54705597	yeast a problem     preface to the fourth edition    this book was written nearly twelve years ago and so many things  have changed since then that it is hardly fair to send it into the  world afresh without some notice of the improvementif such there  bewhich has taken place meanwhile in those southern counties of  england with which alone this book deals  i believe that things are improved  twelve years more of the new  poor law have taught the labouring men greater selfhelp and  independence i hope that those virtues may not be destroyed in them  once more by the boundless and indiscriminate almsgiving which has  become the fashion of the day in most parishes where there are  resident gentry  if half the money which is now given away in  different forms to the agricultural poor could be spent in making  their dwellings fit for honest men to live in then life morals  and poorrates would be saved to an immense amount  but as i do  not see how to carry out such a plan i have no right to complain of  others for not seeing  meanwhile cottage improvement and sanitary reform throughout the  country districts are going on at a fearfully slow rate  here and  there highhearted landlords like the duke of bedford are doing  their duty like men but in general the apathy of the educated  classes is most disgraceful  but the labourers during the last ten years are altogether better  off  free trade has increased their food without lessening their  employment  the politician who wishes to know the effect on  agricultural life of that wise and just measure may find it in mr  grey of dilstons answers to the queries of the french government   the country parson will not need to seek so far  he will see it if  he be an observant man in the faces and figures of his school children  he will see a rosier fatter biggerboned race growing  up which bids fair to surpass in bulk the puny and illfed  generation of 181545 and equal perhaps in thew and sinew to the  men who saved europe in the old french war  if it should be so as god grant it may there is little fear but  that the labouring men of england will find their aristocracy able  to lead them in the battlefield and to develop the agriculture of  the land at home even better than did their grandfathers of the old  war time  to a thoughtful man no point of the social horizon is more full of  light than the altered temper of the young gentlemen  they have  their faults and follies stillfor when will young blood be other  than hot blood  but when one finds more and more swearing  banished from the huntingfield foul songs from the universities  drunkenness and gambling from the barracks when one finds  everywhere whether at college in camp or by the coverside more  and more young men desirous to learn their duty as englishmen and  if possible to do it when one hears their altered tone toward the  middle classes and that word snob thanks very much to mr  thackeray used by them in its true sense without regard of rank  when one watches as at aldershott the care and kindness of  officers toward their men and over and above all this when one  finds in every profession in that of the soldier as much as any  young men who are not only in the world but in religious  phraseology of the world living godfearing virtuous and  useful lives as christian men should  then indeed one looks  forward with hope and confidence to the day when these men shall  settle down in life and become as holders of the land the leaders  of agricultural progress and the guides and guardians of the  labouring man  i am bound to speak of the farmer as i know him in the south of  england  in the north he is a man of altogether higher education  and breeding  but he is even in the south a much better man than  it is the fashion to believe him  no doubt he has given heavy  cause of complaint  he was demoralised as surely if not as  deeply as his own labourers by the old poor law  he was  bewilderedto use the mildest termby promises of protection from  men who knew better  but his worst fault after all has been that  young or old he has copied his landlord too closely and acted on  his maxims and example  and now that his landlord is growing wiser  he is growing wiser too  experience of the new poor law and  experience of freetrade are helping him to show himself what he  always was at heart an honest englishman  all his brave  persistence and industry his sturdy independence and selfhelp and  last but not least his strong sense of justice and his vast good nature are coming out more and more and working better and better  upon the land and the labourer while among his sons i see many  growing up brave manly prudent young men with a steadily  increasing knowledge of what is required of them both as  manufacturers of food and employers of human labour  the country clergy again are steadily improving  i do not mean  merely in moralityfor public opinion now demands that as a sine  qua nonbut in actual efficiency  every fresh appointment seems to  me on the whole a better one than the last  they are gaining more  and more the love and respect of their flocks they are becoming  more and more centres of civilisation and morality to their  parishes they are working for the most part very hard each in  his own way indeed their great danger is that they should trust  too much in that outward business work which they do so heartily  that they should fancy that the administration of schools and  charities is their chief business and literally leave the word of  god to serve tables  would that we clergymen could learn some of  us are learning already that influence over our people is not to be  gained by perpetual interference in their private affairs too often  inquisitorial irritating and degrading to both parties but by  showing ourselves their personal friends of like passions with  them  let a priest do that  let us make our people feel that we  speak to them and feel to them as men to men and then the more  cottages we enter the better  if we go into our neighbours houses  only as judges inquisitors or at best gossips we are bestas too  many areat home in our studies  would too that we would  recollect thisthat our duty is among other things to preach the  gospel and consider firstly whether what we commonly preach be any  gospel or good news at all and not rather the worst possible news  and secondly whether we preach at all whether our sermons are not  utterly unintelligible being delivered in an unknown tongue and  also of a dulness not to be surpassed and whether therefore it  might not be worth our while to spend a little time in studying the  english tongue and the art of touching human hearts and minds  but to return  this improved tone if the truth must be told is  owing far more than people themselves are aware to the triumphs of  those liberal principles for which the whigs have fought for the  last forty years and of that sounder natural philosophy of which  they have been the consistent patrons  england has become whig and  the death of the whig party is the best proof of its victory  it  has ceased to exist because it has done its work because its  principles are accepted by its ancient enemies because the  political economy and the physical science which grew up under its  patronage are leavening the thoughts and acts of anglican and of  evangelical alike and supplying them with methods for carrying out  their own schemes  lord shaftesburys truly noble speech on  sanitary reform at liverpool is a striking proof of the extent to  which the evangelical leaders have given in their adherence to those  scientific laws the original preachers of which have been called by  his lordships party heretics and infidels materialists and  rationalists  be it so  provided truth be preached what matter  who preaches it  provided the leaven of sound inductive science  leaven the whole lump what matter who sets it working  better  perhaps because more likely to produce practical success that  these novel truths should be instilled into the minds of the  educated classes by men who share somewhat in their prejudices and  superstitions and doled out to them in such measure as will not  terrify or disgust them  the child will take its medicine from the  nurses hand trustfully enough when it would scream itself into  convulsions at the sight of the doctor and so do itself more harm  than the medicine would do it good  the doctor meanwhile unless he  be one of hesiods fools who know not how much more half is than  the whole is content enough to see any part of his prescription  got down by any hands whatsoever  but there is another cause for the improved tone of the landlord  class and of the young men of what is commonly called the  aristocracy and that is a growing moral earnestness which is in  great part owing that justice may be done on all sides to the  anglican movement  how much soever neoanglicanism may have failed  as an ecclesiastical or theological system how much soever it may  have proved itself both by the national dislike of it and by the  defection of all its masterminds to be radically unenglish it  has at least awakened hundreds perhaps thousands of cultivated men  and women to ask themselves whether god sent them into the world  merely to eat drink and be merry and to have their souls saved  upon the spurgeon method after they die and has taught them an  answer to that question not unworthy of english christians  the anglican movement when it dies out will leave behind at least  a legacy of grand old authors disinterred of art of music of  churches too schools cottages and charitable institutions which  will form so many centres of future civilisation and will entitle  it to the respect if not to the allegiance of the future  generation  and more than this it has sown in the hearts of young  gentlemen and young ladies seed which will not perish which though  it may develop into forms little expected by those who sowed it  will develop at least into a virtue more stately and reverent more  chivalrous and selfsacrificing more genial and human than can be  learnt from that religion of the stock exchange which reigned  triumphantfor a year and a dayin the popular pulpits  i have said that neoanglicanism has proved a failure as  seventeenthcentury anglicanism did  the causes of that failure  this book has tried to point out  and not one word which is spoken  of it therein but has been drawn from personal and toointimate  experience  but nowpeace to its ashes  is it so great a sin to  have been dazzled by the splendour of an impossible ideal  is it so  great a sin to have had courage and conduct enough to attempt the  enforcing of that ideal in the face of the prejudices of a whole  nation  and if that ideal was too narrow for the english nation  and for the modern needs of mankind is that either so great a sin   are other extant ideals then so very comprehensive  does mr  spurgeon then take so much broader or nobler views of the  capacities and destinies of his race than that great genius john  henry newman  if the world cannot answer that question now it will  answer it promptly enough in another fiveandtwenty years  and  meanwhile let not the party and the system which has conquered boast  itself too loudly  let it take warning by the whigs and suspect  as many a lookeron more than suspects that its triumph may be as  with the whigs its ruin and that having done the work for which  it was sent into the world there may only remain for it to decay  and die  and die it surely will if as seems too probable there succeeds to  this late thirty years of peace a thirty years of storm  for it has lost all hold upon the young the active the daring  it  has sunk into a compromise between originally opposite dogmas  it  has become a religion for jacob the smooth man adapted to the  maxims of the market and leaving him full liberty to supplant his  brother by all methods lawful in that market  no longer can it  embrace and explain all known facts of god and man in heaven and  earth and satisfy utterly such minds and hearts as those of  cromwells ironsides or the scotch covenanters or even of a newton  and a colonel gardiner  let it make the most of its hedley vicars  and its havelock and sound its own trumpet as loudly as it can in  sounding theirs for they are the last specimens of heroism which it  is likely to begetif indeed it did in any true sense beget them  and if their gallantry was really owing to their creed and not to  the simple fact of their beinglike othersenglish gentlemen   well may jacobs chaplains cackle in delighted surprise over their  noble memories like geese who have unwittingly hatched a swan  but on esau in generalon poor rough esau who sails jacobs  ships digs jacobs mines founds jacobs colonies pours out his  blood for him in those wars which jacob himself has stirred up while his sleek brother sits at home in his countinghouse enjoying  at once the means of grace and the produce of esaus labouron  him jacobs chaplains have less and less influence for him they  have less and less good news  he is afraid of them and they of  him the two do not comprehend one another sympathise with one  another they do not even understand one anothers speech  the same  social and moral gulf has opened between them as parted the  cultivated and wealthy pharisee of jerusalem from the rough fishers  of the galilaean lake  and yet the galilaean fishers if we are to  trust josephus and the gospels were trusty generous affectionate and it was not from among the pharisees it is said that the  apostles were chosen  be that as it may esau has a birthright and this book like all  books which i have ever written is written to tell him so and i  trust has not been written in vain  but it is not this book or  any mans book or any man at all who can tell esau the whole truth  about himself his powers his duty and his god  woman must do it  and not man  his mother his sister the maid whom he may love and  failing all these as they often will fail him in the wild  wandering life which he must live those human angels of whom it is  writtenthe barren hath many more children than she who has an  husband  and such will not be wanting  as long as england can  produce at once two such women as florence nightingale and catherine  marsh there is good hope that esau will not be defrauded of his  birthright and that by the time that jacob comes crouching to him  to defend him against the enemies who are near at hand esau  instead of borrowing jacobs religion may be able to teach jacob  his and the two brothers face together the superstition and anarchy  of europe in the strength of a lofty and enlightened christianity  which shall be thoroughly human and therefore thoroughly divine  c k february 17th 1859    preface to the first edition    this little tale was written between two and three years ago in the  hope that it might help to call the attention of wiser and better  men than i am to the questions which are now agitating the minds of  the rising generation and to the absolute necessity of solving them  at once and earnestly unless we would see the faith of our  forefathers crumble away beneath the combined influence of new  truths which are fancied to be incompatible with it and new  mistakes as to its real essence  that this can be done i believe  and know  if i had not believed it i would never have put pen to  paper on the subject  i believe that the ancient creed the eternal gospel will stand  and conquer and prove its might in this age as it has in every  other for eighteen hundred years by claiming and subduing and  organising those young anarchic forces which now unconscious of  their parentage rebel against him to whom they owe their being  but for the time being the young men and women of our day are fast  parting from their parents and each other the more thoughtful are  wandering either towards rome towards sheer materialism or towards  an unchristian and unphilosophic spiritualism  epicurism which in  my eyes is the worst evil spirit of the three precisely because it  looks at first sight most like an angel of light  the mass again  are fancying that they are still adhering to the old creeds the old  church to the honoured patriarchs of english protestantism  i wish  i could agree with them in their belief about themselves  to me  they seemwith a small sprinkling of those noble and cheering  exceptions to popular error which are to be found in every age of  christs churchto be losing most fearfully and rapidly the living  spirit of christianity and to be for that very reason clinging  all the more convulsivelyand who can blame themto the outward  letter of it whether high church or evangelical unconscious all  the while that they are sinking out of real living belief into  that dead selfdeceiving beliefinbelieving which has been always  heretofore and is becoming in england now the parent of the most  blind dishonest and pitiless bigotry  in the following pages i have attempted to show what some at least  of the young in these days are really thinking and feeling  i know  well that my sketch is inadequate and partial  i have every reason  to believe from the criticisms which i have received since its  first publication that it is as far as it goes correct  i put it  as a problem  it would be the height of arrogance in me to do more  than indicate the direction in which i think a solution may be  found  i fear that my elder readers may complain that i have no  right to start doubts without answering them  i can only answer would that i had started them would that i was not seeing them  daily around me under some form or other in just the very hearts  for whom one would most wish the peace and strength of a fixed and  healthy faith  to the young this book can do no harm for it will  put into their minds little but what is there already  to the  elder it may do good for it may teach some of them as i earnestly  hope something of the real but too often utterly unsuspected  state of their own childrens minds something of the reasons of  that calamitous estrangement between themselves and those who will  succeed them which is often too painful and oppressive to be  confessed to their own hearts  whatever amount of obloquy this book  may bring upon me i shall think that a light price to pay if by it  i shall have helped even in a single case to turn the hearts of  the parents to the children and the hearts of the children to the  parents before the great and terrible day of the lord comeas  come it surely will if we persist much longer in substituting  denunciation for sympathy instruction for education and pharisaism  for the good news of the kingdom of god  1851    chapter i  the philosophy of foxhunting    as this my story will probably run counter to more than one fashion  of the day literary and other it is prudent to bow to those  fashions wherever i honestly can and therefore to begin with a  scrap of description  the edge of a great foxcover a flat wilderness of low leafless  oaks fortified by a long dreary thorn capped clay ditch with sour  red water oozing out at every yard a broken gate leading into a  straight wood ride ragged with dead grasses and black with fallen  leaves the centre mashed into a quagmire by innumerable horsehoofs  some forty red coats and some four black a sprinkling of young farmers resplendent in gold buttons and green a pair of sleek drab  stablekeepers showing off horses for sale the surgeon of the  union in mackintosh and antigropelos two holiday schoolboys with  trousers strapped down to bursting point like a penny steamers  safetyvalve a midshipman the only merry one in the field bumping  about on a fretting sweating hack with its nose a foot above its  ears and lancelot smith who then kept two good horses and rode  forward as a fine young fellow of threeandtwenty who can afford  it and has nothing else to do has a very good right to ride  but what is a description without a sketch of the weatherin  these pantheist days especially when a hero or heroines moral  state must entirely depend on the barometer and authors talk as if  christians were cabbages and a mans soul as well as his lungs  might be saved by seabreezes and sunshine or his character  developed by wearing guano in his shoes and training himself  against a south wallwe must have a weather description though as  i shall presently show one in flat contradiction of the popular  theory  luckily for our information lancelot was very much given  to watch both the weather and himself and had indeed while in his  teens combined the two in a sort of a soulalmanack on the  principles just mentionedsomewhat in this style  monday 21stwind sw bright sun mercury at 305 inches  felt  my heart expanded towards the universe  organs of veneration and  benevolence pleasingly excited and gave a shilling to a tramp  an  inexpressible joy bounded through every vein and the soft air  breathed purity and selfsacrifice through my soul  as i watched  the beetles those children of the sun who as divine shelley says  laden with light and odour pass over the gleam of the living  grass i gained an edenglimpse of the pleasures of virtue  nb  found the tramp drunk in a ditch  i could not have degraded  myself on such a dayah how could he  tuesday 22dbarometer rapidly falling  heavy clouds in the  southeast  my heart sank into gloomy forebodings  read manfred  and doubted whether i should live long  the laden weight of destiny  seemed to crush down my aching forehead till the thunderstorm  burst and peace was restored to my troubled soul  this was very bad but to do justice to lancelot he had grown out  of it at the time when my story begins  he was now in the fifth act  of his werterean stage that sentimental measles which all clever  men must catch once in their lives and which generally like the  physical measles if taken early settles their constitution for  good or evil if taken late goes far towards killing them   lancelot had found byron and shelley pall on his taste and commenced  devouring bulwer and worshipping ernest maltravers  he had left  bulwer for old ballads and romances and mr carlyles reviews was  next alternately chivalrymad and germanymad was now reading hard  at physical science and on the whole trying to become a great man  without any very clear notion of what a great man ought to be  real  education he never had had  bred up at home under his father a  rich merchant he had gone to college with a large stock of general  information and a particular mania for dried plants fossils  butterflies and sketching and some such creed as this  that he was very clever  that he ought to make his fortune  that a great many things were very pleasantbeautiful things among  the rest  that it was a fine thing to be superior gentlemanlike generous  and courageous  that a man ought to be religious  and left college with a good smattering of classics and mathematics  picked up in the intervals of boatracing and hunting and much the  same creed as he brought with him except in regard to the last  article  the sceneryandnaturalhistory mania was now somewhat at  a discount  he had discovered a new natural object including in  itself allmore than allyet found beauties and wonderswoman  draw draw the veil and weep guardian angel if such there be   what was to be expected  pleasant things were pleasantthere was  no doubt of that whatever else might be doubtful  he had read  byron by stealth he had been flogged into reading ovid and  tibullus and commanded by his private tutor to read martial and  juvenal for the improvement of his style  all conversation on the  subject of love had been prudishly avoided as usual by his parents  and teacher  the parts of the bible which spoke of it had been  always kept out of his sight  love had been to him practically  ground tabooed and carnal  what was to be expected  just what  happenedif womans beauty had nothing holy in it why should his  fondness for it  just what happens every daythat he had to sow  his wild oats for himself and eat the fruit thereof and the dirt  thereof also  o fathers fathers and you clergymen who monopolise education  either tell boys the truth about love or do not put into their  hands without note or comment the foul devils lies about it  which make up the mass of the latin poetsand then go fresh from  teaching juvenal and ovid to declaim at exeter hall against poor  peter denss wellmeaning prurience  had we not better take the  beam out of our own eye before we meddle with the mote in the  jesuits  but where is my description of the weather all this time  i cannot i am sorry to say give any very cheerful account of the  weather that day  but what matter  are englishmen hedgegnats who  only take their sport when the sun shines  is it not on the  contrary symbolical of our national character that almost all our  field amusements are wintry ones  our fowling our hunting our  puntshooting pastime for hymir himself and the frost giantsour  golf and skatingour very cricket and boatracing and jack and  grayling fishing carried on till we are fairly frozen out  we are  a stern people and winter suits us  nature then retires modestly  into the background and spares us the obtrusive glitter of summer  leaving us to think and work and therefore it happens that in  england it may be taken as a general rule that whenever all the  rest of the world is indoors we are out and busy and on the  whole the worse the day the better the deed  the weather that day the first day lancelot ever saw his beloved  was truly national  a silent dim distanceless steaming rotting  day in march  the last brown oakleaf which had stood out the  winters frost spun and quivered plump down and then lay as if  ashamed to have broken for a moment the ghastly stillness like an  awkward guest at a great dumb dinnerparty  a cold suck of wind  just proved its existence by toothaches on the north side of all  faces  the spiders having been weatherbewitched the night before  had unanimously agreed to cover every brake and brier with gossamer cradles and never a fly to be caught in them like manchester  cottonspinners madly glutting the markets in the teeth of no  demand  the steam crawled out of the dank turf and reeked off the  flanks and nostrils of the shivering horses and clung with clammy  paws to frosted hats and dripping boughs  a soulless skyless  catarrhal day as if that bustling dowager old mother earthwhat  with matchmaking in spring and fetes champetres in summer and  dinnergiving in autumnwas fairly worn out and put to bed with  the influenza under wet blankets and the coldwater cure  there sat lancelot by the coverside his knees aching with cold and  wet thanking his stars that he was not one of the whippersin who  were lashing about in the dripping cover laying up for themselves  in catering for the amusement of their betters a probable old age  of bedridden torture in the form of rheumatic gout  not that he  was at all happyindeed he had no reason to be so for first the  hounds would not find next he had left halffinished at home a  review article on the silurian system which he had solemnly  promised an abject and beseeching editor to send to post that night  next he was on the windward side of the cover and dare not light a  cigar and lastly his mucous membrane in general was not in the  happiest condition seeing that he had been dining the evening  before with mr vaurien of rottenpalings a young gentleman of a  convivial and melodious turn of mind who sangand played alsoas  singing men are wontin more senses than one and had ladies and  gentlemen down from town to stay with him and they sang and played  too and so somehow between vingtun and champagnepunch lancelot  had not arrived at home till seven oclock that morning and was in  a fit state to appreciate the feelings of our grandfathers when  after the third bottle of port they used to put the black silk  tights into their pockets slip on the leathers and boots and ride  the croptailed hack thirty miles on a winters night to meet the  hounds in the next county by ten in the morning  they are gone  down to hades even many stalwart souls of heroes with john warde  of squerries at their headthe fathers of the men who conquered at  waterloo and we their degenerate grandsons are left instead with  puny arms and polished leather boots and a considerable taint of  hereditary disease to sit in clubhouses and celebrate the  progress of the species  whether lancelot or his horse under these depressing circumstances  fell asleep or whether thoughts pertaining to such a life and its  fitness for a clever and ardent young fellow in the nineteenth  century became gradually too painful and had to be peremptorily  shaken off this deponent sayeth not but certainly after fiveand thirty minutes of idleness and shivering lancelot opened his eyes  with a sudden start and struck spurs into his hunter without due  cause shown whereat shiverthetimbers who was no griselda in  temperlancelot had bought him out of the pytchley for half his  value as unrideably vicious when he had killed a groom and fallen  backwards on a roughrider the first season after he came up from  horncastleresponded by a furious kick or two threw his head up  put his foot into a drain and sprawled down all but on his nose  pitching lancelot unawares shamefully on the pommel of his saddle   a certain fatality by the bye had lately attended all lancelots  efforts to shine he never bought a new coat without tearing it  mysteriously next day or tried to make a joke without bursting out  coughing in the middle    and now the whole field were looking on  at his mishap between disgust and the start he turned almost sick  and felt the blood rush into his cheeks and forehead as he heard a  shout of coarse jovial laughter burst out close to him and the old  master of the hounds squire lavington roared aloud  a pretty sportsman you are mr smith to fall asleep by the cover side and let your horse downand your pockets too  whats that  book on the ground  sapping and studying still  i let nobody come  out with my hounds with their pocket full of learning  hand it up  here tom well see what it is  french as i am no scholar   translate for us colonel bracebridge  and amid shouts of laughter the gay guardsman read out  st francis de sales  introduction to a devout life  poor lancelot  wishing himself fathoms underground ashamed of his  book still more ashamed of himself for his shame he had to sit  there ten physical seconds or spiritual years while the colonel  solemnly returned him the book complimenting him on the proofs of  its purifying influence which he had given the night before in  helping to throw the turnpikegate into the river  but all things do end and so did this and the silence of the  hounds also and a faint but knowing whimper drove st francis out  of all heads and lancelot began to stalk slowly with a dozen  horsemen up the woodride to a fitful accompaniment of wandering  houndmusic where the choristers were as invisible as nightingales  among the thick cover  and hark just as the book was returned to  his pocket the sweet hubbub suddenly crashed out into one jubilant  shriek and then swept away fainter and fainter among the trees   the walk became a trotthe trot a canter  then a faint melancholy  shout at a distance answered by a stole away from the fields a  doleful toot of the horn the dull thunder of many horsehoofs  rolling along the farther woodside  then red coats flashing like  sparks of fire across the gray gap of mist at the ridesmouth then  a whipperin bringing up a belated hound burst into the pathway  smashing and plunging with shut eyes through ashsaplings and  hassockgrass then a fat farmer sedulously pounding through the  mud was overtaken and bespattered in spite of all his struggles until the line streamed out into the wide rushy pasture startling  up pewits and curlews as horsemen poured in from every side and  cunning old farmers rode off at inexplicable angles to some well known haunts of pug  and right ahead chiming and jangling sweet  madness the dappled pack glanced and wavered through the veil of  soft grey mist  whats the use of this hurry growled lancelot   they will all be back again  i never have the luck to see a run  but no on and ondown the wind and down the vale and the canter  became a gallop and the gallop a long straining stride and a  hundred horsehoofs crackled like flame among the stubbles and  thundered fetlockdeep along the heavy meadows and every fence  thinned the cavalcade till the madness began to stir all bloods  and with grim earnest silent faces the initiated few settled  themselves to their work and with the colonel and lancelot at their  head took their pleasure sadly after the manner of their nation  as old froissart has it   thorough bush through brier thorough park through pale   till the rolling grasslands spread out into flat black open  fallows crossed with grassy baulks and here and there a long  melancholy line of tall elms while before them the high chalk  ranges gleamed above the mist like a vast wall of emerald enamelled  with snow and the winding river glittering at their feet  a polite fox observed the colonel  hes leading the squire  straight home to whitford just in time for dinner        they were in the last meadow with the stream before them  a line  of struggling heads in the swollen and milky current showed the  hounds opinion of reynards course  the sportsmen galloped off  towards the nearest bridge  bracebridge looked back at lancelot  who had been keeping by his side in sulky rivalry following him  successfully through all manner of desperate places and more and  more angry with himself and the guiltless colonel because he only  followed while the colonels quicker and unembarrassed wit which  lived wholly in the present moment saw long before lancelot how  to cut out his work in every field  i shant go round quietly observed the colonel  do you fancy i shall growled lancelot who took for grantedpoor  thinskinned soul that the words were meant as a hit at himself  youre a brace of geese politely observed the old squire and  youll find it out in rheumatic fever  thereone fool makes  many  youll kill smith before youre done colonel and the old  man wheeled away up the meadow as bracebridge shouted after him  oh hell make a fine riderin time  in time  lancelot could have knocked the unsuspecting colonel  down for the word  it just expressed the contrast which had  fretted him ever since he began to hunt with the whitford priors  hounds  the colonels long practice and consummate skill in all he  took in handhis experience of all society from the prairie  indian to crockfords from the prizering to the continental  courtshis varied and ready store of information and anecdote the harmony and completeness of the manhis consistency with his  own small ideal and his consequent apparent superiority everywhere  and in everything to the huge awkward titancub who though  immeasurably beyond bracebridge in intellect and heart was still in  a state of convulsive dyspepsia swallowing formulae and daily  wellnigh choked diseased throughout with that morbid self consciousness and lust of praise for which god prepares with his  elect a bitter cure  alas poor lancelot an unlicked bear with  all his sorrows before him  come along quoth bracebridge between snatches of a tune his  coolness maddening lancelot  old lavington will find us dry  clothes a bottle of port and a brace of charming daughters at the  priory  in with you little mustang of the prairie  neck or  nothing  and in an instant the small wiry american and the huge horncastle bred hunter were wallowing and staggering in the yeasty stream  till they floated into a deep reach and swam steadily down to a low  place in the bank  they crossed the stream passed the priory  shrubberies leapt the gate into the park and then on and upward  called by the unseen ariels music before themup into the hills  past white crumbling chalkpits fringed with feathered juniper and  tottering ashes their floors strewed with knolls of fallen soil and  vegetation like wooded islets in a sea of milkup between steep  ridges of tuft crested with black firwoods and silver beech and  here and there a huge yew standing out alone the advanced sentry of  the forest with its luscious fretwork of green velvet like a  mountain of gothic spires and pinnacles all glittering and steaming  as the sun drank up the dewdrops  the lark sprang upward into  song and called merrily to the newopened sunbeams while the  wreaths and flakes of mist lingered reluctantly about the hollows  and clung with dewy fingers to every knoll and belt of pineup  into the labyrinthine bosom of the hillsbut who can describe  them  is not all nature indescribable every leaf infinite and  transcendental  how much more those mighty downs with their  enormous sheets of spotless turf where the dizzy eye loses all  standard of size and distance before the awful simplicity the  delicate vastness of those grand curves and swells soft as the  outlines of a greek venus as if the great goddessmother hertha had  laid herself down among the hills to sleep her titan limbs wrapt in  a thin veil of silvery green  up into a vast amphitheatre of sward whose walls banked out the  narrow sky above  and here in the focus of the huge ring an  object appeared which stirred strange melancholy in lancelota  little chapel ivygrown girded with a few yews and elders and  grassy graves  a climbing rose over the porch and iron railings  round the churchyard told of human care and from the graveyard  itself burst up one of those noble springs known as winterbournes  in the chalk ranges which awakened in autumn from the abysses to  which it had shrunk during the summers drought was hurrying down  upon its six months course a broad sheet of oily silver over a  temporary channel of smooth greensward  the hounds had checked in the woods behind now they poured down the  hillside so close together that you might have covered them with a  sheet straight for the little chapel  a saddened tone of feeling spread itself through lancelots heart   there were the everlasting hills around even as they had grown and  grown for countless ages beneath the still depths of the primeval  chalk ocean in the milky youth of this great english land  and  here was he the insect of a day foxhunting upon them  he felt  ashamed and more ashamed when the inner voice whisperedfox hunting is not the shamethou art the shame  if thou art the  insect of a day it is thy sin that thou art one  and his sadness foolish as it may seem grew as he watched a brown  speck fleet rapidly up the opposite hill and heard a gay view halloo burst from the colonel at his side  the chase lost its charm  for him the moment the game was seen  then vanished that mysterious  delight of pursuing an invisible object which gives to hunting and  fishing their unutterable and almost spiritual charm which made  shakespeare a nightly poacher davy and chantrey the patriarchs of  flyfishing by which the twelvefoot rod is transfigured into an  enchanters wand potent over the unseen wonders of the waterworld  to call up spirits from the vasty deep which will really come if  you do call for themat least if the conjuration be orthodoxand  they there  that spell was broken by the sight of poor wearied pug  his once gracefullyfloating brush all draggled and drooping as he  toiled up the sheeppaths towards the open down above  but lancelots sadness reached its crisis as he met the hounds just  outside the churchyard  another momentthey had leaped the rails  and there they swept round under the gray wall leaping and yelling  like berserk fiends among the frowning tombstones over the cradles  of the quiet dead  lancelot shudderedthe thing was not wrongit was no ones  faultbut there was a ghastly discord in it  peace and strife  time and eternitythe mad noisy flesh and the silent immortal  spiritthe frivolous game of lifes outside show and the terrible  earnest of its inward abysses jarred together without and within  him  he pulled his horse up violently and stood as if rooted to  the place gazing at he knew not what  the hounds caught sight of the fox burst into one frantic shriek of  joyand then a sudden and ghastly stillness as mute and  breathless they toiled up the hillside gaining on their victim at  every stride  the patter of the horsehoofs and the rattle of  rolling flints died away above  lancelot looked up startled at the  silence laughed aloud he knew not why and sat regardless of his  pawing and straining horse still staring at the chapel and the  graves  on a sudden the chapeldoor opened and a figure timidly yet  loftily stepped out without observing him and suddenly turning  round met him full face to face and stood fixed with surprise as  completely as lancelot himself  that face and figure and the spirit which spoke through them  entered his heart at once never again to leave it  her features  were aquiline and grand without a shade of harshness her eyes  shone out like twain lakes of still azure beneath a broad marble  cliff of polished forehead her rich chestnut hair rippled downward  round the towering neck  with her perfect masque and queenly  figure and earnest upward gaze she might have been the very model  from which raphael conceived his glorious st catherinethe ideal  of the highest womanly genius softened into selfforgetfulness by  girlish devotion  she was simply almost coarsely dressed but a  glance told him that she was a lady by the courtesy of man as well  as by the will of god  they gazed one moment more at each otherbut what is time to  spirits  with them as with their father one day is as a thousand  years  but that eyewedlock was cut short the next instant by the  decided interference of the horse who thoroughly disgusted at his  masters whole conduct gave a significant shake of his head and  shamming frightened as both women and horses will do when only  cross commenced a wardance which drove argemone lavington into  the porch and gave the bewildered lancelot an excuse for dashing  madly up the hill after his companions  what a horrible ugly face said argemone to herself but so  clever and so unhappy  blest pity true mother of that graceless scamp young love who is  ashamed of his real pedigree and swears to this day that he is the  child of venusthe coxcomb        here for the sake of the reader we omit or rather postpone a  long dissertation on the famous erototheogonic chorus of  aristophaness birds with illustrations taken from all earth and  heaven from the vedas and proclus to jacob boehmen and saint  theresa  the dichotomy of lancelots personality as the germans would call  it returned as he dashed on  his understanding was trying to ride  while his spirit was left behind with argemone  hence loose reins  and a looser seat  he rolled about like a tipsy man holding on in  fact far more by his spurs than by his knees to the utter  infuriation of shiverthetimbers who kicked and snorted over the  down like one of mephistopheless demonsteeds  they had mounted  the hillthe deer fled before them in terrorthey neared the park  palings  in the road beyond them the hounds were just killing their  fox struggling and growling in fierce groups for the red gobbets of  fur a panting steaming ring of horses round them  half a dozen  voices hailed him as he came up  where have you been  hell tumble off  hes had a fall  no  he hasnt  ware hounds man alive  hell break his neck  he has broken it at last shouted the colonel as shiverthe timbers rushed at the high pales out of breath and blind with  rage  lancelot saw and heard nothing till he was awakened from his  dream by the long heave of the huge brutes shoulder and the  maddening sensation of sweeping through the air over the fence  he  started checked the curb the horse threw up his head fulfilling  his name by driving his knees like a batteringram against the  palesthe topbar bent like a withe flew out into a hundred  splinters and man and horse rolled over headlong into the hard  flintroad  for one long sickening second lancelot watched the blue sky between  his own knees  then a crash as if a shell had burst in his facea  horrible grinda sheet of flameand the blackness of night  did  you ever feel it reader  when he awoke he found himself lying in bed with squire lavington  sitting by him  there was real sorrow in the old mans face come  to himself and a great joyful oath rolled out  the boldest rider  of them all  i wouldnt have lost him for a dozen readymade spick  and span colonel bracebridges  quite right squire answered a laughing voice from behind the  curtain  smith has a clear two thousand a year and i live by my  wits    chapter ii  spring yearnings    i heard a story the other day of our most earnest and genial  humorist who is just now proving himself also our most earnest and  genial novelist  i like your novel exceedingly said a lady the  characters are so naturalall but the baronet and he surely is  overdrawn  it is impossible to find such coarseness in his rank of  life  the artist laughed  and that character said he is almost the  only exact portrait in the whole book  so it is  people do not see the strange things which pass them  every day  the romance of real life is only one to the romantic  spirit  and then they set up for critics instead of pupils as if  the artists business was not just to see what they cannot seeto  open their eyes to the harmonies and the discords the miracles and  the absurdities which seem to them one uniform gray fog of  commonplaces  then let the reader believe that whatsoever is commonplace in my  story is my own invention  whatsoever may seem extravagant or  startling is most likely to be historic fact else i should not have  dared to write it down finding gods actual dealings here much too  wonderful to dare to invent many fresh ones for myself  lancelot who had had a severe concussion of the brain and a broken  leg kept his bed for a few weeks and his room for a few more   colonel bracebridge installed himself at the priory and nursed him  with indefatigable goodhumour and few thanks  he brought lancelot  his breakfast before hunting described the run to him when he  returned read him to sleep told him stories of grizzly bear and  buffalohunts made him laugh in spite of himself at extempore comic  medleys kept his tables covered with flowers from the conservatory  warmed his chocolate and even his bed  nothing came amiss to him  and he to nothing  lancelot longed at first every hour to be rid of  him and eyed him about the room as a bulldog does the monkey who  rides him  in his dreams he was sinbad the sailor and bracebridge  the old man of the sea but he could not hold out against the  colonels merry bustling kindliness and the almost womanish  tenderness of his nursing  the ice thawed rapidly and one evening  it split up altogether when bracebridge who was sitting drawing by  lancelots sofa instead of amusing himself with the ladies below  suddenly threw his pencil into the fire and broke out a propos de  rien  what a strange pair we are smith  i think you just the best  fellow i ever met and you hate me like poisonyou cant deny it  there was something in the colonels tone so utterly different from  his usual courtly and measured speech that lancelot was taken  completely by surprise and stammered out  iiinono  i know i am very foolishungrateful  but i do  hate you he said with a sudden impulse and ill tell you why  give me your hand quoth the colonel  i like that  now we shall  see our way with each other at least  because said lancelot slowly because you are cleverer than i  readier than i superior to me in every point  the colonel laughed not quite merrily  lancelot went on holding  down his shaggy brows  i am a brute and an assand yet i do not like to tell you so   for if i am an ass what are you  heyday  look herei am wasting my time and brains on ribaldry but i am  worth nothing betterat least i think so at times but you who  can do anything you put your hand to what business have you in the  devils name to be throwing yourself away on gimcracks and fox hunting foolery  heavens  if i had your talents id beid make  a name for myself before i died if i died to make it  the colonel  griped his hand hard rose and looked out of the window for a few  minutes  there was a dead brooding silence till he turned to  lancelot  mr smith i thank you for your honesty but good advice may come  too late  i am no saint and god only knows how much less of one i  may become but mark my wordsif you are ever tempted by passion  and vanity and fine ladies to form liaisons as the jezebels call  them snares and nets and labyrinths of blind ditches to keep you  down through life stumbling and grovelling hating yourself and  hating the chain to which you clingin that hour praypray as if  the devil had you by the throatto almighty god to help you out  of that cursed slough  there is nothing else for itpray i tell  you  there was a terrible earnestness about the guardsmans face which  could not be mistaken  lancelot looked at him for a moment and  then dropped his eyes ashamed as if he had intruded on the  speakers confidence by witnessing his emotion  in a moment the colonel had returned to his smile and his polish  and now my dear invalid i must beg your pardon for sermonising   what do you say to a game of ecarte  we must play for love or we  shall excite ourselves and scandalise mrs lavingtons piety  and  the colonel pulled a pack of cards out of his pocket and seeing  that lancelot was too thoughtful for play commenced all manner of  jugglers tricks and chuckled over them like any schoolboy  happy man thought lancelot to have the strength of will which  can thrust its thoughts away once and for all  no lancelot more  happy are they whom god will not allow to thrust their thoughts from  them till the bitter draught has done its work  from that day however there was a cordial understanding between  the two  they never alluded to the subject but they had known the  bottom of each others heart  lancelots sickroom was now pleasant  enough and he drank in daily his new friends perpetual stream of  anecdote till march and hunting were past and april was half over   the old squire came up after dinner regularly during march he had  hunted every day and slept every evening and the trio chatted  along merrily enough by the help of whist and backgammon upon the  surface of this little island of lifewhich is like sinbads  after all only the back of a floating whale ready to dive at any  momentand then  but what was argemone doing all this time  argemone was busy in her  boudoir too often a true boudoir to her among books and  statuettes and dried flowers fancying herself and not unfairly  very intellectual  she had four new manias every year her last  winters one had been that bottleandsquirt mania miscalled  chemistry her spring madness was for the greek drama  she had  devoured schlegels lectures and thought them divine and now she  was hard at work on sophocles with a little help from translations  and thought she understood him every word  then she was somewhat  highchurch in her notions and used to go up every wednesday and  friday to the chapel in the hills where lancelot had met her for  an hours mystic devotion set off by a little graceful asceticism   as for lancelot she never thought of him but as an emptyheaded  foxhunter who had met with his deserts and the brilliant accounts  which the all smoothing colonel gave at dinner of lancelots  physical well doing and agreeable conversation only made her set him  down the sooner as a twin cleverdonothing to the despised  bracebridge whom she hated for keeping her father in a roar of  laughter  but her sister little honoria had all the while been busy messing  and cooking with her own hands for the invalid and almost fell in  love with the colonel for his watchful kindness  and here a word  about honoria to whom nature according to her wont with sisters  had given almost everything which argemone wanted and denied almost  everything which argemone had except beauty  and even in that the  manysided mother had made her a perfect contrast to her sister tiny and luscious darkeyed and darkhaired as full of wild simple  passion as an italian thinking little except where she felt much which was indeed everywhere for she lived in a perpetual april shower of exaggerated sympathy for all suffering whether in novels  or in life and daily gave the lie to that shallow old calumny that  fictitious sorrows harden the heart to real ones  argemone was almost angry with her sometimes when she trotted whole  days about the village from school to sickroom  perhaps conscience  hinted to her that her duty too lay rather there than among her  luxurious daydreams  but alas though she would have indignantly  repelled the accusation of selfishness yet in self and for self  alone she lived and while she had force of will for any socalled  selfdenial and would fast herself cross and stupefied and quite  enjoy kneeling thinly clad and barefoot on the freezing chapelfloor  on a winters morning yet her fastidious delicacy revolted at  sitting like honoria beside the bed of the ploughmans consumptive  daughter in a reeking stifling leanto garret in which had slept  the night before the father mother and two grownup boys not to  mention a newmarried couple the sick girl and alas her baby   and of such bedchambers there were too many in whitford priors  the first evening that lancelot came downstairs honoria clapped her  hands outright for joy as he entered and ran up and down for ten  minutes fetching and carrying endless unnecessary cushions and  footstools while argemone greeted him with a cold distant bow and  a finelady drawl of carefully commonplace congratulations  her  heart smote her though as she saw the wan face and the wild  melancholy moonstruck eyes once more glaring through and through  her she found a comfort in thinking his stare impertinent drew  herself up and turned away once indeed she could not help  listening as lancelot thanked mrs lavington for all the pious and  edifying books with which the good lady had kept his room rather  than his brain furnished for the last six weeks he was going to say  more but he saw the colonels quaint foxy eye peering at him  remembered st francis de sales and held his tongue  but as her destiny was argemone found herself in the course of  the evening alone with lancelot at the open window  it was a  still hot heavy night after long easterly drought sheet lightning glimmered on the far horizon over the dark woodlands the  coming shower had sent forward as his herald a whispering draught of  fragrant air  what a delicious shiver is creeping over those limes said  lancelot half to himself  the expression struck argemone  it was the right one and it seemed  to open vistas of feeling and observation in the speaker which she  had not suspected  there was a rich melancholy in the voiceshe  turned to look at him  ay he went on and the same heat which crisps those thirsty  leaves must breed the thundershower which cools them  but so it is  throughout the universe  every yearning proves the existence of an  object meant to satisfy it the same law creates both the giver and  the receiver the longing and its home  if one could but know sometimes what it is for which one is  longing said argemone without knowing that she was speaking from  her inmost heart  but thus does the soul involuntarily lay bare its  most unspoken depths in the presence of its yet unknown mate and  then shudders at its own abandon as it first tries on the wedding  garment of paradise  lancelot was not yet past the era at which young geniuses are apt to  talk book at little  for what he answered flashing up according to his fashion  to  beto be great to have done one mighty work before we die and  live unloved or loved upon the lips of men  for this all long who  are not mere apes and wallflies  so longed the founders of babel answered argemone carelessly to  this tirade  she had risen a strange fish the cunning beauty and  now she was trying her fancy flies over him one by one  and were they so far wrong answered he  from the babel society  sprung our architecture our astronomy politics and colonisation   no doubt the old hebrew sheiks thought them impious enough for  daring to build brick walls instead of keeping to the good old fashioned tents and gathering themselves into a nation instead of  remaining a mere family horde and gave their own account of the  myth just as the antediluvian savages gave theirs of that strange  eden scene by the common interpretation of which the devil is made  the first inventor of modesty  men are all conservatives  everything new is impious till we get accustomed to it and if it  fails the mob piously discover a divine vengeance in the mischance  from babel to catholic emancipation  lancelot had stuttered horribly during the latter part of this most  heterodox outburst for he had begun to think about himself and try  to say a fine thing suspecting all the while that it might not be  true  but argemone did not remark the stammering  the new thoughts  startled and pained her but there was a daring grace about them   she tried as women will to answer him with arguments and failed  as women will fail  she was accustomed to lay down the law a la  madame de stael to savants and nonsavants and be heard with  reverence as a woman should be  but poor truthseeking lancelot  did not see what sex had to do with logic he flew at her as if she  had been a very barrister and hunted her mercilessly up and down  through all sorts of charming sophisms as she begged the question  and shifted her ground as thoroughly right in her conclusion as she  was wrong in her reasoning till she grew quite confused and  pettishand then lancelot suddenly shrank into his shell claws  and all like an affrighted soldiercrab hung down his head and  stammered out some incoherenciesnnnot accustomed to talk to  womenladies i mean  fforgot myselfpray forgive me  and he  looked up and her eyes halfamused met his and she saw that they  were filled with tears  what have i to forgive she said more gently wondering on what  sort of strange sportsman she had fallen  you treat me like an  equal you will deign to argue with me  but men in generaloh  they hide their contempt for us if not their own ignorance under  that mask of chivalrous deference and then in the nasal fine  ladies key which was her shell as bitter brusquerie was his she  added with an amazon queens toss of the headyou must come and  see us often  we shall suit each other i see better than most  whom we see here  a sneer and a blush passed together over lancelots ugliness  what better than the glib colonel bracebridge yonder  oh he is witty enough but he lives on the surface of everything   he is altogether shallow and blase  his goodnature is the fruit of  want of feeling between his gracefulness and his sneering  persiflage he is a perfect mephistophelesapollo  what a snare a decentlygood nickname is  out it must come though  it carry a lie on its back  but the truth was argemone thought  herself infinitely superior to the colonel for which simple reason  she could not in the least understand him  by the bye how subtly mr tennyson has embodied all this in the  princess  how he shows us the woman when she takes her stand on  the false masculine ground of intellect working out her own moral  punishment by destroying in herself the tender heart of flesh  which is either womans highest blessing or her bitterest curse how  she loses all feminine sensibility to the undercurrent of feeling  in us poor worldworn casehardened men and falls from pride to  sternness from sternness to sheer inhumanity  i should have  honoured myself by pleading guilty to stealing much of argemones  character from the princess had not the idea been conceived and  fairly worked out long before the appearance of that noble poem   they said no more to each other that evening  argemone was called  to the piano and lancelot took up the sporting magazine and read  himself to sleep till the party separated for the night  argemone went up thoughtfully to her own room  the shower had  fallen and the moon was shining bright while every budding leaf  and knot of mould steamed up cool perfume borrowed from the  treasures of the thundercloud  all around was working the infinite  mystery of birth and growth of giving and taking of beauty and  use  all things were harmoniousall things reciprocal without   argemone felt herself needless lonely and out of tune with herself  and nature  she sat in the window and listlessly read over to herself a  fragment of her own poetry   sappho  she lay among the myrtles on the cliff above her glared the moon beneath the sea upon the white horizon athos peak weltered in burning haze all airs were dead the sicale slept among the tamarisks hair the birds sat dumb and drooping  far below the lazy seaweed glistened in the sun the lazy seafowl dried their steaming wings the lazy swell crept whispering up the ledge and sank again  great pan was laid to rest and mother earth watched by him as he slept and hushed her myriad children for awhile  she lay among the myrtles on the cliff and sighed for sleep for sleep that would not hear but left her tossing still  for night and day a mighty hunger yearned within her heart till all her veins ran fever and her cheek her long thin hands and ivorychannelld feet were wasted with the wasting of her soul then peevishly she flung her on her face and hid her eyeballs from the blinding glare and fingered at the grass and tried to cool her crisp hot lips against the crisp hot sward and then she raised her head and upward cast wild looks from homeless eyes whose liquid light gleamed out between deep folds of blueblack hair as gleam twin lakes between the purple peaks of deep parnassus at the mournful moon beside her lay a lyre  she snatched the shell and waked wild music from its silver strings then tossed it sadly byah hush she cries dead offspring of the tortoise and the mine why mock my discords with thine harmonies although a thriceolympian lot be thine only to echo back in every tone the moods of nobler natures than thine own   no she said  that soft and rounded rhyme suits ill with  sapphos fitful and wayward agonies  she should burst out at once  into wild passionate lifeweariness and disgust at that universe  with whose beauty she has filled her eyes in vain to find it always  a dead picture unsatisfying unlovingas i have found it  sweet selfdeceiver had you no other reason for choosing as your  heroine sappho the victim of the idolatry of intellecttrying in  vain to fill her heart with the friendship of her own sex and then  sinking into mere passion for a handsome boy and so down into self contempt and suicide  she was conscious i do believe of no other reason than that she  gave but consciousness is a dim candleover a deep mine  after all she said pettishly people will call it a mere  imitation of shelleys alastor  and what harm if it is  is there  to be no female alastor  has not the woman as good a right as the  man to long after ideal beautyto pine and die if she cannot find  it and regenerate herself in its light  yohoooooo  youp youp  ohhooo arose doleful through the  echoing shrubbery  argemone started and looked out  it was not a banshee but a  forgotten foxhound puppy sitting mournfully on the gravelwalk  beneath staring at the clear ghastly moon  she laughed and blushedthere was a rebuke in it  she turned to go  to rest and as she knelt and prayed at her velvet faldstool among  all the nicknacks which nowadays make a luxury of devotion was it  strange if after she had prayed for the fate of nations and  churches and for those who as she thought were fighting at oxford  the cause of universal truth and reverend antiquity she remembered  in her petitions the poor godless youth with his troubled and  troubling eloquence  but it was strange that she blushed when she  mentioned his namewhy should she not pray for him as she prayed  for others  perhaps she felt that she did not pray for him as she prayed for  others  she left the aeolian harp in the window as a luxury if she should  wake and coiled herself up among lace pillows and eider blemos and  the hound coiled himself up on the gravelwalk after a solemn  vesperceremony of three turns round in his own length looking  vainly for a soft stone  the finest of us are animals after all  and live by eating and sleeping  and taken as animals not so  badly off eitherunless we happen to be dorsetshire labourersor  spitalfields weaversor colliery childrenor marching soldiers or i am afraid one half of english souls this day  and argemone dreamedthat she was a fox flying for her life  through a churchyardand lancelot was a hound yelling and leaping  in a red coat and white buckskins close upon herand she felt his  hot breath and saw his white teeth glare     and then her  father was there  and he was an italian boy and played the organ and lancelot was a dancing dog and stood up and danced to the tune  of cest lamour lamour lamour pitifully enough in his red  coatand she stood up and danced too but she found her foxfur  dress insufficient and begged hard for a paper frillwhich was  denied her  whereat she cried bitterly and woke and saw the night  peeping in with her bright diamond eyes and blushed and hid her  beautiful face in the pillows and fell asleep again  what the little imp who managed this puppetshow on argemones  brainstage may have intended to symbolise thereby and whence he  stole his actors and stageproperties and whether he got up the  interlude for his own private fun or for that of a choir of brother  eulenspiegels or finally for the edification of argemone as to  her own history past present or future are questions which we  must leave unanswered till physicians have become a little more of  metaphysicians and have given up their present plan of ignoring for  nine hundred and ninetynine pages that most awful and significant  custom of dreaming and then in the thousandth page talking the  boldest materialist twaddle about it  in the meantime lancelot contrary to the colonels express  commands was sitting up to indite the following letter to his  cousin the tractarian curate  you complain that i waste my time in fieldsports  how do you know  that i waste my time  i find within myself certain appetites and i  suppose that the god whom you say made me made those appetites as a  part of me  why are they to be crushed any more than any other part  of me  i am the whole of what i find in myselfam i to pick and  choose myself out of myself  and besides i feel that the exercise  of freedom activity foresight daring independent self determination even in a few minutes burst across country  strengthens me in mind as well as in body  it might not do so to  you but you are of a different constitution and from all i see  the power of a mans muscles the excitability of his nerves the  shape and balance of his brain make him what he is  else what is  the meaning of physiognomy  every mans destiny as the turks say  stands written on his forehead  one does not need two glances at  your face to know that you would not enjoy foxhunting that you  would enjoy booklearning and refined repose as they are pleased  to call it  every man carries his character in his brain  you all  know that and act upon it when you have to deal with a man for  sixpence but your religious dogmas which make out that everyman  comes into the world equally brutish and fiendish make you afraid  to confess it  i dont quarrel with a douce man like you with a  large organ of veneration for following your bent  but if i am  fiery with a huge cerebellum why am i not to follow minefor  that is what you do after allwhat you like best  it is all very  easy for a man to talk of conquering his appetites when he has none  to conquer  try and conquer your organ of veneration or of  benevolence or of calculationthen i will call you an ascetic   why notthe same power which made the front of ones head made the  back i suppose  and i tell you hunting does me good  it awakens me out of my  dreary millround of metaphysics  it sweeps away that infernal web  of selfconsciousness and absorbs me in outward objects and my  redhot perilluss bull cools in proportion as my horse warms  i  tell you i never saw a man who could cut out his way across country  who could not cut his way through better things when his turn came   the cleverest and noblest fellows are sure to be the best riders in  the long run  and as for bad company and the world when you take  to going in the firstclass carriages for fear of meeting a swearing  sailor in the secondclasswhen those who have renounced the  world give up buying and selling in the fundswhen my uncle the  pious banker who will only associate with the truly religious  gives up dealing with any scoundrel or heathen who can do business  with himthen you may quote pious peoples opinions to me  in  gods name if the stock exchange and railway stagging and the  advertisements in the protestant hueandcry and the frantic  mammonhunting which has been for the last fifty years the peculiar  pursuit of the majority of quakers dissenters and religious  churchmen are not the world what is  i dont complain of them  though puritanism has interdicted to them all art all excitement  all amusementexcept moneymaking  it is their dernier ressort  poor souls  but you must explain to us naughty foxhunters how all this agrees  with the good book  we see plainly enough in the meantime how it  agrees with poor human nature  we see that the religious world  like the great world and the sporting world and the literary  world   compounds for sins she is inclined to by damning those she has no mind to   and that because england is a moneymaking country and moneymaking  is an effeminate pursuit therefore all sedentary and spoony sins  like covetousness slander bigotry and selfconceit are to be  cockered and plastered over while the more masculine vices and no vices also are mercilessly hunted down by your coldblooded soft handed religionists  this is a more quiet letter than usual from me my dear coz for  many of your reproofs cut me home  they angered me at the time but  i deserve them  i am miserable selfdisgusted selfhelpless  craving for freedom and yet crying aloud for some one to come and  guide me and teach me and who is there in these days who could  teach a fast man even if he would try  be sure that as long as  you and yours make piety a synonym for unmanliness you will never  convert either me or any other good sportsman  by the bye my dear fellow was i asleep or awake when i seemed to  read in the postscript of your last letter something about being  driven to rome after all     why thither of all places in  heaven or earth  you know i have no party interest in the  question  all creeds are very much alike to me just now  but allow  me to ask in a spirit of the most tolerant curiosity what possible  celestial bait either of the useful or the agreeable kind can the  present excellent pope or his adherents hold out to you in  compensation for the solid earthly pudding which you would have to  desert     i daresay though that i shall not comprehend your  answer when it comes  i am you know utterly deficient in that  sixth sense of the angelic or supralunar beautiful which fills your  soul with ecstasy  you i know expect and long to become an angel  after death  i am under the strange hallucination that my body is  part of me and in spite of old plotinus look with horror at a  disembodiment till the giving of that new body the great perfection  of which in your eyes and those of every one else seems to be  that it will be less and not more of a body than our present one      is this hope to me at once inconceivable and contradictory  palpable and valuable enough to you to send you to that italian  avernus to get it made a little more certain  if so i despair of  your making your meaning intelligible to a poor fellow wallowing  like me in the hylic borborosor whatever else you may choose to  call the unfortunate fact of being flesh and blood     still  write    chapter iii  new actors and a new stage    when argemone rose in the morning her first thought was of  lancelot  his face haunted her  the wild brilliance of his  intellect struggling through foul smokeclouds had haunted her  still more  she had heard of his profligacy his bursts of fierce  berserkmadness and yet now these very faults instead of  repelling seemed to attract her and intensify her longing to save  him  she would convert him purify him harmonise his discords   and that very wish gave her a peace she had never felt before  she  had formed her idea she had now a purpose for which to live and  she determined to concentrate herself for the work and longed for  the moment when she should meet lancelot and beginhow she did  not very clearly see  it is an old jestthe fair devotee trying to convert the young  rake  men of the world laugh heartily at it and so does the devil  no doubt  if any readers wish to be fellowjesters with that  personage they may but as sure as old saxon womenworship remains  for ever a blessed and healing law of life the devotee may yet  convert the rakeand perhaps herself into the bargain  argemone looked almost angrily round at her beloved books and  drawings for they spoke a message to her which they had never  spoken before of selfcentred ambition  yes she said aloud to  herself i have been selfish utterly  art poetry sciencei  believe after all that i have only loved them for my own sake not  for theirs because they would make me something feed my conceit of  my own talents  how infinitely more glorious to find my workfield  and my prize not in dead forms and colours or inkandpaper  theories but in a living immortal human spirit  i will study no  more except the human heart and only that to purify and ennoble  it  true argemone and yet like all resolutions somewhat less than  the truth  that morning indeed her purpose was simple as gods  own light  she never dreamed of exciting lancelots admiration  even his friendship for herself  she would have started as from a  snake from the issue which the reader very clearly foresees that  lancelot would fall in love not with young englandism but with  argemone lavington  but yet self is not eradicated even from a  womans heart in one morning before breakfast  besides it is not  benevolence but lovethe real cupid of flesh and blood who can  first   touch the chord of self which trembling passes in music out of sight   but a time for all things and it is now time for argemone to go  down to breakfast having prepared some dozen imaginary dialogues  between herself and lancelot in which of course her eloquence  always had the victory  she had yet to learn that it is better  sometimes not to settle in ones heart what we shall speak for the  everlasting will has good works ready prepared for us to walk in by  what we call fortunate accident and it shall be given us in that  day and that hour what we shall speak  lancelot in the meantime shrank from meeting argemone and was  quite glad of the weakness which kept him upstairs  whether he was  afraid of herwhether he was ashamed of himself or of his crutches  i cannot tell but i daresay reader you are getting tired of all  this souldissecting  so we will have a bit of action again for  the sake of variety if for nothing better  of all the species of lovely scenery which england holds none  perhaps is more exquisite than the banks of the chalkriversthe  perfect limpidity of the water the gay and luxuriant vegetation of  the banks and ditches the masses of noble wood embosoming the  villages the unique beauty of the watermeadows living sheets of  emerald and silver tinkling and sparkling cool under the fiercest  sun brilliant under the blackest cloudsthere if anywhere one  would have expected to find arcadia among fertility loveliness  industry and wealth  but alas for the sad reality the cool  breath of those glittering watermeadows too often floats laden with  poisonous miasma  those picturesque villages are generally the  perennial hotbeds of fever and ague of squalid penury sottish  profligacy dull discontent too stale for words  there is luxury in  the park wealth in the huge farmsteadings knowledge in the  parsonage  but the poor those by whose dull labour all that luxury  and wealth ay even that knowledge is made possiblewhat are  they  we shall see please god ere the storys end  but of all this lancelot as yet thought nothing  he too had to be  emancipated as much as argemone from selfish dreams to learn to  work trustfully in the living present not to gloat sentimentally  over the unreturning past  but his time was not yet come and  little he thought of all the work which lay ready for him within a  mile of the priory as he watched the ladies go out for the  afternoon and slipped down to the nunspool on his crutches to  smoke and fish and build castles in the air  the priory with its rambling courts and gardens stood on an island  in the river  the upper stream flowed in a straight artificial  channel through the garden still and broad towards the priory  mill while just above the priory wall half the river fell over a  high weir with all its appendages of bucks and hatchways and eel baskets into the nunspool and then swept round under the ivied  walls with their fantastic turrets and gables and little loopholed  windows peering out over the stream as it hurried down over the  shallows to join the race below the mill  a postern door in the  walls opened on an ornamental wooden bridge across the weirheada  favourite haunt of all fishers and sketchers who were admitted to  the dragonguarded elysium of whitford priors  thither lancelot  went congratulating himself strange to say in having escaped the  only human being whom he loved on earth  he found on the weirbridge two of the keepers  the younger one  tregarva was a stately thoughtfullooking cornishman some six  feet three in height with thews and sinews in proportion  he was  sitting on the bridge looking over a basket of eellines and  listening silently to the chat of his companion  old harry verney the other keeper was a character in his way and  a very bad character too though he was a patriarch among all the  gamekeepers of the vale  he was a short wiry bandylegged  ferretvisaged old man with grizzled hair and a wizened face  tanned brown and purple by constant exposure  between rheumatism  and constant handling the rod and gun his fingers were crooked like  a hawks claws  he kept his left eye always shut apparently to  save trouble in shooting and squinted and sniffed and peered  with a stooping back and protruded chin as if he were perpetually  on the watch for fish flesh and fowl vermin and christian  the  friendship between himself and the scotch terrier at his heels would  have been easily explained by lessing for in the transmigration of  souls the spirit of harry verney had evidently once animated a dog  of that breed  he was dressed in a huge thick fustian jacket  scratched stained and patched with bulging greasy pockets a  cast of flies round a battered hat riddled with shotholes a dog whistle at his buttonhole and an old gun cut short over his arm  bespoke his business  i seed that ere crawy against ashy down plantations last night  ill be sworn said he in a squeaking sneaking tone  well what harm was the man doing  oh ay thats the way you young uns talk  if he warnt doing  mischief hed a been glad to have been doing it ill warrant  if  id been as young as you id have picked a quarrel with him soon  enough and found a cause for tackling him  its worth a brace of  sovereigns with the squire to haul him up  eh eh  aint old harry  right now  humph growled the younger man  there then you get me a snare and a hare by tomorrow night  went on old harry and see if i dont nab him  it wont lay long  under the plantation afore he picks it up  you mind to snare me a  hare tonight now  ill do no such thing nor help to bring fake accusations against  any man  false accusations answered harry in his cringing way  look at  that now for a keeper to say  why if he dont happen to have a  snare just there he has somewhere else you know  eh  aint old  harry right now eh  maybe  there dont say i dont know nothing then  eh  what matter who  put the snare down or the hare in perwided he takes it up man   if twas hisn hed be all the better pleased  the most  notoriousest poacher as walks unhung  and old harry lifted up his  crooked hands in pious indignation  ill have no more gamekeeping harry  what with hunting down  christians as if they were vermin all night and being cursed by  the squire all day id sooner be a sheriffs runner or a negro  slave  ay ay thats the way the young dogs always bark afore theyre  broke in and gets to like it as the eels does skinning  havent i  bounced pretty near out of my skin many a time afore now on this  here very bridge with harry jump in you stupid hound and  harry get out you oneeyed tailor   and then if one of the  gentlemen lost a fish with their clumsinessoh father to hear em  let out at me and my landingnet and curse fit to fright the devil   dash their sarcy tongues  eh  dont old harry know their ways   dont he know em now  ay said the young man bitterly  we break the dogs and we load  the guns and we find the game and mark the gameand then they  call themselves sportsmen we choose the flies and we bait the  spinninghooks and we show them where the fish lie and then when  theyve hooked them they cant get them out without us and the  spoonnet and then they go home to the ladies and boast of the lot  of fish they killedand who thinks of the keeper  oh ah  then dont say old harry knows nothing then  how nicely  now you and i might get a living off this ere manor if the  landlords was served like the french ones was  eh paul chuckled  old harry  wouldnt we pay our taxes with pheasants and grayling  thats all eh  aint old harry right now eh  the old fox was fishing for an assent not for its own sake for he  was a fierce tory and would have stood up to be shot at any day  not only for his masters sake but for the sake of a single  pheasant of his masters but he hated tregarva for many reasons  and was daily on the watch to entrap him on some of his peculiar  points whereof he had as we shall find a good many  what would have been tregarvas answer i cannot tell but lancelot  who had unintentionally overheard the greater part of the  conversation disliked being any longer a listener and came close  to them  heres your gudgeons and minnows sir as you bespoke quoth  harry and heres that paternoster as you gave me to rig up   beautiful minnows sir white as a silver spoontheyre the ones  now aint they sir eh  theyll do  well then dont say old harry dont know nothing thats all  eh and the old fellow toddled off peering and twisting his head  about like a starling  an odd old fellow that tregarva said lancelot  very sir considering who made him answered the cornishman  touching his hat and then thrusting his nose deeper than ever into  the eelbasket  beautiful stream this said lancelot who had a continual longing right or wrongto chat with his inferiors and was proportionately  sulky and reserved to his superiors  beautiful enough sir said the keeper with an emphasis on the  first word  why has it any other fault  not so wholesome as pretty sir  what harm does it do  fever and ague and rheumatism sir  where asked lancelot a little amused by the mans laconic  answers  wherever the white fog spreads sir  wheres that  everywhere sir  and when  always sir  lancelot burst out laughing  the man looked up at him slowly and  seriously  you wouldnt laugh sir if youd seen much of the inside of these  cottages round  really said lancelot i was only laughing at our making such  very short work of such a long and serious story  do you mean that  the unhealthiness of this country is wholly caused by the river  no sir  the riverdamps are gods sending and so they are not  too bad to bear  but theres more of mans sending that is too bad  to bear  what do you mean  are men likely to be healthy when they are worse housed than a  pig  no  and worse fed than a hound  good heavens  no  or packed together to sleep like pilchards in a barrel  but my good fellow do you mean that the labourers here are in  that state  it isnt far to walk sir  perhaps some day when the mayfly is  gone off and the fish wont rise awhile you could walk down and  see  i beg your pardon sir though for thinking of such a thing   they are not places fit for gentlemen thats certain  there was a  staid irony in his tone which lancelot felt  but the clergyman goes  yes sir  and miss honoria goes  yes god almighty bless her  and do not they see that all goes right  the giant twisted his huge limbs as if trying to avoid an answer  and yet not daring to do so  do clergymen go about among the poor much sir at college before  they are ordained  lancelot smiled and shook his head  i thought so sir  our good vicar is like the rest hereabouts   god knows he stints neither time nor moneythe souls of the poor  are well looked after and their bodies tooas far as his purse  will go but thats not far  is he illoff then  the livings worth some forty pounds a year  the great tithes  they say are worth better than twelve hundred but squire lavington  has them  oh i see said lancelot  im glad you do sir for i dont meekly answered tregarva  but  the vicar sir he is a kind man and a good but the poor dont  understand him nor he them  he is too learned sir and saving  your presence too fond of his prayerbook  one cant be too fond of a good thing  not unless you make an idol of it sir and fancy that mens souls  were made for the prayerbook and not the prayerbook for them  but cannot he expose and redress these evils if they exist  tregarva twisted about again  i do not say that i think it sir but this i know that every poor  man in the vale thinks itthat the parsons are afraid of the  landlords  they must see these things for they are not blind and  they try to plaster them up out of their own pockets  but why in gods name dont they strike at the root of the  matter and go straight to the landlords and tell them the truth  asked lancelot  so people say sir  i see no reason for it except the one which i  gave you  besides sir you must remember that a man cant quarrel  with his own kin and so many of them are their squires brothers  or sons or nephews  or good friends with him at least  ay sir and to do them justice they had need for the poors  sake to keep good friends with the squire  how else are they to  get a farthing for schools or coalsubscriptions or lyingin  societies or lending libraries or penny clubs  if they spoke  their minds to the great ones sir how could they keep the parish  together  you seem to see both sides of a question certainly  but what a  miserable state of things that the labouring man should require all  these societies and charities and helps from the richthat an  industrious freeman cannot live without alms  so i have thought this long time quietly answered tregarva  but miss honoriashe is not afraid to tell her father the truth  suppose sir when adam and eve were in the garden that all the  devils had come up and played their fiends tricks before themdo  you think theyd have seen any shame in it  i really cannot tell said lancelot smiling  then i can sir  theyd have seen no more harm in it than there  was harm already in themselves and that was none  a mans eyes can  only see what theyve learnt to see  lancelot started  it was a favourite dictum of his in carlyles  works  where did you get that thought my friend  by seeing sir  but what has that to do with miss honoria  she is an angel of holiness herself sir and therefore she goes  on without blushing or suspecting where our blood would boil again   she sees people in want and thinks it must be so and pities them  and relieves them  but she dont know want herself and therefore  she dont know that it makes men beasts and devils  shes as pure  as gods light herself and therefore she fancies every one is as  spotless as she is  and theres another mistake in your charitable  great people sir  when they see poor folk sick or hungry before  their eyes they pull out their purses fast enough god bless them  for they wouldnt like to be so themselves  but the oppression that  goes on all the year round and the want that goes on all the year  round and the filth and the lying and the swearing and the  profligacy that go on all the year round and the sickening weight  of debt and the miserable grinding anxiety from rentday to rent day and saturday night to saturday night that crushes a mans soul  down and drives every thought out of his head but how he is to fill  his stomach and warm his back and keep a house over his head till  he darent for his life take his thoughts one moment off the meat  that perishethoh sir they never felt this and therefore they  never dream that there are thousands who pass them in their daily  walks who feel this and feel nothing else  this outburst was uttered with an earnestness and majesty which  astonished lancelot  he forgot the subject in the speaker  you are a very extraordinary gamekeeper said he  when the lord shows a man a thing he cant well help seeing it  answered tregarva in his usual staid tone  there was a pause  the keeper looked at him with a glance before  which lancelots eyes fell  hell is paved with hearsays sir and as all this talk of mine is  hearsay if you are in earnest sir go and see for yourself  i  know you have a kind heart and they tell me that you are a great  scholar which would to god i was so you ought not to condescend to  take my word for anything which you can look into yourself with  which sound piece of commonsense tregarva returned busily to his  eellines  hand me the rod and can and help me out along the buckstage  said lancelot i must have some more talk with you my fine  fellow  amen answered tregarva as he assisted our lame hero along a huge  beam which stretched out into the pool and having settled him  there returned mechanically to his work humming a wesleyan hymn tune  lancelot sat and tried to catch perch but tregarvas words haunted  him  he lighted his cigar and tried to think earnestly over the  matter but he had got into the wrong place for thinking  all his  thoughts all his sympathies were drowned in the rush and whirl of  the water  he forgot everything else in the mere animal enjoyment  of sight and sound  like many young men at his crisis of life he  had given himself up to the mere contemplation of nature till he had  become her slave and now a luscious scene a singing bird were  enough to allure his mind away from the most earnest and awful  thoughts  he tried to think but the river would not let him  it  thundered and spouted out behind him from the hatches and leapt  madly past him and caught his eyes in spite of him and swept them  away down its dancing waves and let them go again only to sweep  them down again and again till his brain felt a delicious dizziness  from the everlasting rush and the everlasting roar  and then below  how it spread and writhed and whirled into transparent fans  hissing and twining snakes polished glasswreaths huge crystal  bells which boiled up from the bottom and dived again beneath long  threads of creamy foam and swung round posts and roots and rushed  blackening under dark weedfringed boughs and gnawed at the marly  banks and shook the everrestless bulrushes till it was swept away  and down over the white pebbles and olive weeds in one broad  rippling sheet of molten silver towards the distant sea  downwards  it fleeted ever and bore his thoughts floating on its oily stream  and the great trout with their yellow sides and peacock backs  lounged among the eddies and the silver grayling dimpled and  wandered upon the shallows and the mayflies flickered and rustled  round him like water fairies with their green gauzy wings the coot  clanked musically among the reeds the frogs hummed their ceaseless  vespermonotone the kingfisher darted from his hole in the bank  like a blue spark of electric light the swallows bills snapped as  they twined and hawked above the pool the swifts wings whirred  like musketballs as they rushed screaming past his head and ever  the river fleeted by bearing his eyes away down the current till  its wild eddies began to glow with crimson beneath the setting sun   the complex harmony of sights and sounds slid softly over his soul  and he sank away into a still daydream too passive for imagination  too deep for meditation and   beauty born of murmuring sound did pass into his face   blame him not  there are more things in a mans heart than ever get  in through his thoughts  on a sudden a soft voice behind him startled him  can a poor cockney artist venture himself along this timber without  falling in  lancelot turned  come out to me and if you stumble the naiads will rise out of  their depths and hold up their pearled wrists to save their  favourite  the artist walked timidly out along the beams and sat down beside  lancelot who shook him warmly by the hand  welcome claude mellot and all lovely enthusiasms and symbolisms   expound to me now the meaning of that waterlily leaf and its  grand simple curve as it lies sleeping there in the back eddy  oh i am too amused to philosophise  the fair argemone has just  been treating me to her three hundred and sixtyfifth philippic  against my unoffending beard  why what fault can she find with such a graceful and natural  ornament  just this my dear fellow that it is natural  as it is she  considers me only intelligentlooking  if the beard were away my  face she says would be so refined  and i suppose if i was  just a little more effeminate and pale with a nice retreating  underjaw and a drooping lip and a meek peaking simper like your  starved romish saints i should be so spiritual  and if again  to complete the climax i did but shave my head like a chinese i  should be a model for st francis himself  but really after all why make yourself so singular by this said  beard  i wear it for a testimony and a sign that a man has no right to be  ashamed of the mark of manhood  oh that one or two of your  protestant clergymen who ought to be perfect ideal men would have  the courage to get up into the pulpit in a long beard and testify  that the very essential idea of protestantism is the dignity and  divinity of man as god made him  our forefathers were not ashamed  of their beards but now even the soldier is only allowed to keep  his moustache while our quilldriving masses shave themselves as  close as they can and in proportion to a mans piety he wears less  hair from the young curate who shaves off his whiskers to the  popish priest who shaves his crown  what do you say then to cutting off nuns hair  i say that extremes meet and prudish manichaeism always ends in  sheer indecency  those papists have forgotten what woman was made  for and therefore they have forgotten that a womans hair is her  glory for it was given to her for a covering  as says your friend  paul the hebrew who by the bye had as fine theories of art as he  had of society if he had only lived fifteen hundred years later  and had a chance of working them out  how remarkably orthodox you are said lancelot smiling  how do you know that i am not  you never heard me deny the old  creed  but what if an artist ought to be of all creeds at once  my  business is to represent the beautiful and therefore to accept it  wherever i find it  yours is to be a philosopher and find the  true  but the beautiful must be truly beautiful to be worth anything and  so you too must search for the true  yes truth of form colour chiaroscuro  they are worthy to occupy  me a life for they are eternalor at least that which they  express  and if i am to get at the symbolised unseen it must be  through the beauty of the symbolising phenomenon  if i who live by  art for art in art or you either who seem as much a born artist  as myself am to have a religion it must be a worship of the  fountain of artof the   spirit of beauty who doth consecrate with his own hues whateer he shines upon   as poor shelley has it and much peace of mind it gave him  answered lancelot  i have grown sick lately of such dreary tinsel  abstractions  when you look through the glitter of the words your  spirit of beauty simply means certain shapes and colours which  please you in beautiful things and in beautiful people  vile nominalist renegade from the ideal and all its glories said  claude laughing  i dont care sixpence now for the ideal  i want not beauty but  some beautiful thinga woman perhaps and he sighed  but at  least a persona living loving personall lovely itself and  giving loveliness to all things  if i must have an ideal let it  be for mercys sake a realised one  claude opened his sketchbook  we shall get swamped in these metaphysical oceans my dear dreamer   but lo here come a couple as near ideals as any in these  degenerate daysthe two poles of beauty  the milieu of which would  be venus with us pagans or the virgin mary with the catholics   look at them  honoria the darksymbolic of passionate depth  argemone the fair type of intellectual light  oh that i were a  zeuxis to unite them instead of having to paint them in two separate  pictures and split perfection in half as everything is split in  this piecemeal world  you will have the honour of a sitting this afternoon i suppose  from both beauties  i hope so for my own sake  there is no path left to immortality  or bread either now for us poor artists but portraitpainting  i envy you your path when it leads through such elysiums said  lancelot  come here gentlemen both cried argemone from the bridge  fairly caught grumbled lancelot  you must go at least my  lameness will excuse me i hope  the two ladies were accompanied by bracebridge a gazelle which he  had given argemone and a certain miserable cur of honorias  adopting who plays an important part in this story and therefore  deserves a little notice  honoria had rescued him from a watery  death in the village pond by means of the colonel who had revenged  himself for a pair of wet feet by utterly corrupting the dogs  morals and teaching him every week to answer to some fresh  scandalous name  but lancelot was not to escape  instead of moving on as he had  hoped the party stood looking over the bridge and talkinghe took  for granted poor thinskinned fellowof him  and for once his  suspicions were right for he overheard argemone say  i wonder how mr smith can be so rude as to sit there in my  presence over his stupid perch  smoking those horrid cigars too   how selfish those fieldsports do make men  thank you said the colonel with a low bow  lancelot rose  if a country girl now had spoken in that tone said he to  himself it would have been called at least saucybut mammons  elect ones may do anything  wellhere i come limping to my new  tyrants feet like goethes bear to lilis  she drew him away as women only know how from the rest of the  party who were chatting and laughing with claude  she had shown  off her fancied indifference to lancelot before them and now began  in a softer voice  why will you be so shy and lonely mr smith  because i am not fit for your society  who tells you so  why will you not become so  lancelot hung down his head  as long as fish and game are your only society you will become  more and more morne and selfabsorbed  really fish were the last things of which i was thinking when you  came  my whole heart was filled with the beauty of nature and  nothing else  there was an opening for one of argemones preconcerted orations  had you no better occupation she said gently than nature the  first day of returning to the open air after so frightful and  dangerous an accident  were there no thanks due to one above  lancelot understood her  how do you know that i was not even then showing my thankfulness  what with a cigar and a fishingrod  certainly  why not  argemone really could not tell at the moment  the answer upset her  scheme entirely  might not that very admiration of nature have been an act of  worship continued our hero  how can we better glorify the worker  than by delighting in his work  ah sighed the lady why trust to these selfwilled methods and  neglect the noble and exquisite forms which the church has prepared  for us as embodiments for every feeling of our hearts  every feeling miss lavington  argemone hesitated  she had made the good old stock assertion as  in duty bound but she could not help recollecting that there were  several popish books of devotion at that moment on her table which  seemed to her to patch a gap or two in the prayerbook  my temple as yet said lancelot is only the heaven and the  earth my churchmusic i can hear all day long whenever i have the  sense to be silent and hear my mother sing my priests and  preachers are every bird and bee every flower and cloud  am i not  well enough furnished  do you want to reduce my circular infinite  chapel to an oblong hundredfoot one  my sphere harmonies to the  gregorian tones in four parts  my worldwide priesthood with their  endless variety of costume to one not overeducated gentleman in a  white sheet  and my dreams of naiads and flowerfairies and the  bluebells ringing gods praises as they do in the story without  an end for the gross reality of naughty charity children with  their pockets full of apples bawling out hebrew psalms of which  they neither feel nor understand a word  argemone tried to look very much shocked at this piece of bombast   lancelot evidently meant it as such but he eyed her all the while  as if there was solemn earnest under the surface  oh mr smith she said how can you dare talk so of a liturgy  compiled by the wisest and holiest of all countries and ages  you  revile that of whose beauty you are not qualified to judge  there must be a beauty in it all or such as you are would not love  it  oh she said hopefully that you would but try the church system   how you would find it harmonise and methodise every day every  thought for you  but i cannot explain myself  why not go to our  vicar and open your doubts to him  pardon but you must excuse me  why  he is one of the saintliest of men  to tell the truth i have been to him already  you do not mean it  and what did he tell you  what the rest of the world doeshearsays  but did you not find him most kind  i went to him to be comforted and guided  he received me as a  criminal  he told me that my first duty was penitence that as long  as i lived the life i did he could not dare to cast his pearls  before swine by answering my doubts that i was in a state incapable  of appreciating spiritual truths and therefore he had no right to  tell me any  and what did he tell you  several spiritual lies instead i thought  he told me hearing me  quote schiller to beware of the germans for they were all  pantheists at heart  i asked him whether he included lange and  bunsen and it appeared that he had never read a german book in his  life  he then flew furiously at mr carlyle and i found that all  he knew of him was from a certain review in the quarterly  he  called boehmen a theosophic atheist  i should have burst out at  that had i not read the very words in a high church review the day  before and hoped that he was not aware of the impudent falsehood  which he was retailing  whenever i feebly interposed an objection  to anything he said for after all he talked on he told me to  hear the catholic church  i asked him which catholic church  he  said the english  i asked him whether it was to be the church of  the sixth century or the thirteenth or the seventeenth or the  eighteenth  he told me the one and eternal church which belonged as  much to the nineteenth century as to the first  i begged to know  whether then i was to hear the church according to simeon or  according to newman or according to st paul for they seemed to me  a little at variance  he told me austerely enough that the mind  of the church was embodied in her liturgy and articles  to which i  answered that the mind of the episcopal clergy might perhaps be  but then how happened it that they were always quarrelling and  calling hard names about the sense of those very documents  and so  i left him assuring him that living in the nineteenth century i  wanted to hear the church of the nineteenth century and no other  and should be most happy to listen to her as soon as she had made  up her mind what to say  argemone was angry and disappointed  she felt she could not cope  with lancelots quaint logic which however unsound cut deeper  into questions than she had yet looked for herself  somehow too  she was tonguetied before him just when she wanted to be most  eloquent in behalf of her principles and that fretted her still  more  but his manner puzzled her most of all  first he would run  on with his face turned away as if soliloquising out into the air  and then suddenly look round at her with most fascinating humility  and then in a moment a dark shade would pass over his  countenance and he would look like one possessed and his lips  wreathe in a sinister artificial smile and his wild eyes glare  through and through her with such cunning understanding of himself  and her that for the first time in her life she quailed and felt  frightened as if in the power of a madman  she turned hastily away  to shake off the spell  he sprang after her almost on his knees and looked up into her  beautiful face with an imploring cry  what do you too throw me off  will you too treat the poor  wild uneducated sportsman as a pariah and an outcast because he is  not ashamed to be a manbecause he cannot stuff his souls hunger  with cutanddried hearsays but dares to think for himself because he wants to believe things and dare not be satisfied with  only believing that he ought to believe them  she paused astonished  ah yes he went on i hoped too much  what right had i to  expect that you would understand me  what right still more to  expect that you would stoop any more than the rest of the world to  speak to me as if i could become anything better than the wild hog  i seem  oh yesthe chrysalis has no butterfly in it of course   stamp on the ugly motionless thing  and yetyou look so beautiful  and goodare all my dreams to perish about the alrunen and  prophetmaidens how they charmed our old fighting hunting  forefathers into purity and sweet obedience among their saxon  forests  has woman forgotten her missionto look at the heart and  have mercy while cold man looks at the act and condemns  do you  too like the rest of mankind think nobelief better than  misbelief and smile on hypocrisy lipassent practical atheism  sooner than on the unpardonable sin of making a mistake  will you  like the rest of this wise world let a mans spirit rot asleep into  the pit if he will only lie quiet and not disturb your smooth  respectabilities but if he dares in waking to yawn in an  unorthodox manner knock him on the head at once and break the  bruised reed and quench the smoking flax  and yet you  churchgoers have renounced the world  what do you want in heavens name asked argemone half  terrified  i want you to tell me that  here i am with youth health  strength money every blessing of life but one and i am utterly  miserable  i want some one to tell me what i want  is it not that you wantreligion  i see hundreds who have what you call religion with whom i should  scorn to change my irreligion  but mr smith are you notare you not wickedthey tell me so  said argemone with an effort and is that not the cause of your  disease  lancelot laughed  no fairest prophetess it is the disease itself  why am i what i  am when i know more and more daily what i could bethat is the  mystery and my sins are the fruit and not the root of it  who  will explain that  argemone began  the church  oh miss lavington cried he impatiently will you too send me  back to that cold abstraction  i came to you however presumptuous  for living human advice to a living human heart and will you pass  off on me that proteusdream the church which in every mans mouth  has a different meaning  in one book meaning a method of  education only it has never been carried out in another a system  of polityonly it has never been realisednow a set of words  written in books on whose meaning all are divided now a body of  men who are daily excommunicating each other as heretics and  apostates now a universal idea now the narrowest and most  exclusive of all parties  really before you ask me to hear the  church i have a right to ask you to define what the church is  our articles define it said argemone drily  the visible church at least it defines as a company of  faithful men in which etc  but how does it define the  invisible one  and what does faithful mean  what if i thought  cromwell and pierre leroux infinitely more faithful men in their  way and better members of the invisible church than the  torturerpedant laud or the facing bothways protestantmanichee  taylor  it was lucky for the life of young love that the discussion went no  further  argemone was becoming scandalised beyond all measure   but happily the colonel interposed  look here tell me if you know for whom this sketch is meant  tregarva the keeper  who can doubt answered they both at once  has not mellot succeeded perfectly  yes said lancelot  but what wonder with such a noble subject   what a grand benevolence is enthroned on that lofty forehead  oh you would say so indeed interposed honoria if you knew  him  the stories that i could tell you about him  how he would go  into cottages read to sick people by the hour dress the children  cook the food for them as tenderly as any woman  i found out last  winter if you will believe it that he lived on bread and water to  give out of his own wageswhich are barely twelve shillings a week five shillings a week for more than two months to a poor labouring  man to prevent his going to the workhouse and being parted from  his wife and children  noble indeed said lancelot  i do not wonder now at the effect  his conversation just now had on me  has he been talking to you said honoria eagerly  he seldom  speaks to any one  he has to me and so well that were i sure that the poor were as  ill off as he says and that i had the power of altering the system  a hair i could find it in my heart to excuse all political  grievancemongers and turn one myself  claude mellot clapped his white womanlike hands  bravo bravo  o wonderful conversion  lancelot has at last  discovered that besides the glorious past there is a present  worthy of his sublime notice  we may now hope in time that he  will discover the existence of a future  but mr mellot said honoria why have you been so unfaithful to  your original why have you like all artists been trying to soften  and refine on your model  because my dear lady we are bound to see everything in its ideal not as it is but as it ought to be and will be when the vices of  this pitiful civilised world are exploded and sanitary reform and  a variety of occupation and harmonious education let each man  fulfil in body and soul the ideal which god embodied in him  fourierist cried lancelot laughing  but surely you never saw a  face which had lost by wear less of the divine image  how  thoroughly it exemplifies your great law of protestant art that  the ideal is best manifested in the peculiar  how classic how  independent of clime or race is its bland majestic self possession how thoroughly norse its massive squareness  and yet as a cornishman he should be no norseman  i beg your pardon  like all noble races the cornish owe their  nobleness to the impurity of their bloodto its perpetual loans  from foreign veins  see how the serpentine curve of his nose his  long nostril and protruding sharpcut lips mark his share of  phoenician or jewish blood how norse again that domeshaped  forehead how celtic those dark curls that restless gray eye with  its swinden blicken like von troneg hagens in the niebelungen  lied  he turned  honoria was devouring his words  he saw it for he was  in love and young love makes mans senses as keen as womans  look look at him now said claude in a low voice  how he sits  with his hands on his knees the enormous size of his limbs quite  concealed by the careless grace with his egyptian face like some  dumb granite memnon  only waiting said lancelot for the daystar to arise on him and  awake him into voice  he looked at honoria as he spoke  she blushed angrily and yet a  sort of sympathy arose from that moment between lancelot and  herself  our hero feared he had gone too far and tried to turn the subject  off  the smooth millhead was alive with rising trout  what a huge fish leapt then said lancelot carelessly and close  to the bridge too  honoria looked round and uttered a piercing scream  oh my dog my dog  mops is in the river  that horrid gazelle has  butted him in and hell be drowned  alas it was too true  there a yard above the one open hatchway  through which the whole force of the stream was rushing was the  unhappy mops alias scratch alias dirty dick alias jack sheppard  paddling and sneezing and winking his little bald muzzle turned  piteously upward to the sky  he will be drowned quoth the colonel  there was no doubt of it and so mops thought as shivering and  whining he plied every leg while the glassy current dragged him  back and back and honoria sobbed like a child  the colonel lay down on the bridge and caught at him  his arm was  a foot too short  in a moment the huge form of tregarva plunged  solemnly into the water with a splash like seven salmon and mops  was jerked out over the colonels head high and dry on to the  bridge  youll be drowned at least shouted the colonel with an oath of  uncle tobys own  tregarva saw his danger made one desperate bound upward and missed  the bridge  the colonel caught at him tore off a piece of his  collarthe calm solemn face of the keeper flashed past beneath  him and disappeared through the roaring gate  they rushed to the other side of the bridgecaught one glimpse of a  dark body fleeting and roaring down the foamway  the colonel leapt  the bridgerail like a deer rushed out along the buckstage tore  off his coat and sprung headlong into the boiling pool rejoicing  in his might as old homer would say  lancelot forgetting his crutches was dashing after him when he  felt a soft hand clutching at his arm  lancelot  mr smith cried argemone  you shall not go  you are  too illweak  a fellowcreatures life  what is his life to yours she cried in a tone of deep passion   and then imperiously stay here i command you  the magnetic touch of her hand thrilled through his whole frame   she had called him lancelot  he shrank down and stood spellbound  good heavens she cried look at my sister  out on the extremity of the buckstage how she got there neither  they nor she ever knew crouched honoria her face idiotic with  terror while she stared with bursting eyes into the foam  a shriek  of disappointment rose from her lips as in a moment the colonels  weatherworn head reappeared above looking for all the world like  an old gray shinypainted seal  poof tallyho  poof poof  heave me a piece of wood lancelot  my boy  and he disappeared again  they looked round there was not a loose bit near  claude ran off  towards the house  lancelot desperate seized the bridgerail  tore it off by sheer strength and hurled it far into the pool   argemone saw it and remembered it like a true woman  ay be as  manichaeansentimental as you will fair ladies physical prowess  that edenright of manhood is sure to tell upon your hearts  again the colonels grizzled head reappearedand oh joy beneath  it a draggled knot of black curls  in another instant he had hold  of the rail and quietly floating down to the shallow dragged the  lifeless giant high and dry on a patch of gravel  honoria never spoke  she rose walked quietly back along the beam  passed argemone and lancelot without seeing them and firmly but  hurriedly led the way round the poolside  before they arrived at the bank the colonel had carried tregarva to  it  lancelot and two or three workmen whom his cries had  attracted lifted the body on to the meadow  honoria knelt quietly down on the grass and watched silent and  motionless the dead face with her wide awestruck eyes  god bless her for a kind soul whispered the wan weatherbeaten  field drudges as they crowded round the body  get out of the way my men quoth the colonel  too many cooks  spoil the broth  and he packed off one here and another there for  necessaries and commenced trying every restorative means with the  ready coolness of a practised surgeon while lancelot whom he  ordered about like a baby gulped down a great choking lump of envy  and then tasted the rich delight of forgetting himself in admiring  obedience to a real superior  but there tregarva lay lifeless with folded hands and a quiet  satisfied smile while honoria watched and watched with parted lips  unconscious of the presence of every one  five minutesten  carry him to the house said the colonel in a despairing tone  after another attempt  he moves  no  he does  he breathes  look at his  eyelids  slowly his eyes opened  where am i  all gone  sweet dreamsblessed dreams  his eye met honorias  one big deep sigh swelled to his lips and  burst  she seemed to recollect herself rose passed her arm  through argemones and walked slowly away    chapter iv  an inglorious milton    argemone sweet prude thought herself bound to read honoria a  lecture that night on her reckless exhibition of feeling but it  profited little  the most consummate cunning could not have baffled  argemones suspicions more completely than her sisters utter  simplicity  she cried just as bitterly about mopss danger as about  the keepers and then laughed heartily at argemones solemnity  till at last when pushed a little too hard she broke out into  something very like a passion and told her sister bitterly enough  that she was not accustomed to see men drowned every day and  begged to hear no more about the subject  whereat argemone  prudently held her tongue knowing that under all honorias  tenderness lay a volcano of passionate determination which was  generally kept down by her affections but was just as likely to be  maddened by them  and so this conversation only went to increase  the unconscious estrangement between them though they continued as  sisters will do to lavish upon each other the most extravagant  protestations of affectionvowing to live and die only for each  otherand believing honestly sweet souls that they felt all they  said till real imperious love came in in one case of the two at  least shouldering all other affections right and left and then the  two beauties discovered as others do that it is not so possible or  reasonable as they thought for a woman to sacrifice herself and her  lover for the sake of her sister or her friend  next morning  lancelot and the colonel started out to tregarvas cottage on a  mission of inquiry  they found the giant propped up in bed with  pillows his magnificent features looking in their paleness more  than ever like a granite memnon  before him lay an open pilgrims  progress and a drawer filled with feathers and furs which he was  busily manufacturing into trout flies reading as he worked  the  room was filled with nets guns and keepers tackle while a well filled shelf of books hung by the wall  excuse my rising gentlemen he said in his slow staid voice  but i am very weak in spite of the lords goodness to me  you are  very kind to think of coming to my poor cottage  well my man said the colonel and how are you after your cold  bath  you are the heaviest fish i ever landed  pretty well thank god and you sir  i am in your debt sir for  the dear life  how shall i ever repay you  repay my good fellow  you would have done as much for me  may be but you did not think of that when you jumped in and no  more must i in thanking you  god knows how a poor miners son will  ever reward you but the mouse repaid the lion says the story and  at all events i can pray for you  by the bye gentlemen i hope  you have brought up some trollingtackle  we came up to see you and not to fish said lancelot charmed  with the stately courtesy of the man  many thanks gentlemen but old harry verney was in here just now  and had seen a great jack strike at the tail of the lower reeds   with this fresh wind he will run till noon and you are sure of him  with a dace  after that he will not be up again on the shallows  till sunset  he works the works of darkness and comes not to the  light because his deeds are evil  lancelot laughed  he does but follow his kind poor fellow  no doubt sir no doubt all the lords works are good  but it is  a wonder why he should have made wasps now and blights and  vermin and jack and such evilfeatured things that carry spite  and cruelty in their very facesa great wonder  do you think sir  all those creatures were in the garden of eden  you are getting too deep for me said lancelot  but why trouble  your head about fishing  i beg your pardon for preaching to you sir  im sure i forgot  myself  if you will let me ill get up and get you a couple of  bait from the stew  youll do us keepers a kindness and prevent  sin sir if youll catch him  the squire will swear sadlythe  lord forgive himif he hears of a pike in the troutruns  ill get  up if i may trouble you to go into the next room a minute  lie still for heavens sake  why bother your head about pike  now  it is my business sir and i am paid for it and i must do it  thoroughlyand abide in the calling wherein i am called he  added in a sadder tone  you seem to be fond enough of it and to know enough about it at  all events said the colonel tying flies here on a sickbed  as for being fond of it sirthose creatures of the water teach a  man many lessons and when i tie flies i earn books  how then  i send my flies all over the country sir to salisbury and  hungerford and up to winchester even and the money buys me many a  wise bookall my delight is in reading perhaps so much the worse  for me  so much the better say answered lancelot warmly  ill give you  an order for a couple of pounds worth of flies at once  the lord reward you sir answered the giant  and you shall make me the same quantity said the colonel  you  can make salmonflies  i made a lot by pattern for an irish gent sir  well then well send you some norway patterns and some golden  pheasant and parrot feathers  were going to norway this summer  you know lancelot  tregarva looked up with a quaint solemn hesitation  if you please gentlemen youll forgive a mans conscience  well  but id not like to be a party to the making of norway flies  heres a protectionist with a vengeance laughed the colonel   do you want to keep all us fishermen in england eh to fee english  keepers  no sir  theres pretty fishing in norway i hear and poor folk  that want money more than we keepers  god knows we get too muchwe  that hang about great houses and serve great folks pleasureyou  toss the money down our throats without our deserving it and we  spend it as we get ita deal too fastwhile hardworking labourers  are starving  and yet you would keep us in england  would god i could  why then my good fellow asked lancelot who was getting  intensely interested with the calm selfpossessed earnestness of  the man and longed to draw him out  the colonel yawned  well ill go and get myself a couple of bait  dont you stir my  good parsonkeeper  down charge i say  odd if i dont find a  baitnet and a rod for myself under the verandah  you will colonel  i remember now i set it there last morning  but the water washed many things out of my brains and some things  into themand i forgot it like a goose  well goodbye and lie still  i know what a drowning is and more  than one  a day and a night have i been in the deep like the man  in the good book and bed is the best of medicine for a ducking  and the colonel shook him kindly by the hand and disappeared  lancelot sat down by the keepers bed  youll get those fishhooks into your trousers sir and this is a  poor place to sit down in  i want you to say your say out friend fishhooks or none  the keeper looked warily at the door and when the colonel had  passed the window balancing the trollingrod on his chin and  whistling merrily he began  a day and a night have i been in the deepand brought back no  more from it  and yet the psalms say how they that go down to the  sea in ships see the works of the lordif the lord has opened  their eyes to see them that must mean  lancelot waited  what a gallant gentleman that is and a valiant man of war ill  warrantand to have seen all the wonders he has and yet to be  wasting his span of life like that  lancelots heart smote him  one would think siryoull pardon me for speaking out  and the  noble face worked as he murmured to himself when ye are brought  before kings and princes for my names sakei dare not hold my  tongue sir  i am as one risen from the deadand his face  flashed up into sudden enthusiasmand woe to me if i speak not   oh why why are you gentlemen running off to norway and foreign  parts whither god has not called you  are there no graves in  egypt that you must go out to die in the wilderness  lancelot quite unaccustomed to the language of the dissenting poor  felt keenly the bad taste of the allusion  what can you mean he asked  pardon me sir if i cannot speak plainly but are there not  temptations enough here in england that you must go to waste all  your gifts your scholarship and your rank far away there out of  the sound of a churchgoing bell  i dont deny its a great  temptation  i have read of norway wonders in a book of one miss  martineau with a strange name  feats on the fiord  thats it sir  her books are grand books to set one athinking  but she dont seem to see the lord in all things does she sir  lancelot parried the question  you are wandering a little from the point  so i am and thank you for the rebuke  theres where i find you  scholars have the advantage of us poor fellows who pick up  knowledge as we can  your booklearning makes you stick to the  point so much better  you are taught how to think  after allgod  forgive me if im wrong but i sometimes think that there must be  more good in that human wisdom and philosophy falsely so called  than we wesleyans hold  oh sir what a blessing is a good  education  what you gentlemen might do with it if you did but see  your own power  are there no fish in england sir to be caught  precious fish with immortal souls  and is there not one who has  said come with me and i will make you fishers of men  would you have us all turn parsons  is no one to do gods work except the parson sir  oh the game  that you rich folks have in your hands if you would but play it   such a man as colonel bracebridge now with the tongue of the  serpent who can charm any living soul he likes to his will as a  stoat charms a rabbit  or you sir with your tongueyou have  charmed one precious creature already  i can see it  though  neither of you know it yet i know it  lancelot started and blushed crimson  oh that i had your tongue sir  and the keeper blushed crimson  too and went on hastily  but why could you not charm all alike  do not the poor want you as  well as the rich  what can i do for the poor my good fellow  and what do they want   have they not houses work a church and schoolsand poorrates  to fall back on  the keeper smiled sadly  to fall back on indeed and down on too  at all events you rich  might help to make christians of them and men of them  for im  beginning to fancy strangely in spite of all the preachers say  that before ever you can make them christians you must make them  men and women  are they not so already  oh sir go and see  how can a man be a man in those crowded  styes sleeping packed together like irish pigs in a steamer never  out of the fear of want never knowing any higher amusement than the  beershop  those old greeks and romans as i read were more like  men than half our english labourers  go and see  ask that sweet  heavenly angel miss honoriaand the keeper again blushedand  she too will tell you  i think sometimes if she had been born and  bred like her fathers tenants daughters to sleep where they  sleep and hear the talk they hear and see the things they see  what would she have been now  we mustnt think of it  and the  keeper turned his head away and fairly burst into tears  lancelot was moved  are the poor very immoral then  you ask the rector sir how many children hereabouts are born  within six months of the weddingday  none of them marry sir till  the devil forces them  theres no sadder sight than a labourers  wedding nowadays  you never see the parents come with them  they  just get another couple that are keeping company like themselves  and come sneaking into church looking all over as if they were  ashamed of itand well they may be  is it possible  i say sir that god makes you gentlemen gentlemen that you may  see into these things  you give away your charities kindly enough  but you dont know the folks you give to  if a few of you would but  be like the blessed lord and stoop to go out of the road just  behind the hedge for once among the publicans and harlots  were  you ever at a country fair sir  though i suppose i am rude for  fancying that you could demean yourself to such company  i should not think it demeaning myself said lancelot smiling  but i never was at one and i should like for once to see the real  manners of the poor  im no haunter of such places myself god knows buti see youre  in earnest nowwill you come with me sirfor once for gods  sake and the poors sake  i shall be delighted  not after youve been there i am afraid  well its a bargain when you are recovered  and in the meantime  the squires orders are that you lie by for a few days to rest and  miss honorias too and she has sent you down some wine  she thought of me did she  and the still sad face blazed out  radiant with pleasure and then collapsed as suddenly into deep  melancholy  lancelot saw it but said nothing and shaking him heartily by the  hand had his shake returned by an iron grasp and slipped silently  out of the cottage  the keeper lay still gazing on vacancy  once he murmured to  himself  through strange waysstrange waysand though he let them wander  out of the road in the wildernesswe know how that goes on  and then he fell into a mixed meditationperhaps into a prayer    chapter v  a sham is worse than nothing    at last after lancelot had waited long in vain came his cousins  answer to the letter which i gave in my second chapter  you are not fair to me good cousin    but i have given up  expecting fairness from protestants  i do not say that the front  and the back of my head have different makers any more than that  doves and vipers have    and yet i kill the viper when i meet him     and so do you     and yet are we not taught that our  animal nature is throughout equally viperous     the catholic  church at least so teaches     she believes in the corruption  of human nature  she believes in the literal meaning of scripture   she has no wish to paraphrase away st pauls awful words that in  his flesh dwelleth no good thing by the unscientific euphemisms of  fallen nature or corrupt humanity  the boasted discovery of  phrenologists that thought feeling and passion reside in this  material brain and nerves of ours has ages ago been anticipated by  her simple faith in the letter of scripture a faith which puts to  shame the irreverent vagueness and fantastic private interpretations  of those who make an idol of that very letter which they dare not  take literally because it makes against their selfwilled theories     and so you call me douce and meek     you should remember what  i once was lancelot    i at least have not forgotten    i  have not forgotten how that very animal nature on the possession of  which you seem to pride yourself was in me only the parent of  remorse    i know it too well not to hate and fear it  why do  you reproach me if i try to abjure it and cast away the burden  which i am too weak to bear  i am weakwould you have me say that  i am strong  would you have me try to be a prometheus while i am  longing to be once more an infant on a mothers breast  let me  alone     i am a weary child who knows nothing can do nothing  except lose its way in arguings and reasonings and find no end in  wandering mazes lost  will you reproach me because when i see a  soft cradle lying open for me    with a virgin mothers face  smiling down all womans love about it     i long to crawl into  it and sleep awhile  i want loving indulgent sympathy     i  want detailed explicit guidance     have you then found so  much of them in our former creed that you forbid me to go to seek  them elsewhere in the church which not only professes them as an  organised system but practises them    as you would find in your  first halfhours talk with one of her priests    true priests     who know the heart of man and pity and console and bear for  their flock the burdens which they cannot bear themselves  you ask  me who will teach a fast young man    i answer the jesuit  ay  start and sneer at that delicate womanlike tenderness that subtle  instinctive sympathy which you have never felt    which is as  new to me alas as it would be to you  for if there be none nowa days to teach such as you who is there who will teach such as me   do not fancy that i have not craved and searched for teachers      i went to one party long ago and they commanded me as the price of  their sympathy even of anything but their denunciations to ignore  if not to abjure all the very points on which i came for lightmy  love for the beautiful and the symbolicmy desire to consecrate and  christianise itmy longing for a human voice to tell me with  authority that i was forgivenmy desire to find some practical and  palpable communion between myself and the saints of old  they told  me to cast away as an accursed chaos a thousand years of christian  history and believe that the devil had been for ages    just the  ages i thought noblest most faithful most interpenetrated with the  thought of god    triumphant over that church with which he had  promised to be till the end of the world  no    by the bye they  made two exceptionsof their own choosing  one in favour of the  albigenses    who seemed to me from the original documents to  have been very profligate infidels of whom the world was well rid     and the piedmontese    poor simple illused folk enough  but who certainly cannot be said to have exercised much influence on  the destinies of mankind    and all the rest was chaos and the  pit  there never had been never would be a kingdom of god on  earth but only a few scattered individuals each selfishly intent  on the salvation of his own soulwithout organisation without  unity without common purpose without even a masonic sign whereby  to know one another when they chanced to meet    except  shibboleths which the hypocrite could ape and virtues which the  heathen have performed     would you have had me accept such a  philosophy of history  and then i went to another school    or rather wandered up and  down between those whom i have just described and those who boast  on their side prescriptive right and apostolic succession    and  i found that their ancient charter went backjust three hundred  years    and there derived its transmitted virtue it seemed to  me by something very like obtaining goods on false pretences from  the very church which it now anathematises  disheartened but not  hopeless i asked how it was that the priesthood whose hands  bestowed the grace of ordination could not withdraw it     whether at least the schismatic did not forfeit it by the very act  of schism    and instead of any real answer to that fearful  spiritual dilemma they set me down to folios of nags head  controversies    and myths of an independent british church now  represented strangely enough by those saxons who after its wicked  refusal to communicate with them exterminated it with fire and  sword and derived its own order from st gregory    and  decisions of mythical old councils held by bishops of a different  faith and practice from their own from which i was to pick the one  point which made for them and omit the nine which made against  them while i was to believe by a stretch of imagination    or  common honesty    which i leave you to conceive that the church  of syria in the fourth century was in doctrine practice and  constitution like that of england in the nineteenth     and  what was i to gain by all this     for the sake of what was i to  strain logic and conscience  to believe myself a member of the same  body with all the christian nations of the earthto be able to  hail the frenchman the italian the spaniard as a brotherto have  hopes even of the german and the swede    if not in this life  still in the life to come  no    to be able still to sit apart  from all christendom in the exclusive pride of insular pharisaism  to claim for the modern littleness of england the infallibility  which i denied to the primaeval mother of christendom not to  enlarge my communion to the catholic but excommunicate to all  practical purposes over and above the catholics all other  protestants except my own sect    or rather in practice except  my own party in my own sect     and this was believing in one  catholic and apostolic church    this was to be my share of the  communion of saints  and these were the theories which were to  satisfy a soul which longed for a kingdom of god on earth which  felt that unless the highest of his promises are a mythic dream  there must be some system on the earth commissioned to fulfil those  promises some authority divinely appointed to regenerate and rule  and guide the lives of men and the destinies of nations who must  go mad unless he finds that history is not a dreary aimless  procession of lost spirits descending into the pit or that the  salvation of millions does not depend on an obscure and controverted  hairs breadth of ecclesiastic law  i have tried them both lancelot and found them wanting and now  but one road remains     home to the fountainhead to the  mother of all the churches whose fancied cruelty to her children can  no more destroy her motherhood than their confest rebellion can      shall i not hear her voice when she and she alone cries to  me i have authority and commission from the king of kings to  regenerate the world  history is a chaos only because mankind has  been ever rebelling against me its lawful ruler    and yet not a  chaos    for i still stand and grow rooted on the rock of ages  and under my boughs are fowl of every wing  i alone have been and  am consistent progressive expansive welcoming every race and  intellect and character into its proper place in my great organism     meeting alike the wants of the king and the beggar the artist  and the devotee    there is free room for all within my heaven wide bosom  infallibility is not the exclusive heritage of one  proud and ignorant island but of a system which knows no  distinction of language race or clime  the communion of saints is  not a bygone tale for my saints redeemed from every age and every  nation under heaven still live and love and help and intercede   the union of heaven and earth is not a barbaric myth for i have  still my miracles my host my exorcism my absolution  the present  rule of god is still as ever a living reality for i rule in his  name and fulfil all his will  how can i turn away from such a voice  what if some of her  doctrines may startle my untutored and ignorant understanding      if she is the appointed teacher she will know best what truths to  teach     the disciple is not above his master    or wise in  requiring him to demonstrate the abstrusest problems    spiritual  problems too    before he allows his right to teach the  elements  humbly i must enter the temple porch gradually and  trustfully proceed with my initiation     when that is past and  not before    shall i be a fit judge of the mysteries of the  inner shrine  there     i have written a long letter    with my own hearts  blood     think over it well before you despise it     and  if you can refute it for me and sweep the whole away like a wild  dream when one awakes none will be more thankfulparadoxical as it  may seemthan your unhappy cousin   and lancelot did consider that letter and answered it as follows   it is a relief to me at least dear luke that you are going to  rome in search of a great idea and not merely from selfish  superstitious terror as i should call it about the salvation of  your soul  and it is a new and very important thought to me that  romes scheme of this world rather than of the next forms her  chief allurement  but as for that flesh and spirit question or the  apostolic succession one either all you seem to me as a looker on  to have logically proved is that protestants orthodox and  unorthodox must be a little more scientific and careful in their  use of the terms  but as for adopting your use of them and the  consequences thereofyou must pardon me and i suspect them too   not that  anything but that  whatever is right that is wrong   better to be inconsistent in truth than consistent in a mistake   and your romish idea of man is a mistakeutterly wrong and absurd except in the one requirement of righteousness and godliness which  protestants and heathen philosophers have required and do require  just as much as you  my dear luke your ideal men and women wont  dofor they are not men and women at all but what you call  saints     your calendar your historic list of the earths  worthies wont donot they but others are the people who have  brought humanity thus far  i dont deny that there are great souls  among them beckets and hugh grostetes and elizabeths of hungary   but you are the last people to praise them for you dont understand  them  thierry honours thomas a becket more than all canonisations  and worshippers do because he does see where the mans true  greatness lay and you dont  why you may hunt all surius for such  a biography of a mediaeval worthy as carlyle has given of your abbot  samson  i have read or tried to read your surius and alban  butler and so forthand they seemed to me bats and assesone  really pitied the poor saints and martyrs for having such blind  biographerssuch dunghill cocks who overlooked the pearl of real  human love and nobleness in them in their greediness to snatch up  and parade the rotten chaff of superstition and selftorture and  spiritual dyspepsia which had overlaid it  my dear fellow that  calendar ruins your causeyou are sacres aristocrateskings and  queens bishops and virgins by the

temporal as well as spiritual  too of your dalai lama  his pills do not seem to have had much  practical effect there     my good luke till he can show us a  little better specimen of the kingdom of heaven organised and  realised on earth in the country which does belong to him soil and  people body and soul we must decline his assistance in realising  that kingdom in countries which dont belong to him  if the state  of rome dont show his idea of man and society to be a rotten lie  what proof would you have    perhaps the charming results of a  century of jesuitocracy as they were represented on a french stage  in the year 1793  i cant answer his arguments you see or yours  either i am an englishman and not a controversialist  the only  answer i give is john bulls old dumb instinctive everlasting no  which he will stand by if need be with sharp shot and cold steel not that anything but that  no kingdom of heaven at all for us  if the kingdom of heaven is like that  no heroes at all for us if  their heroism is to consist in their being notmen  better no  society at all but only a competitive wildbeasts den than a sham  society  better no faith no hope no love no god than shams  thereof  i take my stand on fact and nature you may call them  idols and phantoms i say they need be so no longer to any man  since bacon has taught us to discover the eternal laws under the  outward phenomena  here on blank materialism will i stand and  testify against all religions and gods whatsoever if they must  needs be like that roman religion that roman god  i dont believe  they neednot i  but if they need they must go  we cannot have a  deus quidam deceptor  if there be a god these trees and stones  these beasts and birds must be his will whatever else is not  my  body and brain and faculties and appetites must be his will  whatever else is not  whatsoever i can do with them in accordance  with the constitution of them and nature must be his will whatever  else is not  those laws of nature must reveal him and be revealed  by him whatever else is not  mans scientific conquest of nature  must be one phase of his kingdom on earth whatever else is not  i  dont deny that there are spiritual laws which man is meant to obey how can i who feel in my own daily and inexplicable unhappiness  the fruits of having broken thembut i do say that those  spiritual laws must be in perfect harmony with every fresh physical  law which we discover  that they cannot be intended to compete  selfdestructively with each other that the spiritual cannot be  intended to be perfected by ignoring or crushing the physical  unless god is a deceiver and his universe a selfcontradiction   and by this test alone will i try all theories and dogmas and  spiritualities whatsoeverare they in accordance with the laws of  nature  and therefore when your party compare sneeringly romish  sanctity and english civilisation i say take you the sanctity  and give me the civilisation  the one may be a dream for it is  unnatural the other cannot be for it is natural and not an evil  in it at which you sneer but is discovered day by day to be owing  to some infringement of the laws of nature  when we draw bills on  nature as carlyle says she honours themour ships do sail  our mills do work our doctors do cure our soldiers do fight  and  she does not honour yours for your jesuits have by their own  confession to lie to swindle to get even man to accept theirs for  them  so give me the political economist the sanitary reformer  the engineer and take your saints and virgins relics and miracles   the spinningjenny and the railroad cunards liners and the  electric telegraph are to me if not to you signs that we are on  some points at least in harmony with the universe that there is a  mighty spirit working among us who cannot be your anarchic and  destroying devil and therefore may be the ordering and creating  god   which of them do you think reader had most right on his side    chapter vi  vogue la galere    lancelot was now so far improved in health as to return to his  little cottage ornee  he gave himself up freely to his new passion   with his comfortable fortune and good connections the future seemed  bright and possible enough as to circumstances  he knew that  argemone felt for him how much it seemed presumptuous even to  speculate and as yet no goldenvisaged meteor had arisen portentous  in his amatory zodiac  no rich man had stepped in to snatch in  spite of all his own flocks and herds at the poor mans own ewe lamb and set him barking at all the world as many a poor lover has  to do in defence of his morsel of enjoyment now turned into a mere  bone of contention and loadstone for all hungry kites and crows  all that had to be done was to render himself worthy of her and in  doing so to win her  and now he began to feel more painfully his  ignorance of society of practical life and the outward present   he blamed himself angrily for having as he now thought wasted his  time on ancient histories and foreign travels while he neglected  the living wonderful present which weltered daily round him every  face embodying a living soul  for now he began to feel that those  faces did hide living souls formerly he had half believedhe had  tried but from laziness to make himself wholly believethat they  were all empty masks phantasies without interest or significance  for him  but somehow in the light of his new love for argemone  the whole human race seemed glorified brought nearer endeared to  him  so it must be  he had spoken of a law wider than he thought  in his fancy that the angels might learn love for all by love for  an individual  do we not all learn love so  is it not the first  touch of the mothers bosom which awakens in the infants heart that  spark of affection which is hereafter to spread itself out towards  every human being and to lose none of its devotion for its first  object as it expands itself to innumerable new ones  is it not by  love tooby looking into loving human eyes by feeling the care of  loving handsthat the infant first learns that there exist other  beings beside itselfthat every body which it sees expresses a  heart and will like its own  be sure of it  be sure that to have  found the key to one heart is to have found the key to all that  truly to love is truly to know and truly to love one is the first  step towards truly loving all who bear the same flesh and blood with  the beloved  like children we must dress up even our unseen future  in stage properties borrowed from the tried and palpable present  ere we can look at it without horror  we fear and hate the utterly  unknown and it only  even pain we hate only when we cannot know  it when we can only feel it without explaining it and making it  harmonise with our notions of our own deserts and destiny  and as  for human beings there surely it stands true wherever else it may  not that all knowledge is love and all love knowledge that even  with the meanest we cannot gain a glimpse into their inward trials  and struggles without an increase of sympathy and affection  whether he reasoned thus or not lancelot found that his new  interest in the working classes was strangely quickened by his  passion  it seemed the shortest and clearest way toward a practical  knowledge of the present  here he said to himself in the  investigation of existing relations between poor and rich i shall  gain more real acquaintance with english society than by dawdling  centuries in exclusive drawingrooms  the inquiry had not yet presented itself to him as a duty perhaps  so much the better that it might be the more thoroughly a freewill  offering of love  at least it opened a new field of amusement and  knowledge it promised him new studies of human life and as he lay  on his sofa and let his thoughts flow tregarvas dark revelations  began to mix themselves with dreams about the regeneration of the  whitford poor and those again with dreams about the heiress of  whitford and many a luscious scene and noble plan rose brightly  detailed in his exuberant imagination  for lancelot like all born  artists could only think in a concrete form  he never worked out a  subject without embodying it in some set oration dialogue or  dramatic castle in the air  but the more he dreamt the more he felt that a material beauty of  flesh and blood required a material house baths and boudoirs  conservatories and carriages a safe material purse and fixed  material society law and order and the established framework of  society gained an importance in his eyes which they had never had  before  well he said to himself i am turning quite practical and auld warld  those old greeks were not so far wrong when they said that  what made men citizens patriots heroes was the love of wedded  wife and child  wedded wife and childhe shrank in from the daring of the  delicious thought as if he had intruded without invitation into a  hidden sanctuary and looked round for a book to drive away the  dazzling picture  but even there his thoughts were haunted by  argemones face and      when his regard was raised by intense pensiveness two eyes two starry eyes hung in the gloom of thought and seemed with their serene and azure smiles to beckon him   he took up with a new interest chartism which alone of all mr  carlyles works he had hitherto disliked because his own luxurious  daydreams had always flowed in such sad discord with the terrible  warnings of the modern seer and his dark vistas of starvation  crime neglect and discontent  well he said to himself as he closed the book i suppose it is  good for us easygoing ones now and then to face the possibility of  a change  gold has grown on my back as feathers do on geese  without my own will or deed but considering that gold like  feathers is equally useful to those who have and those who have  not why it is worth while for the goose to remember that he may  possibly one day be plucked  and what remains  io as medea  says     but argemone     and lancelot felt for the  moment as conservative as the tutelary genius of all special  constables  as the last thought passed through his brain bracebridges little  mustang slouched past the window ridden without a saddle by a  horseman whom there was no mistaking for no one but the immaculate  colonel the chevalier sans peur et sans reproche dared to go about  the country such a figure  a minute afterwards he walked in in a  students felt hat a ragged heathercoloured coatee and old white  regulation drills shrunk halfway up his legs a pair of  embroidered indian mocassins and an enormous meerschaum at his  buttonhole  where have you been this last week  over head and ears in young england till i fled to you for a  weeks common sense  a glass of cider for mercys sake to take  the taste of it out of my mouth as bill sykes has it  where have you been staying  with young lord vieuxbois among high art and painted glass spade  farms and model smelltraps rubricalities and sanitary reforms  and all other inventions possible and impossible for stretching  the old formula to meet the new fact as your favourite prophet  says  till the old formula cracks under the tension  and cracks its devotees too i think  here comes the cider  but my dear fellow you must not laugh at all this  young england  or peelite this is all right and noble  what a yet unspoken poetry  there is in that very sanitary reform  it is the great fact of the  age  we shall have men arise and write epics on it when they have  learnt that to the pure all things are pure and that science and  usefulness contain a divine element even in their lowest  appliances  write one yourself and call it the chadwickiad  why not   smells and the man i sing   theres a beginning at once  why dont you rather with your  practical power turn sanitary reformerthe only true soldierand  conquer those real devils and natural enemies of englishmen  carbonic acid and sulphuretted hydrogen  ce nest pas mon metier my dear fellow  i am miserably behind the  age  people are getting so cursedly in earnest nowadays that i  shall have to bolt to the backwoods to amuse myself in peace or  else sham dumb as the monkeys do lest folks should find out that  im rational and set me to work  lancelot laughed and sighed  but how on earth do you contrive to get on so well with men with  whom you have not an idea in common  savoir faire o infant hercules own daddy to savoir vivre  i am a  good listener and therefore the most perfect because the most  silent of flatterers  when they talk puginesquery i stick my head  on one side attentively and think the more like the ladys  parrot  i have been all the morning looking over a set of drawings  for my lords new chapel and every soul in the party fancies me a  great antiquary just because i have been retailing to b as my own  everything that a told me the moment before  i envy you your tact at all events  why the deuce should you  you may rise in time to something better  than tact to what the good book i suppose means by wisdom   young geniuses like you who have been green enough to sell your  souls to truth must not meddle with tact unless you wish to fare  as the donkey did when he tried to play lapdog  at all events i would sooner remain cub till they run me down and  eat me than give up speaking my mind said lancelot  fool i may  be but the devil himself shant make me knave  quite proper  on two thousand a year a man can afford to be  honest  kick out lustily right and leftafter all the world is  like a spaniel the more you beat it the better it likes youif  you have money  only dont kick too hard for after all it has a  hundred million pair of shins to your one  dont fear that i shall run amuck against society just now  i am  too thoroughly out of my own good books  i have been for years  laughing at young england and yet its little finger is thicker than  my whole body for it is trying to do something and i alas am  doing utterly nothing  i should be really glad to take a lesson of  these men and their plans for social improvement  you will have a fine opportunity this evening  dont you dine at  minchampstead  yes  do you  mr jingle dines everywhere except at home  will you take me over  in your trap  done  but whom shall we meet there  the lavingtons and vieuxbois and vaurien and a parson or two i  suppose  but between saint venus and vieuxbois you may soon learn  enough to make you a sadder man if not a wiser one  why not a wiser one  sadder than now i cannot be or less wise  god knows  the colonel looked at lancelot with one of those kindly thoughtful  smiles which came over him whenever his better childs heart could  bubble up through the thick crust of worldliness  my young friend you have been a little too much on the stilts  heretofore  take care that now you are off them you dont lie  down and sleep instead of walking honestly on your legs  have  faith in yourself pick these mens brains and all mens  you can  do it  say to yourself boldly as the false prophet in india said  to the missionary i have fire enough in my stomach to burn up a  dozen stucco and filigree reformers and assimilate their ashes into  the bargain like one of liebigs cabbages  how can i have faith in myself when i am playing traitor to myself  every hour in the day  and yet faith in something i must have  in  woman perhaps  never said the colonel energetically  in anything but woman   she must be led not leader  if you love a woman make her have  faith in you  if you lean on her you will ruin yourself and her  as well  lancelot shook his head  there was a pause  after all colonel i think there must be a meaning in those old  words our mothers used to teach us about having faith in god  the colonel shrugged his shoulders  quien sabe said the spanish girl when they asked her who was her  childs father  but here comes my kit on a clods back and it is  time to dress for dinner  so to the dinnerparty they went  lord minchampstead was one of the few noblemen lancelot had ever met  who had aroused in him a thorough feeling of respect  he was always  and in all things a strong man  naturally keen ready business like daring he had carved out his own way through life and opened  his oysterthe world neither with sword nor pen but with steam  and cotton  his father was mr obadiah newbroom of the wellknown  manufacturing firm of newbroom stag and playforall  a stanch  dissenter himself he saw with a slight pang his son thomas turn  churchman as soon as the young man had worked his way up to be the  real head of the firm  but this was the only sorrow which thomas  newbroom now lord minchampstead had ever given his father  i  stood behind a loom myself my boy when i began life and you must  do with great means what i did with little ones  i have made a  gentleman of you you must make a nobleman of yourself  those were  almost the last words of the stern thrifty old puritan craftsman  and his son never forgot them  from a millowner he grew to coal owner shipowner banker railway director moneylender to kings  and princes and last of all as the summit of his own and his  compeers ambition to landowner  he had half a dozen estates in  as many different counties  he had added house to house and field  to field and at last bought minchampstead park and ten thousand  acres for twothirds its real value from that enthusiastic  sportsman lord peu de cervelle whose family had come in with the  conqueror and gone out with george iv  so at least they always  said but it was remarkable that their name could never be traced  farther back than the dissolution of the monasteries  and  calumnious dryasdusts would sometimes insolently father their title  on james i and one of his batches of bought peerages  but let the  dead bury their dead  there was now a new lord in minchampstead  and every country caliban was finding to his disgust that he had  got a new master and must perforce be a new man  oh how the  squires swore and the farmers chuckled when the parvenu sold the  minchampstead hounds and celebrated his 1st of september by  exterminating every hare and pheasant on the estate  how the  farmers swore and the labourers chuckled when he took all the  cottages into his own hands and rebuilt them set up a firstrate  industrial school gave every man a pig and a garden and broke up  all the commons to thin the labourmarket  oh how the labourers  swore and the farmers chuckled when he put up steamengines on all  his farms refused to give away a farthing in alms and enforced the  new poorlaw to the very letter  how the country tradesmen swore  when he called them a pack of dilatory jobbers and announced his  intention of employing only london workmen for his improvements   oh how they all swore together behind his back of course for his  dinners were worth eating and the very ladies said naughty words  when the stern political economist proclaimed at his own table that  he had bought minchampstead for merely commercial purposes as a  profitable investment of capital and he would see that whatever  else it did it should pay  but the new lord heard of all the hard words with a quiet self possessed smile  he had formed his narrow theory of the universe  and he was methodically and conscientiously carrying it out  true  too often like poor keatss merchant brothers   halfignorant he turned an easy wheel which set sharp racks at work to pinch and peel   but of the harm which he did he was unconscious in the good which  he did he was consistent and indefatigable infinitely superior  with all his defects to the ignorant extravagant donothing squire  lavingtons around him  at heart however mammothblinded he was  kindly and upright  a man of a stately presence a broad honest  northcountry face a high square forehead bland and unwrinkled  i  sketch him here once for all because i have no part for him after  this scene in my corps de ballet  lord minchampstead had many reasons for patronising lancelot  in  the first place he had a true eye for a strong man wherever he met  him in the next place lancelots uncle the banker was a stanch  whig ally of his in the house  in the rottenborough times mr  smith he once said to lancelot we could have made a senator of  you at once but for the sake of finality we were forced to  relinquish that organ of influence  the tories had abused it  really a little too far and now we can only make a commissioner of  youwhich after all is a more useful post and a more lucrative  one  but lancelot had not as yet galliolised as the irish  schoolmaster used to call it and cared very little to play a  political ninth fiddle  the first thing which caught his eyes as he entered the drawingroom  before dinner was argemone listening in absorbed reverence to her  favourite vicara stern prim closeshaven dyspeptic man with a  meek cold smile which might have become a cruel one  he watched  and watched in vain hoping to catch her eye but nothere she  stood and talked and listened  ah said bracebridge smiling it is in vain smith  when did  you know a woman leave the church for one of us poor laymen  good heavens said lancelot impatiently why will they make such  fools of themselves with clergymen  they are quite right  they always like the strong menthe  fighters and the workers  in voltaires time they all ran after the  philosophers  in the middle ages books tell us they worshipped  the knights errant  they are always on the winning side the  cunning little beauties  in the wartime when the soldiers had to  play the worlds game the ladies all caught the redcoat fever  now in these talking and thinking days and be hanged to them for  bores they have the blackcoat fever for the same reason  the  parsons are the workers nowadaysor rather all the world expects  them to be so  they have the game in their own hands if they did  but know how to play it  lancelot stood still sulking over many thoughts  the colonel  lounged across the room towards lord vieuxbois a quiet truly high bred young man with a sweet open countenance and an ample  forehead whose size would have vouched for great talents had not  the promise been contradicted by the weakness of the overdelicate  mouth and chin  who is that with whom you came into the room bracebridge asked  lord vieuxbois  i am sure i know his face  lancelot smith the man who has taken the shootingbox at lower  whitford  oh i remember him well enough at cambridge  he was one of a set  who tried to look like blackguards and really succeeded tolerably   they used to eschew gloves and drink nothing but beer and smoke  disgusting short pipes and when we established the coverley club in  trinity they set up an opposition and called themselves the  navvies  and they used to make piratical expeditions down to lynn  in eight oars to attack bargemen and fen girls and shoot ducks  and sleep under turfstacks and come home when they had drank all  the publichouse taps dry  i remember the man perfectly  navvy or none said the colonel he has just the longest head and  the noblest heart of any man i ever met  if he does not distinguish  himself before he dies i know nothing of human nature  ah yes i believe he is clever enoughtook a good degree a  better one than i didbut horribly eclectic full of mesmerism and  german metaphysics and all that sort of thing  i heard of him one  night last spring on which he had been seen if you will believe  it going successively into a swedenborgian chapel the garricks  head and one of elliotsons magnetic soirees  what can you expect  after that  a great deal said bracebridge drily  with such a head as he  carries on his shoulders the man might be another mirabeau if he  held the right cards in the right rubber  and he really ought to  suit you for he raves about the middle ages and chivalry and has  edited a book full of old ballads  oh all the eclectics do that sort of thing and small thanks to  them  however i will speak to him after dinner and see what there  is in him  and lord vieuxbois turned away and alas for lancelot sat next to  argemone at dinner  lancelot who was cross with everybody for what  was nobodys fault revenged himself all dinnertime by never  speaking a word to his next neighbour miss newbroom who was  longing with all her heart to talk sentiment to him about the  exhibition and when argemone in the midst of a brilliant word skirmish with lord vieuxbois stole a glance at him he chose to  fancy that they were both talking of him and looked more cross than  ever  after the ladies retired lancelot in his sulky way made up his  mind that the conversation was going to be ineffably stupid and set  to to dream sip claret and count the minutes till he found himself  in the drawingroom with argemone  but he soon discovered as i  suppose we all have that it never rains but it pours and that  one cannot fall in with a new fact or a new acquaintance but next  day twenty fresh things shall spring up as if by magic throwing  unexpected light on ones new phenomenon  lancelots head was full  of the conditionofthepoor question and lo everybody seemed  destined to talk about it  well lord vieuxbois said the host casually my girls are  raving about your new school  they say it is a perfect antiquarian  gem  yes tolerable i believe  but wales has disappointed me a little   that vile modernist naturalism is creeping back even into our  painted glass  i could have wished that the artists designs for  the windows had been a little more catholic  how then asked the host with a puzzled face  oh he means said bracebridge that the figures wrists and  ankles were not sufficiently dislocated and the patron saint did  not look quite like a starved rabbit with its neck wrung  some of  the faces i am sorry to say were positively like goodlooking men  and women  oh i understand said lord minchampstead bracebridges tongue  is privileged you know lord vieuxbois so you must not be angry  i dont see my way into all this said squire lavington which was  very likely to be true considering that he never looked for his  way  i dont see how all these painted windows and crosses and  chanting and the deuce and the pope only know what else are to  make boys any better  we have it on the highest authority said vieuxbois that  pictures and music are the books of the unlearned  i do not think  that we have any right in the nineteenth century to contest an  opinion which the fathers of the church gave in the fourth  at all events said lancelot it is by pictures and music by art  and song and symbolic representations that all nations have been  educated in their adolescence and as the youth of the individual is  exactly analogous to the youth of the collective race we should  employ the same means of instruction with our children which  succeeded in the early ages with the whole world  lancelot might as well have held his tonguenobody understood him  but vieuxbois and he had been taught to scent german neology in  everything as some folks are taught to scent jesuitry especially  when it involved an inductive law and not a mere redtape  precedent and therefore could not see that lancelot was arguing  for him  all very fine smith said the squire its a pity you  wont leave off puzzling your head with books and stick to fox hunting  all you young gentlemen will do is to turn the heads of  the poor with your cursed education  the national oath followed  of course  pictures and chanting  why when i was a boy a good  honest labouring man wanted to see nothing better than a halfpenny  ballad with a woodcut at the top and they worked very well then  and wanted for nothing  oh we shall give them the halfpenny ballads in time said  vieuxbois smiling  you will do a very good deed then said mine host  but i am  sorry to say that as far as i can find from my agents when the  upper classes write cheap publications the lower classes will not  read them  too true said vieuxbois  is not the cause asked lancelot just that the upper classes do  write them  the writings of working men certainly said lord minchampstead  have an enormous sale among their own class  just because they express the feelings of that class of which i am  beginning to fear that we know very little  look again what a  noble literature of peoples songs and hymns germany has  some of  lord vieuxboiss friends i know are busy translating many of  them  as many of them that is to say said vieuxbois as are  compatible with a real church spirit  be it so but who wrote them  not the german aristocracy for the  people but the german people for themselves  there is the secret  of their power  why not educate the people up to such a standard  that they should be able to write their own literature  what said mr chalklands of chalklands who sat opposite would  you have working men turn ballad writers  there would be an end of  work then i think  i have not heard said lancelot that the young womenladies i  ought to say if the word mean anythingwho wrote the lowell  offering spun less or worse cotton than their neighbours  on the contrary said lord minchampstead we have the most noble  accounts of heroic industry and selfsacrifice in girls whose  education to judge by its fruits might shame that of most english  young ladies  mr chalklands expressed certain confused notions that in america  factory girls carried green silk parasols put the legs of pianos  into trousers and were too prudish to make a shirt or to call it a  shirt after it was made he did not quite remember which  it is a great pity said lord minchampstead that our factory  girls are not in the same state of civilisation  but it is socially  impossible  america is in an abnormal state  in a young country  the laws of political economy do not make themselves fully felt   here where we have no uncleared world to drain the labourmarket  we may pity and alleviate the condition of the workingclasses but  we can do nothing more  all the modern schemes for the amelioration  which ignore the laws of competition must end either in  pauperisationwith a glance at lord vieuxboisor in the  destruction of property  lancelot said nothing but thought the more  it did strike him at  the moment that the few might possibly be made for the many and  not the many for the few and that property was made for man not  man for property  but he contented himself with asking  you think then my lord that in the present state of society no  deadlift can be given to the conditionin plain english the  wagesof working men without the destruction of property  lord minchampstead smiled and parried the question  there may be other deadlift ameliorations my young friend  besides a deadlift of wages  so lancelot thought also but lord minchampstead would have been a  little startled could he have seen lancelots notion of a deadlift   lord minchampstead was thinking of cheap bread and sugar  do you  think that i will tell you of what lancelot was thinking  but here vieuxbois spurred in to break a last lance  he had been  very much disgusted with the turn the conversation was taking for  he considered nothing more heterodox than the notion that the poor  were to educate themselves  in his scheme of course the clergy and  the gentry were to educate the poor who were to take down  thankfully as much as it was thought proper to give them  and all  beyond was selfwill and private judgment the fathers of  dissent and chartism tradesunion strikes and french revolutions  et si qua alia  and pray mr smith may i ask what limit you would put to  education  the capacities of each man said lancelot  if man living in  civilised society has one right which he can demand it is this that  the state which exists by his labour shall enable him to develop  or at least not hinder his developing his whole faculties to  their very utmost however lofty that may be  while a man who might  be an author remains a spadedrudge or a journeyman while he has  capacities for a master while any man able to rise in life remains  by social circumstances lower than he is willing to place himself  that man has a right to complain of the states injustice and  neglect  really i do not see said vieuxbois why people should wish to  rise in life  they had no such selfwilled fancy in the good old  times  the whole notion is a product of these modern days  he would have said more but he luckily remembered at whose table he  was sitting  i think honestly said lancelot whose blood was up that we  gentlemen all run into the same fallacy  we fancy ourselves the  fixed and necessary element in society to which all others are to  accommodate themselves  given the rights of the few rich to find  the condition of the many poor  it seems to me that other  postulate is quite as fair  given the rights of the many poor to  find the condition of the few rich  lord minchampstead laughed  if you hit us so hard mr smith i must really denounce you as a  communist  lord vieuxbois shall we join the ladies  in the drawingroom poor lancelot after rejecting overtures of  fraternity from several young ladies set himself steadily again  against the wall to sulk and watch argemone  but this time she  spied in a few minutes his melancholy moonstruck face swam up to  him and said something kind and commonplace  she spoke in the  simplicity of her heart but he chose to think she was patronising  himshe had not talked commonplaces to the vicar  he tried to say  something smart and cuttingstuttered broke down blushed and  shrank back again to the wall fancying that every eye in the room  was on him and for one moment a flash of sheer hatred to argemone  swept through him  was argemone patronising him  of course she was  true she was but  threeandtwenty and he was of the same age but spiritually and  socially the girl develops ten years earlier than the boy  she was  flattered and worshipped by grayheaded men and in her simplicity  she thought it a noble selfsacrifice to stoop to notice the poor  awkward youth  and yet if he could have seen the pure moonlight of  sisterly pity which filled all her heart as she retreated with  something of a blush and something of a sigh and her heart  fluttered and fell would he have been content  not he  it was her  love he wanted and not her pity it was to conquer her and possess  her and inform himself with her image and her with his own though  as yet he did not know it though the moment that she turned away he  cursed himself for selfish vanity and moroseness and conceit  who am i to demand her all to myself  her the glorious the  saintly the unfallen  is not a look a word infinitely more than  i deserve  and yet i pretend to admire tales of chivalry  old  knightly hearts would have fought and wandered for years to earn a  tithe of the favours which have been bestowed on me unasked  peace poor lancelot  thy egg is by no means addle but the chick  is breaking the shell in somewhat a crossgrained fashion    chapter vii  the drive home and what came of it    now it was not extraordinary that squire lavington had assimilated  a couple of bottles of carbonels best port for however abstemious  the new lord himself might be he felt for the habits and for the  vote of an oldfashioned whig squire  nor was it extraordinary that  he fell fast asleep the moment he got into the carriage nor again  that his wife and daughters were not solicitous about waking him  nor on the other hand that the coachman and footman who were like  all the squires servants of the good old sort honest faithful  boozing extravagant happygolucky souls who had been about the  place these forty years were somewhat owlish and unsteady on the  box  nor was it extraordinary that there was a heavy storm of  lightning for that happened three times aweek in the chalk hills  the summer through nor again that under these circumstances the  horses who were of the squires own breeding and never thoroughly  broke nothing was done thoroughly at whitford went rather wildly  home and that the carriage swung alarmingly down the steep hills  and the boughs brushed the windows rather too often  but it was  extraordinary that mrs lavington had cast off her usual primness  and seemed tonight for the first time in her life in an exuberant  good humour which she evinced by snubbing her usual favourite  honoria and lavishing caresses on argemone whose vagaries she  usually regarded with a sort of puzzled terror like a hen who has  hatched a duckling  honoria take your feet off my dress  argemone my child i hope  you spent a pleasant evening  argemone answered by some tossy commonplace  a pauseand then mrs lavington recommenced  how very pleasing that poor young lord vieuxbois is after all  i thought you disliked him so much  his opinions my child but we must hope for the best  he seems  moral and well inclined and really desirous of doing good in his  way and so successful in the house too i hear  to me said argemone he seems to want life originality depth  everything that makes a great man  he knows nothing but what he has  picked up readymade from books  after all his opinions are the  one redeeming point in him  ah my dear when it pleases heaven to open your eyes you will see  as i do  poor mrs lavington  unconscious spokeswoman for the ninetynine  hundredths of the human race  what are we all doing from morning to  night but setting up our own fancies as the measure of all heaven  and earth and saying each in his own dialect whig radical or  tory papist or protestant when it pleases heaven to open your  eyes you will see as i do  it is a great pity went on mrs lavington meditatively to see  a young man so benighted and thrown away  with his vast fortune  toosuch a means of good  really we ought to have seen a little  more of him  i think mr oblareaways conversation might be a  blessing to him  i think of asking him over to stay a week at  whitford to meet that sainted young man  now argemone did not think the reverend panurgus oblareaway  incumbent of lower whitford at all a sainted young man but on the  contrary a very vulgar slippery irishman and she had somehow  tired of her late favourite lord vieuxbois so she answered tossily  enough  really mamma a week of lord vieuxbois will be too much  we shall  be bored to death with the cambridge camden society and ballads for  the people  i think my dear said mrs lavington who had half unconsciously  to herself more reasons than one for bringing the young lord to  whitford i think my dear that his conversation with all its  faults will be a very improving change for your father  i hope  hes asleep  the squires nose answered for itself  really what between mr smith and colonel bracebridge and their  very ineligible friend mr mellot whom i should never have allowed  to enter my house if i had suspected his religious views the place  has become a hotbed of false doctrine and heresy  i have been quite  frightened when i have heard their conversation at dinner lest the  footmen should turn infidels  perhaps mamma said honoria slyly lord vieuxbois might convert  them to something quite as bad  how shocking if old giles the  butler should turn papist  honoria you are very silly  lord vieuxbois at least can be  trusted  he has no liking for low companions  he is above joking  with grooms and taking country walks with gamekeepers  it was lucky that it was dark for honoria and argemone both blushed  crimson  your poor fathers mind has been quite unsettled by all their  ribaldry  they have kept him so continually amused that all my  efforts to bring him to a sense of his awful state have been more  unavailing than ever  poor mrs lavington  she had married at eighteen a man far her  inferior in intellect and had becomeas often happens in such  casesa prude and a devotee  the squire who really admired and  respected her confined his disgust to sly curses at the methodists  under which name he used to include every species of religious  earnestness from quakerism to that of mr newman  mrs lavington  used at first to dignify these disagreeables by the name of  persecution and now she was trying to convert the old man by  coldness severity and long curtainlectures utterly  unintelligible to their victim because couched in the peculiar  conventional phraseology of a certain school  she forgot poor  earnest soul that the same form of religion which had captivated a  disappointed girl of twenty might not be the most attractive one  for a jovial old man of sixty  argemone who a fortnight before would have chimed in with all her  mothers lamentations now felt a little nettled and jealous  she  could not bear to hear lancelot classed with the colonel  indeed she said if amusement is bad for my father he is not  likely to get much of it during lord vieuxboiss stay  but of  course mamma you will do as you please  of course i shall my dear answered the good lady in a tragedy queen tone  i shall only take the liberty of adding that it is  very painful to me to find you adding to the anxiety which your  unfortunate opinions give me by throwing every possible obstacle in  the way of my plans for your good  argemone burst into proud tears she often did so after a  conversation with her mother  plans for my goodand an  unworthy suspicion about her mother crossed her mind and was  peremptorily expelled again  what turn the conversation would have  taken next i know not but at that moment honoria and her mother  uttered a fearful shriek as their side of the carriage jolted half way up the bank and stuck still in that pleasant position  the squire awoke and the ladies simultaneously clapped their hands  to their ears knowing what was coming  he thrust his head out of  the window and discharged a broadside of at least ten pounds worth  of oaths bow street valuation at the servants who were examining  the broken wheel with a side volley or two at mrs lavington for  being frightened  he often treated her and honoria to that style of  oratory  at argemone he had never sworn but once since she left the  nursery and was so frightened at the consequences that he took  care never to do it again  but there they were fast with a broken wheel plunging horses and  a drunken coachman  luckily for them the colonel and lancelot were  following close behind and came to their assistance  the colonel as usual solved the problem  your dogcart will carry four smith  it will  then let the ladies get in and mr lavington drive them home  what said the squire with both my hands redhot with the gout   you must drive three of us colonel and one of us must walk  i will walk said argemone in her determined way  mrs lavington began something about propriety but was stopped with  another pounds worth of oaths by the squire who however had  tolerably recovered his good humour and hurried mrs lavington and  honoria laughingly into the dogcart saying  argemones safe enough with smith the servants will lead the  horses behind them  its only three miles home and i should like  to see any one speak to her twice while smiths fists are in the  way  lancelot thought so too  you can trust yourself to me miss lavington  by all means  i shall enjoy the walk after and she stopped   in a moment the dogcart had rattled off with a parting curse from  the squire to the servants who were unharnessing the horses  argemone took lancelots arm the soft touch thrilled through and  through him and argemone felt she knew not why a new sensation  run through her frame  she shudderednot with pain  you are cold miss lavington  oh not in the least  cold when every vein was boiling so  strangely  a soft luscious melancholy crept over her  she had  always had a terror of darkness but now she felt quite safe in his  strength  the thought of her own unprotected girlhood drew her  heart closer to him  she remembered with pleasure the stories of  his personal prowess which had once made her think him coarse and  brutal  for the first time in her life she knew the delight of  dependencethe holy charm of weakness  and as they paced on  silently together through the black awful night while the servants  lingered far out of sight about the horses she found out how  utterly she trusted to him  listen she said  a nightingale was close to them pouring out  his whole soul in song  is it not very late in the year for a nightingale  he is waiting for his mate  she is rearing a late brood i  suppose  what do you think it is which can stir him up to such an ecstasy of  joy and transfigure his whole heart into melody  what but love the fulness of all joy the evoker of all song  all songthe angels sing in heaven  so they say  but the angels must love if they sing  they love god  and no one else  oh yes  but that is universal spiritual love not earthly lovea  narrow passion for an individual  how do we know that they do not learn to love all by first loving  one  oh the angelic life is single  who told you so miss lavington  she quoted the stock text of coursein heaven they neither  marry nor are given in marriage but are as the angels  as the tree falls so it lies  and god forbid that those who  have been true lovers on earth should contract new marriages in the  next world  love is eternal  death may part lovers but not love   and how do we know that these angels as they call them if they be  really persons may not be united in pairs by some marriage bond  infinitely more perfect than any we can dream of on earth  that is a very wild view mr smith and not sanctioned by the  church said argemone severely  curious and significant it is  how severe ladies are apt to be whenever they talk of the church  in plain historic fact the early fathers and the middleage monks  did not sanction it  and are not they the very last persons to whom  one would go to be taught about marriage  strange that people  should take their notions of love from the very men who prided  themselves on being bound by their own vows to know nothing about  it  they were very holy men  but still men as i take it  and do you not see that love is like  all spiritual things only to be understood by experienceby  loving  but is love spiritual  pardon me but what a question for one who believes that god is  love  but the divines tell us that the love of human beings is earthly  how did they know  they had never tried  oh miss lavington  cannot you see that in those barbarous and profligate ages of the  later empire it was impossible for men to discern the spiritual  beauty of marriage degraded as it had been by heathen brutality   do you not see that there must have been a continual tendency in the  minds of a celibate clergy to look with contempt almost with spite  on pleasures which were forbidden to them  another pause  it must be very delicious said argemone thoughtfully for any  one who believes it to think that marriage can last through  eternity  but then what becomes of entire love to god  how can  we part our hearts between him and his creatures  it is a sin then to love your sister or your friend  what a  low material view of love to fancy that you can cut it up into so  many pieces like a cake and give to one person one titbit and  another to another as the popish books would have you believe   love is like flamelight as many fresh flames at it as you will it  grows instead of diminishing by the dispersion  it is a beautiful imagination  but oh how miserable and tantalising a thought miss lavington  to those who know that a priceless spirit is near them which might  be one with theirs through all eternity like twin stars in one  common atmosphere for ever giving and receiving wisdom and might  beauty and bliss and yet are barred from their bliss by some  invisible adamantine wall against which they must beat themselves  to death like butterflies against the windowpane gazing and  longing and unable to guess why they are forbidden to enjoy  why did argemone withdraw her arm from his  he knew and he felt  that she was entrusted to him  he turned away from the subject  i wonder whether they are safe home by this time  i hope my father will not catch cold  how sad mr smith that he  will swear so  i do not like to say it and yet you must have heard  him too often yourself  it is hardly a sin with him now i think  he has become so  habituated to it that he attaches no meaning or notion whatsoever  to his own oaths  i have heard him do it with a smiling face to the  very beggar to whom he was giving halfacrown  we must not judge a  man of his school by the standard of our own day  let us hope so said argemone sadly  there was another pause  at a turn of the hill road the black  masses of beechwood opened and showed the priory lights twinkling  right below  strange that argemone felt sorry to find herself so  near home  we shall go to town next week said she and thenyou are going  to norway this summer are you not  no  i have learnt that my duty lies nearer home  what are you going to do  i wish this summer for the first time in my life to try and do  some goodto examine a little into the real condition of english  working men  i am afraid mr smith that i did not teach you that duty  oh you have taught me priceless things  you have taught me beauty  is the sacrament of heaven and love its gate that that which is  the most luscious is also the most pure  but i never spoke a word to you on such subjects  there are those miss lavington to whom a human face can speak  truths too deep for books  argemone was silent but she understood him  why did she not  withdraw her arm a second time  in a moment more the colonel hailed them from the dogcart and  behind him came the britschka with a relay of servants  they parted with a long lingering pressure of the hand which  haunted her young palm all night in dreams  argemone got into the  carriage lancelot jumped into the dogcart took the reins and  relieved his heart by galloping sandy up the hill and frightening  the returning coachman down one bank and his led horses up the  other  vogue la galere lancelot  i hope you have made good use of your  time  but lancelot spoke no word all the way home and wandered till dawn  in the woods around his cottage kissing the hand which argemones  palm had pressed    chapter viii  whither    some three months slipped awayright dreary months for lancelot  for the lavingtons went to badenbaden for the summer  the waters  were necessary for their health     how wonderful it is by the  bye that those german brunnen are never necessary for poor peoples  health    and they did not return till the end of august  so  lancelot buried himself up to the eyes in the conditionofthepoor  questionthat is in blue books red books sanitary reports mine  reports factory reports and came to the conclusion which is now  pretty generally entertained that something was the matterbut  what no man knew or if they knew thought proper to declare   hopeless and bewildered he left the books and wandered day after  day from farm to hamlet and from field to trampers tent in hopes  of finding out the secret for himself  what he saw of course i  must not say for if i did the reviewers would declare as usual  one and all that i copied out of the morning chronicle and the  fact that these pages ninetynine hundredths of them at least were  written two years before the morning chronicle began its invaluable  investigations would be contemptuously put aside as at once  impossible and arrogant  i shall therefore only say that he saw  what every one else has seen at least heard of and got tired of  hearingthough alas they have not got tired of seeing it and so  proceed with my story only mentioning therein certain particulars  which folks seem to me somewhat strangely to have generally  overlooked  but whatever lancelot saw or thought he saw i cannot say that it  brought him any nearer to a solution of the question and he at last  ended by a sulky acquiescence in sam wellers memorable dictum   who it is i cant say but all i can say is that somebody ought to  be wopped for this  but one day turning over as hopelessly as he was beginning to turn  over everything else a new work of mr carlyles he fell on some  such words as these  the beginning and the end of what is the matter with us in these  days isthat we have forgotten god  forgotten god  that was at least a defect of which blue books had  taken no note  and it was one which on the wholegranting for  the sake of argument any real living or practical existence to  that being might be a radical oneit brought him many hours of  thought that saying and when they were over he rose up and went  to findtregarva  yes he is the man  he is the only man with whom i have ever met  of whom i could be sure that independent of his own interest  without the allurements of respectability and decency of habit and  custom he believes in god  and he too is a poor man he has known  the struggles temptations sorrows of the poor  i will go to him  but as lancelot rose to find him there was put into his hand a  letter which kept him at home a while longernone other in fact  than the longexpected answer from luke   well my dear cousinyou may possibly have some logical ground  from which to deny popery if you deny all other religions with it  but how those who hold any received form of christianity whatsoever  can fairly side with you against rome i cannot see  i am sure i  have been sent to rome by them not drawn thither by jesuits  not  merely by their defects and inconsistencies not merely because they  go on taunting us and shrieking at us with the cry that we ought to  go to rome till we at last wearied out take them at their word  and do at their bidding the thing we used to shrink from with  terrornot this merely but the very doctrines we hold in common  with them have sent me to rome  for would these men have known of  them if rome had not been  the trinitythe atonementthe  inspiration of scripturea future statethat point on which the  present generation without a smattering of psychological science  without even the old belief in apparitions dogmatises so narrowly  and arrogantlywhat would they have known of them but for rome   and she says there are three realms in the future state     heaven hell and purgatory     what right have they to throw  away the latter and arbitrarily retain the two former  i am told  that scripture gives no warrant for a third state  she says that it  doesthat it teaches that implicitly as it teaches other the very  highest doctrines some hold the trinity itself     it may be  proved from scripture for it may be proved from the love and  justice of god revealed in scripture  the protestants dividein  theory that ismankind into two classes the righteous who are  destined to infinite bliss the wicked who are doomed to infinite  torment in which latter class to make their arbitrary division  exhaustive they put of course nine hundred and ninetynine out of  the thousand and doom to everlasting companionship with borgias and  cagliostros the gentle frivolous girl or the peevish boy who  would have shrunk in life with horror from the contact      well at least their hell is hellish enough    if it were but  just     but i lancelot i cannot believe it  i will not  believe it  i had a brother onceaffectionate simple generous  full of noble aspirationsbut without alas a thought of god  yielding in a hundred little points and some great ones to the  infernal temptations of a public school     he died at  seventeen  where is he now  lancelot where is he now  never for  a day has that thought left my mind for years  not in heavenfor  he has no right there protestants would say that as well as i     where thenlancelot not in that other place  i cannot i will  not believe it  for the sake of gods honour as well as of my own  sanity i will not believe it  there must be some third placesome  intermediate chance some door of hopesome purifying and redeeming  process beyond the grave     why not a purifying fire  ages of  that are surely punishment enoughand if there be a fire of hell  why not a fire of purgatory     after all the idea of purgatory  as a fire is only an opinion not a dogma of the church     but  if the gross flesh which has sinned is to be punished by the matter  which it has abused why may it not be purified by it  you may laugh if you will at both and say again as i have heard  you say ere now that the popular christian paradise and hell are  but a pagan olympus and tartarus as grossly material as mahomets  without the honest thoroughgoing sexuality which you thought made  his notion logical and consistent     well you may say that  but protestants cannot for their idea of heaven and ours is the  samewith this exception that theirs will contain but a thin band  of saved ones while ours will fill and grow to all eternity     i tell you lancelot it is just the very doctrines for which  england most curses rome and this very purgatory at the head of  them which constitute her strength and her allurement which appeal  to the reason the conscience the heart of men like me who have  revolted from the novel superstition which looks pitilessly on at  the fond memories of the brother the prayers of the orphan the  doubled desolation of the widow with its cold terrible assurance  there is no hope for thy loved and lost onesno hope but hell for  evermore  i do not expect to convert you  you have your metempsychosis and  your theories of progressive incarnation and your monads and your  spirits of the stars and flowers  i have not forgotten a certain  talk of ours over falk von mullers recollections of goethe and how  you materialists are often the most fantastic of theorists     i  do not expect i say to convert you  i only want to show you there  is no use trying to show the selfsatisfied pharisees of the popular  sectwhy in spite of all their curses men still go back to rome   lancelot read this and reread it and smiled but sadlyand the  more he read the stronger its arguments seemed to him and he  rejoiced thereat  for there is a bad pleasurehappy he who has not  felt itin a pitiless reductio ad absurdum which asks tauntingly  why do you not follow out your own conclusionsinstead of  thanking god that people do not follow them out and that their  hearts are sounder than their heads  was it with this feeling that  the fancy took possession of him to show the letter to tregarva  i  hope notperhaps he did not altogether wish to lead him into  temptation any more than i wish to lead my readers but only to  make him just as i wish to make them face manfully a real awful  question now racking the hearts of hundreds and see how they will  be able to answer the sophist fiendfor honestly such he iswhen  their time comes as come it will  at least he wanted to test at  once tregarvas knowledge and his logic  as for his faith alas  he had not so much reverence for it as to care what effect lukes  arguments might have there  the whole man quoth lancelot to  himself is a novel phenomenon and all phenomena however  magnificent are surely fair subjects for experiment  magendie may  have gone too far certainly in dissecting a live dogbut what  harm in my pulling the mane of a dead lion  so he showed the letter to tregarva as they were fishing together  one dayfor lancelot had been installed duly in the whitford trout  preservestregarva read it slowly asked shrewdly enough the  meaning of a word or two as he went on at last folded it up  deliberately and returned it to its owner with a deep sigh   lancelot said nothing for a few minutes but the giant seemed so  little inclined to open the conversation that he was forced at last  to ask him what he thought of it  it isnt a matter for thinking sir to my mindtheres a nice  fish on the feed there just overright that alder  hang the fish  why not a matter for thinking  to my mind sir a man may think a deal too much about many matters  that come in his way  what should he do with them then  mind his own business  pleasant for those whom they concernthats rather a coldblooded  speech for you tregarva  the cornishman looked up at him earnestly  his eyes were  glitteringwas it with tears  dont fancy i dont feel for the poor young gentlemangod help  himive been through it allor not through it thats to say  i  had a brother once as fine a young fellow as ever handled pick as  kindhearted as a woman and as honest as the sun in heavenbut he  would drink sirthat one temptation he never could stand it   and one day at the shafts mouth reaching after the kibblechain maybe he was in liquor maybe notthe lord knows but  i didnt know him again sir when we picked him up any more than  and the strong man shuddered from head to foot and beat  impatiently on the ground with his heavy heel as if to crush down  the rising horror  where is he sir  a long pause  do you think i didnt ask that sir for years and years after of  god and my own soul and heaven and earth and the things under the  earth too  for many a night did i go down that mine out of my  turn and sat for hours in that level watching and watching if  perhaps the spirit of him might haunt about and tell his poor  brother one word of newsone way or the otheranything would have  been a comfortbut the doubt i couldnt bear  and yet at last i  learnt to bear itand whats more i learnt not to care for it   its a bold wordtheres one who knows whether or not it is a true  one  good heavensand what then did you say to yourself  i said this siror rather one came as i was on my knees and  said it to mewhats done you cant mend  whats left you can   whatever has happened is gods concern now and none but his  do  you see that as far as you can no such thing ever happen again on  the face of his earth  and from that day sir i gave myself up to  that one thing and will until i die to save the poor young fellows  like myself who are left nowadays to the devil body and soul  just when they are in the prime of their power to work for god  ah said lancelotif poor lukes spirit were but as strong as  yours  i strong answered he with a sad smile and so you think sir   but its written and its truethe heart knoweth its own  bitterness  then you absolutely refuse to try to fancy yourhis present  state  yes sir because if i did fancy it that would be a certain sign i  didnt know it  if we cant conceive what god has prepared for  those that we know loved him how much less can we for them of whom  we dont know whether they loved him or not  well thought lancelot to himself i did not do so very wrong in  trusting your intellect to cut through a sophism  but what do you believe tregarva  i believe this sirand your cousin will believe the same if he  will only give up as i am sore afraid he will need to some day  sticking to arguments and doctrines about the lord and love and  trust the lord himself  i believe sir that the judge of all the  earth will do rightand whats right cant be wrong nor cruel  either else it would not be like him who loved us to the death  thats all i know and thats enough for me  to whom little is  given of him is little required  he that didnt know his masters  will will be beaten with few stripes and he that did know it as i  do will be beaten with many if he neglects itand that latter  not the former is my concern  well thought lancelot to himself this great heart has gone down  to the root of the matterthe right and wrong of it  he at least  has not forgotten god  well i would give up all the teleologies  and cosmogonies that i ever dreamt or read just to believe what he  believesheigho and welladaypaul hist  ill swear that was  an otter  i hope not sir im sure  i havent seen the spraint of one here  this two years  there againdont you see something move under that marl bank  tregarva watched a moment and then ran up to the spot and throwing  himself on his face on the edge leant over grappled somethingand  was instantly to lancelots astonishment grappled in his turn by a  rough lank white dog whose teeth however could not get through  the velveteen sleeve  ill give in keeper  ill give in  doant ye harm the dog hes  deaf as a post you knows  i wont harm him if you take him off and come up quietly  this mysterious conversation was carried on with a human head which  peeped above the water its arms supporting from beneath the  growling cursuch a visage as only wornout poachers or trampling  drovers or london chiffonniers carry pearshaped and retreating to  a narrow peak above while below the bleared cheeks and drooping  lips and peering purblind eyes perplexed hopeless defiant and  yet sneaking bespeak their share in the inheritance of the kingdom  of heavensavages without the resources of a savageslaves  without the protection of a masterto whom the cartwhip and the  riceswamp would be a change for the betterfor there at least is  food and shelter  slowly and distrustfully a dripping scarecrow of rags and bones rose  from his hidingplace in the water and then stopped suddenly and  seemed inclined to dash through the river but tregarva held him  fast  theres two on ye  thats a shame  ill surrender to no man but  you paul  hold off or ill set the dog on ye  its a gentleman fishing  he wont tellwill you sir  and he  turned to lancelot  have pity on the poor creature sir for gods  sakeit isnt often he gets it  i wont tell my man  ive not seen you doing any harm  come out  like a man and lets have a look at you  the creature crawled up the bank and stood abject and shivering  with the dog growling from between his legs  i was only looking for a kingfishers nest  indeed now i was  paul tregarva  dont lie you were setting nightlines  i saw a minnow lie on the  bank as i came up  dont lie i hate liars  well indeed thena man must live somehow  you dont seem to live by this trade my friend quoth lancelot  i cannot say it seems a prosperous business by the look of your  coat and trousers  that tim goddard stole all my clothes and no good may they do him  last time as i went to gaol i gave them him to kep and he went off  for a navvy meantime so there i am  if you will play with the dogs quoth tregarva you know what you  will be bit by  havent i warned you  of course you wont prosper   as you make your bed so you must lie in it  the lord cant be  expected to let those prosper that forget him  what mercy would it  be to you if he did let you prosper by setting snares all church time as you were last sunday instead of going to church  i say paul tregarva ive told you my mind about that afore  if i  dont do what i knows to be right and good already there aint no  use in me a damning myself all the deeper by going to church to hear  more  god help you quoth poor paul  now i say quoth crawy with the air of a man who took the whole  thing as a matter of course no more to be repined at than the rain  and windwhat be you a going to do with me this time  i do hope  you wont have me up to bench  taint a month now as im out o  prizzum along o they firtoppings and i should you see with a  look up and down and round at the gay haymeadows and the fleet  water and the soft gleaming clouds which to lancelot seemed most  pathetici should like to ha a spell o fresh air like afore i  goes in again  tregarva stood over him and looked down at him like some huge  stately bloodhound on a trembling mangy cur  good heavens  thought lancelot as his eye wandered from the sad steadfast dignity  of the one to the dogged helpless misery of the othercan those  two be really fellowcitizens fellowchristianseven animals of  the same species  hard to believe  true lancelot but to quote you against yourself bacon or rather  the instinct which taught bacon teaches you to discern the  invisible common law under the deceitful phenomena of sense  i must have those nightlines crawy quoth tregarva at length  then i must starve  you might ever so well take away the dog   theyre the life of me  theyre the death of you  why dont you go and work instead of  idling about stealing trout  be you a laughing at a poor fellow in his trouble  whod gie me a  days work id like to know  its twenty year too late for that  lancelot stood listening  yes that wretch too was a man and a  brotherat least so books used to say  time was when he had  looked on a poacher as a pariah hostem humani generisand only  deplored that the law forbade him to shoot them down like cats and  otters but he had begun to change his mind  he had learnt and learnt rightly the selfindulgence the danger  the cruelty of indiscriminate alms  it looked well enough in  theory on paper  butbutbut thought lancelot in practice  one cant help feeling a little of that uneconomic feeling called  pity  no doubt the fellow has committed an unpardonable sin in  daring to come into the world when there was no call for him one  used to think certainly that childrens opinions were not  consulted on such points before they were born and that therefore  it might be hard to visit the sins of the fathers on the children  even though the labourmarket were a little overstockedmais nous  avons change tout cela like m jourdains doctors  no doubt too  the fellow might have got work if he had chosenin kamschatka or  the cannibal islands for the political economists have proved  beyond a doubt that there is work somewhere or other for every one  who chooses to work  but as unfortunately society has neglected  to inform him of the state of the cannibal island labourmarket or  to pay his passage thither when informed thereof he has had to  choose in the somewhat limited labourfield of the whitford priors  union whose workhouse is already every winter filled with abler bodied men than he between starvationand this  well as for  employing him one would have thought that there was a little work  waiting to be done in those five miles of heather and snipebog  which i used to tramp over last winterbut those it seems are  still on the margin of cultivation and not a remunerative  investmentthat is to capitalists  i wonder if any one had made  crawy a present of ten acres of them when he came of age and  commanded him to till that or be hanged whether he would not have  found it a profitable investment  but bygones are bygones and  there he is and the moors thanks to the rights of propertyin  this case the rights of the dog in the mangerbelong to poor old  lavingtonthat is the game and timber on them and neither crawy  nor any one else can touch them  what can i do for him  convert  him to what  for the next life even tregarvas talisman seems to  fail  and for this lifeperhaps if he had had a few more practical  proofs of a divine justice and governmentthat kingdom of heaven  of which luke talks in the sensible bodily matters which he does  appreciate he might not be so unwilling to trust to it for the  invisible spiritual matters which he does not appreciate  at all  events one has but one chance of winning him and that is through  those five senses which he has left  what if he does spend the  money in gross animal enjoyment  what will the amount of it be  compared with the animal enjoyments which my station allows me daily  without reproach  a little more bacona little more beera little  more tobacco at all events they will be more important to him than  a pair of new boots or an extra box of cigars to meand lancelot  put his hand in his pocket and pulled out a sovereign  no doubt he  was a great goose but if you can answer his arguments reader i  cannot  look herewhat are your nightlines worth  a matter of seven shilling aint they now paul tregarva  i should suppose they are  then do you give me the lines one and all and theres a sovereign  for youno i cant trust you with it all at once  ill give it  to tregarva and he shall allow you four shillings a week as long as  it lasts if youll promise to keep off squire lavingtons river  it was pathetic and yet disgusting to see the abject joy of the  poor creature  well thought lancelot if he deserves to be  wretched so do iwhy therefore if we are one as bad as the  other should i not make his wretchedness a little less for the time  being  i waint come anear the water  you trust mei minds them as is  kind to meand a thought seemed suddenly to lighten up his dull  intelligence  i say paul hark you here  i see that bantam into d    tother  day  what is he down already  with a dogcart he and another of his pals and i see em take out  a silk flue i did  so says i you maunt be trying that ere along  o the whitford trout they kepers is out o nights so sure as the  moon  you didnt know that  lying again  no but i sayed it in course  i didnt want they arobbing here  so i think they worked mainly up squire vauriens water  i wish id caught them here quoth tregarva grimly enough  though i dont think they came or i should have seen the track on  the banks  but he sayed like as how he should be down here again about  pheasant shooting  trust him for it  let us know now if you see him  and that i will too  i wouldnt save a feather for that ere old  rascal harry  if the devil dont have he i dont see no use in  keeping no devil  but i minds them as has mercy on me though my  name is crawy  ay he added bitterly taint so many kind turns  as i gets in this life that i can afford to forget eer a one   and he sneaked off with the deaf dog at his heels  how did that fellow get his name tregarva  oh most of them have nicknames round here  some of them hardly  know their own real names sir  a sure sign of low  civilisation thought lancelot  but he got his a foolish way  and yet it was the ruin of him  when he was a boy of fifteen he  got miching away in churchtime as boys will and took off his  clothes to get in somewhere here in this very river groping in the  banks after crawfish and as the devilfor i can think no less would have it a big one catches hold of him by the fingers with one  claw and a root with the other and holds him there till squire  lavington comes out to take his walk after church and there he  caught the boy and gave him a thrashing there and then naked as he  stood  and the story got wind and all the chaps round called him  crawy ever afterwards and the poor fellow got quite reckless from  that day and never looked any one in the face again and being  ashamed of himself you see sir was never ashamed of anything  elseand there he is  that dogs his only friend and gets a  livelihood for them both  its growing old now and when it dies  hell starve  wellthe world has no right to blame him for not doing his duty  till it has done its own by him a little better  but the world will sir because it hates its duty and cries all  day long like cain am i my brothers keeper  do you think it knows its duty  i have found it easy enough to see  that something is diseased tregarva but to find the medicine  first and to administer it afterwards is a very different matter  welli suppose the world will never be mended till the day of  judgment  in plain english not mended till it is destroyed  hopeful for the  poor world  i should fancy if i believed that that the devil in  the old historywhich you believehad had the best of it with a  vengeance when he brought sin into the world and ruined it  i  dare not believe that  how dare you who say that god sent his son  into the world to defeat the devil  tregarva was silent a while  learning and the gospel together ought to do something sir  towards mending it  one would think so  but the prophecies are  against that  as folks happen to read them just now  a hundred years hence they  may be finding the very opposite meaning in them  come tregarva suppose i teach you a little of the learning and you teach me a  little of the gospeldo you think we two could mend the world  between us or even mend whitford priors  god knows sir said tregarva        tregarva said lancelot as they were landing the next trout  where will that crawy go when he dies  god knows sir said tregarva        lancelot went thoughtful home and sat downnot to answer lukes  letterfor he knew no answer but tregarvas and that alas he  could not give for he did not believe it but only longed to  believe it  so he turned off the subject by a question  you speak of yourself as being already a member of the romish  communion  how is this  have you given up your curacy  have you  told your father  i fancy that if you had done so i must have heard  of it ere now  i entreat you to tell me the state of the case for  heathen as i am i am still an englishman and there are certain old  superstitions still lingering among uswhencesoever we may have got  them firstabout truth and common honestyyou understand me  do not be angry  but there is a prejudice against the truthfulness  of romish priests and romish convertsits no affair of mine  i  see quite enough protestant rogues and liars to prevent my having  any pleasure in proving romanists or any other persons rogues and  liars also  but i amif not fond of youat least sufficiently  fond to be anxious for your good name  you used to be an open hearted fellow enough  do prove to the world that coelum non  animum mutant qui trans mare currunt    chapter ix  harry verney hears his last shot fired    the day after the lavingtons return when lancelot walked up to the  priory with a fluttering heart to inquire after all parties and see  one he found the squire in a great state of excitement  a large gang of poachers who had come down from london by rail had  been devastating all the covers round to stock the london markets  by the first of october and intended as tregarva had discovered  to pay mr lavingtons preserves a visit that night  they didnt  care for country justices not they  werent all their fines paid  by highly respectable gamedealers at the west end  they owned  three dogcarts among them a parcel by railway would bring them  down bail to any amount they tossed their money away at the public houses like gentlemen thanks to the game laws their profits ran  high and when they had swept the country pretty clean of game why  they would just finish off the season by a stray highway robbery or  two and vanish into babylon and their native night  such was harry verneys information as he strutted about the  courtyard waiting for the squires orders  but theyve put their nose into a furzebush muster smith they  have  weve got our possecommontaturs fourteen men sir asll  play the whole vale to cricket and whap them and every onell  fight for theyre half poachers themselves you see and harry  winked and chuckled and they cant abide no interlopers to come  down and take the sport out of their mouths  but are you sure theyll come tonight  that ere paul says so  wonder how he found outsome of his  underhand colloguing methodist ways ill warrant  i seed him  preaching to that ere crawy three or four times when he ought to  have hauled him up  he consorts with them poachers sir uncommon   i hope he bent one himself thats all  nonsense harry  oh  eh  dont say old harry dont know nothing thats all  ive  fixed his flint anyhow  ah  smith shouted the squire out of his study window with a  cheerful and appropriate oath  the very man i wanted to see  you  must lead these keepers for me tonight  they always fight better  with a gentleman among them  breeding tells you knowbreeding  tells  lancelot felt a strong disgust at the occupation but he was under  too many obligations to the squire to refuse  ay i knew you were game said the old man  and youll find it  capital fun  i used to think it so i know when i was young  many  a shindy have i had here in my uncles time under the very windows  before the chase was disparked when the fellows used to come down  after the deer  just then lancelot turned and saw argemone standing close to him   he almost sprang towards herand retreated for he saw that she had  overheard the conversation between him and her father  what  mr smith said she in a tone in which tenderness and  contempt pity and affected carelessness were strangely mingled   so you are going to turn gamekeeper tonight  lancelot was blundering out something when the squire interposed  let her alone smith  women will be tenderhearted you know   quite rightbut they dont understand these things  they fight  with their tongues and we with our fists and then they fancy their  weapons dont hurtha ha ha  mr smith said argemone in a low determined voice if you have  promised my father to go on this horrid businessgo  but promise  me too that you will only look on or i will never  argemone had not time to finish her sentence before lancelot had  promised seven times over and meant to keep his promise as we all  do  about ten oclock that evening lancelot and tregarva were walking  stealthily up a ride in one of the homecovers at the head of some  fifteen fine young fellows keepers grooms and not extempore  watchers whom old harry was marshalling and tutoring with  exhortations as many and as animated as if their ambition was  mourir pour la patrie  how does this sort of work suit you tregarva for i dont like it  at all  the fightings all very well but its a poor cause  oh sir i have no mercy on these londoners  if it was these poor  halfstarved labourers that snare the same hares that have been  eating up their gardenstuff all the week i cant touch them sir  and thats truth but these ruffiansand yet sir wouldnt it be  better for the parsons to preach to them than for the keepers to  break their heads  oh said lancelot the parsons say all to them that they can  tregarva shook his head  i doubt that sir  but no doubt theres a great change for the  better in the parsons  i remember the time sir that there wasnt  an earnest clergyman in the vale and now every other man you meet  is trying to do his best  but those london parsons sir whats the  matter with them  for all their societies and their schools the  devil seems to keep ahead of them sadly  i doubt they havent found  the right fly yet for publicans and sinners to rise at  a distant shot in the cover  there they are sir  i thought that crawy wouldnt lead me false  when i let him off  well fight away then and win  i have promised miss lavington  not to lift a hand in the business  then youre a lucky man sir  but the squires game is his own  and we must do our duty by our master  there was a rustle in the bushes and a tramp of feet on the turf  there they are sir sure enough  the lord keep us from murder  this night  and tregarva pulled off his neckcloth and shook his  huge limbs as if to feel that they were all in their places in a  way that augured ill for the man who came across him  they turned the corner of a ride and in an instant found  themselves face to face with five or six armed men with blackened  faces who without speaking a word dashed at them and the fight  began reinforcements came up on each side and the engagement  became general   the forestlaws were sharp and stern    the forest blood was keen they lashed together for life and death    beneath the hollies green  the metal good and the walnutwood    did soon in splinters flee they tossed the orts to south and north    and grappled knee to knee  they wrestled up they wrestled down    they wrestled still and sore the herbage sweet beneath their feet    was stamped to mud and gore   and all the while the broad still moon stared down on them grim and  cold as if with a saturnine sneer at the whole humbug and the  silly birds about whom all this butchery went on slept quietly over  their heads every one with his head under his wing  oh if  pheasants had but understanding how they would split their sides  with chuckling and crowing at the follies which civilised christian  men perpetrate for their precious sake  had i the pen of homer though they say he never used one or even  that of the worthy who wasted precious years in writing a homer  burlesqued what heroic exploits might not i immortalise  in every  stupid serf and cunning ruffian there there was a heart as brave as  ajaxs own but then they fought with sticks instead of lances and  hammered away on fustian jackets instead of brazen shields and  therefore poor fellows they were beneath the dignity of poetry  whatever that may mean  if one of your squeamish dignityof poetry critics had just had his head among the gunstocks for five  minutes that night he would have found it grim tragic earnest  enough not without a touch of fun though here and there  lancelot leant against a tree and watched the riot with folded arms  mindful of his promise to argemone and envied tregarva as he hurled  his assailants right and left with immense strength and led the van  of battle royally  little would argemone have valued the real proof  of love which he was giving her as he looked on sulkily while his  fingers tingled with longing to be up and doing  strangethat mere  lust of fighting common to man and animals whose traces even the  lamb and the civilised child evince in their mockfights the  earliest and most natural form of play  is it after all the one  human propensity which is utterly evil incapable of being turned to  any righteous use  gross and animal no doubt it is but not the  less really pleasant as every irishman and many an englishman knows  well enough  a curious instance of this by the bye occurred in  paris during the february revolution  a fat english coachman went  out from mere curiosity to see the fighting  as he stood and  watched a new passion crept over him he grew madder and madder as  the bullets whistled past him at last when men began to drop by  his side he could stand it no longer seized a musket and rushed  in careless which side he took   to drink delight of battle with his peers   he was not heard of for a day or two and then they found him stiff  and cold lying on his face across a barricade with a bullet  through his heart  sedentary persons may call him a sinful fool   be it so  homo sum  humani nihil a me alienum puto  lancelot i verily believe would have kept his promise though he  saw that the keepers gave ground finding cockney skill too much for  their clumsy strength but at last harry verney who had been  fighting as venomously as a wild cat and had been once before saved  from a broken skull by tregarva rolled over at his very feet with a  couple of poachers on him  you wont see an old man murdered mr smith cried he  imploringly  lancelot tore the ruffians off the old man right and left  one of  them struck him he returned the blow and in an instant promises  and argemone philosophy and antigamelaw prejudices were swept  out of his head and he went as the old romances say hurling  into the midst of the press as mere a wild animal for the moment  as angry bull or boar  an instant afterwards though he burst out  laughing in spite of himself as the battersea bantam who had  been ineffectually dancing round tregarva like a gamecock spurring  at a bull turned off with a voice of ineffable disgust  that big coves a yokel tant creditable to waste science on him   youre my man if you please sirand the little wiry lump of  courage and conceit rascality and good humour flew at lancelot  who was twice his size with a heroism worthy of a better cause  as respectable papers when they are not too frightened say of the  french        do you want any more asked lancelot  quite a pleasure sir to meet a scientific genlman  beg your  pardon sir stay a moment while i wipes my face  now sir time  if you please  alas for the little man in another moment he tumbled over and lay  senselesslancelot thought he had killed him  the gang saw their  champion fall gave ground and limped off leaving three of their  party groaning on the ground beside as many whitford men  as it was in the beginning so is it to be to the end my foolish  brothers  from the poacher to the prime ministerwearying  yourselves for very vanity  the soldier is not the only man in  england who is fool enough to be shot at for a shilling a day  but while all the rest were busy picking up the wounded men and  securing the prisoners harry verney alone held on and as the  poachers retreated slowly up the ride he followed them peering  into the gloom as if in hopes of recognising some old enemy  stand back harry verney we know you and wed be loth to harm an  old man cried a voice out of the darkness  eh  do you think old harryd turn back when he was once on the  track of ye  you softfisted gindrinking counterskipping  cockney rascals that fancy youre to carry the county before you  because you get your fines paid by londontradesmen  eh  what do  you take old harry for  go back you old fool and a volley of oaths followed  if you  follow us well fire at you as sure as the moons in heaven  fire away then  ill follow you to and the old man paced  stealthily but firmly up to them  tregarva saw his danger and sprang forward but it was too late  what you will have it then  a sharp crack followeda bright flash in the darknessevery white  birchstem and jagged oakleaf shone out for a moment as bright as  dayand in front of the glare lancelot saw the old man throw his  arms wildly upward fall forward and disappear on the dark ground  youve done it off with you  and the rascals rushed off up the  ride  in a moment tregarva was by the old mans side and lifted him  tenderly up  theyve done for me paul  old harrys got his gruel  hes heard  his last shot fired  i knowed it ud come to this and i said it   eh  didnt i now paul  and as the old man spoke the workings  of his lungs pumped great jets of blood out over the still heather flowers as they slept in the moonshine and dabbled them with  smoking gore  here men shouted the colonel up with him at once and home   here put a brace of your guns together muzzle and lock  help him  to sit on them lancelot  there harry put your arms round their  necks  tregarva hold him up behind  now then men left legs  foremostkeep stepmarch  and they moved off towards the priory  you seem to know everything colonel said lancelot  the colonel did not answer for a moment  lancelot i learnt this dodge from the only friend i ever had in  the world or ever shall have and a week after i marched him home  to his deathbed in this very way  paulpaul tregarva whispered old harry put your head down  here  wipe my mouth theres a man its wet uncommon wet  it  was his own lifeblood  ive been a beast to you paul  ive  hated you and envied you and tried to ruin you  and now youve  saved my life once this night and here you be anursing of me as my  own son might do if he was here poor fellow  ive ruined you  paul the lord forgive me  pray pray said paul and he will forgive you  he is all mercy   he pardoned the thief on the cross  no paul no thiefnot so bad as that i hope anyhow never  touched a feather of the squires  but you dropped a song paul a  bit of writing  paul turned pale  andthe lord forgive mei put it in the squires flybook  the lord forgive you  amen said paul solemnly  wearily and slowly they stepped on towards the old mans cottage  a  messenger had gone on before and in a few minutes the squire mrs  lavington and the girls were round the bed of their old retainer  they sent off right and left for the doctor and the vicar the  squire was in a frenzy of rage and grief  dont take on master dont take on said old harry as he lay  while the colonel and honoria in vain endeavoured to stanch the  wound  i knowed it would be so sooner or later tis all in the  way of business  they havent carried off a bird squire not a  bird we was too many for emeh paul eh  where is that cursed doctor said the squire  save him colonel  save him and ill give you  alas the charge of shot at a few feet distance had entered like a  bullet tearing a great ragged holethere was no hope and the  colonel knew it but he said nothing  the second keeper sighed argemone who has been killed here   oh mr smith must this be  is gods blessing on all this  lancelot said nothing  the old man lighted up at argemones voice  theres the beauty theres the pride of whitford  and sweet miss  honor tooso kind to nurse a poor old man  but she never would  let him teach her to catch perch would she  she was always too  tenderhearted  ah squire when were dead and gonedead and  gonesquire theyll be the pride of whitford still  and theyll  keep up the old placewont you my darlings  and the old name  too  for you know there must always be a lavington in whitford  priors till the nuns pool runs up to ashy down  and a curse upon the lavingtons sighed argemone to herself in an  undertone  lancelot heard what she said  the vicar entered but he was too late  the old mans strength was  failing and his mind began to wander  windy he murmured to himself windy dark and windybirds wont  lienot old harrys fault  how black it grows  we must be gone by  nightfall squire  wheres that young dog gone  arter the larks  the brute  old squire lavington sobbed like a child  you will soon be home my man said the vicar  remember that you  have a saviour in heaven  cast yourself on his mercy  harry shook his head  very good words very kindvery heavy gamebag though  never get  home never any more at all  wheres my boy tom to carry it  send  for my boy tom  he was always a good boy till he got along with  them poachers  listen he said listen  theres bells aringingringing in my  head  come you here paul tregarva  he pulled tregarvas face down to his own and whispered  thems the bells aringing for miss honors wedding  paul started and drew back  harry chuckled and grinned for a moment  in his old foxy peering way and then wandered off again  whats that thumping and roaring  alas it was the failing  pulsation of his own heart  its the weir the weirawashing me  awaythundering over mesquire im drowningdrowning and  choking  oh lord how deep  now its running quieternow i can  breathe againswift and oilyrunning on running on down to the  sea  see how the grayling sparkle  theres a pike  taint my  fault squire so help medont swear now squire old men and  dying maunt swear squire  how steady the river runs down  lower  and slowerlower and slower  now its quite stillstillstill  his voice sank awayhe was dead  no once more the light flashed up in the socket  he sprang upright  in the bed and held out his withered paw with a kind of wild  majesty as he shouted  there aint such a head of hares on any manor in the county  and  thems the last words of harry verney  he fell backshuddereda rattle in his throatanotherand all  was over    chapter x  murder will out and love too    argemone need never have known of lancelots share in the poaching  affray but he dared not conceal anything from her  and so he  boldly went up the next day to the priory not to beg pardon but to  justify himself and succeeded  and before long he found himself  fairly installed as her pupil nominally in spiritual matters but  really in subjects of which she little dreamed  every day he came to read and talk with her and whatever objections  mrs lavington expressed were silenced by argemone  she would have  it so and her mother neither dared nor knew how to control her   the daughter had utterly outread and outthought her less educated  parent who was clinging in honest bigotry to the old forms while  argemone was wandering forth over the chaos of the strange new age a poor homeless noahs dove seeking rest for the sole of her foot  and finding none  and now all motherly influence and sympathy had  vanished and mrs lavington in fear and wonder let her daughter  go her own way  she could not have done better perhaps for  providence had found for argemone a better guide than her mother  could have done and her new pupil was rapidly becoming her teacher   she was matched for the first time with a man who was her own  equal in intellect and knowledge and she felt how real was that  sexual difference which she had been accustomed to consider as an  insolent calumny against woman  proudly and indignantly she  struggled against the conviction but in vain  again and again she  argued with him and was vanquishedor at least what is far  better made to see how many different sides there are to every  question  all appeals to authority he answered with a contemptuous  smile  the best authorities he used to say  on what question  do not the best authorities flatly contradict each other  and why   because every man believes just what it suits him to believe  dont  fancy that men reason themselves into convictions the prejudices  and feelings of their hearts give them some idea or theory and then  they find facts at their leisure to prove their theory true  every  man sees facts through narrow spectacles red or green or blue as  his nation or his temperament colours them  and he is quite right  only he must allow us the liberty of having our spectacles too   authority is only good for proving facts  we must draw our own  conclusions  and argemone began to suspect that he was rightat  least to see that her opinions were mere hearsays picked up at her  own will and fancy while his were living dailygrowing ideas  her  mind was beside his as the vase of cut flowers by the side of the  rugged tree whose roots are feeding deep in the mother earth  in  him she first learnt how one great truth received into the depths of  the soul germinates there and bears fruit a thousandfold  explaining and connecting and glorifying innumerable things  apparently the most unlike and insignificant and daily she became a  more reverent listener and gave herself up half against her will  and conscience to the guidance of a man whom she knew to be her  inferior in morals and in orthodoxy  she had worshipped intellect  and now it had become her tyrant and she was ready to give up every  belief which she once had prized to flutter like a moth round its  fascinating brilliance  who can blame her poor girl  for lancelots humility was even more  irresistible than his eloquence  he assumed no superiority  he  demanded her assent to truths not because they were his opinions  but simply for the truths sake and on all points which touched the  heart he looked up to her as infallible and inspired  in questions  of morality of taste of feeling he listened not as a lover to his  mistress but rather as a baby to its mother and thus half  unconsciously to himself he taught her where her true kingdom lay that the heart and not the brain enshrines the priceless pearl of  womanhood the oracular jewel the urim and thummim before which  gross man can only inquire and adore  and in the meantime a change was passing upon lancelot  his  morbid vanitythat brawlbegotten child of struggling selfconceit  and selfdisgustwas vanishing away and as mr tennyson says in  one of those priceless idyls of his before which the shade of  theocritus must hide his diminished head   he was altered and began    to move about the house with joy and with the certain step of man   he had at last found one person who could appreciate him  and in  deliberate confidence he set to work to conquer her and make her  his own  it was a traitorous return but a very natural one  and  she sweet creature walked straight into the pleasant snare  utterly blind because she fancied that she saw clearly  in the  pride of her mysticism she had fancied herself above so commonplace  a passion as love  it was a curious feature of lower humanity  which she might investigate and analyse harmlessly as a cold  scientific spectator and in her mingled pride and purity she used  to indulge lancelot in metaphysical disquisitions about love and  beauty like that first one in their walk home from minchampstead  from which a less celestially innocent soul would have shrunk  she  thought forsooth as the old proverb says that she could deal in  honey without putting her hand to her mouth  but lancelot knew  better and marked her for his own  and daily his selfconfidence  and sense of rightful power developed and with them paradoxical as  it may seem the bitterest selfabasement  the contact of her  stainless innocence the growing certainty that the destiny of that  innocence was irrevocably bound up with his own made him shrink  from her whenever he remembered his own guilty career  to remember  that there were passages in it which she must never knowthat she  would cast him from her with abhorrence if she once really  understood their vileness  to think that amid all the closest  bonds of love there must for ever be an awful silent gulf in the  past of which they must never speakthat she would bring to him  what he could never never bring to herthe thought was  unbearable  and as hideous recollections used to rise before him  devilish caricatures of his former self mopping and mowing at him  in his dreams he would start from his lonely bed and pace the room  for hours or saddle his horse and ride all night long aimlessly  through the awful woods vainly trying to escape himself  how  gladly at those moments he would have welcomed centuries of a  material hell to escape from the more awful spiritual hell within  himto buy back that pearl of innocence which he had cast  recklessly to be trampled under the feet of his own swinish  passions  but no that which was done could never be undone never to all eternity  and more than once as he wandered  restlessly from one room to another the barrels of his pistols  seemed to glitter with a cold devilish smile and call to him  come to us and with one touch of your finger send that bursting  spirit which throbs against your brow to flit forth free and  nevermore to defile her purity by your presence  but no again  a voice within seemed to command him to go on and  claim her and win her spite of his own vileness  and in after  years slowly and in fear and trembling he knew it for the voice  of god who had been leading him to become worthy of her through  that bitter shame of his own unworthiness  as one higher than them would have it she took a fancy to read  homer in the original and lancelot could do no less than offer his  services as translator  she would prepare for him portions of the  odyssey and every day that he came up to the priory he used to  comment on it to her and so for many a week in the dark wainscoted  library and in the clipt yewalleys of the old gardens and under  the brown autumn trees they quarried together in that unexhausted  mine among the records of the rich titanyouth of man  and step by  step lancelot opened to her the everlasting significance of the  poem the unconscious purity which lingers in it like the last rays  of the paradise dawn its sense of the dignity of man as man the  religious reverence with which it speaks of all human ties human  strength and beautyay even of merely animal human appetites as  godgiven and godlike symbols  she could not but listen and admire  when he introduced her to the sheer paganism of schillers gods of  greece for on this subject he was more eloquent than on any  he  had gradually in fact as we have seen dropped all faith in  anything but nature the slightest fact about a bone or a weed was  more important to him than all the books of divinity which argemone  lent himto be laid by unread  what do you believe in she asked him one day sadly  in this he said stamping his foot on the ground  in the earth  i stand on and the things i see walking and growing on it  there  may be something beside itwhat you call a spiritual world  but if  he who made me intended me to think of spirit first he would have  let me see it first  but as he has given me material senses and  put me in a material world i take it as a fair hint that i am meant  to use those senses first whatever may come after  i may be  intended to understand the unseen world but if so it must be as i  suspect by understanding the visible one  and there are enough  wonders there to occupy me for some time to come  but the bible argemone had given up long ago wasting words about  the church  my only bible as yet is bacon  i know that he is right whoever is  wrong  if that hebrew bible is to be believed by me it must agree  with what i know already from science  what was to be done with so intractable a heretic  call him an  infidel and a materialist of course and cast him off with horror   but argemone was beginning to find out that when people are really  in earnest it may be better sometimes to leave gods methods of  educating them alone instead of calling the poor honest seekers  hard names which the speakers themselves dont understand  but words would fail sometimes and in default of them lancelot had  recourse to drawings and manifested in them a talent for thinking  in visible forms which put the climax to all argemones wonder  a  single profile even a mere mathematical figure would in his  hands become the illustration of a spiritual truth  and in time  every fresh lesson on the odyssey was accompanied by its  illustrationsome bold and simple outline drawing  in argemones  eyes the sketches were immaculate and inspired for their chief  almost their only fault was just those mere anatomical slips which  a woman would hardly perceive provided the forms were generally  graceful and bold  one day his fancy attempted a bolder flight  he brought a large  penandink drawing and laying it silently on the table before her  fixed his eyes intensely on her face  the sketch was labelled the  triumph of woman  in the foreground to the right and left were  scattered groups of men in the dresses and insignia of every period  and occupation  the distance showed in a few bold outlines a  dreary desert broken by alpine ridges and furrowed here and there  by a wandering watercourse  long shadows pointed to the halfrisen  sun whose disc was climbing above the waste horizon  and in front  of the sun down the path of the morning beams came woman clothed  only in the armour of her own loveliness  her bearing was stately  and yet modest in her face pensive tenderness seemed wedded with  earnest joy  in her right hand lay a cross the emblem of self sacrifice  her path across the desert was marked by the flowers  which sprang up beneath her steps the wild gazelle stept forward  trustingly to lick her hand a single wandering butterfly fluttered  round her head  as the group one by one caught sight of her a  human tenderness and intelligence seemed to light up every face   the scholar dropt his book the miser his gold the savage his  weapons even in the visage of the halfslumbering sot some nobler  recollection seemed wistfully to struggle into life  the artist  caught up his pencil the poet his lyre with eyes that beamed forth  sudden inspiration  the sage whose broad brow rose above the group  like some torrent furrowed alp scathed with all the temptations and  all the sorrows of his race watched with a thoughtful smile that  preacher more mighty than himself  a youth decked out in the most  fantastic fopperies of the middle age stood with clasped hands and  brimming eyes as remorse and pleasure struggled in his face and as  he looked the fierce sensual features seemed to melt and his flesh  came again to him like the flesh of a little child  the slave  forgot his fetters little children clapped their hands and the  toilworn stunted savage woman sprung forward to kneel at her  feet and see herself transfigured in that new and divine ideal of  her sex  descriptions of drawings are clumsy things at best the reader must  fill up the sketch for himself by the eye of faith  entranced in wonder and pleasure argemone let her eyes wander over  the drawing  and her feelings for lancelot amounted almost to  worship as she apprehended the harmonious unity of the manifold  conceptionthe rugged boldness of the groups in front the soft  grandeur of the figure which was the lodestar of all their emotions the virginal purity of the whole  and when she fancied that she  traced in those bland aquiline lineaments and in the crisp ringlets  which floated like a cloud down to the knees of the figure some  traces of her own likeness a dream of a new destiny flitted before  hershe blushed to her very neck and as she bent her face over  the drawing and gazed her whole soul seemed to rise into her eyes  and a single tear dropped upon the paper  she laid her hand over  it and then turned hastily away  you do not like it  i have been too boldsaid lancelot  fearfully  oh no no  it is so beautifulso full of deep wisdom  butbut you may leave it  lancelot slipped silently out of the room he hardly knew why and  when he was gone argemone caught up the drawing pressed it to her  bosom covered it with kisses and hid it as too precious for any  eyes but her own in the farthest corner of her secretaire  and yet she fancied that she was not in love  the vicar saw the growth of this intimacy with a fastlengthening  face for it was very evident that argemone could not serve two  masters so utterly contradictory as himself and lancelot and that  either the lover or the fatherconfessor must speedily resign  office  the vicar had had great disadvantages by the bye in  fulfilling the latter function for his visits at the priory had  been all but forbidden and argemones spiritual state had been  directed by means of a secret correspondencea method which some  clergymen and some young ladies too have discovered in the last  few years to be quite consistent with moral delicacy and filial  obedience  john bull like a stupid fellow as he is has still his  doubts upon the point but he should remember that though st paul  tells women when they want advice to ask their husbands at home yet  if the poor woman has no husband or as often happens her  husbands advice is unpleasant to whom is she to go but to the next  best substitute her spiritual cicisbeo or favourite clergyman  in  sad earnest neither husband nor parent deserves pity in the immense  majority of such cases  woman will have guidance  it is her  delight and glory to be led and if her husband or her parents will  not meet the cravings of her intellect she must go elsewhere to  find a teacher and run into the wildest extravagances of private  judgment in the very hope of getting rid of it just as poor  argemone had been led to do  and indeed she had of late wandered into very strange paths   would to god they were as uncommon as strange  both she and the  vicar had a great wish that she should lead a devoted life but  then they both disdained to use common means for their object  the  good old english plan of district visiting by which ladies can have  mercy on the bodies and souls of those below them without casting  off the holy discipline which a home even the most ungenial alone  supplies savoured too much of mere protestantism  it might be  gods plan for christianising england just now but that was no  reason alas for its being their plan  they wanted something more  catholic more in accordance with church principles for indeed  is it not the business of the church to correct the errors of  providence and what they sought they found at once in a certain  favourite establishment of the vicars a churchofengland  beguinage or quasiprotestant nunnery which he fostered in a  neighbouring city and went thither on all high tides to confess the  young ladies who were in all things nuns but bound by no vows  except of course such as they might choose to make for themselves  in private  here they laboured among the lowest haunts of misery and sin  piously and selfdenyingly enough sweet souls in hope of the  peculiar crown and a higher place in heaven than the relations  whom they had left behind them in the world and unshackled by the  interference of parents and other such merely fleshly  relationships which as they cannot have been instituted by god  merely to be trampled under foot on the path to holiness and cannot  well have instituted themselves unless after all the materialists  are right and this world does grind of itself except when its  maker happens to interfere once every thousand years must needs  have been instituted by the devil  and so more than one girl in  that nunnery and out of it too believed in her inmost heart  though her catholic principles by a happy inconsistency forbade  her to say so  in a moment of excitement fascinated by the romance of the notion  argemone had proposed to her mother to allow her to enter this  beguinage and called in the vicar as advocate which produced a  correspondence between him and mrs lavington stormy on her side  provokingly calm on his  and when the poor lady tired of raging  had descended to an affecting appeal to his human sympathies  entreating him to spare a mothers feelings he had answered with  the same impassive fanaticism that he was surprised at her putting  a mothers selfish feelings in competition with the sanctity of her  child and that had his own daughter shown such a desire for a  higher vocation he should have esteemed it the very highest  honour to which mrs lavington answered naively enough that it  depended very much on what his daughter was likeso he was all  but forbidden the house  nevertheless he contrived by means of  this same secret correspondence to keep alive in argemones mind  the longing to turn nun and fancied honestly that he was doing god  service while he was pampering the poor girls lust for singularity  and selfglorification  but lately argemones letters had become less frequent and less  confiding and the vicar who well knew the reason had resolved to  bring the matter to a crisis  so he wrote earnestly and peremptorily to his pupil urging her  with all his subtle and refined eloquence to make a final appeal to  her mother and if that failed to act as her conscience should  direct her and enclosed an answer from the superior of the  convent to a letter which argemone had in a mad moment asked him to  write  the superiors letter spoke of argemones joining her as a  settled matter and of her room as ready for her while it lauded to  the skies the peaceful activity and usefulness of the establishment   this letter troubled argemone exceedingly  she had never before  been compelled to face her own feelings either about the nunnery or  about lancelot  she had taken up the fancy of becoming a sister of  charity not as honoria might have done from genuine love of the  poor but from a sense of duty  almsgiving and visiting the sick  were one of the methods of earning heaven prescribed by her new  creed  she was ashamed of her own laziness by the side of honorias  simple benevolence and sad though it may be to have to say it she  longed to outdo her by some signal act of selfsacrifice  she had  looked to this nunnery too as an escape once and for all from  her own luxury just as people who have not strength to be temperate  take refuge in teetotalism and the thought of menial services  towards the poor however distasteful to her came in quite prettily  to fill up the little ideal of a life of romantic asceticisms and  mystic contemplation which gave the true charm in her eyes to her  wild project  but nowjust as a field had opened to her cravings  after poetry and art wider and richer than she had ever imagined just as those simple childlike views of man and nature which she  had learnt to despise were assuming an awful holiness in her eyes just as she had found a human soul to whose regeneration she could  devote all her energiesto be required to give all up perhaps for  ever and she felt that if at all it ought to be for everit was  too much for her little heart to bear and she cried bitterly and  tried to pray and could not and longed for a strong and tender  bosom on which to lay her head and pour out all her doubts and  struggles and there was none  her mother did not understand hardly loved her  honoria loved her but understood her even less  than her mother  pridethe pride of intellect the pride of self willhad long since sealed her lips to her own family     and then out of the darkness of her heart lancelots image rose  before her stronger than all tenderer than all and as she  remembered his magical faculty of anticipating all her thoughts  embodying for her all her vague surmises he seemed to beckon her  towards himshe shuddered and turned away  and now she first  became conscious how he had haunted her thoughts in the last few  months not as a soul to be saved but as a living manhis face  his figure his voice his every gesture and expression rising  clear before her in spite of herself by day and night  and then she thought of his last drawing and the looks which had  accompanied itunmistakable looks of passionate and adoring love   there was no denying itshe had always known that he loved her but  she had never dared to confess it to herself  but now the  earthquake was come and all the secrets of her heart burst upward  to the light and she faced the thought in shame and terror  how  unjust i have been to him how cruel thus to entice him on in  hopeless love  she lifted up her eyes and saw in the mirror opposite the  reflection of her own exquisite beauty  i could have known what i was doing  i knew all the while  and  yet it is so delicious to feel that any one loves me  is it  selfishness  it is selfishness to pamper my vanity on an affection  which i do not will not return  i will not be thus in debt to him  even for his love  i do not love himi do not and even if i did  to give myself up to a man of whom i know so little who is not even  a christian much less a churchman  ay and to give up my will to  any man to become the subject the slave of another human being   i who have worshipped the belief in womans independence the hope  of womans enfranchisement who have felt how glorious it is to live  like the angels single and selfsustained  what if i cut the  gordian knot and here make once for all a vow of perpetual  celibacy  she flung herself on her kneesshe could not collect her thoughts  no she said i am not prepared for this  it is too solemn to be  undertaken in this miserable whirlwind of passion  i will fast and  meditate and go up formally to the little chapel and there devote  myself to god and in the meantime to write at once to the  superior of the beguines to go to my mother and tell her once for  allwhat  must i lose himmust i give him up  not his lovei  cannot give up thatwould that i could but no he will love me for  ever  i know it as well as if an angel told me  but to give up  him  never to see him never to hear his voice never to walk with  him among the beech woods any more  oh argemone  argemone  miserable girl and is it come to this  and she threw herself on  the sofa and hid her face in her hands  yes argemone it is come to this and the best thing you can do is  just what you are doingto lie there and cry yourself to sleep  while the angels are laughing kindly if a solemn public who  settles everything for them will permit them to laugh at the  rickety old windmill of shampopery which you have taken for a real  giant  at that same day and hour as it chanced lancelot little dreaming  what the said windmill was grinding for him was scribbling a hasty  and angry answer to a letter of lukes which perhaps came that  very morning in order to put him into a proper temper for the  demolishing of windmills  it ran thus   ay my good cousinso i expected   suave mari magno turbantibus aequora ventis e terra magnum alterius spectare laborem      pleasant and easy for you protestants for i will call you what you  are in spite of your own denials a truly consistent and logical  protestantand therefore a materialisteasy for you i say to  sit on the shore in cold cruel selfsatisfaction and tell the  poor wretch buffeting with the waves what he ought to do while he is  choking and drowning     thank heaven the storm has stranded me  upon the everlasting rock of peterbut it has been a sore trouble  to reach it  protestants who look at creeds as things to be  changed like coats whenever they seem not to fit them little know  what we catholichearted ones suffer     if they did they would  be more merciful and more chary in the requirements of us just as  we are in the very throe of a newborn existence  the excellent  man to whose care i have committed myself has a wise and a tender  heart    he saw no harm in my concealing from my father the  spiritual reason of my giving up my curacy for i have given it up  and only giving the outward but equally true reason that i found  it on the whole an ineligible and distressing post     i know  you will apply to such an act that disgusting monosyllable of which  protestants are so fond  he felt with me and for mefor my horror  of giving pain to my father and for my wearied and excited state of  mind and strangely enoughto show how differently according to  the difference of the organs the same object may appear to two  peoplehe quoted in my favour that very verse which you wrest  against me  he wished me to show my father that i had only changed  my heaven and not my character by becoming an ultramontane catholic    that as far as his esteem and affection were founded  on anything in me the ground of it did not vanish with my  conversion  if i had told him at once of my altered opinions he  would have henceforth viewed every word and action with a perjudiced  eye     protestants are so bigoted    but if after seeing me  for a month or two the same luke that he had ever known me he were  gradually informed that i had all the while held that creed which he  had considered incompatible with such a life as i hope mine would  beyou must see the effect which it ought to have    i dont  doubt that you will complain of all this     all i can say is  that i cannot sympathise with that superstitious reverence for mere  verbal truth which is so common among protestants    it seems  to me they throw away the spirit of truth in their idolatry of its  letter  for instancewhat is the use of informing a man of a true  fact but to induce a true opinion in him  but if by clinging to  the exact letter of the fact you create a false opinion in his  mind as i should do in my fathers case if by telling him at once  of my change i gave him an unjust horror of catholicismyou do  not tell him the truth     you may speak what is true to you but it becomes an error when received into his mind    if his  mind is a refracting and polarising mediumif the crystalline lens  of his souls eye has been changed into tourmaline or labrador spar the only way to give him a true image of the fact is to present it  to him already properly altered in form and adapted to suit the  obliquity of his vision in order that the very refractive power of  his faculties may instead of distorting it correct it and make it  straight for him and so a verbal wrong in fact may possess him with  a right opinion     you see the whole question turns on your protestant deification of  the intellect     if you really believed as you all say you do  that the nature of man and therefore his intellect among the rest  was utterly corrupt you would not be so superstitiously careful to  tell the truth    as you call it because you would know that  mans heart if not his head would needs turn the truth into a lie  by its own corruption     the proper use of reasoning is to  produce opinionand if the subject in which you wish to produce  the opinion is diseased you must adapt the medicine accordingly   to all which lancelot with several strong curses scrawled the  following answer   and this is my cousin lukewell i shall believe henceforward  that there is after all a thousand times greater moral gulf fixed  between popery and tractarianism than between tractarianism and the  extremest protestantism  my dear fellowi wont bother you by  cutting up your charming ambiguous middle terms which make reason  and reasoning identical or your theory that the office of reasoning  is to induce opinionsthe devil take opinions right or wrongi  want facts faith in real factsor about deifying the intellect as if all sound intellect was not in itself divine lighta  revelation to man of absolute laws independent of him as the very  heathens hold  but this i will dothank you most sincerely for the  compliment you pay us cismontane heretics  we do retain some dim  belief in a godeven i am beginning to believe in believing in him   and therefore as i begin to suppose it is that we reverence  facts as the work of god his acted words and will which we dare  not falsify which we believe will tell their own story better than  we can tell it for them  if our eyes are dimmed we think it safer  to clear them which do belong to us than to bedevil by the light  of those very already dimmed eyes the objects round which do not  belong to us  whether we are consistent or not about the  corruptness of man we are about the incorruptness of god and  therefore about that of the facts by which god teaches men  and  believe and will continue to believe that the blackest of all  sins the deepest of all atheisms that which above all things  proves no faith in gods government of the universe no sense of his  presence no understanding of his character isa lie  one word moreunless you tell your father within twentyfour hours  after receiving this letter i will  and i being a protestant if  cursing popery means protestantism mean what i say   as lancelot walked up to the priory that morning the reverend  panurgus oblareaway dashed out of a cottage by the roadside and  seized him unceremoniously by the shoulders  he was a specimen of  humanity which lancelot could not help at once liking and despising  a quaint mixture of conceit and earnestness uniting the shrewdness  of a stockjobber with the frolic of a schoolboy broke loose  he was  rector of a place in the west of ireland containing some ten  protestants and some thousand papists  being unfortunately for  himself a redhot orangeman he had thought fit to quarrel with the  priest in consequence of which he found himself deprived both of  tithes and congregation and after receiving three or four rockite  letters and a charge of slugs through his hat of which he always  talked as if being shot at was the most pleasant and amusing feature  of irish life he repaired to england and there after trying to  set up as popular preacher in london declaiming at exeter hall and  writing for all the thirdrate magazines found himself incumbent of  lower whitford  he worked there as he said himself like a  horse spent his mornings in the schools his afternoons in the  cottages preached four or five extempore sermons every week to  overflowing congregations took the lead by virtue of the gift of  the gab at all religious meetings for ten miles round and  really did a great deal of good in his way  he had an unblushing  candour about his own worldly ambition with a tremendous brogue  and prided himself on exaggerating deliberately both of these  excellences  the top of the morning to ye mr smith  ye havent such a thing  as a cegar about ye  ive been preaching to schoolchildren till me  throats as dry as the slave of a limeburners coat  i am very sorry but really i have left my case at home  oh ah faix and i forgot  ye mustnt be smokin the nasty things  going up to the castle  och mr smith but youre the lucky man  i am much obliged to you for the compliment said lancelot  gruffly but really i dont see how i deserve it  desarve it  sure lucks all and thats your luck and not your  deserts at all  to have the handsomest girl in the county dying for  love of yepanurgus had a happy knack of blurting out truths when they were pleasant ones  and she just the beautifulest  creature that ever spilte shoeleather barring lady philandria  mountflunkey of castle mountflunkey quanes county that shall be  nameless  upon my word oblareaway you seem to be better acquainted with my  matters than i am  dont you think on the whole it might be  better to mind your own business  me own business  poker o moses and aint it me own business   havent ye spilte my tenderest hopes  and good luck to ye in that  same for yere as pretty a rider as ever kicked copingstones out  of a wall and poor paddy loves a sportsman by nature  och but  yeve got a hand of trumps this time  didnt i mate the vicar the  other day and spake my mind to him  what do you mean asked lancelot with a strong expletive  faix i told him he might as well faugh a ballaghmake a rid road  and get out of that with his bowings and his crossings and his  popery made asy for small minds for there was a gun afield that  would wipe his eyemaning yourself ye prathestant  all i can say is that you had really better mind your own  business and ill mind my own  och said the goodnatured irishman and its you must mind my  business and ill mind yours and thats all fair and aqual  yeve  cut me out intirely at the priory ye tory and so yere bound to  give me a lift somehow  couldnt ye look me out a fine fat widow  with an illigant little fortune  for whats england made for except  to find poor paddy a wife and money  ah ye may laugh but id buy  me a chapel at the westend  me talents are thrown away here  intirely wasting me swateness on the desert air as tom moore says  panurgus used to attribute all quotations whatsoever to irish  geniuses and i flatter meself im the boy to shute the gospel to  the aristocracy  lancelot burst into a roar of laughter and escaped over the next  gate  but the irishmans coarse hints stuck by him as they were  intended to do  dying for the love of me  he knew it was an  impudent exaggeration but somehow it gave him confidence there  is no smoke he thought without fire  and his heart beat high  with new hopes for which he laughed at himself all the while  it  was just the cordial which he needed  that conversation determined  the history of his life  he met argemone that morning in the library as usual but he soon  found that she was not thinking of homer  she was moody and  abstracted and he could not help at last saying  i am afraid i and my classics are de trop this morning miss  lavington  oh no no  never that  she turned away her head  he fancied  that it was to hide a tear  suddenly she rose and turned to him with a clear calm gentle  gaze  listen to me mr smith  we must part today and for ever  this  intimacy has gone ontoo long i am afraid for your happiness   and now like all pleasant things in this miserable world it must  cease  i cannot tell you why but you will trust me  i thank you  for iti thank god for it  i have learnt things from it which i  shall never forget  i have learnt at least from it to esteem and  honour you  you have vast powers  nothing nothing i believe is  too high for you to attempt and succeed  but we must part and now  god be with you  oh that you would but believe that these glorious  talents are his loan  that you would but be a true and loyal knight  to him who saidlearn of me for i am meek and lowly of heart and  ye shall find rest unto your soulsay she went on more and  more passionately for she felt that not she but one mightier than  herself was speaking through her then you might be great indeed   then i might watch your name from afar rising higher and higher  daily in the ranks of gods own heroes  i see itand you have  taught me to see itthat you are meant for a faith nobler and  deeper than all doctrines and systems can give  you must become the  philosopher who can discover new truthsthe artist who can embody  them in new forms while poor iand that is another reason why we  should parthush hear me out  i must not be a clog to drag you  down in your course  take this and farewell and remember that you  once had a friend called argemone  she put into his hands a little bible  he took it and laid it down  on the table  for a minute he stood silent and rooted to the spot   disappointment shame rage hatred all boiled up madly within him   the bitterest insults rose to his lipsflirt coldhearted pedant  fanatic but they sank again unspoken as he looked into the  celestial azure of those eyes calm and pure as a soft evening sky   a mighty struggle between good and evil shook his heart to the  roots and for the first time in his life his soul breathed out  one real prayer that god would help him now or never to play the  man  and in a moment the darkness passed a new spirit called out  all the latent strength within him and gently and proudly he  answered her  yes i will go  i have had mad dreams conceited and insolent and  have met with my deserts  brute and fool as i am i have aspired  even to you  and i have gained in the sunshine of your  condescension strength and purityis not that enough for me  and  now i will show you that i love youby obeying you  you tell me to  departi go for ever  he turned away  why did she almost spring after him  lancelot one word  do not misunderstand me as i know you will   you will think me so cold heartless fickleoh you do not know you never can knowhow much i too have felt  he stopped spellbound  in an instant his conversation with the  irishman flashed up before him with new force and meaning  a  thousand petty incidents which he had driven contemptuously from  his mind returned as triumphant evidences and with an impetuous  determination he cried out  i seei see it all argemone  we love each other  you are mine  never to be parted  what was her womanhood that it could stand against the energy of  his manly will  the almost coarse simplicity of his words silenced  her with a delicious violence  she could only bury her face in her  hands and sob out  oh lancelot lancelot whither are you forcing me  i am forcing you no whither  god the father of spirits is  leading you  you who believe in him how dare you fight against  him  lancelot i cannoti cannot listen to youread that  and she  handed him the vicars letter  he read it tossed it on the carpet  and crushed it with his heel  wretched pedant  can your intellect be deluded by such barefaced  sophistries  gods will forsooth  and if your mothers  opposition is not a sign that gods willif it mean anything except  your own will or thatthat mansis against this mad project and  not for it what sign would you have  so celibacy is the highest  state  and why  because it is the safest and the easiest road to  heaven  a pretty reason vicar  i should have thought that that  was a sign of a lower state and not a higher  noble spirits show  their nobleness by daring the most difficult paths  and even if  marriage was but one weedfield of temptations as these miserable  pedants say who have either never tried it or misused it to their  own shame it would be a greater deed to conquer its temptations  than to flee from them in cowardly longings after ease and safety  she did not answer him but kept her face buried in her hands  again i say argemone will you fight against fateprovidence godcall it what you will  who made us meet at the chapel  who  made me by my accident a guest in your fathers house  who put it  into your heart to care for my poor soul  who gave us this strange  attraction towards each other in spite of our unlikeness   wonderful that the very chain of circumstances which you seem to  fancy the offspring of chance or the devil should have first taught  me to believe that there is a god who guides us  argemone speak  tell me if you will to go for ever but tell me first the truth you love me  a strong shudder ran through her framethe ice of artificial years  cracked and the clear stream of her womans nature welled up to the  light as pure as when she first lay on her mothers bosom  she  lifted up her eyes and with one long look of passionate tenderness  she faltered out  i love you  he did not stir but watched her with clasped hands like one who in  dreams finds himself in some fairy palace and fears that a movement  may break the spell  now go she said go and let me collect my thoughts  all this  has been too much for me  do not look sadyou may come again to morrow  she smiled and held out her hand  he caught it covered it with  kisses and pressed it to his heart  she half drew it back  frightened  the sensation was new to her  again the delicious  feeling of being utterly in his power came over her and she left  her hand upon his heart and blushed as she felt its passionate  throbbings  he turned to gonot as before  she followed with greedy eyes her  newfound treasure and as the door closed behind him she felt as  if lancelot was the whole world and there was nothing beside him  and wondered how a moment had made him all in all to her and then  she sank upon her knees and folded her hands upon her bosom and  her prayers for him were like the prayers of a little child    chapter xi  thunderstorm the first    but what had become of the bit of writing which harry verney by  the instigation of his evil genius had put into the squires fly book  tregarva had waited in terrible suspense for many weeks  expecting the explosion which he knew must follow its discovery  he  had confided to lancelot the contents of the paper and lancelot had  tried many stratagems to get possession of it but all in vain   tregarva took this as calmly as he did everything else  only once  on the morning of the eclaircissement between lancelot and argemone  he talked to lancelot of leaving his place and going out to seek  his fortune but some spell which he did not explain seemed to  chain him to the priory  lancelot thought it was the want of money  and offered to lend him ten pounds whenever he liked but tregarva  shook his head  you have treated me sir as no one else has donelike a man and a  friend but i am not going to make a market of your generosity  i  will owe no man anything save to love one another  but how do you intend to live asked lancelot as they stood  together in the cloisters  theres enough of me sir to make a good navigator if all trades  fail  nonsense you must not throw yourself away so  oh sir theres good to be done believe me among those poor  fellows  they wander up and down the land like hogs and heathens  and no one tells them that they have a soul to be saved  not one  parson in a thousand gives a thought to them  they can manage old  folks and little children sir but somehow they never can get  hold of the young menjust those who want them most  theres a  talk about ragged schools now  why dont they try ragged churches  sir and a ragged service  what do you mean  why sir the parsons are ready enough to save souls but it must  be only according to rule and regulation  before the gospel can be  preached there must be three thousand pounds got together for a  church and a thousand for an endowment not to mention the thousand  pounds that the clergymans education costs  i dont think of his  own keep sir thats little enough often and those that work  hardest get least pay it seems to me  but after all that expense  when theyve built the church its the tradesmen and the gentry  and the old folk that fill it and the working men never come near  it from one years end to another  whats the cause do you think asked lancelot who had himself  remarked the same thing more than once  half of the reason sir i do believe is that same prayerbook   not that the prayerbook aint a fine book enough and a true one  but dont you see sir to understand the virtue of it the poor  fellows ought to be already just what you want to make them  you mean that they ought to be thorough christians already to  appreciate the spirituality of the liturgy  youve hit it sir  and see what comes of the present plan how a  navvy drops into a church by accident and there he has to sit like  a fish out of water through that hours service staring or  sleeping before he can hear a word that he understands and sir  when the sermon does come at last its not many of them can make  much out of those fine bookwords and long sentences  why dont  they have a short simple service now and then that might catch the  ears of the roughs and the blowens without tiring out the poor  thoughtless creatures patience as they do now  because said lancelotbecausei really dont know whybut i  think there is a simpler plan than even a ragged service  what then sir  fieldpreaching  if the mountain wont come to mahomet let  mahomet go to the mountain  right sir right you are  go out into the highways and hedges  and compel them to come in  and why are they to speak to them only  one by one  why not by the dozen and the hundred  we wesleyans  know sirfor the matter of that every soldier knowswhat  virtue there is in getting a lot of men together how good and evil  spread like wildfire through a crowd and one man if you can stir  him up will become leaven to leaven the whole lump  oh why sir  are they so afraid of fieldpreaching  was not their master and  mine the prince of all fieldpreachers  think if the apostles had  waited to collect subscriptions for a church before they spoke to  the poor heathens where should we have been now  lancelot could not but agree  but at that moment a footman came up  and with a face half laughing half terrified said  tregarva master wants you in the study  and please sir i think  you had better go in too master knows youre here and you might  speak a word for good for hes raging like a mad bull  i knew it would come at last said tregarva quietly as he  followed lancelot into the house  it had come at last  the squire was sitting in his study purple  with rage while his daughters were trying vainly to pacify him   all the menservants grooms and helpers were drawn up in line  along the wall and greeted tregarva whom they all heartily liked  with sly and sorrowful looks of warning  here you sir you look at this  is this the way you repay me   i who have kept you out of the workhouse treated you like my own  child  and then to go and write filthy rascally radical ballads  on me and mine  this comes of your methodism you canting sneaking  hypocriteyou viperyou adderyou snakeyou  and the  squire whose vocabulary was not large at a loss for another  synonym rounded off his oration by a torrent of oaths at which  argemone taking honorias hand walked proudly out of the room  with one glance at lancelot of mingled shame and love  this is  your handwriting you villain you know it and the squire tossed  the fatal paper across the table though i suppose youll lie  about it  how can you depend on fellows who speak evil of their  betters  but all the servants are ready to swear its your  handwriting  beg your pardon sir interposed the old butler we didnt quite  say that but well all swear it isnt ours  the paper is mine said tregarva  confound your coolness  hes no more ashamed of it thanread it  out smith read it out every word and let them all hear how this  pauper this balladsinging vagabond whom i have bred up to insult  me dares to abuse his own master  i have not abused you sir answered tregarva  i will be heard  sir he went on in a voice which made the old man start from his  seat and clench his fist but he sat down again  not a word in it  is meant for you  you have been a kind and a good master to me   ask where you will if i was ever heard to say a word against you  i  would have cut off my right hand sooner than write about you or  yours  but what i had to say about others lies there and i am not  ashamed of it  not against me  read it out smith and see if every word of it  dont hit at me and at my daughters too by worst of all  read  it out i say  lancelot hesitated but the squire who was utterly beside himself  began to swear at him also as masters of hounds are privileged to  do and lancelot to whom the whole scene was becoming every moment  more and more intensely ludicrous thought it best to take up the  paper and begin   a rough rhyme on a rough matter  the merry brown hares came leaping    over the crest of the hill where the clover and corn lay sleeping    under the moonlight still  leaping late and early    till under their bite and their tread the swedes and the wheat and the barley    lay cankered and trampled and dead  a poachers widow sat sighing    on the side of the white chalk bank where under the gloomy firwoods    one spot in the ley throve rank  she watched a long tuft of clover    where rabbit or hare never ran for its black sour haulm covered over    the blood of a murdered man  she thought of the dark plantation    and the hares and her husbands blood and the voice of her indignation    rose up to the throne of god  i am long past wailing and whining    i have wept too much in my life ive had twenty years of pining    as an english labourers wife  a labourer in christian england    where they cant of a saviours name and yet waste mens lives like the vermins    for a few more brace of game  theres blood on your new foreign shrubs squire    theres blood on your pointers feet theres blood on the game you sell squire    and theres blood on the game you eat   you villain interposed the squire when did i ever sell a head  of game   you have sold the labouring man squire    body and soul to shame to pay for your seat in the house squire    and to pay for the feed of your game  you made him a poacher yourself squire    when youd give neither work nor meat and your barleyfed hares robbed the garden    at our starving childrens feet  when packed in one reeking chamber    man maid mother and little ones lay while the rain pattered in on the rotting bridebed    and the walls let in the day  when we lay in the burning fever    on the mud of the cold clay floor till you parted us all for three months squire    at the cursed workhouse door  we quarrelled like brutes and who wonders    what selfrespect could we keep worse housed than your hacks and your pointers    worse fed than your hogs and your sheep   and yet he has the impudence to say he dont mean me grumbled the  old man  tregarva winced a good dealas if he knew what was coming  next and then looked up relieved when he found lancelot had omitted  a stanzawhich i shall not omit   our daughters with baseborn babies    have wandered away in their shame if your misses had slept squire where they did    your misses might do the same  can your lady patch hearts that are breaking    with handfuls of coals and rice or by dealing out flannel and sheeting    a little below cost price  you may tire of the gaol and the workhouse    and take to allotments and schools but youve run up a debt that will never    be repaid us by pennyclub rules  in the season of shame and sadness    in the dark and dreary day when scrofula gout and madness    are eating your race away  when to kennels and liveried varlets    you have cast your daughters bread and worn out with liquor and harlots    your heir at your feet lies dead  when your youngest the mealymouthed rector    lets your soul rot asleep to the grave you will find in your god the protector    of the freeman you fancied your slave  she looked at the tuft of clover    and wept till her heart grew light and at last when her passion was over    went wandering into the night  but the merry brown hares came leaping    over the uplands still where the clover and corn lay sleeping    on the side of the white chalk hill   surely sir said lancelot you cannot suppose that this latter  part applies to you or your family  if it dont it applies to half the gentlemen in the vale and  thats just as bad  what right has the fellow to speak evil of  dignities continued he quoting the only text in the bible which  he was inclined to make a rule absolute  what does such an  insolent dog deserve  what dont he deserve i say  i think quoth lancelot ambiguously that a man who can write  such ballads is not fit to be your gamekeeper and i think he feels  so himself and lancelot stole an encouraging look at tregarva  and i say sir the keeper answered with an effort that i leave  mr lavingtons service here on the spot once and for all  and that you may do my fine fellow roared the squire  pay the  rascal his wages steward and then duck him soundly in the weir pool  he had better have stayed there when he fell in last  so i had indeed i think  but ill take none of your money  the  day harry verney was buried i vowed that id touch no more of the  wages of blood  im going sir i never harmed you or meant a hard  word of all this for you or dreamt that you or any living soul  would ever see it  but what ive seen myself in spite of myself  ive set down here and am not ashamed of it  and woe he went on  with an almost prophetic solemnity in his tone and gesturewoe to  those who do these things and woe to those also who though they  dare not do them themselves yet excuse and defend them who dare  just because the world calls them gentlemen and not tyrants and  oppressors  he turned to go  the squire bursting with passion sprang up with  a terrible oath turned deadly pale staggered and dropped  senseless on the floor  they all rushed to lift him up  tregarva was the first to take him  in his arms and place him tenderly in his chair where he lay back  with glassy eyes snoring heavily in a fit of apoplexy  go for gods sake go whispered lancelot to the keeper and  wait for me at lower whitford  i must see you before you stir  the keeper slipped away sadly  the ladies rushed ina groom  galloped off for the doctormet him luckily in the village and in  a few minutes the squire was bled and put to bed and showed  hopeful signs of returning consciousness  and as argemone and  lancelot leant together over his pillow her hair touched her  lovers and her fragrant breath was warm upon his cheek and her  bright eyes met his and drank light from them like glittering  planets gazing at their sun  the obnoxious ballad produced the most opposite effects on argemone  and on honoria  argemone whose reverence for the formalities and  the respectabilities of society never very great had of late  utterly vanished before lancelots bad counsel could think of it  only as a work of art and conceived the most romantic longing to  raise tregarva into some station where his talents might have free  play  to honoria on the other hand it appeared only as a very  fierce coarse and impertinent satire which had nearly killed her  father  true there was not a thought in it which had not at some  time or other crossed her own mind but that made her dislike all  the more to see those thoughts put into plain english  that very  intense tenderness and excitability which made her toil herself  among the poor and had called out both her admiration of tregarva  and her extravagant passion at his danger made her also shrink with  disgust from anything which thrust on her a painful reality which  she could not remedy  she was a staunch believer too in that  peculiar creed which allows every one to feel for the poor except  themselves and considers that to plead the cause of workingmen is  in a gentleman the perfection of virtue but in a workingman  himself sheer high treason  and so beside her fathers sickbed  she thought of the keeper only as a scorpion whom she had helped to  warm into life and sighing assent to her mother when she said  that wretch and he seemed so pious and so obliging who would have  dreamt that he was such a horrid radical she let him vanish from  her mind and out of whitford priors little knowing the sore weight  of manly love he bore with him  as soon as lancelot could leave the priory he hastened home to find  tregarva  the keeper had packed up all his small possessions and  brought them down to lower whitford through which the london coach  passed  he was determined to go to london and seek his fortune  he  talked of turning coalheaver methodist preacher anything that  came to hand provided that he could but keep independence and a  clear conscience  and all the while the man seemed to be struggling  with some great purposeto feel that he had a work to do though  what it was and how it was to be done he did not see  i am a tall man he said like saul the son of kish and i am  going forth like him sir to find my fathers asses  i doubt i  shant have to look far for some of them  and perhaps said lancelot laughing to find a kingdom  may be so sir  i have found one already by gods grace and im  much mistaken if i dont begin to see my way towards another  and what is that  the kingdom of god on earth sir as well as in heaven  come it  must sir and come it will some day  lancelot shook his head  tregarva lifted up his eyes and said  are we not taught to pray for the coming of his kingdom sir  and  do you fancy that he who gave the lesson would have set all mankind  to pray for what he never meant should come to pass  lancelot was silent  the words gained a new and blessed meaning in  his eyes  well he said the time at least of their fulfilment is far  enough off  unionworkhouses and childmurder dont look much like  it  talking of that tregarva what is to become of your promise to  take me to a village wake and show me what the poor are like  i can keep it this night sir  there is a revel at bonesake  about five miles up the river  will you go with a discharged  gamekeeper  i will go with paul tregarva whom i honour and esteem as one of  gods own noblemen who has taught me what a man can be and what i  am notand lancelot grasped the keepers hand warmly  tregarva  brushed his hand across his eyes and answered  i said in my haste all men are liars and god has just given me  the lie back in my own teeth  well sir we will go tonight  you  are not ashamed of putting on a smockfrock  for if you go as a  gentleman you will hear no more of them than a hawk does of a covey  of partridges  so the expedition was agreed on and lancelot and the keeper parted  until the evening  but why had the vicar been rambling on all that morning through  pouring rain on the top of the london coach  and why was he so  anxious in his inquiries as to the certainty of catching the up train  because he had had considerable experience in that wisdom of  the serpent whose combination with the innocence of the dove in  somewhat ultramontane proportions is recommended by certain late  leaders of his school  he had made up his mind after his  conversation with the irishman that he must either oust lancelot at  once or submit to be ousted by him and he was now on his way to  lancelots uncle and trustee the london banker  he knew that the banker had some influence with his nephew whose  whole property was invested in the bank and who had besides a deep  respect for the kindly and upright practical mind of the veteran  mammonite  and the vicar knew too that he himself had some  influence with the banker whose son luke had been his pupil at  college  and when the young man lay sick of a dangerous illness  brought on by debauchery into which weakness rather than vice had  tempted him the vicar had watched and prayed by his bed nursed him  as tenderly as a mother and so won over his better heart that he  became completely reclaimed and took holy orders with the most  earnest intention to play the man therein as repentant rakes will  often do half from a mere revulsion to asceticism half from real  gratitude for their deliverance  this good deed had placed the  banker in the vicars debt and he loved and reverenced him in spite  of his dread of popish novelties  and now the good priest was  going to open to him just as much of his heart as should seem fit  and by saying a great deal about lancelots evil doings opinions  and companions and nothing at all about the heiress of whitford  persuade the banker to use all his influence in drawing lancelot up  to london and leaving a clear stage for his plans on argemone  he  caught the uptrain he arrived safe and sound in town but what he  did there must be told in another chapter    chapter xii  thunderstorm the second    weary with many thoughts the vicar came to the door of the bank   there were several carriages there and a crowd of people swarming  in and out like bees round a hivedoor entering with anxious  faces and returning with cheerful ones to stop and talk earnestly  in groups round the door  every moment the mass thickenedthere  was a run on the bank  an old friend accosted him on the steps  what have you too money here then  neither here nor anywhere else thank heaven said the vicar   but is anything wrong  have not you heard  the house has sustained a frightful blow this  weekrailway speculations so they sayand is hardly expected to  survive the day  so we are all getting our money out as fast as  possible  by way of binding up the bruised reed eh  oh every man for himself  a man is under no obligation to his  banker that i know of  and the good man bustled off with his  pockets full of gold  the vicar entered  all was hurry and anxiety  the clerks seemed  trying to brazen out their own terror and shovelled the rapidly  lessening gold and notes across the counter with an air of indignant  nonchalance  the vicar asked to see the principal  if you want your money sir answered the official with a  disdainful look  i want no money  i must see mr smith on private business and  instantly  he is particularly engaged  i know it and therefore i must see him  take in my card and he  will not refuse me  a new vista had opened itself before him  he was ushered into a private room  and as he waited for the  banker he breathed a prayer  for what  that his own will might be  donea very common style of petition  mr smith entered hurried and troubled  he caught the vicar  eagerly by the hand as if glad to see a face which did not glare on  him with the cold selfish stamp of business and then drew back  again afraid to commit himself by any sign of emotion  the vicar had settled his plan of attack and determined boldly to  show his knowledge of the bankers distress  i am very sorry to trouble you at such an unfortunate moment sir  and i will be brief but as your nephews spiritual pastor  he  knew the banker was a stout churchman  what of my nephew sir  no fresh misfortunes i hope  not so much misfortune sir as misconducti might say frailty but frailty which may become ruinous  how how  some mesalliance interrupted mr smith in a peevish  excited tone  i thought there was some heiress on the tapisat  least so i heard from my unfortunate son who has just gone over to  rome  theres another misfortunenothing but misfortunes and  your teaching sir by the bye i am afraid has helped me to that  one  gone over to rome asked the vicar slowly  yes sir gone to rometo the pope sir to the devil sir  i  should have thought you likely to know of it before i did  the vicar stared fixedly at him a moment and burst into honest  tears  the banker was moved  pon my honour sir i beg your pardon  i did not mean to be rude  butbutto be plain with a clergyman sir so many things coming  together have quite unmanned me  pooh pooh and he shook himself  as if to throw off a weight and with a face once more quiet and  businesslike asked and now my dear sir what of my nephew  as for that young lady sir of whom you spoke i can assure you  once for all as her clergyman and therefore more or less her  confidant that your nephew has not the slightest chance or hope in  that quarter  how sir  you will not throw obstacles in the way  heaven sir i think has interposed far more insuperable  obstaclesin the young ladys own heartthan i could ever have  done  your nephews character and opinions i am sorry to say are  not such as are likely to command the respect and affection of a  pure and pious churchwoman  opinions sir  what is he turning papist too  i am afraid sir and more than afraid for he makes no secret of  it himself that his views tend rather in the opposite direction to  an infidelity so subversive of the commonest principles of morality  that i expect weekly to hear of some unblushing and disgraceful  outrage against decency committed by him under its fancied  sanction  and you know as well as myself the double danger of  some profligate outbreak which always attends the miseries of a  disappointed earthly passion  true very true  we must get the boy out of the way sir  i must  have him under my eye  exactly so sir said the subtle vicar who had been driving at  this very point  how much better for him to be here using his  great talents to the advantage of his family in an honourable  profession than to remain where he is debauching body and mind by  hopeless dreams godless studies and frivolous excesses  when do you return sir  an hour hence if i can be of service to you  the banker paused a moment  you are a gentleman with emphasis on the word and as such i  can trust you  say rather as a clergyman  pardon me but i have found your cloth give little additional cause  for confidence  i have been as much bitten by clergymeni have  seen as sharp practice among them in money matters as well as in  religious squabbles as i have in any class  whether it is that  their book education leaves them very often ignorant of the plain  rules of honour which bind men of the world or whether their zeal  makes them think that the end justifies the means i cannot tell  but  but said the vicar half smiling half severely you must not  disparage the priesthood before a priest  i know it i know it and i beg your pardon  but if you knew the  cause i have to complain  the slipperiness sir of one staggering  parson has set rolling this very avalanche which gathers size  every moment and threatens to overwhelm me now unless that idle  dog lancelot will condescend to bestir himself and help me  the vicar heard but said nothing  me at least you can trust he answered proudly and honestly  toofor he was a gentleman by birth and breeding unselfish and  chivalrous to a faultand yet when he heard the bankers words it  was as if the inner voice had whispered to him thou art the man  when do you go down again asked mr smith  to tell you the  truth i was writing to lancelot when you were announced but the  post will not reach him till tomorrow at noon and we are all so  busy here that i have no one whom i can trust to carry down an  express  the vicar saw what was coming  was it his good angel which prompted  him to interpose  why not send a parcel by rail  i can trust the rail as far as d but i cannot trust those  coaches  if you could do me so great a kindness  i will  i can start by the one oclock train and by ten oclock  tonight i shall be in whitford  are you certain  if god shall please i am certain  and you will take charge of a letter  perhaps too you could see  him yourself and tell himyou see i trust you with everything that my fortune his own fortune depends on his being here to morrow morning  he must start tonight sirtonight tell him if  there were twenty miss lavingtons in whitfordor he is a ruined  man  the letter was written and put into the vicars hands with a  hundred entreaties from the terrified banker  a cab was called and  the clergyman rattled off to the railway terminus  well said he to himself god has indeed blessed my errand  giving as always exceeding abundantly more than we are able to  ask or think  for some weeks at least this poor lamb is safe  from the destroyers clutches  i must improve to the utmost those  few precious days in strengthening her in her holy purpose  but  after all he will return daring and cunning as ever and then will  not the fascination recommence  and as he mused a little fiend passed by and whispered unless  he comes up tonight he is a ruined man  it was friday and the vicar had thought it a fit preparation for so  important an errand to taste no food that day  weakness and hunger  joined to the roar and bustle of london had made him excited  nervous unable to control his thoughts or fight against a  stupifying headache and his selfweakened will punished him by  yielding him up an easy prey to his own fancies  ay he thought if he were ruined after all it would be well  for gods cause  the lavingtons at least would find no temptation  in his wealth  and argemoneshe is too proud too luxurious to  marry a beggar  she might embrace a holy poverty for the sake of  her own soul but for the gratification of an earthly passion  never  base and carnal delights would never tempt her so far  alas poor pedant  among all that thy books taught thee they did  not open to thee much of the depths of that human heart which thy  dogmas taught thee to despise as diabolic  again the little fiend whispered  unless he comes up tonight he is a ruined man  and what if he is thought the vicar  riches are a curse and  poverty a blessing  is it not his wealth which is ruining his soul   idleness and fulness of bread have made him what he isa luxurious  and selfwilled dreamer battening on his own fancies  were it not  rather a boon to him to take from him the root of all evil  most true vicar  and yet the devil was at that moment transforming  himself into an angel of light for thee  but the vicar was yet honest  if he had thought that by cutting off  his right hand he could have saved lancelots soul by canonical  methods of course for who would wish to save souls in any other  he would have done it without hesitation  again the little fiend whispered  unless he comes up tonight he is a ruined man  a terrible sensation seized himwhy should he give the letter to night  you promised whispered the inner voice  no i did not promise exactly in so many words that is i only  said i would be at home tonight if god pleased  and what if god  should not pleasei promised for his good  what if on second  thoughts it should be better for him not to keep my promise  a  moment afterwards he tossed the temptation from him indignantly   but back it came  at every gaudy shop at every smokegrimed  manufactory at the face of every anxious victim of mammon of every  sturdy cheerful artisan the fiend winked and pointed crying and  what if he be ruined  look at the thousands who have and are  miserableat the millions who have not and are no sadder than  their own tyrants  again and again he thrust the thought from him but more and more  weakly  his whole frame shook the perspiration stood on his  forehead  as he took his railway ticket his look was so haggard  and painful that the clerk asked him whether he were ill  the train  was just starting he threw himself into a carriagehe would have  locked himself in if he could and felt an inexpressible relief when  he found himself rushing past houses and marketgardens whirled  onward whether he would or not in the right pathhomeward  but was it the right path for again the temptation flitted past  him  he threw himself back and tried to ask counsel of one above  but there was no answer nor any that regarded  his heart was  silent and dark as midnight fog  why should there have been an  answer  he had not listened to the voice within  did he wish for a  miracle to show him his duty  not that i care for detection he said to himself  what is shame  to me  is it not a glory to be evilspoken of in the cause of god   how can the world appreciate the motives of those who are not of the  worldthe divine wisdom of the serpentat once the saints  peculiar weapon and a part of his peculiar cross when men call him  a deceiver because they confound forsooth his spiritual subtlety  with their earthly cunning  have i not been called liar  hypocrite jesuit often enough already to harden me towards  bearing that name once again  that led him into sad thoughts of his last few years careerof  the friends and pupils whose secession to rome had been attributed  to his hypocrisy his disguised romanism and then the remembrance  of poor luke smith flashed across him for the first time since he  left the bank  i must see him he said to himself i must argue with him face to  face  who knows but that it may be given even to my unworthiness to  snatch him from this accursed slough  and then he remembered that his way home lay through the city in  which the new converts parish wasthat the coach stopped there to  change horses and again the temptation leapt up again stronger  than ever under the garb of an imperative call of duty  he made no determination for or against it  he was too weak in body  and mind to resist and in a half sleep broken with an aching  terrified sense of something wanting which he could not find he was  swept down the line got on the coach and mechanically almost  without knowing it found himself set down at the city of a and  the coach rattling away down the street  he sprang from his stupor and called madly after itran a few  steps  you might as well try to catch the clouds sir said the ostler   gemmen should make up their minds afore they gets down  alas so thought the vicar  but it was too late and with a heavy  heart he asked the way to the late curates house  thither he went  mr luke smith was just at dinner but the vicar  was nevertheless shown into the bachelors little diningroom   but what was his disgust and disappointment at finding his late  pupil teteatete over a comfortable fishdinner opposite a burly  vulgar cunningeyed man with a narrow rim of muslin turned down  over his stiff cravat of whose profession there could be no doubt  my dearest sir said the new convert springing up with an air of  extreme empressement what an unexpected pleasure  allow me to  introduce you to my excellent friend padre bugiardo  the padre rose bowed obsequiously was overwhelmed with delight at  being at last introduced to one of whom he had heard so much sat  down again and poured himself out a bumper of sherry while the  vicar commenced making the best of a bad matter by joining in the  now necessary business of eating  he had not a word to say for himself  poor luke was particularly  jovial and flippant and startlingly unlike his former self  the  padre went on staring out of the window and talking in a loud  forced tone about the astonishing miracles of the ecstatica and  addolorata and the poor vicar finding the purpose for which he  had sacrificed his own word of honour utterly frustrated by the  priests presence sat silent and crestfallen the whole evening  the priest had no intention of stirring  the late fatherconfessor  tried to outstay his new rival but in vain the padre deliberately  announced his intention of taking a bed and the vicar with a heavy  heart rose to go to his inn  as he went out at the door he caught an opportunity of saying one  word to the convert  my poor luke and are you happy  tell me honestly in gods sight  tell me  happier than ever i was in my life  no more selftorture physical  or mental now  these good priests thoroughly understand poor human  nature i can assure you  the vicar sighed for the speech was evidently meant as a gentle  rebuke to himself  but the young man ran on half laughing  you know how you and the rest used to tell us what a sad thing it  was that we were all cursed with conscienceswhat a fearful  miserable burden moral responsibility was but that we must submit  to it as an inevitable evil  now that burden is gone thank god   we of the true church have some one to keep our consciences for us   the padre settles all about what is right or wrong and we slip on  as easily as  a hog or a butterfly said the vicar bitterly  exactly answered luke  and on your own showing are clean  gainers of a happy life here not to mention heaven hereafter  god  bless you  we shall soon see you one of us  never so help me god said the vicar all the more fiercely  because he was almost at that moment of the young mans opinion  the vicar stepped out into the night  the rain which had given  place during the afternoon to a bright sun and clear chilly evening  had returned with double fury  the wind was sweeping and howling  down the lonely streets and lashed the rain into his face while  gray clouds were rushing past the moon like terrified ghosts across  the awful void of the black heaven  above him gaunt poplars groaned  and bent like giants cowering from the wrath of heaven yet rooted  by grim necessity to their place of torture  the roar and tumult  without him harmonised strangely with the discord within  he  staggered and strode along the plashy pavement muttering to himself  at intervals  rest for the soul peace of mind  i have been promising them all  my life to othershave i found them myself  and here is this poor  boy saying that he has gained themin the very barbarian  superstition which i have been anathematising to him  what is true  at this rate  what is false  is anything right or wrong except in  as far as men feel it to be right or wrong  else whence does this  poor fellows peace come or the peace of many a convert more  they  have all one by one told me the same story  and is not a religion  to be known by its fruits  are they not right in going where they  can get peace of mind  certainly vicar  if peace of mind be the summum bonum and  religion is merely the science of selfsatisfaction they are right  and your wisest plan will be to follow them at once or failing  that to apply to the next best substitute that can be discovered alcohol and opium  as he went on talking wildly to himself he passed the union  workhouse  opposite the gate under the lee of a wall some twenty  men women and children were huddled together on the bare ground   they had been refused lodging in the workhouse and were going to  pass the night in that situation  as he came up to them coarse  jests and snatches of low drinkingsongs ghastly as the laughter  of lost spirits in the pit mingled with the feeble wailings of some  child of shame  the vicar recollected how he had seen the same  sight at the door of kensington workhouse walking home one night in  company with luke smith and how too he had commented to him on  that fearful sign of the times and had somewhat unfairly drawn a  contrast between the niggard cruelty of popular protestantism and  the fancied liberality of the middle age  what wonder if his  pupil had taken him at his word  delighted to escape from his own thoughts by anything like action  he pulled out his purse to give an alms  there was no silver in it  but only some fifteen or twenty sovereigns which he that day  received as payment for some bitter reviews in a leading religious  periodical  everything that night seemed to shame and confound him  more  as he touched the money there sprang up in his mind in an  instant the thought of the articles which had procured it by one of  those terrible searching inspirations in which the light which  lighteth every man awakes as a lightningflash of judgment he saw  them and his own heart for one moment as they weretheir blind  prejudice their reckless imputations of motives their wilful  concealment of any palliating clauses their party nicknames given  without a shudder at the terrible accusations which they conveyed   and then the indignation the shame the reciprocal bitterness which  those articles would excite tearing still wider the bleeding wounds  of that church which they professed to defend  and then in this  case too the thought rushed across him what if i should have  been wrong and my adversary right  what if i have made the heart of  the righteous sad whom god has not made sad  i to have been  dealing out heavens thunders as if i were infallible  i who am  certain at this moment of no fact in heaven or earth except my own  untruth  god who am i that i should judge another  and the coins  seemed to him like the price of bloodhe fancied that he felt them  redhot to his hand and in his eagerness to get rid of the  accursed thing he dealt it away fiercely to the astonished group  amid whining and flattery wrangling and ribaldry and then not  daring to wait and see the use to which his money would be put  hurried off to the inn and tried in uneasy slumbers to forget the  time until the mail passed through at daybreak on its way to  whitford    chapter xiii  the village revel    at dusk that same evening the two had started for the village fair   a velveteen shootingjacket a pair of corduroy trousers and a  waistcoat furnished by tregarva covered with flowers of every  imaginable hue tolerably disguised lancelot who was recommended by  his conductor to keep his hands in his pockets as much as possible  lest their delicacy which was as it happened not very remarkable  might betray him  as they walked together along the plashy turnpike  road overtaking now and then groups of two or three who were out  on the same errand as themselves lancelot could not help remarking  to the keeper how superior was the look of comfort in the boys and  young men with their ruddy cheeks and smart dresses to the worn  and haggard appearance of the elder men  let them alone poor fellows said tregarva it wont last long   when theyve got two or three children at their heels theyll look  as thin and shabby as their own fathers  they must spend a great deal of money on their clothes  and on their stomachs too sir  they never lay by a farthing and  i dont see how they can when their clubmoneys paid and their  insides are well filled  do you mean to say that they actually have not as much to eat after  they marry  indeed and i do sir  they get no more wages afterwards round  here and have four or five to clothe and feed off the same money  that used to keep one and that sum wont take long to work out i  think  but do they not in some places pay the married men higher wages  than the unmarried  thats a worse trick still sir for it tempts the poor thoughtless  boys to go and marry the first girl they can get hold of and it  dont want much persuasion to make them do that at any time  but why dont the clergymen teach them to put into the savings  banks  one here and there sir says what he can though its of very  little use  besides every one is afraid of savings banks now not  a year but one reads of some breaking and the lawyers going off with  the earnings of the poor  and if they didnt youths a foolish  time at best and the carnal man will be hankering after amusement  siramusement  and no wonder said lancelot at all events i should not think  they got much of it  but it does seem strange that no other  amusement can be found for them than the beershop  cant they  read  cant they practise light and interesting handicrafts at  home as the german peasantry do  wholl teach em sir  from the ploughtail to the reapinghook  and back again is all they know  besides sir they are not like  us cornish they are a stupid pigheaded generation at the best  these south countrymen  theyre grownup babies who want the parson  and the squire to be leading them and preaching to them and  spurring them on and coaxing them up every moment  and as for  scholarship sir a boy leaves school at nine or ten to follow the  horses and between that time and his weddingday he forgets every  word he ever learnt and becomes for the most part as thorough a  heathen savage at heart as those wild indians in the brazils used to  be  and then we call them civilised englishmen said lancelot  we  can see that your indian is a savage because he wears skins and  feathers but your irish cottar or your english labourer because he  happens to wear a coat and trousers is to be considered a civilised  man  its the way of the world sir said tregarva judging carnal  judgment according to the sight of its own eyes always looking at  the outsides of things and men sir and never much deeper  but as  for reading sir its all very well for me who have been a keeper  and dawdled about like a gentleman with a gun over my arm but did  you ever do a good days farmwork in your life  if you had man or  boy you wouldnt have been game for much reading when you got home  youd do just what these poor fellows dotumble into bed at eight  oclock hardly waiting to take your clothes off knowing that you  must turn up again at five oclock the next morning to get a  breakfast of bread and perhaps a dab of the squires dripping  and then back to work again and so on day after day sir week  after week year after year without a hope or a chance of being  anything but what you are and only too thankful if you can get work  to break your back and catch the rheumatism over  but do you mean to say that their labour is so severe and  incessant  its only gods blessing if it is incessant sir for if it stops  they starve or go to the house to be worse fed than the thieves in  gaol  and as for its being severe theres many a boy as their  mothers will tell you comes home night after night too tired to  eat their suppers and tumble fasting to bed in the same foul  shirt which theyve been working in all the day never changing  their rag of calico from weeks end to weeks end or washing the  skin thats under it once in seven years  no wonder said lancelot that such a life of drudgery makes them  brutal and reckless  no wonder indeed sir  theyve no time to think theyre born to  be machines and machines they must be and i think sir he added  bitterly its gods mercy that they darent think  its gods  mercy that they dont feel  men that write books and talk at  elections call this a free country and say that the poorest and  meanest has a free opening to rise and become prime minister if he  can  but you see sir the misfortune is that in practice he  cant for one who gets into a gentlemans family or into a little  shop and so saves a few pounds fifty know that theyve no chance  before them but daylabourer born daylabourer live from hand to  mouth scraping and pinching to get not meat and beer even but  bread and potatoes and then at the end of it all for a worthy  reward halfacrown aweek of parish payor the workhouse  thats  a lively hopeful prospect for a christian man  but said lancelot i thought this new poorlaw was to stir them  up to independence  oh sir the old law has bit too deep  it made them slaves and  beggars at heart  it taught them not to be ashamed of parish pay to demand it as a right  and so it is their right said lancelot  in gods name if a  country is so illconstituted that it cannot find its own citizens  in work it is bound to find them in food  maybe sir maybe  god knows i dont grudge it them  its a poor  pittance at best when they have got it  but dont you see sir  how all poorlaws old or new either suck the independent spirit  out of a man how they make the poor wretch reckless how they tempt  him to spend every extra farthing in amusement  how then  why he is always tempted to say to himself whatever happens to  me the parish must keep me  if i am sick it must doctor me if i  am worn out it must feed me if i die it must bury me if i leave my  children paupers the parish must look after them and theyll be as  well off with the parish as they were with me  now theyve only got  just enough to keep body and soul together and the parish cant  give them less than that  whats the use of cutting myself off from  sixpennyworth of pleasure here and sixpennyworth there  im not  saving money for my children im only saving the farmers rates   there it is sir said tregarva thats the bottom of it sir im only saving the farmers rates  let us eat and drink for to morrow we die  i dont see my way out of it said lancelot  so says everybody sir  but i should have thought those members of  parliament and statesmen and university scholars have been set up  in the high places out of the wood where we are all struggling and  scrambling just that they might see their way out of it and if  they dont sir and that soon as sure as god is in heaven these  poor fellows will cut their way out of it  and blindfolded and ignorant as they are said lancelot they  will be certain to cut their way out just in the wrong direction  im not so sure of that sir said tregarva lowering his voice   what is written  that there is one who hears the desire of the  poor  lord thou preparest their hearts and thine ear hearkeneth  thereto to help the fatherless and poor unto their right that the  man of the earth be no more exalted against them  why you are talking like any chartist tregarva  am i sir  i havent heard much scripture quoted among them  myself poor fellows but to tell you the truth sir i dont know  what i am becoming  im getting half mad with all i see going on  and not going on and you will agree sir that whats happened this  day cant have done much to cool my temper or brighten my hopes  though gods my witness theres no spite in me for my own sake   but what makes me maddest of all sir is to see that everybody sees  these evils except just the men who can cure themthe squires and  the clergy  why surely tregarva there are hundreds if not thousands of  clergymen and landlords working heart and soul at this moment to  better the condition of the labouring classes  ay sir they see the evils and yet they dont see them  they do  not see what is the matter with the poor man and the proof of it  is sir that the poor have no confidence in them  theyll take  their alms but theyll hardly take their schooling and their  advice they wont take at all  and why is it sir  because the  poor have got in their heads in these days a strange confused fancy  maybe but still a deep and a fierce one that they havent got what  they call their rights  if you were to raise the wages of every man  in this country from nine to twelve shillings aweek tomorrow you  wouldnt satisfy them at least the only ones whom you would  satisfy would be the mere hogs among them who as long as they can  get a full stomach care for nothing else  what in heavens name do they want asked lancelot  they hardly know yet sir but they know well what they dont want   the question with them sir believe me is not so much how shall  we get better fed and better housed but whom shall we depend upon  for our food and for our house  why should we depend on the will  and fancy of any man for our rights  they are asking ugly questions  among themselves sir about what those two words rent and taxes  mean and about what that same strange word freedom means  eight  or wrong theyve got the thought into their heads and its growing  there and they will find an answer for it  depend upon it sir i  tell you a truth and they expect a change  you will hear them talk  of it tonight sir if youve luck  we all expect a change for that matter said lancelot  that  feeling is common to all classes and parties just now  tregarva took off his hat  for the word of the lord hath spoken it  do you know sir i  long at times that i did agree with those chartists  if i did id  turn lecturer tomorrow  how a man could speak out then  if he saw  any door of hope any way of salvation for these poor fellows even  if it was nothing better than salvation by act of parliament  but why dont you trust the truly worthy among the clergy and the  gentry to leaven their own ranks and bring all right in time  because sir they seem to be going the way only to make things  worse  the people have been so dependent on them heretofore that  they have become thorough beggars  you can have no knowledge sir  of the whining canting deceit and lies which those poor miserable  labourers wives palm on charitable ladies  if they werent angels  some of them theyd lock up their purses and never give away  another farthing  and sir these freeschools and these penny clubs and clothing clubs and these heaps of money which are given  away all make the matter worse and worse  they make the labourer  fancy that he is not to depend upon god and his own right hand but  on what his wife can worm out of the good nature of the rich  why  sir they growl as insolently now at the parson or the squires wife  if they dont get as much money as their neighbours as they used to  at the parish vestrymen under the old law  look at that lord  vieuxbois sir as sweet a gentleman as ever god made  it used to  do me good to walk behind him when he came over here shooting just  to hear the gentle kindhearted way in which he used to speak to  every old soul he met  he spends his whole life and time about the  poor i hear  but sir as sure as you live hes making his people  slaves and humbugs  he doesnt see sir that they want to be  raised bodily out of this miserable handtomouth state to be  brought nearer up to him and set on a footing where they can shift  for themselves  without meaning it sir all his boundless  charities are keeping the people down and telling them they must  stay down and not help themselves but wait for what he gives them   he fats prizelabourers sir just as lord minchampstead fats prize oxen and pigs  lancelot could not help thinking of that amusingly inconsistent  however wellmeant scene in coningsby in which mr lyle is  represented as trying to restore the independent order of  peasantry by making them the receivers of public alms at his own  gate as if they had been middleage serfs or vagabonds and not  citizens of modern england  it may suit the mr lyles of this age thought lancelot to make  the people constantly and visibly comprehend that property is their  protector and their friend but i question whether it will suit the  people themselves unless they can make property understand that it  owes them something more definite than protection  saddened by this conversation which had helped to give another  shake to the easygoing complacency with which lancelot had been  used to contemplate the world below him and look on its evils as  necessaries ancient and fixed as the universe he entered the  village fair and was a little disappointed at his first glimpse of  the villagegreen  certainly his expectations had not been very  exalted but there had run through them a hope of something  melodramatic dreams of maypole dancing and athletic games  somewhat of villagebelle rivalry of the corin and sylvia school  or failing that a few touchstones and audreys some genial earnest  buffo humour here and there  but there did not seem much likelihood  of it  two or three apple and gingerbread stalls from which  draggled children were turning slowly and wistfully away to go home  a booth full of trumpery fairings in front of which tawdry girls  were coaxing maudlin youths with faded southernwood in their  buttonholes another long low booth from every crevice of which  reeked odours of stale beer and smoke by courtesy denominated  tobacco to the treble accompaniment of a jigging fiddle and a  tambourine and the bass one of grumbled oaths and curses within these were the means of relaxation which the piety freedom and  civilisation of fourteen centuries from hengist to queen victoria  had devised and made possible for the english peasant  there seems very little here to see said lancelot half  peevishly  i think sir quoth tregarva that very thing is whats most  worth seeing  lancelot could not help even at the risk of detection investing  capital enough in sugarplums and gingerbread to furnish the  urchins around with the material for a whole carnival of stomach aches and he felt a great inclination to clear the fairingstall in  a like manner on behalf of the poor bedizened sicklylooking girls  round but he was afraid of the jealousy of some beerbemuddled  swain  the illlooks of the young girls surprised him much  here  and there smiled a plump rosy face enough but the majority seemed  undersized underfed utterly wanting in grace vigour and what  the pennyaliners call rude health  he remarked it to tregarva   the keeper smiled mournfully  you see those little creatures dragging home babies in arms nearly  as big as themselves sir  that and bad food want of milk  especially accounts for their growing up no bigger than they do  and as for their sad countenances sir most of them must carry a  lighter conscience before they carry a brighter face  what do you mean asked lancelot  the clergyman who enters the weddings and the baptisms knows well  enough what i mean sir  but well go into that booth if you want  to see the thick of it sir thats to say if youre not ashamed  i hope we need neither of us do anything to be ashamed of there  and as for seeing i begin to agree with you that what makes the  whole thing most curious is its intense dulness  what upon earth is that  i say look out there  well you look out yourself  this was caused by a violent blow across the shins with a thick  stick the deed of certain drunken wiseacres who were persisting in  playing in the dark the never very lucrative game of three sticks a  penny conducted by a couple of gipsies  poor fellows there was  one excuse for them  it was the only thing there to play at except  a set of skittles and on those they had lost their money every  saturday night for the last seven years each at his own village  beershop  so into the booth they turned and as soon as lancelots eyes were  accustomed to the reeking atmosphere he saw seated at two long  temporary tables of board fifty or sixty of my brethren as  clergymen call them in their sermons wrangling stupid beery with  sodden eyes and drooping lipsinterspersed with more girls and  brazenfaced women with dirty flowers in their caps whose whole  business seemed to be to cast jealous looks at each other and  defend themselves from the coarse overtures of their swains  lancelot had been already perfectly astonished at the foulness of  language which prevailed and the utter absence of anything like  chivalrous respect almost of common decency towards women  but  lo the language of the elder women was quite as disgusting as that  of the men if not worse  he whispered a remark on the point to  tregarva who shook his head  its the fieldwork sirthe fieldwork that does it all  they  get accustomed there from their childhood to hear words whose very  meanings they shouldnt know and the older teach the younger ones  and the married ones are worst of all  it wears them out in body  sir that fieldwork and makes them brutes in soul and in manners  why dont they give it up  why dont the respectable ones set  their faces against it  they cant afford it sir  they must go afield or go hungered  most of them  and they get to like the gossip and scandal and  coarse fun of it while their children are left at home to play in  the roads or fall into the fire as plenty do every year  why not at school  the big ones are kept at home sir to play at nursing those little  ones who are too young to go  oh sir he added in a tone of deep  feeling it is very little of a fathers care or a mothers love  that a labourers child knows in these days  lancelot looked round the booth with a hopeless feeling  there was  awkward dancing going on at the upper end  he was too much sickened  to go and look at it  he began examining the faces and foreheads of  the company and was astonished at the first glance by the lofty and  ample development of brain in at least one half  there were  intellects thereor rather capacities of intellect capable  surely of anything had not the promise of the brow been almost  always belied by the loose and sensual lower features  they were  evidently rather a degraded than an undeveloped race  the low  forehead of the kabyle and koord thought lancelot is compensated  by the grim sharp lip and glittering eye which prove that all the  small capabilities of the man have been called out into clear and  vigorous action  but here the very features themselves both by  what they have and what they want testify against that society  which carelessly wastes her most precious wealth the manhood of her  masses  tregarva you have observed a good many thingsdid you  ever observe whether the men with the large foreheads were better  than the men with the small ones  ay sir i know what you are driving at  ive heard of that new fangled notion of scholars which if youll forgive my plain  speaking expects mans brains to do the work of gods grace  but what have you remarked  all i ever saw was that the stupidlooking ones were the greatest  blackguards and the cleverlooking ones the greatest rogues  lancelot was rebuked but not surprised  he had been for some time  past suspecting from the bitter experience of his own heart the  favourite modern theory which revives the neoplatonism of  alexandria by making intellect synonymous with virtue and then  jumbling like poor bewildered proclus the physical understanding  of the brain with the pure intellect of the spirit  youll see something if you look round sir a great deal easier  to explainand i should have thought a great deal easier to cure than want of wits  and what is that  how differentlooking the young ones are from their fathers and  still more from their grandfathers  look at those three or four old  grammers talking together there  for all their being shrunk with  age and weather you wont see such finegrown men anywhere else in  this booth  it was too true  lancelot recollected now having remarked it before  when at church and having wondered why almost all the youths were  so much smaller clumsier lowerbrained and weakerjawed than  their elders  why is it tregarva  worse food worse lodging worse nursingand im sore afraid  worse blood  there was too much filthiness and drunkenness went on  in the old wartimes not to leave a taint behind it for many a  generation  the prosperity of fools shall destroy them  oh thought lancelot for some young sturdy lancashire or lothian  blood to put new life into the old frozen south saxon veins  even  a drop of the warm enthusiastic celtic would be better than none   perhaps this irish immigration may do some good after all  perhaps it may lancelot  let us hope so since it is pretty nearly  inevitable  sadder and sadder lancelot tried to listen to the conversation of  the men round him  to his astonishment he hardly understood a word  of it  it was half articulate nasal guttural made up almost  entirely of vowels like the speech of savages  he had never before  been struck with the significant contrast between the sharp  clearlydefined articulation the vivid and varied tones of the  gentleman or even of the london streetboy when compared with the  coarse halfformed growls as of a company of seals which he heard  round him  that single fact struck him perhaps more deeply than  any it connected itself with many of his physiological fancies it  was the parent of many thoughts and plans of his afterlife  here  and there he could distinguish a half sentence  an old shrunken man  opposite him was drawing figures in the spilt beer with his pipe stem and discoursing of the glorious times before the great war  when there was more food than there were mouths and more work than  there were hands  poor human nature thought lancelot as he  tried to follow one of those unintelligible discussions about the  relative prices of the loaf and the bushel of flour which ended as  usual in more swearing and more quarrelling and more beer to make  it uppoor human nature always looking back as the german sage  says to some fancied golden age never looking forward to the real  one which is coming  but i say vather drawled out some one they say theres a sight  more money in england now than there was afore the wartime  eees booy said the old man but its got into too few hands  well thought lancelot theres a glimpse of practical sense at  least  and a pedlar who sat next him a bold blackwhiskered  bully from the potteries hazarded a joke  its all along of this new skyandtoughit farming  they used to  spread the money broadcast but now they drills it all in one place  like bonedust under their fancy plants and we poor selfsown chaps  gets none  this garland of fancies was received with great applause whereat  the pedlar emboldened proceeded to observe mysteriously that  donkeys took a beating but horses kicked at it and that theyd  found out that in staffordshire long ago  you want a good chartist  lecturer down here my covies to show you donkeys of labouring men  that you have got iron on your heels if you only knowd how to use  it  and whats the use of rioting asked some one querulously  why if you dont riot the farmers will starve you  and if we do theyd turn sodgersyeomanry as they call it  though there aint a yeoman among them in these parts and then they  takes sword and kills us  so riot or none they has it all their  own way  lancelot heard many more scraps of this sort  he was very much  struck with their dread of violence  it did not seem cowardice  it  was not loyaltythe english labourer has fallen below the  capability of so spiritual a feeling lancelot had found out that  already  it could not be apathy for he heard nothing but complaint  upon complaint bandied from mouth to mouth the whole evening  they  seemed rather sunk too low in body and mindtoo stupefied and  spiritless to follow the example of the manufacturing districts  above all they were too illinformed  it is not mere starvation  which goads the leicester weaver to madness  it is starvation with  educationan empty stomach and a cultivated even though  miscultivated mind  at that instant a huge hulking farmboy rolled into the booth  roaring dolefully the end of a song with a punctuation of his own  invention   hell maak me a lady  zo   vine to be zyure and vaithfully love me  although i bee poorrrr   lancelot would have laughed heartily at him anywhere else but the  whole scene was past a jest and a gleam of pathos and tenderness  seemed to shine even from that doggerela vista as it were of  true genial nature in the far distance  but as he looked round  again what hope he thought of its realisation  arcadian  dreams of pastoral innocence and graceful industry i suppose are  to be henceforth monopolised by the stage or the boudoir  never so  help me god  the ursine howls of the newcomer seemed to have awakened the spirit  of music in the party  coom blackburd gi us zong blackburd bo cried a dozen voices  to an impish darkeyed gipsy boy of some thirteen years old  put n on taable  now then pipe up  what will ee ha  mary gi us mary  i shall make a girls cry quoth blackbird with a grin  don good too they likes it  zing away  and the boy began in a broad country twang which could not  overpower the sad melody of the air or the rich sweetness of his  flutelike voice   young mary walked sadly down through the green clover    and sighed as she looked at the babe at her breast my roses are faded my false love a rover    the green graves they call me come home to your rest  then by rode a soldier in gorgeous arraying    and where is your bridering my fair maid he cried i neer had a bridering by false mans betraying    nor token of love but this babe at my side  tho gold could not buy me sweet words could deceive me    so faithful and lonely till death i must roam oh mary sweet mary look up and forgive me    with wealth and with glory your true love comes home  so give me my own babe those soft arms adorning    ill wed you and cherish you never to stray for its many a dark and a wild cloudy morning    turns out by the noontime a sunshiny day   a bad moral that sir whispered tregarva  better than none answered lancelot  its well if you are right sir for youll hear no other  the keeper spoke truly in a dozen different songs more or less  coarsely but in general with a dash of pathetic sentiment the  same case of lawless love was embodied  it seemed to be their only  notion of the romantic  now and then there was a poaching song  then one of the lowest flash london schoolfilth and allwas  roared in chorus in presence of the women  i am afraid that you do not thank me for having brought you to any  place so unfit for a gentleman said tregarva seeing lancelots  sad face  because it is so unfit for a gentleman therefore i do thank you   it is right to know what ones own flesh and blood are doing  hark to that song sir thats an old one  i didnt think theyd  get on to singing that  the blackbird was again on the table but seemed this time  disinclined to exhibit  out wi un boy it waint burn thy mouth  i be afeard  o who  keeper there  he pointed to tregarva there was a fierce growl round the room  i am no keeper shouted tregarva starting up  i was turned off  this morning for speaking my mind about the squires and now im one  of you to live and die  this answer was received with a murmur of applause and a fellow in  a scarlet merino neckerchief three waistcoats and a fancy  shootingjacket who had been eyeing lancelot for some time sidled  up behind them and whispered in tregarvas ear  perhaps youd like an engagement in our line young man and your  friend there he seems a sporting gent toowe could show him very  pretty shooting  tregarva answered by the first and last oath lancelot ever heard  from him and turning to him as the rascal sneaked off  thats a poaching crimp from london sir tempting these poor boys  to sin and deceit and drunkenness and theft and the hulks  i fancy i saw him somewhere the night of our rowyou understand  so do i sir but theres no use talking of it  blackbird was by this time prevailed on to sing and burst out as  melodious as ever while all heads were cocked on one side in  delighted attention   i zeed a vire o monday night    a vire both great and high but i wool not tell you where my boys    nor wool not tell you why the varmer he comes screeching out    to zave uns new brood mare zays i you and your stock may roast    vor aught us poor chaps care  coorus boys coorus  and the chorus burst out  then heres a curse on varmers all    as

blessed hett  they robs us of our turfing rights    our bits of chips and sticks till poor folks now cant warm their hands    except by varmers ricks       then etc   and again the boys delicate voice rung out the ferocious chorus  with something lancelot fancied of fiendish exultation and every  worn face lighted up with a coarse laugh that indicated no malice but also no mercy  lancelot was sickened and rose to go  as he turned his arm was seized suddenly and firmly  he looked  round and saw a coarse handsome showilydressed girl looking  intently into his face  he shook her angrily off  you neednt be so proud mr smith ive had my hand on the arm of  as good as you  ah you neednt start  i know youi know you i  say well enough  you used to be with him  where is he  whom do you mean  he answered the girl with a fierce surprised look as if there  could be no one else in the world  colonel bracebridge whispered tregarva  ay he it is  and now walk further off bloodhound and let me  speak to mr smith  he is in norway she ran on eagerly  when  will he be back  when  why do you want to know asked lancelot  when will he be backshe kept on fiercely repeating the  question and then burst outcurse you gentlemen all  cowards  you are all in a league against us poor girls  you can hunt alone  when you betray us and lie fast enough then  but when we come for  justice you all herd together like a flock of rooks and turn so  delicate and honourable all of a suddento each other  when will  he be back i say  in a month answered lancelot who saw that something really  important lay behind the girls wildness  too late she cried wildly clapping her hands together too  late  heretell him you saw me tell him you saw mary tell him  where and in what a pretty place too for maid master or man   what are you doing here  what is that to you my good girl  true  tell him you saw me here and tell him when next he hears  of me it will be in a very different place  she turned and vanished among the crowd  lancelot almost ran out  into the nightinto a triad of fights two drunken men two  jealous wives and a brute who struck a poor thin wornout woman  for trying to coax him home  lancelot rushed up to interfere but a  man seized his uplifted arm  hell only beat her all the more when he getteth home  she has stood that every saturday night for the last seven years  to my knowledge said tregarva and worse too at times  good god is there no escape for her from her tyrant  no sir  its only you gentlefolks who can afford such luxuries  your poor man may be tied to a harlot or your poor woman to a  ruffian but once done done for ever  well thought lancelot we english have a characteristic way of  proving the holiness of the marriage tie  the angel of justice and  pity cannot sever it only the stronger demon of money  their way home lay over ashy down a lofty chalk promontory round  whose foot the river made a sudden bend  as they paced along over  the dreary hedgeless stubbles they both started as a ghostly ha  ha ha rang through the air over their heads and was answered by  a like cry faint and distant across the wolds  thats those stonecurlewsat least so i hope said tregarva   hell be round again in a minute  and again right between them and the clear cold moon ha ha  ha resounded over their heads  they gazed up into the cloudless  starbespangled sky but there was no sign of living thing  its an old sign to me quoth tregarva god grant that i may  remember it in this black day of mine  how so asked lancelot i should not have fancied you a  superstitious man  names go for nothing sir and what my forefathers believed in i am  not going to be conceited enough to disbelieve in a hurry  but if  you heard my story you would think i had reason enough to remember  that devils laugh up there  let me hear it then  well sir it may be a long story to you but it was a short one to  me for it was the making of me out of hand there and then  blessed be god  but if you will have it  and i will have it friend tregarva quoth lancelot lighting his  cigar  i was about sixteen years old just after i came home from the  brazils  what have you been in the brazils  indeed and i have sir for three years and one thing i learnt  there at least thats worth going for  whats that  what the garden of eden must have been like  but those brazils  under god were the cause of my being here for my father who was a  minecaptain lost all his money there by no mans fault but his  own and not his either the world would say and when we came back  to cornwall he could not stand the bal work nor i neither  out of  that burning sun sir to come home here and work in the levels up  to our knees in warm water with the thermometer at 85 degrees and  then up a thousand feet of ladder to grass reeking wet with heat  and find the easterly sleet driving across those open furzecrofts he couldnt stand it sirfew stand it long even of those who stay  in cornwall  we miners have a short lease of life consumption and  strains break us down before were fifty  but how came you here  the doctor told my father and me too sir that we must give up  mining or die of decline  so he came up here to a sister of his  that was married to the squires gardener and here he died and the  squire god bless him and forgive him took a fancy to me and made  me underkeeper  and i loved the life for it took me among the  woods and the rivers where i could think of the brazils and fancy  myself back again  but mustnt talk of thatwhere god wills is all  right  and it is a fine life for reading and thinking a  gamekeepers for its an idle life at best  now thats over he  added with a sigh and the lord has fulfilled his words to me  that he spoke the first night that ever i heard a stoneplover cry  what on earth can you mean asked lancelot deeply interested  why sir it was a wild whirling gray night with the air full of  sleet and rain and my father sent me over to redruth town to bring  home some trade or other  and as i came back i got blinded with the  sleet and i lost my way across the moors  you know those cornish  furzemoors sir  no  well then they are burrowed like a rabbitwarren with old mine shafts  you cant go in some places ten yards without finding  great ghastly black holes covered in with furze and weeds and  bits of rotting timber and when i was a boy i couldnt keep from  them  something seemed to draw me to go and peep down and drop  pebbles in to hear them rattle against the sides fathoms below  till they plumped into the ugly black still water at the bottom   and i used to be always after them in my dreams when i was young  falling down them down down all night long till i woke  screaming for i fancied they were hells mouth every one of them   and it stands to reason sir we miners hold that the lake of fire  cant be far below  for we find it grow warmer and warmer and  warmer the farther we sink a shaft and the learned gentlemen have  proved sir that its not the blasting powder nor the mens  breaths that heat the mine  lancelot could but listen  well sir i got into a great furzecroft full of deads those are  the earthheaps they throw out of the shafts where no man in his  senses dare go forward or back in the dark for fear of the shafts  and the wind and the snow were so sharp they made me quite stupid  and sleepy and i knew if i stayed there i should be frozen to  death and if i went on there were the shafts ready to swallow me  up  and what with fear and the howling and raging of the wind i  was like a mazed boy sir  and i knelt down and tried to pray and  then in one moment all the evil things id ever done and the bad  words and thoughts that ever crossed me rose up together as clear  as one page of a printbook and i knew that if i died that minute i  should go to hell  and then i saw through the ground all the water  in the shafts glaring like blood and all the sides of the shafts  fierce redhot as if hell was coming up  and i heard the knockers  knocking or thought i heard them as plain as i hear that  grasshopper in the hedge now  what are the knockers  they are the ghosts the miners hold of the old jews sir that  crucified our lord and were sent for slaves by the roman emperors  to work the mines and we find their old smeltinghouses which we  call jews houses and their blocks of tin at the bottom of the  great bogs which we call jews tin and theres a town among us  too which we call marketjewbut the old name was marazion that  means the bitterness of zion they tell me  isnt it so sir  i believe it is said lancelot utterly puzzled in this new field  of romance  and bitter work it was for them no doubt poor souls  we used to  break into the old shafts and adits which they had made and find  old stagshorn pickaxes that crumbled to pieces when we brought  them to grass and they say that if a man will listen sir of a  still night about those old shafts he may hear the ghosts of them  at working knocking and picking as clear as if there was a man at  work in the next level  it may be all an old fancy  i suppose it  is  but i believed it when i was a boy and it helped the work in  me that night  but ill go on with my story  go on with what you like said lancelot  well sir i was down on my knees among the furzebushes and i  tried to pray but i was too frightened for i felt the beast i had  been sir and i expected the ground to open and let me down every  moment and then there came by over my head a rushing and a cry   ha ha ha  paul it said and it seemed as if all the devils and  witches were out on the wind alaughing at my misery  oh ill  mendill repent i said indeed i will and again it came  backha ha ha  paul it said  i knew afterwards that it was  a bird but the lord sent it to me for a messenger no less that  night  and i shook like a reed in the water and then all at once  a thought struck me  why should i be a coward  why should i be  afraid of shafts or devils or hell or anything else  if i am a  miserable sinner theres one died for mei owe him love not fear  at all  ill not be frightened into doing rightthats a rascally  reason for repentance  and so it was sir that i rose up like a  man and said to the lord jesus right out into the black dumb  airif youll be on my side this night good lord that died for  me ill be on your side for ever villain as i am if im worth  making any use of  and there and then sir i saw a light come  over the bushes brighter and brighter up to me and there rose up  a voice within me and spoke to me quite soft and sweetfear  not paul for i will send thee far hence unto the gentiles  and  what more happened i cant tell for when i woke i was safe at home   my father and his folk had been out with lanterns after me and  there they found me sure enough in a dead faint on the ground   but this i know sir that those words have never left my mind since  for a day together and i know that they will be fulfilled in me  this tide or never  lancelot was silent a few minutes  i suppose tregarva that you would call this your conversion  i should call it one sir because it was one  tell me now honestly did any real practical change in your  behaviour take place after that night  as much sir as if you put a soul into a hog and told him that he  was a gentlemans son and if every time he remembered that he got  spirit enough to conquer his hoggishness and behave like a man  till the hoggishness died out of him and the manliness grew up and  bore fruit in him more and more each day  lancelot half understood him and sighed  a long silence followed as they paced on past lonely farmyards  from which the rich manurewater was draining across the road in  foul black streams festering and steaming in the chill night air   lancelot sighed as he saw the fruitful materials of food running to  waste and thought of the overpopulation cry and then he looked  across to the miles of brown moorland on the opposite side of the  valley that lay idle and dreary under the autumn moon except where  here and there a squatters cottage and rood of fruitful garden gave  the lie to the laziness and ignorance of man who pretends that it  is not worth his while to cultivate the soil which god has given  him  good heavens he thought had our forefathers had no more  enterprise than modern landlords where should we all have been at  this moment  everywhere waste  waste of manure waste of land  waste of muscle waste of brain waste of populationand we call  ourselves the workshop of the world  as they passed through the miserable hamletstreet of ashy they saw  a light burning in window  at the door below a haggard woman was  looking anxiously down the village  whats the matter mistress cooper asked tregarva  heres mrs granes poor girl lying sick of the feverthe lord  help her and the boy died of it last week  we sent for the doctor  this afternoon and hes busy with a poor soul thats in her  trouble and now weve sent down to the squires and the young  ladies god bless them sent answer theyd come themselves  straightway  no wonder you have typhus here said lancelot with this filthy  open drain running right before the door  why cant you clean it  out  why what harm does that do answered the woman peevishly   besides heres my master gets up to his work by five in the  morning and not back till seven at night and by then he aint in  no humour to clean out gutters  and wheres the water to come from  to keep a place clean  it costs many a one of us here a shilling a  week the summer through to pay fetching water up the hill  weve  work enough to fill our kettles  the muck must just lie in the  road smell or none till the rain carries it away  lancelot sighed again  it would be a good thing for ashy tregarva if the weirpool did  some fine morning run up to ashy down as poor harry verney said on  his deathbed  there wont be much of ashy left by that time sir if the  landlords go on pulling down cottages at their present rate driving  the people into the towns to herd together there like hogs and  walk out to their work four or five miles every morning  why said lancelot wherever one goes one sees commodious new  cottages springing up  wherever you go sir but what of wherever you dont go  along the  roadsides and round the gentlemens parks where the cottages are  in sight its all very smart but just go into the outlying  hamletsa whited sepulchre sir is many a great estate outwardly  swept and garnished and inwardly full of all uncleanliness and  dead mens bones  at this moment two cloaked and veiled figures came up to the door  followed by a servant  there was no mistaking those delicate  footsteps and the two young men drew back with fluttering hearts  and breathed out silent blessings on the ministering angels as they  entered the crazy and reeking house  im thinking sir said tregarva as they walked slowly and  reluctantly away that it is hard of the gentlemen to leave all  gods work to the ladies as ninetenths of them do  and i am thinking tregarva that both for ladies and gentlemen  prevention is better than cure  theres a great change come over miss argemone sir  she used not  to be so ready to start out at midnight to visit dying folk  a  blessed change  lancelot thought so too and he thought that he knew the cause of  it  argemones appearance and their late conversation had started a  new covey of strange fancies  lancelot followed them over hill and  dale glad to escape a moment from the mournful lessons of that  evening but even over them there was a cloud of sadness  harry  verneys last words and argemones accidental whisper about a  curse upon the lavingtons rose to his mind  he longed to ask  tregarva but he was afraidnot of the man for there was a  delicacy in his truthfulness which encouraged the most utter  confidence but of the subject itself but curiosity conquered  what did old harry mean about the nunpool he said at last   every one seemed to understand him  ah sir he oughtnt to have talked of it  but dying men at  times see over the dark water into deep thingsdeeper than they  think themselves  perhaps theres one speaks through them  but i  thought every one knew the story  i do not at least  perhaps its so much the better sir  why  i must insist on knowing  it is necessaryproper that is that i should hear everything that concerns  i understand sir so it is and ill tell you  the story goes  that in the old popish times when the nuns held whitford priors  the first mr lavington that ever was came from the king with a  warrant to turn them all out poor souls and take the lands for his  own  and they say the head lady of themprioress or abbess as  they called herwithstood him and cursed him in the name of the  lord for a hypocrite who robbed harmless women under the cloak of  punishing them for sins theyd never committed for they say sir  he went up to court and slandered the nuns there for drunkards and  worse  and she told him that the curse of the nuns of whitford  should be on him and his till they helped the poor in the spirit of  the nuns of whitford and the nunpool ran up to ashy down  that time is not come yet said lancelot  but the worst is to come sir  for he or his sir that night  said or did something to the lady that was more than womans heart  could bear  and the next morning she was found dead and cold  drowned in that weirpool  and there the gentlemans eldest son was  drowned and more than one lavington beside  miss argemones only  brother that was the heir was drowned there too when he was a  little one  i never heard that she had a brother  no sir no one talks of it  there are many things happen in the  great house that you must go to the little house to hear of  but  the countryfolk believe sir that the nuns curse holds true and  they say that whitford folks have been getting poorer and wickeder  ever since that time and will till the nunpool runs up to ashy  and the lavingtons name goes out of whitford priors  lancelot said nothing  a presentiment of evil hung over him  he  was utterly downhearted about tregarva about argemone about the  poor  the truth was he could not shake off the impression of the  scene he had left utterly disappointed and disgusted with the  revel  he had expected as i said before at least to hear  something of pastoral sentiment and of genial frolicsome humour to  see some innocent simple enjoyment  but instead what had he seen  but vanity jealousy hoggish sensuality dull vacuity drudges  struggling for one night to forget their drudgery  and yet withal  those songs and the effect which they produced showed that in  these poor creatures too lay the germs of pathos taste melody  soft and noble affections  what right have we thought he to  hinder their development  art poetry music scienceay even  those athletic and graceful exercises on which we all pride  ourselves which we consider necessary to soften and refine  ourselves what god has given us a monopoly of themwhat is good  for the rich man is good for the poor  overeducation  and what of  that  what if the poor be raised above their station  what right  have we to keep them down  how long have they been our born thralls  in soul as well as in body  what right have we to say that they  shall know no higher recreation than the hogs because forsooth if  we raised them they might refuse to workfor us  are we to fix  how far their minds may be developed  has not god fixed it for us  when he gave them the same passions talents tastes as our own  tregarvas meditations must have been running in a very different  channel for he suddenly burst out after a long silence  its a pity these fairs cant be put down  they do a lot of harm  ruin all the young girls round the dissenters children especially  for they run utterly wild their parents have no hold on them at  all  they tell them that they are children of the devil said lancelot   what wonder if the children take them at their word and act  accordingly  the parson here sir who is a godfearing man enough tried hard  to put down this one but the innkeepers were too strong for him  to take away their only amusement in short  he had much better  have set to work to amuse them himself  his business is to save souls sir and not to amuse them  i dont  see sir what christian people want with such vanities  lancelot did not argue the point for he knew the prejudices of  dissenters on the subject but it did strike him that if tregarvas  brain had been a little less preponderant he too might have found  the need of some recreation besides books and thought  by this time they were at lancelots door  he bid the keeper a  hearty goodnight made him promise to see him next day and went to  bed and slept till nearly noon  when he walked into his breakfastroom he found a note on the table  in his uncles handwriting  the vicars servant had left it an hour  before  he opened it listlessly rang the bell furiously ordered  out his best horse and huddling on his clothes galloped to the  nearest station caught the train and arrived at his uncles bank it had stopped payment two hours before    chapter xiv  whats to be done    yes the bank had stopped  the ancient firm of smith brown jones  robinson and co which had been for some years past expanding from  a solid golden organism into a cobwebtissue and huge balloon of  threadbare paper had at last worn through and collapsed dropping  its car and human contents miserably into the thames mud  why  detail the pitiable postmortem examination resulting  lancelot  sickened over it for many a long day not indeed mourning at his  private losses but at the thorough hollowness of the system which  it exposed about which he spoke his mind pretty freely to his  uncle who bore it goodhumouredly enough  indeed the discussions  to which it gave rise rather comforted the good man by turning his  thought from his own losses to general principles  i have ruined  you my poor boy he used to say so you may as well take your  moneys worth out of me in bullying  nothing indeed could  surpass his honest and manly sorrow for having been the cause of  lancelots beggary but as for persuading him that his system was  wrong it was quite impossible  not that lancelot was hard upon  him on the contrary he assured him repeatedly of his conviction  that the precepts of the bible had nothing to do with the laws of  commerce that though the jews were forbidden to take interest of  jews christians had a perfect right to be as hard as they liked on  brother christians that there could not be the least harm in  sharejobbing for though it did to be sure add nothing to the  wealth of the communityonly conjure money out of your neighbours  pocket into your ownyet was not that all fair in trade  if a man  did not know the real value of the shares he sold you you were not  bound to tell him  again lancelot quite agreed with his uncle  that though covetousness might be idolatry yet moneymaking could  not be called covetousness and that on the whole though making  haste to be rich was denounced as a dangerous and ruinous temptation  in st pauls times that was not the slightest reason why it should  be so now  all these concessions were made with a freedom which  caused the good banker to suspect at times that his shrewd nephew  was laughing at him in his sleeve but he could not but subscribe to  them for the sake of consistency though as a staunch protestant it  puzzled him a little at times to find it necessary to justify  himself by getting his infidel nephew to explain away so much of  the bible for him  but men are accustomed to do that nowadays  and so was he  once only did lancelot break out with his real sentiments when the  banker was planning how to reestablish his credit to set to work  in fact to blow over again the same bubble which had already burst  under him  if i were a christian said lancelot like you i would call this  credit system of yours the devils selfish counterfeit of gods  order of mutual love and trust the child of that miserable dream  which as dr chalmers well said expects universal selfishness to  do the work of universal love  look at your credit system hownot  in its abuse but in its very essenceit carries the seeds of self destruction  in the first place a mans credit depends not upon  his real worth and property but upon his reputation for property  daily and hourly he is tempted he is forced to puff himself to  pretend to be richer than he is  the banker sighed and shrugged his shoulders  we all do it my  dear boy  i know it  you must do it or be more than human  there is lie  the first and look at lie the second  this credit system is  founded on the universal faith and honour of men towards men  but  do you think faith and honour can be the children of selfishness   men must be chivalrous and disinterested to be honourable  and you  expect them all to join in universal faitheach for his own selfish  interest  you forget that if that is the prime motive men will be  honourable only as long as it suits that same selfinterest  the banker shrugged his shoulders again  yes my dear uncle said lancelot you all forget it though you  suffer for it daily and hourly though the honourable men among you  complain of the stain which has fallen on the old chivalrous good  faith of english commerce and say that now abroad as well as at  home an englishmans word is no longer worth other mens bonds   you see the evil and you deplore it in disgust  ask yourself  honestly how can you battle against it while you allow in  practice and in theory too except in church on sundays the very  falsehood from which it all springsthat a man is bound to get  wealth not for his country but for himself that in short not  patriotism but selfishness is the bond of all society   selfishness can collect not unite a herd of cowardly wild cattle  that they may feed together breed together keep off the wolf and  bear together  but when one of your wild cattle falls sick what  becomes of the corporate feelings of the herd then  for one man of  your class who is nobly helped by his fellows are not the thousand  left behind to perish  your bible talks of society not as a herd  but as a living tree an organic individual body a holy  brotherhood and kingdom of god  and here is an idol which you have  set up instead of it  but the banker was deaf to all arguments  no doubt he had plenty  for he was himself a just and generousay and a godfearing man in  his way only he regarded lancelots young fancies as too visionary  to deserve an answer which they most probably are else having  been broached as often as they have been they would surely ere  now have provoked the complete refutation which can no doubt be  given to them by hundreds of learned votaries of socalled commerce   and here i beg my readers to recollect that i am in no way  answerable for the speculations either of lancelot or any of his  acquaintances and that these papers have been from beginning to  end as in name so in nature yeastan honest sample of the  questions which good or bad are fermenting in the minds of the  young of this day and are rapidly leavening the minds of the rising  generation  no doubt they are all as full of fallacies as possible  but as long as the saying of the german sage stands true that the  destiny of any nation at any given moment depends on the opinions  of its young men under fiveandtwenty so long it must be worth  while for those who wish to preserve the present order of society to  justify its acknowledged evils somewhat not only to the few young  men who are interested in preserving them but also to the many who  are not  though therefore i am neither plymouth brother nor communist and  as thoroughly convinced as the newspapers can make me that to  assert the duties of property is only to plot its destruction and  that a community of goods must needs imply a community of wives as  every one knows was the case with the apostolic christians i shall  take the liberty of narrating lancelots fanatical conduct without  execratory comment certain that he will still receive his just  reward of condemnation and that if i find facts a sensible public  will find abhorrence for them  his behaviour was indeed most  singular he absolutely refused a good commercial situation which  his uncle procured him  he did not believe in being cured by a  hair of the dog that bit him and he refused also the really  generous offers of the creditors to allow him a sufficient  maintenance  no he said no more pay without work for me  i will earn my  bread or starve  it seems gods will to teach me what poverty isi  will see that his intention is not left half fulfilled  i have  sinned and only in the stern delight of a just penance can i gain  selfrespect  but my dear madman said his uncle you are just the innocent  one among us all  you at least were only a sleeping partner  and therein lies my sin i took money which i never earned and  cared as little how it was gained as how i spent it  henceforth i  shall touch no farthing which is the fruit of a system which i  cannot approve  i accuse no one  actions may vary in rightfulness  according to the age and the person  but what may be right for you  because you think it right is surely wrong for me because i think  it wrong  so with grim determination he sent to the hammer every article he  possessed till he had literally nothing left but the clothes in  which he stood  he could not rest he said till he had pulled  out all his borrowed peacocks feathers  when they were gone he  should be able to see at last whether he was jackdaw or eagle   and wonder not reader at this same strength of will  the very  genius which too often makes its possessor selfindulgent in common  matters from the intense capability of enjoyment which it brings  may also when once his whole being is stirred into motion by some  great object transform him into a hero  and he carried a letter too in his bosom night and day which  routed all coward fears and sad forebodings as soon as they arose  and converted the lonely and squalid lodging to which he had  retired into a fairy palace peopled with bright phantoms of future  bliss  i need not say from whom it came  beloved it ran darling you need not pain yourself to tell me  anything  i know all and i know too do not ask me how your  noble determination to drink the wholesome cup of poverty to the  very dregs  oh that i were with you  oh that i could give you my fortune but  that is not yet alas in my own power  no rather would i share  that poverty with you and strengthen you in your purpose  and yet  i cannot bear the thought of you lonelyperhaps miserable  but  courage though you have lost all you have found me and now you  are knitting me to you for everjustifying my own love to me by  your nobleness and am i not worth all the world to you  i dare say  this to you you will not think me conceited  can we misunderstand  each others hearts  and all this while you are alone  oh i have  mourned for you  since i heard of your misfortune i have not tasted  pleasure  the light of heaven has been black to me and i have  lived only upon love  i will not taste comfort while you are  wretched  would that i could be poor like you  every night upon  the bare floor i lie down to sleep and fancy you in your little  chamber and nestle to you and cover that dear face with kisses   strange that i should dare to speak thus to you whom a few months  ago i had never heard of  wonderful simplicity of love  how all  that is prudish and artificial flees before it  i seem to have  begun a new life  if i could play now it would be only with little  children  farewell be greata glorious future is before you and  me in you  lancelots answer must remain untold perhaps the veil has been  already too far lifted which hides the sanctuary of such love  but  alas to his letter no second had been returned and he feltthough  he dared not confess it to himselfa gloomy presentiment of evil  flit across him as he thought of his fallen fortunes and the  altered light in which his suit would be regarded by argemones  parents  once he blamed himself bitterly for not having gone to mr  lavington the moment he discovered argemones affection and  insuringas he then might have donehis consent  but again he  felt that no sloth had kept him back but adoring reverence for his  godgiven treasure and humble astonishment at his own happiness  and he fled from the thought into renewed examination into the state  of the masses the effect of which was only to deepen his own  determination to share their lot  but at the same time it seemed to him but fair to live as long as  it would last on that part of his capital which his creditors would  have given nothing fornamely his information and he set to work  to write  but alas he had but a small literary connection and  the entree of the initiated ring is not obtained in a day      besides he would not write trashhe was in far too grim a humour  for that and if he wrote on important subjects able editors always  were in the habit of entrusting them to old contributorsmen in  short in whose judgment they had confidencenot to say anything  which would commit the magazine to anything but its own little  partytheory  and behold poor lancelot found himself of no party  whatsoever  he was in a minority of one against the whole world on  all points right or wrong  he had the unhappiest knack as all  geniuses have of seeing connections humorous or awful between the  most seemingly antipodal things of illustrating every subject from  three or four different spheres which it is anathema to mention in  the same page  if he wrote a physicalscience article able editors  asked him what the deuce a scrap of highchurchism did in the middle  of it  if he took the same article to a highchurch magazine the  editor could not commit himself to any theory which made the earth  more than six thousand years old and was afraid that the public  taste would not approve of the allusions to freemasonry and soyers  soup     and worse than that one and alljew turk infidel  and heretic as well as the orthodoxjoined in pious horror at his  irreverencethe shocking way he had of jumbling religion and  politicsthe human and the divinethe theories of the pulpit with  the facts of the exchange     the very atheists who laughed at  him for believing in a god agreed that that at least was  inconsistent with the dignity of the godwho did not exist      it was syncretism     pantheism     very well friends quoth lancelot to himself in bitter rage one  day if you choose to be without god in the world and to honour  him by denying him    do so  you shall have your way and go to  the place whither it seems leading you just now at railroad pace   but i must live     well at least there is some old college  nonsense of mine written three years ago when i believed like  you that all heaven and earth was put together out of separate  bits like a childs puzzle and that each topic ought to have its  private little pigeonhole all to itself in a mans brain like  drugs in a chemists shop  perhaps it will suit you friends  perhaps it will be systemfrozen and narrow and dogmatic and  cowardly and godless enough for you      so he went forth with  them to market and behold they were bought forthwith  there was  verily a demand for such    and in spite of the ten thousand  inkfountains which were daily pouring out similar stygian liquors  the public thirst remained unslaked  well thought lancelot the  negro race is not the only one which is afflicted with manias for  eating dirt     by the bye where is poor luke  ah where was poor luke  lancelot had received from him one short  and hurried note blotted with tears which told how he had informed  his father and how his father had refused to see him and had  forbid him the house and how he had offered him an allowance of  fifty pounds a year it should have been five hundred he said if  he had possessed it which lukes director sensibly enough had  compelled him to accept     and there the letter ended  abruptly leaving the writer evidently in lower depths than he had  either experienced already or expected at all  lancelot had often pleaded for him with his father but in vain   not that the good man was hardhearted  he would cry like a child  about it all to lancelot when they sat together after dinner  but  he was utterly beside himself what with grief shame terror and  astonishment  on the whole the sorrow was a real comfort to him   it gave him something beside his bankruptcy to think of and  distracted between the two different griefs he could brood over  neither  but of the two certainly his sons conversion was the  worst in his eyes  the bankruptcy was intelligiblemeasurable it  was something known and classifiedpart of the ills which flesh  or at least commercial flesh is heir to  but going to rome  i cant understand it  i wont believe it  its so foolish you  see lancelotso foolishlike an ass that eats thistles      there must be some reasonthere must besomething we dont know  sir  do you think they could have promised to make him a cardinal  lancelot quite agreed that there were reasons for it that theyor  at least the bankerdid not know     depend upon it they promised him somethingsome princebishopric  perhaps  else why on earth could a man go over  its out of the  course of nature  lancelot tried in vain to make him understand that a man might  sacrifice everything to conscience and actually give up all worldly  weal for what he thought right  the banker turned on him with angry  resignation  very welli suppose hes done right then  i suppose youll go  next  take up a false religion and give up everything for it   why then he must be honest and if hes honest hes in the right  and i suppose id better go too  lancelot argued  but in vain  the idea of disinterested sacrifice  was so utterly foreign to the good mans own creed and practice  that he could but see one pair of alternatives  either he is a good man or hes a hypocrite  either hes right  or hes gone over for some vile selfish end and what can that be  but money  lancelot gently hinted that there might be other selfish ends  besides pecuniary onessaving ones soul for instance  why if he wants to save his soul hes right  what ought we all  to do but try to save our souls  i tell you theres some sinister  reason  theyve told him that they expect to convert englandi  should like to see them do itand that hell be made a bishop   dont argue with me or youll drive me mad  i know those jesuits  and as soon as he began upon the jesuits lancelot prudently held  his tongue  the good man had worked himself up into a perfect  frenzy of terror and suspicion about them  he suspected concealed  jesuits among his footmen and his housemaids jesuits in his  countinghouse jesuits in his duns     hang it sir how do i know that there aint a jesuit listening to  us now behind the curtain  ill go and look quoth lancelot and suited the action to the  word  well if there aint there might be  theyre everywhere i tell  you  that vicar of whitford was a jesuit  i was sure of it all  along but the man seemed so pious and certainly he did my poor  dear boy a deal of good  but he ruined you you know  and im  convincedno dont contradict me i tell you i wont stand it im convinced that this whole mess of mine is a plot of those  rascalsim as certain of it as if theyd told me  for what end  how the deuce can i tell  am i a jesuit to understand their  sneaking underhandpah  im sick of life  nothing but rogues  wherever one turns  and then lancelot used to try to persuade him to take poor luke back  again  but vague terror had steeled his heart  what  why hed convert us all  hed convert his sisters  hed  bring his priests in here or his nuns disguised as ladies maids  and we should all go over every one of us like a set of nine pins  you seem to think protestantism a rather shaky cause if it is so  easy to be upset  sir  protestantism is the cause of england and christianity and  civilisation and freedom and common sense sir and thats the  very reason why its so easy to pervert men from it and the very  reason why its a lost cause and popery and antichrist and the  gates of hell are coming in like a flood to prevail against it  well thought lancelot that is the very strangest reason for  its being a lost cause  perhaps if my poor uncle believed it  really to be the cause of god himself he would not be in such  extreme fear for it or fancy it required such a hotbed and  greenhouse culture     really if his sisters were little girls  of ten years old who looked up to him as an oracle there would be  some reason in it     but those tall ballgoing flirting  selfsatisfied cousins of minewho would have been glad enough  either of them two months ago to snap up me infidelity bad  character and all as a charming rich young roueif they have not  learnt enough protestantism in the last fiveandtwenty years to  take care of themselves protestantism must have very few  allurements or else be very badly carried out in practice by those  who talk loudest in favour of it     i heard them praising  oblareaways ministry by the bye the other day  so he is up in  town at lastat the summit of his ambition  well he may suit  them  i wonder how many young creatures like argemone and luke he  would keep from popery  but there was no use arguing with a man in such a state of mind and  gradually lancelot gave it up in hopes that time would bring the  good man to his sane wits again and that a fathers feelings would  prove themselves stronger because more divine than a socalled  protestants fears though that would have been in the bankers  eyes and in the jesuits alsoso do extremes meetthe very reason  for expecting them to be the weaker for it is the rule with all  bigots that the right cause is always a lost cause and therefore  requiresgods weapons of love truth and reason being well known  to be too weakto be defended if it is to be saved with the  devils weapons of bad logic spite and calumny  at last in despair of obtaining tidings of his cousin by any other  method lancelot made up his mind to apply to a certain remarkable  man whose conversion had preceded lukes about a year and had  indeed mainly caused it  he went    and was not disappointed  with the most winning  courtesy and sweetness his story and his request were patiently  listened to  the outcome of your speech then my dear sir as i apprehend it  is a request to me to send back the fugitive lamb into the jaws of  the wellmeaning but still lupine wolf  this was spoken with so sweet and arch a smile that it was  impossible to be angry  on my honour i have no wish to convert him  all i want is to have  human speech of himto hear from his own lips that he is content   whither should i convert him  not to my own platformfor i am  nowhere  not to that which he has left    for if he could have  found standing ground there he would not have gone elsewhere for  rest  therefore they went out from you because they were not of you  said the father half aside  most true sir  i have felt long that argument was bootless with  those whose rootideas of deity man earth and heaven were as  utterly different from my own as if we had been created by two  different beings  do you include in that catalogue those ideas of truth love and  justice which are deity itself  have you no common ground in  them  you are an elder and a better man than i     it would be  insolent in me to answer that question except in one way     and  in that you cannot answer it  be it so     you shall see your  cousin  you may make what efforts you will for his reconversion   the catholic church continued he with one of his arch deep meaning smiles is not like popular protestantism driven into  shrieking terror at the approach of a foe  she has too much faith  in herself and in him who gives to her the power of truth to  expect every gay meadow to allure away her lambs from the fold  i assure you that your gallant permission is unnecessary  i am  beginning at least to believe that there is a father in heaven who  educates his children and i have no wish to interfere with his  methods  let my cousin go his way    he will learn something  which he wanted i doubt not on his present path even as i shall  on mine  se tu segui la tua stella is my motto     let it be  his too wherever the star may guide him  if it be a willothe wisp and lead to the morass he will only learn how to avoid  morasses better for the future  ave maris stella  it is the star of bethlehem which he follows     the star of mary immaculate allloving     and he bowed his  head reverently  would that you too would submit yourself to  that guidance     you too would seem to want some loving heart  whereon to rest     lancelot sighed  i am not a child but a man i want not a mother  to pet but a man to rule me  slowly his companion raised his thin hand and pointed to the  crucifix which stood at the other end of the apartment  behold him and he bowed his head once more    and lancelot he  knew not why did the same    and yet in an instant he threw his  head up proudly and answered with george foxs old reply to the  puritans  i want a live christ not a dead one     that is noble     beautiful    it may be true     but it has no message for  me  he died for you  i care for the world and not myself  he died for the world  and has deserted it as folks say now and becomean absentee  performing his work by deputies     do not start the blasphemy  is not mine but those who preach it  no wonder that the owners of  the soil think it no shame to desert their estates when preachers  tell them that he to whom they say all power is given in heaven and  earth has deserted his  what would you have my dear sir asked the father  what the jews had  a king of my nation and of the hearts of my  nation who would teach soldiers artists craftsmen statesmen  poets priests if priests there must be  i want a human lord who  understands me and the millions round me pities us teaches us  orders our history civilisation development for us  i come to  you full of manhood and you send me to a woman  i go to the  protestants full of desires to right the worldand they begin to  talk of the next life and give up this as lost  a quiet smile lighted up the thin wan face full of unfathomable  thoughts and he replied again half to himself  am i god to kill or to make alive that thou sendest to me to  recover a man of his leprosy  farewell  you shall see your cousin  here at noon tomorrow  you will not refuse my blessing or my  prayers even though they be offered to a mother  i will refuse nothing in the form of human love  and the father  blessed him fervently and he went out     what a man said he to himself or rather the wreck of what a  man  oh for such a heart with the thews and sinews of a truly  english brain  next day he met luke in that room  their talk was short and sad   luke was on the point of entering an order devoted especially to the  worship of the blessed virgin  my father has cast me out     i must go to her feet  she will  have mercy though man has none  but why enter the order  why take an irrevocable step  because it is irrevocable because i shall enter an utterly new  life in which old things shall pass away and all things become  new and i shall forget the very names of parent englishman  citizenthe very existence of that strange babel of mans  building whose roar and moan oppress me every time i walk the  street  oh for solitude meditation penance  oh to make up by  bitter selfpunishment my ingratitude to her who has been leading me  unseen for years home to her bosomthe allprevailing mother  daughter of gabriel spouse of deity flower of the earth whom i  have so long despised  oh to follow the example of the blessed  mary of oignies who every day inflicted on her most holy person  eleven hundred stripes in honour of that allperfect maiden  such an honour i could have thought would have pleased better  kali the murdergoddess of the thugs thought lancelot to himself  but he had not the heart to say it and he only replied  so torture propitiates the virgin  that explains the strange story  i read lately of her having appeared in the cevennes and informed  the peasantry that she had sent the potato disease on account of  their neglecting her shrines that unless they repented she would  next year destroy their cattle and the third year themselves  why not asked poor luke  why not indeed  if god is to be capricious proud revengeful  why not the son of god  and if the son of god why not his mother  you judge spiritual feelings by the carnal test of the  understanding your protestant horror of asceticism lies at the root  of all you say  how can you comprehend the selfsatisfaction the  absolute delight of selfpunishment  so far from it i have always had an infinite respect for  asceticism as a noble and manful thingthe only manful thing to my  eyes left in popery and fast dying out of that under jesuit  influence  you recollect the quarrel between the tablet and the  jesuits over fabers unlucky honesty about st rose of lima      but really as long as you honour asceticism as a means of  appeasing the angry deities i shall prefer to st dominics cuirass  or st hedwigas chilblains john myttons two hours crawl on the  ice in his shirt after a flock of wild ducks  they both endured  like heroes but the former for a selfish if not a blasphemous end  the latter as a man should to test and strengthen his own powers  of endurance     there i will say no more  go your way in  gods name  there must be lessons to be learnt in all strong and  selfrestraining action     so you will learn something from the  scourge and the hairshirt  we must all take the bitter medicine of  suffering i suppose  and therefore i am the wiser in forcing the draught on myself  provided it be the right draught and do not require another and  still bitterer one to expel the effects of the poison  i have no  faith in peoples doctoring themselves either physically or  spiritually  i am not my own physician i follow the rules of an infallible  church and the examples of her canonised saints  well    perhaps they may have known what was best for  themselves     but as for you and me here in the year 1849      however we shall argue on for ever  forgive me if i have  offended you  i am not offended  the catholic church has always been a  persecuted one  then walk with me a little way and i will persecute you no more  where are you going  to     to lancelot had not the heart to say whither  to my fathers  ah what a son i would have been to him now in  his extreme need     and he will not let me  lancelot is it  impossible to move him  i do not want to go home again    to  live there     i could not face that though i longed but this  moment to do it  i cannot face the selfsatisfied pitying looks     the everlasting suspicion that they suspect me to be speaking  untruths or proselytising in secret     cruel and unjust  lancelot thought of a certain letter of lukes    but who was he  to break the bruised reed  no i will not see him  better thus better vanish and be known  only according to the spirit by the spirits of saints and  confessors and their successors upon earth  no  i will die and  give no sign  i must see somewhat more of you indeed  i will meet you here then two hours hence  near that houseeven  along the way which leads to iti cannot go  it would be too  painful  too painful to think that you were walking towards it the old house where i was born and bred    and i shut outeven  though it be for the sake of the kingdom of heaven  or for the sake of your own share therein my poor cousin thought  lancelot to himself which is a very different matter  whither after you have been  luke could not get out the word  home  to claude mellots  i will walk part of the way thither with you  but he is a very bad  companion for you  i cant help that  i cannot live and i am going to turn painter   it is not the road in which to find a fortune but still the very  signpainters live somehow i suppose  i am going this very  afternoon to claude mellot and enlist  i sold the last of my  treasured mss to a fifthrate magazine this morning for what it  would fetch  it has been like eating ones own childrenbut at  least they have fed me  so now to fresh fields and pastures  new    chapter xv  deus e machina    when lancelot reached the bankers a letter was put into his hand  it bore the whitford postmark and mrs lavingtons handwriting  he  tore it open it contained a letter from argemone which it is  needless to say he read before her mothers  my beloved my husbandyesthough you may fancy me fickle and  proudi will call you so to the last for were i fickle i could  have saved myself the agony of writing this and as for pride oh  how that darling vice has been crushed out of me  i have rolled at  my mothers feet with bitter tears and vain entreatiesand been  refused and yet i have obeyed her after all  we must write to each  other no more  this one last letter must explain the forced silence  which has been driving me mad with fears that you would suspect me   and now you may call me weak but it is your love which has made me  strong to do thiswhich has taught me to see with new intensity my  duty not only to you but to every human beingto my parents  by  this selfsacrifice alone can i atone to them for all my past  undutifulness  let me then thus be worthy of you  hope that by  this submission we may win even her to change  how calmly i write  but it is only my hand that is calm  as for my heart read  tennysons fatima and then know how i feel towards you  yes i  love youmadly the world would say  i seem to understand now how  women have died of love  ay that indeed would be blessed for then  my spirit would seek out yours and hover over it for ever   farewell beloved and let me hear of you through your deeds  a  feeling at my heart which should not be although it is a sad one  tells me that we shall meet soonsoon  stupefied and sickened lancelot turned carelessly to mrs  lavingtons cover whose blameless respectability thus uttered  itself  i cannot deceive you or myself by saying i regret that providential  circumstances should have been permitted to break off a connection  which i always felt to be most unsuitable and i rejoice that the  intercourse my dear child has had with you has not so far undermined  her principles as to prevent her yielding the most filial obedience  to my wishes on the point of her future correspondence with you   hoping that all that has occurred will be truly blessed to you and  lead your thoughts to another world and to a true concern for the  safety of your immortal soul  i remain yours truly  c  lavington  another world said lancelot to himself  it is most merciful of  you certainly my dear madame to put one in mind of the existence  of another world while such as you have their own way in this one  and thrusting the latter epistle into the fire he tried to collect  his thoughts  what had he lost  the oftener he asked himself the less he found  to unman him  argemones letters were so new a want that the  craving for them was not yet established  his intense imagination  resting on the delicious certainty of her faith seemed ready to  fill the silence with bright hopes and noble purposes  she herself  had said that he would see her soon  but yetbut yetwhy did that  allusion to death strike chilly through him  they were but words a melancholy fancy such as women love at times to play with  he  would toss it from him  at least here was another reason for  bestirring himself at once to win fame in the noble profession he  had chosen  and yet his brain reeled as he went upstairs to his uncles private  room  there however he found a person closeted with the banker whose  remarkable appearance drove everything else out of his mind  he was  a huge shaggy toilworn man the deep melancholy earnestness of  whose rugged features reminded him almost ludicrously of one of  landseers bloodhounds  but withal there was a tendernessa  genial though covert humour playing about his massive features  which awakened in lancelot at first sight a fantastic longing to  open his whole heart to him  he was dressed like a foreigner but  spoke english with perfect fluency  the banker sat listening quite  crestfallen beneath his intense and melancholy gaze in which  nevertheless there twinkled some rays of kindly sympathy  it was all those foreign railways said mr smith pensively  and it serves you quite right answered the stranger  did i not  warn you of the folly and sin of sinking capital in foreign  countries while english land was crying out for tillage and english  poor for employment  my dear friend in a deprecatory tone it was the best possible  investment i could make  and pray who told you that you were sent into the world to make  investments  but  but me no buts or i wont stir a finger towards helping you  what  are you going to do with this money if i procure it for you  work till i can pay back that poor fellows fortune said the  banker earnestly pointing to lancelot  and if i could clear my  conscience of that i would not care if i starved myself hardly if  my own children did  spoken like a man answered the stranger work for that and ill  help you  be a new man once and for all my friend  dont even  make this younker your first object  say to yourself not i will  invest this money where it shall pay me most but i will invest it  where it shall give most employment to english hands and produce  most manufactures for english bodies  in short seek first the  kingdom of god and his justice with this money of yours and see if  all other things profits and suchlike included are not added unto  you  and you are certain you can obtain the money  my good friend the begum of the cannibal islands has more than she  knows what to do with and she owes me a good turn you know  what are you jesting about now  did i never tell you  the new king of the cannibal islands just  like your european ones ran away and would neither govern himself  nor let any one else govern so one morning his ministers getting  impatient ate him and then asked my advice  i recommended them to  put his mother on the throne who being old and tough would run  less danger and since then everything has gone on smoothly as  anywhere else  are you mad thought lancelot to himself as he stared at the  speakers matteroffact face  no i am not mad my young friend quoth he facing right round  upon him as if he had divined his thoughts  ii beg your pardon i did not speak stammered lancelot abashed  at a pair of eyes which could have looked down the boldest mesmerist  in three seconds  i am perfectly well aware that you did not  i must have some talk  with you  ive heard a good deal about you  you wrote those  articles in the  review about george sand did you not  i did  well there was a great deal of noble feeling in them and a great  deal of abominable nonsense  you seem to be very anxious to reform  society  i am  dont you think you had better begin by reforming yourself  really sir answered lancelot i am too old for that wornout  quibble  the root of all my sins has been selfishness and sloth   am i to cure them by becoming still more selfish and slothful  what  part of myself can i reform except my actions and the very sin of  my actions has been as i take it that ive been doing nothing to  reform others never fighting against the world the flesh and the  devil as your prayerbook has it  my prayerbook answered the stranger with a quaint smile  upon my word lancelot interposed the banker with a frightened  look you must not get into an argument  you must be more  respectful  you dont know to whom you are speaking  and i dont much care answered he  life is really too grim  earnest in these days to stand on ceremony  i am sick of blind  leaders of the blind of respectable preachers to the respectable  who drawl out secondhand trivialities which they neither practise  nor wish to see practised  ive had enough all my life of scribes  and pharisees in white cravats laying on man heavy burdens and  grievous to be borne and then not touching them themselves with one  of their fingers  silence sir roared the banker while the stranger threw himself  into a chair and burst into a storm of laughter  upon my word friend mammon heres another of hans andersens ugly  ducks  i really do not mean to be rude said lancelot recollecting  himself but i am nearly desperate  if your heart is in the right  place you will understand me if not the less we talk to each  other the better  most true answered the stranger and i do understand you and  if as i hope we see more of each other henceforth we will see if  we cannot solve one or two of these problems between us  at this moment lancelot was summoned downstairs and found to his  great pleasure tregarva waiting for him  that worthy personage  bowed to lancelot reverently and distantly  i am quite ashamed to intrude myself upon you sir but i could not  rest without coming to ask whether you have had any newshe broke  down at this point in the sentence but lancelot understood him  i have no news he said  but what do you mean by standing off in  that way as if we were not old and fast friends  remember i am as  poor as you are now you may look me in the face and call me your  equal if you will or your inferior i shall not deny it  pardon me sir answered tregarva but i never felt what a real  substantial thing rank is as i have since this sad misfortune of  yours  and i have never till now found out its worthlessness  youre wrong sir you are wrong look at the difference between  yourself and me  when youve lost all you have and seven times  more youre still a gentleman  no man can take that from you  you  may look the proudest duchess in the land in the face and claim her  as your equal while i siri dont mean though to talk of  myselfbut suppose that you had loved a pious and a beautiful lady  and among all your worship of her and your awe of her had felt  that you were worthy of her that you could become her comforter  and her pride and her joy if it wasnt for that accursed gulf that  men had put between you that you were no gentleman that you didnt  know how to walk and how to pronounce and when to speak and when  to be silent not even how to handle your own knife and fork without  disgusting her or how to keep your own body clean and sweetah  sir i see it now as i never did before what a wall all these  little defects build up round a poor man how he longs and struggles  to show himself as he is at heart and cannot till he feels  sometimes as if he was enchanted pent up like folks in fairy  tales in the body of some dumb beast  but sir he went on with  a concentrated bitterness which lancelot had never seen in him  before just because this gulf which rank makes is such a deep one  therefore it looks to me all the more devilish not that i want to  pull down any man to my level i despise my own level too much i  want to rise i want those like me to rise with me  let the rich be  as rich as they willi and those like me covet not money but  manners  why should not the workman be a gentleman and a workman  still  why are they to be shut out from all that is beautiful and  delicate and winning and stately  now perhaps said lancelot you begin to understand what i was  driving at on that night of the revel  it has come home to me lately sir bitterly enough  if you knew  what had gone on in me this last fortnight you would know that i  had cause to curse the state of things which brings a man up a  savage against his will and cuts him off as if he were an ape or a  monster from those for whom the same lord died and on whom the  same spirit rests  is that gods will sir  no it is the devils  will  those whom god hath joined let no man put asunder  lancelot coloured for he remembered with how much less reason he  had been lately invoking in his own cause those very words  he was  at a loss for an answer but seeing to his relief that tregarva  had returned to his usual impassive calm he forced him to sit down  and began questioning him as to his own prospects and employment  about them tregarva seemed hopeful enough  he had found out a  wesleyan minister in town who knew him and had by his means after  assisting for a week or two in the london city mission got some  similar appointment in a large manufacturing town  of the state of  things he spoke more sadly than ever  the rich cannot guess sir  how high illfeeling is rising in these days  its not only those  who are outwardly poorest who long for change the middling people  sir the small town shopkeepers especially are nearly past all  patience  one of the city mission assured me that he has been  watching them these several years past and that nothing could beat  their fortitude and industry and their determination to stand  peaceably by law and order but yet this last year or two things  are growing too bad to bear  do what they will they cannot get  their bread and when a man cannot get that sir  but what do you think is the reason of it  how should i tell sir  but if i had to say i should say this just what they say themselvesthat there are too many of them  go  where you will in town or country youll find halfadozen shops  struggling for a custom that would only keep up one and so theyre  forced to undersell one another  and when theyve got down prices  all they can by fair means theyre forced to get them down lower by  foulto sand the sugar and sloeleave the tea and putsatan only  that prompts em knows whatinto the bread and then they dont  thrivethey cant thrive gods curse must be on them  they begin  by trying to oust each other and eat each other up and while  theyre eating up their neighbours their neighbours eat up them  and so they all come to ruin together  why you talk like mr mill himself tregarva you ought to have  been a political economist and not a city missionary  by the bye  i dont like that profession for you  its the lords work sir  its the very sending to the gentiles  that the lord promised me  i dont doubt it paul but you are meant for other things if not  better  there are plenty of smaller men than you to do that work   do you think that god would have given you that strength that  brain to waste on a work which could be done without them  those  limbs would certainly be good capital for you if you turned a live  model at the academy  perhaps youd better be mine but you cant  even be that if you go to manchester  the giant looked hopelessly down at his huge limbs  well  god  only knows what use they are of just now  but as for the brains  sirin much learning is much sorrow  one had much better work than  read i find  if i read much more about what men might be and are  not and what english soil might be and is not i shall go mad   and that puts me in mind of one thing i came here for though like  a poor rude country fellow as i am i clean forgot it a thinking of look here sir youve given me a sight of books in my time and  god bless you for it  but now i hear thatthat you are determined  to be a poor man like us and that you shant be while paul  tregarva has ought of yours  so ive just brought all the books  back and there they lie in the hall and may god reward you for the  loan of them to his poor child  and so sir farewell and he rose  to go  no paul the books and you shall never part  and i say sir the books and you shall never part  then we two can never partand a sudden impulse flashed over him and we will not part paul  the only man whom i utterly love and  trust and respect on the face of gods earth is you and i cannot  lose sight of you  if we are to earn our bread let us earn it  together if we are to endure poverty and sorrow and struggle to  find out the way of bettering these wretched millions round us let  us learn our lesson together and help each other to spell it out  do you mean what you say asked paul slowly  i do  then i say what you say  where thou goest i will go and where  thou lodgest i will lodge  come what will i will be your servant  for good luck or bad for ever  my equal paul not my servant  i know my place sir  when i am as learned and as wellbred as  you i shall not refuse to call myself your equal and the sooner  that day comes the better i shall be pleased  till then i am your  friend and your brother but i am your scholar too and i shall not  set up myself against my master  i have learnt more of you paul than ever you have learnt of me   but be it as you will only whatever you may call yourself we must  eat at the same table live in the same room and share alike all  this worlds good thingsor we shall have no right to share  together this worlds bad things  if that is your bargain there is  my hand on it  amen quoth tregarva and the two young men joined hands in that  sacred bondnow growing rarer and rarer year by yearthe utter  friendship of two equal manful hearts  and now sir i have promisedand you would have me keep my  promiseto go and work for the city mission in manchesterat  least for the next month till a young mans place who has just  left is filled up  will you let me go for that time and then if  you hold your present mind we will join home and fortunes  thenceforth and go wherever the lord shall send us  theres work  enough of his waiting to be done  i dont doubt but if we are  willing and able he will set us about the thing were meant for  as lancelot opened the door for him he lingered on the steps and  grasping his hand said in a low earnest voice  the lord be with  you sir  be sure that he has mighty things in store for you or he  would not have brought you so low in the days of your youth  and so as john bunyan has it he went on his way and lancelot  saw him no more tillbut i must not outrun the order of time  after all this visit came to lancelot timely  it had roused him to  hope and turned off his feelings from the startling news he had  just heard  he stepped along arm in arm with luke cheerful and  fatedefiant and as he thought of tregarvas complaints  the beautiful he said to himself they shall have it  at least  they shall be awakened to feel their need of it their right to it   what a high destiny to be the artist of the people to devote ones  powers of painting not to mimicking obsolete legends pagan or  popish but to representing to the working men of england the  triumphs of the past and the yet greater triumphs of the future  luke began at once questioning him about his father  and is he contrite and humbled  does he see that he has sinned  in what  it is not for us to judge but surely it must have been some sin or  other of his which has drawn down such a sore judgment on him  lancelot smiled but luke went on not perceiving him  ah we cannot find out for him  nor has he alas as a protestant  much likelihood of finding out for himself  in our holy church he  would have been compelled to discriminate his faults by methodic  selfexamination and lay them one by one before his priest for  advice and pardon and so start a new and free man once more  do you think asked lancelot with a smile that he who will not  confess his faults either to god or to himself would confess them  to man  and would his priest honestly tell him what he really wants  to know which sin of his has called down this socalled judgment   it would be imputed i suppose to some vague generality to  inattention to religious duties to idolatry of the world and so  forth  but a romish priest would be the last person i should  think who could tell him fairly in the present case the cause of  his affliction and i question whether he would give a patient  hearing to any one who told it him  how so  though indeed i have remarked that people are perfectly  willing to be told they are miserable sinners and to confess  themselves such in a general way but if the preacher once begins  to specify to fix on any particular act or habit he is accused of  personality or uncharitableness his hearers are ready to confess  guilty to any sin but the very one with which he charges them  but  surely this is just what i am urging against you protestantsjust  what the catholic use of confession obviates  attempts to do so you mean answered lancelot  but what if your  religion preaches formally that which only remains in our religion  as a fastdying superstitionthat those judgments of god as you  call them are not judgments at all in any fair use of the word but  capricious acts of punishment on the part of heaven which have no  more reference to the fault which provokes them than if you cut off  a mans finger because he made a bad use of his tongue  that is  part but only a part of what i meant just now by saying that  people represent god as capricious proud revengeful  but do not protestants themselves confess that our sins provoke  gods anger  your common creed when it talks rightly of god as one who has no  passions ought to make you speak more reverently of the  possibility of any act of ours disturbing the everlasting equanimity  of the absolute love  why will men so often impute to god the  miseries which they bring upon themselves  because i suppose their pride makes them more willing to confess  themselves sinners than fools  right my friend they will not remember that it is of their  pleasant vices that god makes whips to scourge them  oh i at  least have felt the deep wisdom of that saying of wilhelm meisters  harper that it is   voices from the depth of nature borne which woe upon the guilty head proclaim   of natureof those eternal laws of hers which we daily break  yes  it is not because gods temper changes but because gods universe  is unchangeable that such as i such as your poor father having  sown the wind must reap the whirlwind  i have fed my selfesteem  with luxuries and not with virtue and losing them have nothing  left  he has sold himself to a system which is its own punishment   and yet the last place in which he will look for the cause of his  misery is in that very moneymongering to which he now clings as  frantically as ever  but so it is throughout the world  only look  down over that bridgeparapet at that huge blackmouthed sewer  vomiting its pestilential riches across the mud  there it runs and  will run hurrying to the sea vast stores of wealth elaborated by  natures chemistry into the ready materials of food which proclaim  too by their own foul smell gods will that they should be buried  out of sight in the fruitful allregenerating grave of earth  there  it runs turning them all into the seeds of pestilence filth and  drunkennessand then when it obeys the laws which we despise and  the pestilence is come at last men will pray against it and  confess it to be a judgment for their sins but if you ask what  sin people will talk about les voiles dairain as fourier says  and tell you that it is presumptuous to pry into gods secret  counsels unless perhaps some fanatic should inform you that the  cholera has been drawn down on the poor by the endowment of maynooth  by the rich  it is most fearful indeed to think that these diseases should be  confined to the poorthat a man should be exposed to cholera  typhus and a host of attendant diseases simply because he is born  into the world an artisan while the rich by the mere fact of  money are exempt from such curses except when they come in contact  with those whom they call on sunday their brethren and on week  days the masses  thank heaven that you do see thatthat in a country calling  itself civilised and christian pestilence should be the peculiar  heritage of the poor  it is past all comment  and yet are not these pestilences a judgment even on them for  their dirt and profligacy  and how should they be clean without water  and how can you wonder  if their appetites sickened with filth and selfdisgust crave  after the ginshop for temporary strength and then for temporary  forgetfulness  every london doctor knows that i speak the truth  would that every london preacher would tell that truth from his  pulpit  then would you too say that god punishes one class for the sins of  another  some would say answered lancelot half aside that he may be  punishing them for not demanding their right to live like human  beings to all those social circumstances which shall not make their  childrens life one long disease  but are not these pestilences a  judgment on the rich too in the truest sense of the word  are  they not the broad unmistakable seal to gods opinion of a state of  society which confesses its economic relations to be so utterly  rotten and confused that it actually cannot afford to save yearly  millions of pounds worth of the materials of food not to mention  thousands of human lives  is not every man who allows such things  hastening the ruin of the society in which he lives by helping to  foster the indignation and fury of its victims  look at that group  of stunted haggard artisans who are passing us  what if one day  they should call to account the landlords whose coveteousness and  ignorance make their dwellings hells on earth  by this time they had reached the artists house  luke refused to enter    he had done with this world and the  painters of this world      and with a tearful last farewell  he turned away up the street leaving lancelot to gaze at his slow  painful steps and abject earthfixed mien  ah thought lancelot here is the end of your anthropology  at  first your ideal man is an angel  but your angel is merely an  unsexed woman and so you are forced to go back to the humanity  after allbut to a woman not a man  and this in the nineteenth  century when men are telling us that the poetic and enthusiastic  have become impossible and that the only possible state of the  world henceforward will be a universal goodhumoured hive of the  franklinbenthamite religion    a vast prosaic cockaigne of steam  mills for grinding sausagesfor those who can get at them  and all  the while in spite of all manchester schools and high and dry  orthodox schools here are the strangest phantasms new and old  sane and insane starting up suddenly into live practical power to  give their prosaic theories the liepopish conversions mormonisms  mesmerisms californias continental revolutions paris days of june     ye hypocrites ye can discern the face of the sky and yet ye  cannot discern the signs of this time  he was ushered upstairs to the door of his studio at which he  knocked and was answered by a loud come in  lancelot heard a  rustle as he entered and caught sight of a most charming little  white foot retreating hastily through the folding doors into the  inner room  the artist who was seated at his easel held up his brush as a  signal of silence and did not even raise his eyes till he had  finished the touches on which he was engaged  and nowwhat do i seethe last man i should have expected  i  thought you were far down in the country  and what brings you to me  with such serious and businesslike looks  i am a penniless youth  what  ruined to my last shilling and i want to turn artist  oh ye gracious powers  come to my arms brother at last with me  in the holy order of those who must work or starve  long have i  wept in secret over the pernicious fulness of your purse  dry your tears then now said lancelot for i neither have ten  pounds in the world nor intend to have till i can earn them  artist ran on mellot ah you shall be an artist indeed  you  shall stay with me and become the english michael angelo or if you  are fool enough go to rome and utterly eclipse overbeck and throw  schadow for ever into the shade  i fine you a supper said lancelot for that execrable attempt at  a pun  agreed  here sabina send to covent garden for huge nosegays and  get out the best bottle of burgundy  we will pass an evening worthy  of horace and with garlands and libations honour the muse of  painting  luxurious dog said lancelot with all your cant about poverty  as he spoke the folding doors opened and an exquisite little  brunette danced in from the inner room in which by the bye had  been going on all the while a suspicious rustling as of garments  hastily arranged  she was dressed gracefully in a loose french  morninggown down which lancelots eye glanced towards the little  foot which however was now hidden in a tiny velvet slipper  the  artists wife was a real beauty though without a single perfect  feature except a most delicious little mouth a skin like velvet  and clear brown eyes from which beamed earnest simplicity and arch  good humour  she darted forward to her husbands friend while her  rippling brown hair fantastically arranged fluttered about her  neck and seizing lancelots hands successively in both of hers  broke out in an accent prettily tinged with french  charmingdelightful  and so you are really going to turn  painter  and i have longed so to be introduced to you  claude has  been raving about you these two years you already seem to me the  oldest friend in the world  you must not go to rome  we shall keep  you mr lancelot positively you must come and live with uswe  shall be the happiest trio in london  i will make you so  comfortable  you must let me cater for youcook for you  and be my study sometimes said lancelot smiling  ah she said blushing and shaking her pretty little fist at  claude that madcap how he has betrayed me  when he is at his  easel he is so in the seventh heaven that he sees nothing thinks  of nothing but his own dreams  at this moment a heavy step sounded on the stairs the door opened  and there entered to lancelots astonishment the stranger who had  just puzzled him so much at his uncles  claude rose reverentially and came forward but sabina was  beforehand with him and running up to her visitor kissed his hand  again and again almost kneeling to him  the dear master she cried what a delightful surprise we have  not seen you this fortnight past and gave you up for lost  where do you come from my dear master asked claude  from going to and fro in the earth and from walking up and down in  it answered he smiling and laying his finger on his lips my  dear pupils  and you are both well and happy  perfectly and doubly delighted at your presence today for your  advice will come in a providential moment for my friend here  ah said the strange man well met once more  so you are going  to turn painter  he bent a severe and searching look on lancelot  you have a painters face young man he said go on and prosper   what branch of art do you intend to study  the ancient italian painters as my first step  ancient it is not four hundred years since perugino died  but i  should suppose you do not intend to ignore classic art  you have divined rightly  i wish in the study of the antique to  arrive at the primeval laws of unfallen human beauty  were phidias and praxiteles then so primeval the world had  lasted many a thousand years before their turn came  if you intend  to begin at the beginning why not go back at once to the garden of  eden and there study the true antique  if there were but any relics of it said lancelot puzzled and  laughing  you would find it very near you young man if you had but eyes to  see it  claude mellot laughed significantly and sabina clapped her little  hands  yet till you take him with you master and show it to him he must  needs be content with the royal academy and the elgin marbles  but to what branch of painting pray said the master to lancelot  will you apply your knowledge of the antique  will you like this  foolish fellow here with a kindly glance at claude fritter  yourself away on nymphs and venuses in which neither he nor any one  else believes  historic art as the highest answered lancelot is my ambition  it is well to aim at the highest but only when it is possible for  us  and how can such a school exist in england now  you english  must learn to understand your own history before you paint it   rather follow in the steps of your turners and landseers and  standfields and creswicks and add your contribution to the present  noble school of naturalist painters  that is the niche in the  temple which god has set you english to fill up just now  these  mens patient reverent faith in nature as they see her their  knowledge that the ideal is neither to be invented nor abstracted  but found and left where god has put it and where alone it can be  represented in actual and individual phenomenain these lies an  honest development of the true idea of protestantism which is  paving the way to the mesothetic art of the future  glorious said sabina  not a single word that we poor creatures  can understand  but our hero who always took a virtuous delight in hearing what he  could not comprehend went on to question the orator  what then is the true idea of protestantism said he  the universal symbolism and dignity of matter whether in man or  nature  but the puritans  were inconsistent with themselves and with protestantism and  therefore god would not allow them to proceed  yet their  repudiation of all art was better than the judaskiss which romanism  bestows on it in the meagre eclecticism of the ancient religious  schools and of your modern overbecks and pugins  the only really  wholesome designer of great power whom i have seen in germany is  kaulbach and perhaps every one would not agree with my reasons for  admiring him in this whitewashed age  but you young sir were  meant for better things than art  many young geniuses have an early  hankering as goethe had to turn painters  it seems the shortest  and easiest method of embodying their conceptions in visible form  but they get wiser afterwards when they find in themselves thoughts  that cannot be laid upon the canvas  come with mei like striking  while the iron is hot walk with me towards my lodgings and we will  discuss this weighty matter  and with a gay farewell to the adoring little sabina he passed an  iron arm through lancelots and marched him down into the street  lancelot was surprised and almost nettled at the sudden influence  which he found this quaint personage was exerting over him  but he  had of late tasted the high delight of feeling himself under the  guidance of a superior mind and longed to enjoy it once more   perhaps they were reminiscences of this kind which stirred in him  the strange fancy of a connection almost of a likeness between his  new acquaintance and argemone  he asked humbly enough why art was  to be a forbidden path to him  besides you are an englishman and a man of uncommon talent unless  your physiognomy belies you and one too for whom god has strange  things in store or he would not have so suddenly and strangely  overthrown you  lancelot started  he remembered that tregarva had said just the  same thing to him that very morning and the to him strange  coincidence sank deep into his heart  you must be a politician the stranger went on  you are bound to  it as your birthright  it has been englands privilege hitherto to  solve all political questions as they arise for the rest of the  world it is her duty now  here or nowhere must the solution be  attempted of those social problems which are convulsing more and  more all christendom  she cannot afford to waste brains like yours  while in thousands of reeking alleys such as that one opposite us  heathens and savages are demanding the rights of citizenship   whether they be right or wrong is what you and such as you have  to find out at this day  silent and thoughtful lancelot walked on by his side  what is become of your friend tregarva  i met him this morning  after he parted from you and had some talk with him  i was sorely  minded to enlist him  perhaps i shall in the meantime i shall  busy myself with you  in what way asked lancelot most strange sir of whose name  much less of whose occupation i can gain no tidings  my name for the time being is barnakill  and as for business as  it is your english fashion to call new things obstinately by old  names careless whether they apply or not you may consider me as a  recruitingsergeant which trade indeed i follow though i am no  more like the popular redcoated ones than your present glorious  constitution is like william the thirds or overbecks high art  like fra angelicos  farewell  when i want you which will be most  likely when you want me i shall find you again  the evening was passed as claude had promised in a truly horatian  manner  sabina was most piquante and claude interspersed his  genial and enthusiastic eloquence with various wise saws of the  prophet  but why on earth quoth lancelot at last do you call him a  prophet  because he is one its his business his calling  he gets his  living thereby as the showman did by his elephant  but what does he foretell  oh son of the earth  and you went to cambridgeare reported to  have gone in for the thing or phantom called the tripos and taken  a first class     did you ever look out the word prophetes in  liddell and scott  why what do you know about liddell and scott  nothing thank goodness i never had time to waste over the crooked  letters  but i have heard say that prophetes means not a  foreteller but an outtellerone who declares the will of a deity  and interprets his oracles  is it not so  undeniably  and that he became a foreteller among heathens at leastas i  consider among all peoples whatsoeverbecause knowing the real  bearing of what had happened and what was happening he could  discern the signs of the times and so had what the world calls a  shrewd guesswhat i like a pantheist as i am denominated should  call a divine and inspired foresightof what was going to happen  a new notion and a pleasant one for it looks something like a  law  i am no scollard as they would say in whitford you know but it  has often struck me that if folks would but believe that the  apostles talked not such very bad greek and had some slight notion  of the received meaning of the words they used and of the absurdity  of using the same term to express nineteen different things the new  testament would be found to be a much simpler and more severely  philosophic book than theologians anthroposophists i call  them fancy  where on earth did you get all this wisdom or foolishness  from the prophet a fortnight ago  who is this prophet  i will know  then you will know more than i do  sabinalight my meerschaum  theres a darling it will taste the sweeter after your lips  and  claude laid his delicate womanlike limbs upon the sofa and looked  the very picture of luxurious nonchalance  what is he you pitiless wretch  fairest hebe fill our prometheus vinctus another glass of  burgundy and find your guitar to silence him  it was the ocean nymphs who came to comfort prometheusand  unsandalled too if i recollect right said lancelot smiling at  sabina  come now if he will not tell me perhaps you will  sabina only blushed and laughed mysteriously  you surely are intimate with him claude  when and where did you  meet him first  seventeen years ago on the barricades of the three days in the  charming little pandemonium called paris he picked me out of a  gutter a boy of fifteen with a musketball through my body mended  me and sent me to a painters studio     the next sejour i had  with him began in sight of the demawend  sabina perhaps you might  like to relate to mr smith that interview and the circumstances  under which you made your first sketch of that magnificent and  littleknown volcano  sabina blushed againthis time scarlet and to lancelots  astonishment pulled off her slipper and brandishing it daintily  uttered some unintelligible threat in an oriental language at the  laughing claude  why you must have been in the east  why not  do you think that figure and that walk were picked up in  stayridden toepinching england     ay in the east and why  not elsewhere  do you think i got my knowledge of the human figure  from the livemodel in the royal academy  i certainly have always had my doubts of it  you are the only man  i know who can paint muscle in motion  because i am almost the only man in england who has ever seen it   artists should go to the cannibal islands for that     jai fait  le grand tour  i should not wonder if the prophet made you take  it  that would be very much as i chose  or otherwise  what do you mean  that if he wills you to go i defy you to stay  eh sabina  well you are a very mysterious pairand a very charming one  so we think ourselvesas to the charmingness    and as for the  mystery    omnia exeunt in mysterium says somebody somewhere or if he dont ought to seeing that it is so  you will be a  mystery some day and a myth and a thousand years hence pious old  ladies will be pulling caps as to whether you were a saint or a  devil and whether you did really work miracles or not as  corroborations of your exsupralunar illumination on social  questions     yes    you will have to submit and see bogy  and enter the eleusinian mysteries  eh sabina  my dear claude what between the burgundy and your usual  foolishness you seem very much inclined to divulge the eleusinian  mysteries  i cant well do that my beauty seeing that if you recollect we  were both turned back at the vestibule for a pair of naughty  children as we are  do be quiet and let me enjoy for once my womans right to the  last word  and in this hopeful state of mystification lancelot went home and  dreamt of argemone  his uncle would and indeed as it seemed could give him very  little information on the question which had so excited his  curiosity  he had met the man in india many years before had  received there from him most important kindnesses and considered  him from experience of oracular wisdom  he seemed to have an  unlimited command of money though most frugal in his private  habits visited england for a short time every few years and always  under a different appellation but as for his real name habitation  or business here or at home the good banker knew nothing except  that whenever questioned on them he wandered off into pantagruelist  jokes and ended in cloudland  so that lancelot was fain to give  up his questions and content himself with longing for the  reappearance of this inexplicable sage    chapter xvi  once in a way    a few mornings afterwards lancelot as he glanced his eye over the  columns of the times stopped short at the beloved name of whitford   to his disgust and disappointment it only occurred in one of those  miserable cases now of weekly occurrence of concealing the birth  of a child  he was turning from it when he saw bracebridges name   another look sufficed to show him that he ought to go at once to the  colonel who had returned the day before from norway  a few minutes brought him to his friends lodging but the times had  arrived there before him  bracebridge was sitting over his untasted  breakfast his face buried in his hands  do not speak to me he said without looking up  it was right of  you to comekind of you but it is too late  he started and looked wildly round him as if listening for some  sound which he expected and then laid his head down on the table   lancelot turned to go  nodo not leave me  not alone for gods sake not alone  lancelot sat down  there was a fearful alteration in bracebridge   his old keen selfconfident look had vanished  he was haggard  lifeweary shamestricken almost abject  his limbs looked quite  shrunk and powerless as he rested his head on the table before him  and murmured incoherently from time to time  my own child  and i never shall have another  no second chance  for those whooh mary  mary you might have waitedyou might have  trusted me  and why should youay why indeed  and such a  pretty baby toojust like his father  lancelot laid his hand kindly on his shoulder  my dearest bracebridge the evidence proves that the child was born  dead  they lie he said fiercely starting up  it cried twice after  it was born  lancelot stood horrorstruck  i heard it last night and the night before that and the night  before that again under my pillow shriekingstiflingtwo little  squeaks like a caught hare and i tore the pillows off iti did  and once i saw it and it had beautiful black eyesjust like its  fatherjust like a little miniature that used to lie on my mothers  table when i knelt at her knee before they sent me out to see  life and eton and the army and crockfords and newmarket and  fine gentlemen and fine ladies and luxury and flattery brought  me to this  oh father father was that the only way to make a  gentleman of your sonthere it is again  dont you hear it under the sofa cushions  tear them off  curse you  save it  and with a fearful oath the wretched man sent lancelot staggering  across the room and madly tore up the cushions  a long postmans knock at the doorhe suddenly rose up quite  collected  the letter  i knew it would come  she need not have written it   i know what is in it  the servants step came up the stairs  poor bracebridge turned to  lancelot with something of his own stately determination  i must be alone when i receive this letter  stay here  and with  compressed lips and fixed eyes he stalked out at the door and shut  it  lancelot heard him stop then the servants footsteps down the  stairs then the colonels treading slowly and heavily went step  by step up to the room above  he shut that door too  a dead  silence followed  lancelot stood in fearful suspense and held his  breath to listen  perhaps he had fainted  no for then he would  have heard a fall  perhaps he had fallen on the bed  he would go  and see  no he would wait a little longer  perhaps he was  praying  he had told lancelot to pray oncehe dared not interrupt  him now  a slight stira noise as of an opening box  thank god  he was at least alive  nonsense  why should he not be alive   what could happen to him and yet he knew that something was going  to happen  the silence was ominousunbearable the air of the room  felt heavy and stifling as if a thunderstorm were about to burst   he longed to hear the man raging and stamping  and yet he could not  connect the thought of one so gay and full of gallant life with the  terrible dread that was creeping over himwith the terrible scene  which he had just witnessed  it must be all a temporary excitement a mistakea hideous dream which the next post would sweep away   he would go and tell him so  no he could not stir  his limbs  seemed leaden his feet felt rooted to the ground as in long  nightmare  and still the intolerable silence brooded overhead  what broke it  a dull stifled report as of a pistol fired against  the ground a heavy fall and again the silence of death  he rushed upstairs  a corpse lay on its face upon the floor and  from among its hair a crimson thread crept slowly across the  carpet  it was all over  he bent over the head but one look was  sufficient  he did not try to lift it up  on the table lay the fatal letter  lancelot knew that he had a  right to read it  it was scrawled misspeltbut there were no  tearblots on the paper  siri am in prisonand where are you  cruel man  where were you  all those miserable weeks while i was coming nearer and nearer to  my shame  murdering dumb beasts in foreign lands  you have  murdered more than them  how i loved you once  how i hate you now   but i have my revenge  your baby cried twice after it was born  lancelot tore the letter into a hundred pieces and swallowed them  for every foot in the house was on the stairs  so there was terror and confusion and running in and out  but  there were no wet eyes there except those of bracebridges groom  who threw himself on the body and would not stir  and then there  was a coroners inquest and it came out in the evidence how the  deceased had been for several days very much depressed and had  talked of voices and apparitions whereat the juryas twelve  honest goodnatured christians were bound to doreturned a verdict  of temporary insanity and in a week more the pennyaliners grew  tired and the world too who never expects anything not even  french revolutions grew tired also of repeatingdear me who  would have expected it and having filled up the colonels place  swaggered on as usual arminarm with the flesh and the devil  bracebridges death had of course a great effect on lancelots  spirit  not in the way of warning thoughsuch events seldom act  in that way on the highest as well as on the lowest minds  after  all your rakes progresses and atheists deathbeds do no more  good than noble george cruikshanks bottle will because every one  knows that they are the exception and not the rule that the  atheist generally dies with a conscience as comfortably callous as a  rhinoceroushide and the rake when old age stops his power of  sinning becomes generally rather more respectable than his  neighbours  the new testament deals very little in appeals ad  terrorem and it would be well if some who fancy that they follow  it would do the same and by abstaining from making hellfire the  chief incentive to virtue cease from tempting many a poor fellow to  enlist on the devils side the only manly feeling he has left personal courage  but yet lancelot was affected  and when on the night of the  colonels funeral he opened at hazard argemones bible and his  eyes fell on the passage which tells how one shall be taken and  another left great honest tears of gratitude dropped upon the  page and he fell on his knees and in bitter selfreproach thanked  the new found upper powers who as he began to hope were leading  him not in vainthat he had yet a life before him wherein to play  the man  and now he felt that the last link was broken between him and all  his late frivolous companions  all had deserted him in his ruin but  this oneand he was silent in the grave  and now from the world  and all its toys and revelry he was parted once and for ever and  he stood alone in the desert like the last arab of a plague stricken tribe looking over the wreck of ancient cities across  barren sands where far rivers gleamed in the distance that seemed  to beckon him away into other climes other hopes other duties   old things had passed awaywhen would all things become new  not yet lancelot  thou hast still one selfish hope one dream of  bliss however impossible yet still cherished  thou art a changed  manbut for whose sake  for argemones  is she to be thy god  then  art thou to live for her or for the sake of one greater than  she  all thine idols are brokenswiftly the desert sands are  drifting over them and covering them inall but onemust that  too be taken from thee  one morning a letter was put into lancelots hands bearing the  whitford postmark  tremblingly he tore it open  it contained a few  passionate words from honoria  argemone was dying of typhus fever  and entreating to see him once again and honoria had with some  difficulty as she hinted obtained leave from her parents to send  for him  his last bank note carried him down to whitford and calm  and determined as one who feels that he has nothing more to lose on  earth and whose torment must henceforth become his element he  entered the priory that evening  he hardly spoke or looked at a soul he felt that he was there on an  errand which none understood that he was moving towards argemone  through a spiritual world in which he and she were alone that in  his utter poverty and hopelessness he stood above all the luxury  even above all the sorrow around him that she belonged to him and  to him alone and the brokenhearted beggar followed the weeping  honoria towards his ladys chamber with the step and bearing of a  lord  he was wrong there were pride and fierceness enough in his  heart mingled with that sense of nothingness of rank money chance  and change yea death itself of all but lovemingled even with  that intense belief that his sorrows were but his just deserts  which now possessed all his soul  and in after years he knew that  he was wrong but so he felt at the time and even then the strength  was not all of earth which bore him manlike through that hour  he entered the room the darkness the silence the cool scent of  vinegar struck a shudder through him  the squire was sitting half  idiotic and helpless in his armchair  his face lighted up as  lancelot entered and he tried to hold out his palsied hand   lancelot did not see him  mrs lavington moved proudly and primly  back from the bed with a face that seemed to say through its tears  i at least am responsible for nothing that occurs from this  interview  lancelot did not see her either  he walked straight up  towards the bed as if he were treading on his own ground  his heart  was between his lips and yet his whole soul felt as dry and hard as  some burntout volcanocrater  a faint voiceoh how faint how changedcalled him from within  the closed curtains  he is there  i know it is he  lancelot my lancelot  silently still he drew aside the curtain the light fell full upon  her face  what a sight  her beautiful hair cut close a ghastly  white handkerchief round her head those bright eyes sunk and  lustreless those ripe lips baked and black and drawn her thin  hand fingering uneasily the coverlidit was too much for him  he  shuddered and turned his face away  quicksighted that love is  even to the last slight as the gesture was she saw it in an  instant  you are not afraid of infection she said faintly  i was not  lancelot laughed aloud as men will at strangest moments sprung  towards her with open arms and threw himself on his knees beside  the bed  with sudden strength she rose upright and clasped him in  her arms  once more she sighed in a whisper to herself once more on  earth  and the room and the spectators and disease itself faded  from around them like vain dreams as she nestled closer and closer  to him and gazed into his eyes and passed her shrunken hand over  his cheeks and toyed with his hair and seemed to drink in magnetic  life from his embrace  no one spoke or stirred  they felt that an awful and blessed spirit  overshadowed the lovers and were hushed as if in the sanctuary of  god  suddenly again she raised her head from his bosom and in a tone in  which her old queenliness mingled strangely with the saddest  tenderness  all of you go away now i must talk to my husband alone  they went leading out the squire who cast puzzled glances toward  the pair and murmured to himself that she was sure to get well now  smith was come  everything went right when he was in the way  so they were left alone  i do not look so very ugly my darling do i  not so very ugly  though they have cut off all my poor hair and i told them so often  not  but i kept a lock for you and feebly she drew from under the  pillow a long auburn tress and tried to wreathe it round his neck  but could not and sunk back  poor fellow he could bear no more  he hid his face in his hands  and burst into a long low weeping  i am very thirsty darling reach meno i will drink no more  except from your dear lips  he lifted up his head and breathed his whole soul upon her lips  his tears fell on her closed eyelids  weeping  noyou must not cry  see how comfortable i am  they  are all so kindsoft bed cool room fresh air sweet drinks sweet  scents  oh so different from that room  what roommy own  listen and i will tell you  sit downput your arm under my head so  when i am on your bosom i feel so strong  god let me last to  tell him all  it was for that i sent for him  and then in broken words she told him how she had gone up to the  fever patient at ashy on the fatal night on which lancelot had last  seen her  shuddering she hinted at the horrible filth and misery  she had seen at the foul scents which had sickened her  a madness  of remorse she said had seized her  she had gone in spite of her  disgust to several houses which she found open  there were worse  cottages there than even her fathers some tradesmen in a  neighbouring town had been allowed to run up a set of rack rent  hovelsanother shudder seized her when she spoke of them and from  that point in her story all was fitful broken like the images of a  hideous dream  every instant those foul memories were defiling her  nostrils  a horrible loathing had taken possession of her  recurring from time to time till it ended in delirium and fever  a  scentfiend was haunting her night and day she said  and now the  curse of the lavingtons had truly come upon her  to perish by the  people whom they made  their neglect cupidity oppression are  avenged on me  why not  have i not wantoned in down and perfumes  while they by whose labour my luxuries were bought were pining  among scents and soundsone day of which would have driven me mad   and then they wonder why men turn chartists  there are those  horrible scents again  save me from them  lancelotdarling  take  me to the fresh air  i choke  i am festering away  the nunpool   take all the water every drop and wash ashy clean again  make a  great fountain in itbeautiful marbleto bubble and gurgle and  trickle and foam for ever and ever and wash away the sins of the  lavingtons that the little rosy children may play round it and the  poor toilbent woman may washand washand drinkwater water  i  am dying of thirst  he gave her water and then she lay back and babbled about the nun pool sweeping all the houses of ashy into one beautiful palace  among great flowergardens where the school children will sit and  sing such merry hymns and never struggle with great pails of water  up the hill of ashy any more  you will do it darling  strong wise noblehearted that you are   why do you look at me  you will be rich some day  you will own  land for you are worthy to own it  oh that i could give you  whitford  no  it was mine too longtherefore i die because i lord jesus have i not repented of my sin  then she grew calm once more  a soft smile crept over her face as  it grew sharper and paler every moment  faintly she sank back on  the pillows and faintly whispered to him to kneel and pray  he  obeyed her mechanically     nonot for me for themfor them  and for yourselfthat you may save them whom i never dreamt that i  was bound to save  and he knelt and prayed    what he alone and those who heard his  prayer can tell           when he lifted up his head at last he saw that argemone lay  motionless  for a moment he thought she was dead and frantically  sprang to the bell  the family rushed in with the physician  she  gave some faint token of life but none of consciousness  the  doctor sighed and said that her end was near  lancelot had known  that all along  i think sir you had better leave the room said mrs lavington  and followed him into the passage  what she was about to say remained unspoken for lancelot seized her  hand in spite of her with frantic thanks for having allowed him  this one interview and entreaties that he might see her again if  but for one moment  mrs lavington somewhat more softly than usual saidthat the  result of this visit had not been such as to make a second  desirablethat she had no wish to disturb her daughters mind at  such a moment with earthly regrets  earthly regrets  how little she knew what had passed there  but  if she had known would she have been one whit softened  for  indeed argemones spirituality was not in her mothers language   and yet the good woman had prayed and prayed and wept bitter  tears by her daughters bedside day after day but she had never  heard her pronounce the talismanic formula of words necessary in  her eyes to ensure salvation and so she was almost without hope for  her  oh bigotry  devil who turnest gods love into mans curse  are not human hearts hard and blind enough of themselves without  thy cursed help  for one moment a storm of unutterable pride and rage convulsed  lancelotthe next instant love conquered and the strong proud man  threw himself on his knees at the feet of the woman he despised and  with wild sobs entreated for one moment moreone only  at that instant a shriek from honoria resounded from the sick  chamber  lancelot knew what it meant and sprang up as men do when  shot through the heartin a moment he was himself again  a new  life had begun for himalone  you will not need to grant my prayer madam he said calmly   argemone is dead    chapter xvii  the valley of the shadow of death    let us pass over the period of dull stupefied misery that followed  when lancelot had returned to his lonely lodging and the excitement  of his feelings had died away  it is impossible to describe that  which could not be separated into parts in which there was no  foreground no distance but only one dead black colourless  present  after a time however he began to find that fancies  almost ridiculously trivial arrested and absorbed his attention  even as when our eyes have become accustomed to darkness every  lightcoloured mote shows luminous against the void blackness of  night  so we are tempted to unseemly frivolity in churches and at  funerals and all most solemn moments and so lancelot found his  imagination fluttering back half amused to every smallest  circumstance of the last few weeks as objects of mere curiosity  and found with astonishment that they had lost their power of  paining him  just as victims on the rack have fallen it is said  by length of torture into insensibility and even calm repose his  brain had been wrought until all feeling was benumbed  he began to  think what an interesting autobiography his life might make and the  events of the last few years began to arrange themselves in a most  attractive dramatic form  he began even to work out a scene or two  and where motives seemed wanting to invent them here and there   he sat thus for hours silent over his fire playing with his old  self as though it were a thing which did not belong to hima suit  of clothes which he had put off and which   for that it was too rich to hang by the wall it must be ripped   and then pieced and dizened out afresh as a toy  and then again he  started away from his own thoughts at finding himself on the edge  of that very gulf which as mellot had lately told him barnakill  denounced as the true hell of genius where art is regarded as an  end and not a means and objects are interesting not in as far as  they form our spirits but in proportion as they can be shaped into  effective parts of some beautiful whole  but whether it was a  temptation or none the desire recurred to him again and again  he  even attempted to write but sickened at the sight of the first  words  he turned to his pencil and tried to represent with it one  scene at least and with the horrible calmness of some self torturing ascetic he sat down to sketch a drawing of himself and  argemone on her dying day with her head upon his bosom for the last  timeand then tossed it angrily into the fire partly because he  felt just as he had in his attempts to write that there was  something more in all these events than he could utter by pen or  pencil than he could even understand principally because he could  not arrange the attitudes gracefully enough  and now in front of  the stern realities of sorrow and death he began to see a meaning  in another mysterious saying of barnakills which mellot was  continually quoting that art was never art till it was more than  art that the finite only existed as a body of the infinite and  that the man of genius must first know the infinite unless he  wished to become not a poet but a maker of idols  still he felt  in himself a capability nay an infinite longing to speak though  what he should utter or howwhether as poet social theorist  preacher he could not yet decide  barnakill had forbidden him  painting and though he hardly knew why he dared not disobey him   but argemones dying words lay on him as a divine command to labour   all his doubts his social observations his dreams of the beautiful  and the blissful his intense perception of social evils his new born hopefaith it could not yet be calledin a ruler and  deliverer of the world all urged him on to labour  but at what   he felt as if he were the demon in the legend condemned to twine  endless ropes of sand  the world outside which he now stood for  good and evil seemed to him like some frantic whirling waltz some  serried struggling crowd which rushed past him in aimless  confusion without allowing him time or opening to take his place  among their ranks  and as for wings to rise above and to look down  upon the uproar where were they  his melancholy paralysed him more  and more  he was too listless even to cater for his daily bread by  writing his articles for the magazines  why should he  he had  nothing to say  why should he pour out words and empty sound and  add one more futility to the herd of prophets that had become wind  and had no truth in them  those who could write without a  conscience without an object except that of seeing their own fine  words and filling their own pocketslet them do it  for his part  he would have none of it  but his purse was empty and so was his  stomach and as for asking assistance of his uncle it was returning  like the dog to his vomit  so one day he settled all bills with his  last shilling tied up his remaining clothes in a bundle and  stoutly stepped forth into the street to find a jobto hold a  horse if nothing better offered when behold on the threshold he  met barnakill himself  whither away said that strange personage  i was just going to  call on you  to earn my bread by the labour of my hands  so our fathers all  began  and so their sons must all end  do you want work  yes if you have any  follow me and carry a trunk home from a shop to my lodgings  he strode off with lancelot after him entered a mathematical  instrument makers shop in the neighbouring street and pointed out  a heavy corded case to lancelot who with the assistance of the  shopman got it on his shoulders and trudging forth through the  streets after his employer who walked before him silent and  unregarding felt himself for the first time in his life in the same  situation as nine hundred and ninetynine out of every thousand of  adams descendants and discovered somewhat to his satisfaction that  when he could once rid his mind of its old superstition that every  one was looking at him it mattered very little whether the burden  carried were a deal trunk or a downing street despatchbox  his employers lodgings were in st pauls churchyard  lancelot set  the trunk down inside the door  what do you charge  sixpence  barnakill looked him steadily in the face gave him the sixpence  went in and shut the door  lancelot wandered down the street half amused at the simple test  which had just been applied to him and yet sickened with  disappointment for he had cherished a mysterious fancy that with  this strange being all his hopes of future activity were bound up   tregarvas month was nearly over and yet no tidings of him had  come  mellot had left london on some mysterious errand of the  prophets and for the first time in his life he seemed to stand  utterly alone  he was at one pole and the whole universe at the  other  it was in vain to tell himself that his own act had placed  him there that he had friends to whom he might appeal  he would  not he dare not accept outward help even outward friendship  however hearty and sincere at that crisis of his existence  it  seemed a desecration of its awfulness to find comfort in anything  but the highest and the deepest  and the glimpse of that which he  had attained seemed to have passed away from him againseemed to  be something which as it had arisen with argemone was lost with  her alsoone speck of the far blue sky which the rolling clouds  had covered in again  as he passed under the shadow of the huge  sootblackened cathedral and looked at its grim spiked railings and  closed doors it seemed to him a symbol of the spiritual world  clouded and barred from him  he stopped and looked up and tried to  think  the rays of the setting sun lighted up in clear radiance the  huge cross on the summit  was it an omen  lancelot thought so but  at that instant he felt a hand on his shoulder and looked round   it was that strange man again  so far well said he  you are making a better days work than  you fancy and earning more wages  for instance here is a packet  for you  lancelot seized it trembling and tore it open  it was directed in  honorias handwriting  whence had you this said he  through mellot through whom i can return your answer if one be  needed  the letter was significant of honorias character  it busied itself  entirely about facts and showed the depth of her sorrow by making  no allusion to it  argemone as lancelot was probably aware had  bequeathed to him the whole of her own fortune at mrs lavingtons  death and had directed that various precious things of hers should  be delivered over to him immediately  her mother however kept her  chamber under lock and key and refused to allow an article to be  removed from its accustomed place  it was natural in the first  burst of her sorrow and lancelot would pardon  all his drawings  and letters had been by argemones desire placed with her in her  coffin  honoria had been only able to obey her in sending a  favourite ring of hers and with it the last stanzas which she had  composed before her death   twin stars aloft in ether clear    around each other roll away within one common atmosphere    of their own mutual light and day  and myriad happy eyes are bent    upon their changeless love alway as strengthened by their one intent    they pour the flood of life and day  so we through this worlds waning night    shall hand in hand pursue our way shed round us order love and light    and shine unto the perfect day   the precious relic with all its shattered hopes came at the right  moment to soften his hardworn heart  the sight the touch of it  shot like an electric spark through the black stifling thundercloud  of his soul and dissolved it in refreshing showers of tears  barnakill led him gently within the area of the railings where he  might conceal his emotion and it was but a few seconds before  lancelot had recovered his selfpossession and followed him up the  steps through the wicket door  they entered  the afternoon service was proceeding  the organ  droned sadly in its iron cage to a few musical amateurs  some  nursery maids and foreign sailors stared about within the spiked  felons dock which shut off the body of the cathedral and tried in  vain to hear what was going on inside the choir  as a wise author a protestant toohas lately said the scanty service rattled in  the vast building like a dried kernel too small for its shell   the place breathed imbecility and unreality and sleepy lifein death while the whole nineteenth century went roaring on its way  outside  and as lancelot thought though only as a dilettante of  old st pauls the morning star and focal beacon of england through  centuries and dynasties from old augustine and mellitus up to  those pauls cross sermons whose thunders shook thrones and to  noble wrens masterpiece of art he asked whither all this   coleridges dictum that a cathedral is a petrified religion may be  taken to bear more meanings than one  when will life return to this  cathedral system  when was it ever a living system answered the other  when was  it ever anything but a transitionary makeshift since the dissolution  of the monasteries  why then not away with it at once  you english have not done with it yet  at all events it is  keeping your cathedrals rainproof for you till you can put them to  some better use than now  and in the meantime  in the meantime there is life enough in them life that will wake  the dead some day  do you hear what those choristers are chanting  now  not i said lancelot nor any one round us i should think  that is our own fault after all for we were not good churchmen  enough to come in time for vespers  are you a churchman then  yes thank god  there may be other churches than those of europe  or syria and right catholic ones too  but shall i tell you what  they are singing  he hath put down the mighty from their seat and  hath exalted the humble and meek  he hath filled the hungry with  good things and the rich he hath sent empty away  is there no  life think you in those words spoken here every afternoon in the  name of god  by hirelings who neither care nor understand  hush  be not hasty with imputations of evil within walls  dedicated to and preserved by the allgood  even should the  speakers forget the meaning of their own words to my sense  perhaps that may just now leave the words more entirely gods  at  all events confess that whatever accidental husks may have  clustered round it here is a germ of eternal truth  no i dare not  despair of you english as long as i hear your priesthood forced by  providence even in spite of themselves thus to speak gods words  about an age in which the condition of the poor and the rights and  duties of man are becoming the rallyingpoint for all thought and  all organisation  but does it not make the case more hopeless that such words have  been spoken for centuries and no man regards them  you have to blame for that the people rather than the priest  as  they are so will he be in every age and country  he is but the  index which the changes of their spiritual state move up and down  the scale  and as they will become in england in the next half  century so will he become also  and can these dry bones live asked lancelot scornfully  who are you to ask  what were you three months ago for i know  well your story  but do you remember what the prophet saw in the  valley of vision  how first that those same dry bones shook and  clashed together as if uneasy because they were disorganised and  how they then found flesh and stood upright  and yet there was no  life in them till at last the spirit came down and entered into  them  surely there is shaking enough among the bones now  it is  happening to the body of your england as it did to adams after he  was made  it lay on earth the rabbis say forty days before the  breath of life was put into it and the devil came and kicked it  and it sounded hollow as england is doing now but that did not  prevent the breath of life coming in good time nor will it in  englands case  lancelot looked at him with a puzzled face  you must not speak in such deep parables to so young a learner  is my parable so hard then  look around you and see what is the  characteristic of your country and of your generation at this  moment  what a yearning what an expectation amid infinite  falsehoods and confusions of some nobler more chivalrous more  godlike state  your very costermonger trolls out his belief that  theres a good time coming and the hearts of gamins as well as  millenarians answer true  is not that a clashing among the dry  bones  and as for flesh what new materials are springing up among  you every month spiritual and physical for a state such as eye  hath not seen nor ear heardrailroads electric telegraphs  associatelodginghouses clubhouses sanitary reforms  experimental schools chemical agriculture a matchless school of  inductive science an equally matchless school of naturalist  paintersand all this in the very workshop of the world  look  again at the healthy craving after religious art and ceremonial the strong desire to preserve that which has stood the test of time  and on the other hand at the manful resolution of your middle  classes to stand or fall by the bible aloneto admit no  innovations in worship which are empty of instinctive meaning  look  at the enormous amount of practical benevolence which now struggles  in vain against evil only because it is as yet private desultory  divided  how dare you young man despair of your own nation while  its nobles can produce a carlisle an ellesmere an ashley a robert  grosvenorwhile its middle classes can beget a faraday a  stephenson a brooke an elizabeth fry  see i say what a chaos of  noble materials is hereall confused it is truepolarised  jarring and chaotichere bigotry there selfwill superstition  sheer atheism often but only waiting for the one inspiring spirit  to organise and unite and consecrate this chaos into the noblest  polity the world ever saw realised  what a destiny may be that of  your land if you have but the faith to see your own honour  were i  not of my own country i would be an englishman this day  and what is your country asked lancelot  it should be a noble  one which breeds such men as you  the stranger smiled  will you go thither with me  why not  i long for travel and truly i am sick of my own country   when the spirit of which you speak he went on bitterly shall  descend i may return till then england is no place for the  penniless  how know you that the spirit is not even now poured out  must your  english pharisees and sadducees too have signs and wonders ere  they believe  will man never know that the kingdom of god comes  not by observation that now as ever his promise stands true lo  i am with you alway even unto the end of the world  how  many inspired hearts even now may be cherishing in secret the idea  which shall reform the age and fulfil at once the longings of every  sect and rank  name it to me then  who can name it  who can even see it but those who are like him  from whom it comes  them a long and stern discipline awaits  would  you be of them you must like the highest who ever trod this earth  go fasting into the wilderness and among the wild beasts stand  alone face to face with the powers of nature  i will go where you shall bid me  i will turn shepherd among the  scottish mountainslive as an anchorite in the solitudes of  dartmoor  but to what purpose  i have listened long to natures  voice but even the whispers of a spiritual presence which haunted  my childhood have died away and i hear nothing in her but the  grinding of the iron wheels of mechanical necessity  which is the will of god  henceforth you shall study not nature  but him  yet as for placei do not like your english primitive  formations where earth worn out with struggling has fallen  wearily asleep  no you shall rather come to asia the oldest and  yet the youngest continentto our volcanic mountain ranges where  her bosom still heaves with the creative energy of youth around the  primeval cradle of the most ancient race of men  then when you  have learnt the wondrous harmony between man and his dwellingplace  i will lead you to a land where you shall see the highest spiritual  cultivation in triumphant contact with the fiercest energies of  matter where men have learnt to tame and use alike the volcano and  the human heart where the body and the spirit the beautiful and  the useful the human and the divine are no longer separate and  men have embodied to themselves on earth an image of the city not  made with hands eternal in the heavens  where is this land said lancelot eagerly  poor human nature must have its name for everything  you have  heard of the country of prester john that mysterious christian  empire rarely visited by european eye  there are legends of two such said lancelot an ethiopian and an  asiatic one and the ethiopian if we are to believe colonel  harriss journey to shoa is a sufficiently miserable failure  true the day of the chamitic race is past you will not say the  same of our caucasian empire  to our race the present belongsto  england france germany americato us  will you see what we  have done and perhaps bring home after long wanderings a  message for your country which may help to unravel the tangled web  of this strange time  i will said lancelot now this moment  and yet no  there is  one with whom i have promised to share all future weal and woe   without him i can take no step  tregarva  yeshe  what made you guess that i spoke of him  mellot told me of him and of you too six weeks ago  he is now  gone to fetch him from manchester  i cannot trust him here in  england yet  the country made him sad london has made him mad  manchester may make him bad  it is too fearful a trial even for his  faith  i must take him with us  what interest in himnot to say what authority over himhave  you  the same which i have over you  you will come with me so will he   it is my business as my name signifies to save the children alive  whom european society leaves carelessly and ignorantly to die  and  as for my power i come said he with a smile from a country  which sends no one on its errands without first thoroughly  satisfying itself as to his power of fulfilling them  if he goes i go with you  and he will go  and yet think what you do  it is a fearful  journey  they who travel it even as they came naked out of their  mothers wombeven as they return thither and carry nothing with  them of all which they have gotten in this life so must those who  travel to my land  what  tregarva  is he too to give up all  i had thought that i  saw in him a precious possession one for which i would barter all  my scholarship my talentsaymy life itself  a possession worth your life  what then  faith in an unseen god  ask him whether he would call that a possessionhis own in any  sense  he would call it a revelation to him  that is a taking of the veil from something which was behind the  veil already  yes  and which may therefore just as really be behind the veil in other  cases without its presence being suspected  certainly  in what sense now is that a possession  do you possess the sun  because you see it  did herschel create uranus by discovering it  or even increase by an atom its attraction on one particle of his  own body  whither is all this tending  hither  tregarva does not possess his father and his lord he is  possessed by them  but he would sayand i should believe himthat he has seen and  known them not with his bodily eyes but with his soul heart  imaginationcall it what you will  all i know is that between him  and me there is a great gulf fixed  what seen and known them utterly comprehended them  are they not  infinite incomprehensible  can the less comprehend the greater  he knows at least enough of them to make him what i am not  that is he knows something of them  and may not you know  something of them alsoenough to make you what he is not  lancelot shook his head in silence  suppose that you had met and spoken with your father and loved him  when you saw him and yet were not aware of the relation in which  you stood to him still you would know him  not the most important thing of allthat he was my father  is that the most important thing  is it not more important that he  should know that you were his son  that he should support guide  educate you even though unseen  do you not know that some one has  been doing that  that i have been supported guided educated i know full well but  by whom i know not  and i know too that i have been punished   and thereforetherefore i cannot free the thought of a himof a  persononly of a destiny of laws and powers which have no faces  wherewith to frown awful wrath upon me  if it be a person who has  been leading me i must go mad or know that he has forgiven  i conceive that it is he and not punishment which you fear  lancelot was silent a moment     yes  he and not hell at all  is what i fear  he can inflict no punishment on me worse than the  inner hell which i have felt already many and many a time  bona verba  that is an awful thing to say  but better this  extreme than the other     and you wouldwhat  be pardoned  if he loves you he has pardoned you already  how do i know that he loves me  how does tregarva  he is a righteous man and i  am a sinner  he would and rightly call himself the same  but he knows that god loves himthat he is gods child  so then god did not love him till he caused god to love him by  knowing that he loved him  he was not gods child till he made  himself one by believing that he was one when as yet he was not  i  appeal to common sense and logic    it was revealed to tregarva  that god had been loving him while he was yet a bad man  if he  loved him in spite of his sin why should he not have loved you  if he had loved me would he have left me in ignorance of himself   for if he be to know him is the highest good  had he left tregarva in ignorance of himself  no     certainly tregarva spoke of his conversion as of a  turning to one of whom he had known all along and disregarded  then do you turn like him to him whom you have known all along  and disregarded  i  yesyou  if half i have heard and seen of you be true he has  been telling you more and not less of himself than he does to most  men  you for aught i know may know more of him than tregarva  does  the gulf between you and him is this  he has obeyed what he  knewand you have not     lancelot paused a moment then  nodo not cheat me  you said once that you were a churchman  so i am  a catholic of the catholics  what then  who is he to whom you ask me to turn  you talk to me of him as my  father but you talk of him to men of your own creed as the father   you have mysterious dogmas of a three in one  i know them    i  have admired them  in all their formsin the vedas in the neo platonists in jacob boehmen in your catholic creeds in coleridge  and the germans from whom he borrowed i have looked at them and  found in them beautiful phantasms of philosophy    all but  scientific necessities    but  but what  i do not want cold abstract necessities of logic  i want living  practical facts  if those mysterious dogmas speak of real and  necessary properties of his being they must be necessarily  interwoven in practice with his revelation of himself  most true  but how would you have him unveil himself  by unveiling himself  what  to your simple intuition  that was semeles ambition      you recollect the end of that myth  you recollect too as you have  read the neoplatonists the result of their similar attempt  idolatry and magic  true and yet such is the ambition of man you who were just now  envying tregarva are already longing to climb even higher than  saint theresa  i do not often indulge in such an ambition  but i have read in  your schoolmen tales of a beatific vision how that the highest good  for man was to see god  and did you believe that  one cannot believe the impossibleonly regret its impossibility  impossibility  you can only see the uncreate in the createthe  infinite in the finitethe absolute good in that which is like the  good  does tregarva pretend to more  he sees god in his own  thoughts and consciousnesses and in the events of the world around  him imaged in the mirror of his own mind  is your mirror then so  much narrower than his  i have none  i see but myself and the world and far above them  a dim awful unity which is but a notion  fooland slow of heart to believe  where else would you see him  but in yourself and in the world  they are all things cognisable to  you  where else but everywhere would you see him whom no man hath  seen or can see  when he shows himself to me in them then i may see him  but now   you have seen him and because you do not know the name of what you  seeor rather will not acknowledge ityou fancy that it is not  there  how in his name what have i seen  ask yourself  have you not seen in your fancy at least an ideal  of man for which you spurned for mellot has told me all the  merely negative angelicthe merely receptive and indulgent  feminineideals of humanity and longed to be a man like that ideal  and perfect man  i have  and what was your misery all along  was it not that you felt you  ought to be a person with a one inner unity a one practical will  purpose and business given to younot invented by yourselfin the  great order and harmony of the universeand that you were not  onethat your selfwilled fancies and selfpleasing passions had  torn you in pieces and left you inconsistent dismembered  helpless purposeless  that in short you were below your ideal  just in proportion as you were not a person  god knows you speak truth  then must not that ideal of humanity be a person himselfelse how  can he be the ideal man  where is your logic  an impersonal ideal  of a personal species     and what is the most special  peculiarity of man  is it not that he alone of creation is a son  with a father to love and to obey  then must not the ideal man be a  son also  and last but not least is it not the very property of  man that he is a spirit invested with flesh and blood  then must  not the ideal man have once at least taken on himself flesh and  blood also  else how could he fulfil his own idea  yes     yes     that thought too has glanced through my  mind at moments like a lightningflash till i have envied the old  greeks their faith in a human zeus son of kronosa human phoibos  son of zeus  but i could not rest in them  they are noble  but  are theyare anyperfect ideals  the one thing i did and do and  will believe is the one which they do not fulfilthat man is meant  to be the conqueror of the earth matter nature decay death  itself and to conquer them as bacon says by obeying them  hold it fastbut follow it out and say boldly the ideal of  humanity must be one who has conquered natureone who rules the  universeone who has vanquished death itself and conquered them  as bacon says not by violating but by submitting to them  have  you never heard of one who is said to have done this  how do you  know that in this ideal which you have seen you have not seen the  sonthe perfect man who died and rose again and sits for ever  healer and lord and ruler of the universe     staydo not  answer me  have you not besides had dreams of an allfatherfrom  whom in some mysterious way all things and beings must derive  their source and that sonif my theory be trueamong the rest  and above all the rest  who has not  but what more dim or distantmore drearily  hopelessly notional than that thought  only the thought that there is none  but the dreariness was only  in your own inconsistency  if he be the father of all he must be  the father of personshe himself therefore a person  he must be  the father of all in whom dwell personal qualities power wisdom  creative energy love justice pity  can he be their father  unless all these very qualities are infinitely his  does he now  look so terrible to you  i have had this dream too but i turned away from it in dread  doubtless you did  some day you will know why  does that former  dream of a human son relieve this dream of none of its awfulness   may not the type be beloved for the sake of its antitype even if  the very name of allfather is no guarantee for his paternal pity      but you have had this dream  how know you that in it you were  not allowed a glimpse however dim and distant of him whom the  catholics call the father  it may be but  stay again  had you never the sense of a spirit in youa will an  energy an inspiration deeper than the region of consciousness and  reflection which like the wind blew where it listed and you  heard the sound of it ringing through your whole consciousness and  yet knew not whence it came or whither it went or why it drove you  on to dare and suffer to love and hate to be a fighter a  sportsman an artist  and a drunkard added lancelot sadly  and a drunkard  but did it never seem to you that this strange  wayward spirit if anything was the very root and core of your own  personality  and had you never a craving for the help of some  higher mightier spirit to guide and strengthen yours to regulate  and civilise its savage and spasmodic selfwill to teach you your  rightful place in the great order of the universe around to fill  you with a continuous purpose and with a continuous will to do it   have you never had a dream of an inspirera spirit of all  spirits  lancelot turned away with a shudder  talk of anything but that  little you knowand yet you seem to  know everythingthe agony of craving with which i have longed for  guidance the rage and disgust which possessed me when i tried one  pretended teacher after another and found in myself depths which  their spirits could not or rather would not touch  i have been  irreverent to the false from very longing to worship the true i  have been a rebel to sham leaders for very desire to be loyal to a  real one i have envied my poor cousin his jesuits i have envied my  own pointers their slavery to my whip and whistle i have fled as a  last resource to brandy and opium for the inspiration which  neither man nor demon would bestow     then i found    you  know my story     and when i looked to her to guide and inspire  me behold i found myself by the very laws of humanity compelled  to guide and inspire herblind to lead the blindthank god for  her sake that she was taken from me  did you ever mistake these substitutes even the noblest of them  for the reality  did not your very dissatisfaction with them show  you that the true inspirer ought to be if he were to satisfy your  cravings a person trulyelse how could he inspire and teach you  a person yourselfbut an utterly infinite omniscient eternal  person  how know you that in that dream he was not unveiling  himself to youhe the spirit who is the lord and giver of life  the spirit who teaches men their duty and relation to those above  around beneath them the spirit of order obedience loyalty  brotherhood mercy condescension  but i never could distinguish these dreams from each other the  moment that i essayed to separate them i seemed to break up the  thought of an absolute one ground of all things without which the  universe would have seemed a piecemeal chaos and they receded to  infinite distance and became transparent barren notional shadows  of my own brain even as your words are now  how know you that you were meant to distinguish them  how know you  that that very impossibility was not the testimony of fact and  experience to that old catholic dogma for the sake of which you  just now shrank from my teaching  i say that this is so  how do  you know that it is not  but how do i know that it is  i want proof  and you are the man who was five minutes ago crying out for  practical facts and disdaining cold abstract necessities of logic   can you prove that your body exists  no  can you prove that your spirit exists  no  and yet know that they both exist  and how  solvitur ambulando  exactly  when you try to prove either of them without the other  you fail  you arrive if at anything at some barren polar notion   by action alone you prove the mesothetic fact which underlies and  unites them  quorsum haec  hither  i am not going to demonstrate the indemonstrableto give  you intellectual notions which after all will be but reflexes of  my own peculiar brain and so add the green of my spectacles to the  orange of yours and make night hideous by fresh monsters  i may  help you to think yourself into a theoretical tritheism or a  theoretical sabellianism i cannot make you think yourself into  practical and living catholicism  as you of anthropology so i say  of theologysolvitur ambulando  dont believe catholic doctrine  unless you like faith is free  but see if you can reclaim either  society or yourself without it see if he will let you reclaim them   take catholic doctrine for granted act on it and see if you will  not reclaim them  take for granted  am i to come after all to implicit faith  implicit fiddlesticks  did you ever read the novum organum   mellot told me that you were a geologist  well  you took for granted what you read in geological books and went to  the mine and the quarry afterwards to verify it in practice and  according as you found fact correspond to theory you retained or  rejected  was that implicit faith or common sense common  humility and sound induction  sound induction at least  then go now and do likewise  believe that the learned wise and  good for 1800 years may possibly have found out somewhat or have  been taught somewhat on this matter and test their theory by  practice  if a theory on such a point is worth anything at all it  is omnipotent and allexplaining  if it will not work of course  there is no use keeping it a moment  perhaps it will work  i say  it will  but i shall not work it i still dread my own spectacles  i dare  not trust myself alone to verify a theory of murchisons or lyells   how dare i trust myself in this  then do not trust yourself alone  come and see what others are  doing  come and become a member of a body which is verifying by  united action those universal and eternal truths which are too  great for the grasp of any one timeridden individual  not that we  claim the gift of infallibility any more than i do that of perfect  utterance of the little which we do know  then what do you promise me in asking me to go with you  practical proof that these my words are truepractical proof that  they can make a nation all that england might be and is notthe  sight of what a people might become who knowing thus far do what  they know  we believe no more than you but we believe it  come  and seeand yet you will not see facts and the reasons of them  will be as impalpable to you there as here unless you can again  obey your novum organum  how then  by renouncing all your idolsthe idols of the race and of the  market of the study and of the theatre  every national prejudice  every vulgar superstition every remnant of pedantic system every  sentimental like or dislike must be left behind you for the  induction of the world problem  you must empty yourself before god  will fill you  of what can i strip myself more  i know nothing i can do nothing  i hope nothing i fear nothing i am nothing  and you would gain something  but for what purposefor on that  depends your whole success  to be famous great glorious  powerful beneficent  as i live the height of my ambition small though it be is only  to find my place though it were but as a sweeper of chimneys  if i  dare wishif i dare choose it would be only thisto regenerate  one little parish in the whole world    to do that and die for  aught i care without ever being recognised as the author of my own  deeds    to hear them if need be imputed to another and myself  accursed as a fool if i can but atone for the sins of     he paused but his teacher understood him  it is enough he said  come with me tregarva waits for us near   again i warn you you will hear nothing new you shall only see what  you and all around you have known and not done known and done   we have no peculiar doctrines or systems the old creeds are enough  for us  but we have obeyed the teaching which we received in each  and every age and allowed ourselves to be built up generation by  generationas the rest of christendom might have doneinto a  living temple on the foundation which is laid already and other  than which no man can lay  and what is that  jesus christthe man  he took lancelot by the hand  a peaceful warmth diffused itself  over his limbs the droning of the organ sounded fainter and more  faint the marble monuments grew dim and distant and half  unconsciously he followed like a child through the cathedral door    epilogue    i can foresee many criticisms and those not unreasonable ones on  this little booklet it be some excuse at least for me that i have  foreseen them  readers will complain i doubt not of the very  mythical and mysterious denouement of a story which began by things  so gross and palpable as fieldsports and pauperism  but is it not  true that sooner or later omnia exeunt in mysterium  out of  mystery we all came at our birth foxhunters and paupers sages and  saints into mystery we shall all return    at all events when  we die probably as it seems to me some of us will return thither  before we die  for if the signs of the times mean anything they  portend i humbly submit a somewhat mysterious and mythical  denouement to this very age and to those struggles of it which i  have herein attempted clumsily enough to sketch  we are entering  fast i both hope and fear into the region of prodigy true and  false and our greatgrandchildren will look back on the latter half  of this century and ask if it were possible that such things could  happen in an organised planet  the benthamites will receive this  announcement if it ever meets their eyes with shouts of laughter   be it so    nous verrons    in the year 1847 if they will  recollect they were congratulating themselves on the nations having  grown too wise to go to war any more    and in 1848  so it has  been from the beginning  what did philosophers expect in 1792   what did they see in 1793  popery was to be eternal  but the  reformation came nevertheless  rome was to be eternal  but alaric  came  jerusalem was to be eternal  but titus came  gomorrha was  to be eternal i doubt not but the firefloods came     as it  was in the days of noah so shall it be in the days of the son of  man  they were eating drinking marrying and giving in marriage  and the flood came and swept them all away  of course they did not  expect it  they went on saying where is the promise of his  coming  for all things continue as they were from the beginning   most true but what if they were from the beginningover a  volcanos mouth  what if the method whereon things have proceeded  since the creation were as geology as well as history proclaims a  cataclysmic method  what then  why should not this age as all  others like it have done end in a cataclysm and a prodigy and a  mystery  and why should not my little book do likewise  againreaders will probably complain of the fragmentary and  unconnected form of the book  let them first be sure that that is  not an integral feature of the subject itself and therefore the  very form the book should take  do not young men think speak act  just now in this very incoherent fragmentary way without methodic  education or habits of thought with the various stereotyped systems  which they have received by tradition breaking up under them like  ice in a thaw with a thousand facts and notions which they know  not how to classify pouring in on them like a flooda very yeasty  state of mind altogether like a mountain burn in a spring rain  carrying down with it stones sticks peatwater addle grouseeggs  and drowned kingfishers fertilising salts and vegetable poisons not alas without a large crust here and there of sheer froth   yet no heterogeneous confused flooddeposit no fertile meadows  below  and no high water no fishing  it is in the long black  droughts when the water is foul from lowness and not from height  that hydras and desmidiae and rotifers and all uncouth pseud organisms bred of putridity begin to multiply and the fish are  sick for want of a fresh and the cunningest artificial fly is of no  avail and the shrewdest angler will do nothingexcept with a gross  fleshly gilttailed worm or the cannibal bait of roe whereby  parent fishes like competitive barbarisms devour each others  flesh and bloodperhaps their own  it is when the stream is  clearing after a flood that the fish will rise     when will  the flood clear and the fish come on the feed again  next i shall be blamed for having left untold the fate of those  characters who have acted throughout as lancelots satellites  but  indeed their only purpose consisted in their influence on his  development and that of tregarva i do not see that we have any  need to follow them farther  the reader can surely conjecture their  history for himself     he may be pretty certain that they have  gone the way of the world    abierunt ad plures    for this  life or for the next  they have donevery much what he or i might  have done in their placenothing  nature brings very few of her  children to perfection in these days or any other     and for  grace which does bring its children to perfection the quantity and  quality of the perfection must depend on the quantity and quality of  the grace and that again to an awful extentthe giver only knows  to how great an extenton the will of the recipients and therefore  in exact proportion to their lowness in the human scale on the  circumstances which environ them  so my characters are nowvery  much what the reader might expect them to be  i confess them to be  unsatisfactory so are most things  but how can i solve problems  which fact has not yet solved for me  how am i to extricate my  antitypal characters when their living types have not yet  extricated themselves  when the age moves on my story shall move  on with it  let it be enough that my puppets have retreated in  good order and that i am willing to give to those readers who have  conceived something of human interest for them the latest accounts  of their doings  with the exception that is of mellot and sabina  them i confess  to be an utterly mysterious fragmentary little couple  why not   do you not meet with twenty such in the course of your life charming people who for aught you know may be opera folk from  paris or emissaries from the czar or disguised jesuits or  disguised angels    who evidently have a history and a strange  one which you never expect or attempt to fathom who interest you  intensely for a while and then are whirled away again in the great  worldwaltz and lost in the crowd for ever  why should you wish my  story to be more complete than theirs is or less romantic than  theirs may be  there are more things in london as well as in  heaven and earth than are dreamt of in our philosophy  if you but  knew the secret history of that dull gentleman opposite whom you sat  at dinner yesterdaythe real thoughts of that chattering girl whom  you took downomnia exeunt in mysterium i say again  every  human being is a romance a miracle to himself now and will appear  as one to all the world in that day  but now for the rest and squire lavington first  he is a very fair  sample of the fate of the british public for he is dead and buried   and readers would not have me extricate him out of that situation   if you ask news of the reason and manner of his end i can only  answer that like many others he went outas candles do  i  believe he expressed general repentance for all his sinsall at  least of which he was aware  to confess and repent of the state of  the whitford priors estate and of the poor thereon was of course  more than any minister of any denomination whatsoever could be  required to demand of him seeing that would have involved a  recognition of those duties of property of which the good old  gentleman was to the last a staunch denier and which are as yet  seldom supposed to be included in any christian creed catholic or  other  two sermons were preached in whitford on the day of his  funeral one by mr oblareaway on the text from job provided for  such occasions when the ear heard him then it blessed him etc  etc  the other by the baptist preacher on two verses of the  fortyninth psalm  they fancy that their houses shall endure for ever and call the  lands after their own names  yet man being in honour hath no understanding but is compared to  the beasts that perish  waiving the good taste which was probably on a par in both cases  the reader is left to decide which of the two texts was most  applicable  mrs lavington is mrs lavington no longer  she has married to the  astonishment of the world in general that excellent man mr  oblareaway who has been discovered not to be quite as young as he  appeared his graces being principally owing to a brutus wig which  he has now wisely discarded  mrs lavington now sits in state under  her husbands ministry as the leader of the religious world in the  fashionable wateringplace of steamingbath and derives her notions  of the past present and future state of the universe principally  from those two meek and unbiased periodicals the protestant hue andcry and the christian satirist to both of which oblareaway is  a constant contributor  she has taken such an aversion to whitford  since argemones death that she has ceased to have any connection  with that unhealthy locality beyond the popular and easy one of  rentreceiving  oblareaway has never entered the parish to his  knowledge since mr lavingtons funeral and was much pleased the  last time i rode with him at my informing him that a certain  picturesque moorland which he had been greatly admiring was his own  possession     after all he is an excellent man and when i  met a large party at his house the other day and beheld dory and  surmullet champagne and lachryma christi amid all the glory of the  whitford plate    some of it said to have belonged to the altar  of the priory church four hundred years ago i was deeply moved by  the impressive tone in which at the end of a long grace he prayed  that the daily bread of our less favoured brethren might be  mercifully vouchsafed to them     my dear readers would you  have me even if i could extricate him from such an elysium by any  denouement whatsoever  poor dear luke again is said to be painting lean frescoes for the  somethingorotherkirche at munich and the vicar under the name  of father stylites of the order of st philumena is preaching  impassioned sermons to crowded congregations at st georges  bedlam  how can i extricate them from that  no one has come forth  of it yet to my knowledge except by paths whereof i shall use  lessings saying i may have my whole hand full of truth and yet  find good to open only my little finger  but who cares for their  coming out  they are but two more added to the five hundred at  whose moral suicide and dive into the roman avernus a quasi protestant public looks on with a sort of savage satisfaction  crying only didnt we tell you soand more than half hopes that  they will not come back again lest they should be discovered to  have learnt anything while they were there  what are two among that  five hundred much more among the five thousand who seem destined  shortly to follow them  the banker thanks to barnakills assistance is rapidly getting  rich againwho would wish to stop him  however he is wiser on  some points at least than he was of yore  he has taken up the flax  movement violently of lateperhaps owing to some hint of  barnakillstalks of nothing but chevalier claussen and mr  donellan and is very anxious to advance capital to any landlord who  will grow flax on mr warness method either in england or ireland      john bull however has not yet awakened sufficiently to  listen to his overtures but sits up in bed dolefully rubbing his  eyes and bemoaning the evanishment of his protectionist dream altogether realising tolerably he and his land dr watts well known moral song concerning the sluggard and his garden  lord minchampstead again prospers  either the nuns of minchampstead  have left no nemesis behind them like those of whitford or a  certain wisdom and righteousness of his however dim and imperfect  averts it for a time  so as i said he prospers and is hated  especially by his farmers to whom he has just offered long leases  and a sliding cornrent  they would have hated him just the same if  he had kept them at rackrents and he has not forgotten that but  they have  they looked shy at the leases because they bind them to  farm high which they do not know how to do and at the cornrent  because they think that he expects wheat to rise againwhich being  a sensible man he very probably does  but for my storyi  certainly do not see how to extricate him or any one else from  farmers stupidity greed and illwill     that question must  have seven years more freetrade to settle it before i can say  anything thereon  still less can i foreshadow the fate of his  eldest son who has just been rusticated from christ church for  riding one of simmons hacks through a chinashop window especially  as the youth is reported to be given to piquette and strong liquors  and like many noblemens eldest sons is considered not to have  the talent of his father  as for the old lord himself i have no  wish to change or develop him in any wayexcept to cut slips off  him as you do off a willow and plant two or three in every county  in england  let him alone to work out his own plot    we have  not seen the end of it yet but whatever it will be england has  need of him as a transitionstage between feudalism and       for many a day to come  if he be not the ideal landlord he is  nearer it than any we are like yet to see     except one and that after all is lord vieuxbois  let him go on  like a gallant gentleman as he is and prosper  and he will  prosper for he fears god and god is with him  he has much to  learn and a little to unlearn  he has to learn that god is a  living god now as well as in the middle ages to learn to trust not  in antique precedents but in eternal laws  to learn that his  tenants just because they are children of god are not to be kept  children but developed and educated into sons to learn that gods  grace like his love is free and that his spirit bloweth where it  listeth and vindicates its own freewill against our narrow  systems by revealing at times even to nominal heretics and  infidels truths which the catholic church must humbly receive as  the message of him who is wider deeper more tolerant than even  she can be   and he is in the way to learn all this  let him go  on  at what conclusions he will attain he knows not nor do i   but this i know that he is on the path to great and true  conclusions     and he is just about to be married too  that  surely should teach him something  the papers inform me that his  bride elect is lord minchampsteads youngest daughter  that should  be a noble mixture there should be stalwart offspring spiritual as  well as physical born of that intermarriage of the old and the new   we will hope it  perhaps some of my readers who enter into my  inner meaning may also pray for it  whom have i to account for besides  crawythough some of my  readers may consider the mention of him superfluous  but to those  who do not i may impart the news that last month in the union  workhousehe died and may for aught we know have ere this met  squire lavington    he is supposed or at least said to have had  a soul to be saved    as i think a body to be saved also  but  what is one more among so many  and in an overpeopled country like  this too     one must learn to look at thingsand paupersin  the mass  the poor of whitford also  my dear readers i trust you will not  ask me just now to draw the horoscope of the whitford poor or of  any others  really that depends principally on yourselves      but for the present the poor of whitford owing as it seems to  them and me to quite other causes than an overstocked labour market or too rapid multiplication of their species are growing  more profligate reckless pauperised year by year  oblareaway  complained sadly to me the other day that the poorrates were  becoming heavier and heavierhad nearly reached indeed what  they were under the old law     but there is one who does not complain but gives and gives and  stints herself to give and weeps in silence and unseen over the  evils which she has yearly less and less power to stem  for in a darkened chamber of the fine house at steamingbath lies on  a sofa honoria lavingtonbeautiful no more the victim of some  mysterious and agonising disease about which the physicians agree  on one point onlythat it is hopeless  the curse of the  lavingtons is on her and she bears it  there she lies and prays  and reads and arranges her charities and writes little books for  children full of the beloved name which is for ever on her lips   she suffersnone but herself knows how much or how strangelyyet  she is never heard to sigh  she weeps in secretshe has long  ceased to pleadfor others not for herself and prays for them  tooperhaps some day her prayers will yet he answered  but she  greets all visitors with a smile fresh from heaven and all who  enter that room leave it saddened and yet happy like those who  have lingered a moment at the gates of paradise and seen angels  ascending and descending upon earth  there she lieswho could wish  her otherwise  even doctor autotheus maresnest the celebrated  mesmeriser who though he laughs at the resurrection of the lord  is confidently reported to have raised more than one corpse to life  himself was heard to say after having attended her professionally  that her waking bliss and peace although unfortunately  unattributable even to autocatalepsy much less to somnambulist  exaltation was on the whole however unscientific almost as  enviable  there she liesand will lie till she diesthe type of thousands  more the martyrs by the pang without the palm who find no mates  in this life    and yet may find them in the life to come     poor paul tregarva  little he fancies how her days run by     at least there has been no news since that last scene in st pauls  cathedral either of him or lancelot  how their strange teacher has  fulfilled his promise of guiding their education whether they have  yet reached the country of prester john whether indeed that  caucasian utopia has a local and bodily existence or was only used  by barnakill to shadow out that ideal which is as he said of the  garden of eden always near us underlying the actual as the spirit  does its body exhibiting itself step by step through all the  falsehoods and confusions of history and society giving life to all  in it which is not falsehood and decay on all these questions i can  give my readers no sort of answer perhaps i may as yet have no  answer to give perhaps i may be afraid of giving one perhaps the  times themselves are giving at once cheerfully and sadly in  strange destructions and strange births a better answer than i can  give  i have set forth as far as in me lay the data of my  problem  and surely if the premises be given wise men will not  have to look far for the conclusion  in homely english i have given  my readers yeast if they be what i take them for they will be able  to bake with it themselves  and yet i have brought lancelot at leastperhaps tregarva tooto  a conclusion and an allimportant one which whoso reads may find  fairly printed in these pages  henceforth his life must begin anew   were i to carry on the thread of his story continuously he would  still seem to have overleaped as vast a gulf as if i had re introduced him as a grayhaired man  strange that the death of one  of the lovers should seem no complete termination to their history  when their marriage would have been accepted by all as the  legitimate denouement beyond which no information was to be  expected  as if the history of love always ended at the altar   oftener it only begins there and all before it is but a mere  longing to love  why should readers complain of being refused the  future history of one life when they are in most novels cut short  by the marriage finale from the biography of two  but if over and above this any reader should be wroth at my having  left lancelots history unfinished on questions in his opinion more  important than that of love let me entreat him to set manfully  about finishing his own historya far more important one to him  than lancelots  if he shall complain that doubts are raised for  which no solution is given that my hero is brought into  contradictory beliefs without present means of bringing them to  accord into passive acquiescence in vast truths without seeing any  possibility of practically applying themlet him consider well  whether such be not his own case let him if he be as most are  thank god when he finds out that such is his case when he knows at  last that those are most blind who say they see when he becomes at  last conscious how little he believes how little he acts up to that  small belief  let him try to right somewhat of the doubt  confusion customworship inconsistency idolatry within himsome  of the greed bigotry recklessness respectably superstitious  atheism around him and perhaps before his new task is finished  lancelot and tregarva may have returned with a message if not for  himfor that depends upon him having ears to hear ityet possibly  for strong lord minchampstead probably for good lord vieuxbois and  surely for the sinners and the slaves of whitford priors  what it  will be i know not altogether but this i know that if my heroes  go on as they have set forth looking with single mind for some one  ground of human light and love some everlasting rock whereon to  build utterly careless what the building may be howsoever contrary  to
