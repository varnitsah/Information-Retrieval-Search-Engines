 fifth crisis in the kaisers spectrehunt  the crownprinces young life being by perverse chance involved and as it were absorbed in that foolish question of his english marriage we have nothing for it but to continue our sad function and go on painfully fishing out and reducing to an authentic form what traces of him there are from that disastrous beggarly elementtill once he get free of it either dead or alive the winds partly by artmagic rise to the hurricane pitch upon this marriage project and him and as for the sea or general tide of european politicsbut let the reader look with his own eyes  in the spring of 1727 war as anticipated breaks out spaniards actually begin battering at gibraltar kaisers ambassador at london is angrily ordered to begone causes of war were many  1 duke de ripperdatumbled out now that illustrious diplomatic bulldog at madridsought asylum in the english ambassadors house and no respect was had to such asylum that is one cause  2 then you english what is the meaning of these warfleets in the west indies in the mediterranean on the very coast of spain we demand that you at once take them home againwhich cannot be complied with  3 but above all things we demand gibraltar of youwhich can still less be complied with termagant elizabeth has set her heart on gibraltar that in such opportunity as this unexpected condition of the balances now gives her is the real cause of the war  cession of gibraltar there had been vague promises years ago on the kaisers part nay george himself raw to england at that date is said to have thought the thing might perhaps be donedo it at once then said the termagant queen and repeated with ever more emphasisand there being not the least compliance she has opened parallels before the place and begun war and

sputtering of war that is to say siege of gibraltar a siege utterly unmemorable and without the least interest for existing mankind with their ungrateful humorif it be not once more that the father of tristram shandy was in it still a lieutenant of foot poor fellow brisk small hottempered loving liable to be cheated ten times a day if nine will not suffice you he was in this siege shipped to the rock to make stand there and would have done so with the boldestonly he got into duel hottempered though of lamblike innocence and was run through the body not entirely killed but within a hairs breadth of it and unable for service while this sputtering went on little lorry is still living gone to school in yorkshire after pranks enough and misventureshalfdrowning in the millrace at annamoe

remember that he is uncle toby this poor lieutenant and take her measuresthe siege of gibraltar we still see with our eyes was in itself nothing  truly it might well enough have grown to universal flame of war but this always needs two parties and pacific george would not be second party in it george guided by pacific walpole backed by pacific fleury answers the ardent firing by phlegmatic patience and protocolling not by counterfiring except quite at his convenience from privateers from warships here and there and in sulky defence from gibraltar itself probably the termagant with all the fire she has will not do much damage upon gibraltar such was georges hope whereby the flame of war ardent only in certain spanish batteries upon the point of san roque does not spread hithertothough all mortals and friedrich wilhelm as much as any can see the imminent likelihood there is in such circumstances what a stroke of policy to have disjoined friedrich wilhelm from the hanover alliance and brought him over to our own is not grumkow worth his pension grumkow serves honorably let the invaluable seckendorf persevere     crownprince seen in dryasdusts glass darkly  to know the special figure of the crownprinces way of life in those years who his friends companions were what his pursuits and experiences would be agreeable to us but beyond the outline already given there is little definite on record he now resides habitually at potsdam be the court there or not attending strictly to his military duties in the giant regiment it is only on occasion chiefly perhaps in carnival time that he gets to berlin to partake in the gayeties of society who his associates there or at potsdam were suhm the saxon resident a cultivated man of literary turn famed as his friend in time coming is already at his diplomatic post in berlin post of difficulty just now but i know not whether they have yet any intimacy preuss friedrich mit seinen verwandten und freunden p 24 this we do know the crownprince begins to be noted for his sprightly sense his love of literature his ingenuous ways in the court or other circles whatsoever has intelligence attracts him and is attracted by him the roucoulles soireesgone all to dim backram for us though once so lively in their high periwigs and speculationsfall on wednesday when the finkenstein or the others fallno doubt his royal highness knows it in the tabakscollegium there also driven by duty he sometimes appears but like seckendorf and some others he only affects to smoke and his pipe is mere white clay nor is the social element any more than the narcotic vapor which prevails there attractive to the young princethough he had better hide his feelings on the subject  out at potsdam again life goes very heavy the winged psyche much imprisoned in that pipeclay element a prey to vacancy and many tediums and longings daily return the giant drillduties and daily to the uttermost of rigorous perfection they must be donethis then is the sum of ones existence this patience young man of genius as the newspapers would now call you it is indispensably beneficial nevertheless to swallow ones disgusts and do faithfully the ugly commanded work taking no council with flesh and blood know that genius everywhere in nature means this first of all that without this it means nothing generally even less and be thankful for your potsdam grenadiers and their pipeclay  happily he has his books about him his flute duhan too is here still more or less didactic in some branches always instructive and companionable to him the crownprince reads a great deal very many french books new and old he reads among the new we need not doubt the henriade of m arouet junior who now calls himself voltaire which has risen like a star of the first magnitude in these years london 1723 in surreptitious incomplete state la ligue the title then at length london 1726 as henriade in splendid 4toby subscription king prince and princess of

commonplace rise glancings of a starry splendor betokeningoh how much  out of books rumors and experiences young imagination is forming to itself some picture of the world as it is as it has been the curtains of this strange lifetheatre are mounting mountingwondrously as in the case of all young souls but with what specialties moods or phenomena of light and shadow to this young soul is not in any point recorded for us the early letters to wilhelmina which exist in great numbers from these we had hoped elucidation but these the learned editor has wholly withheld as useless for the present let them be carefully preserved on the chance of somebodys arising to whom they may have uses  the worst feature of these years is friedrich wilhelms discontent with them a crownprince sadly out of favor with papa this has long been on the growing hand and these doublemarriage troubles not to mention again the newfangled french tendencies blitz franzosen much aggravate the matter and accelerate its rate of growth already the paternal countenance does not shine upon him flames often and thunders to a shocking degreeand worse days are coming     chapter ii  death of george i  gibraltar still keeps sputtering ardent ineffectual bombardment from the one side sulky heavy blast of response now and then from the other but the fire does not spread nor will we may hope it is true sweden and denmark have joined the treaty of hanover this spring and have troops on foot and money paid them but george is pacific gibraltar is impregnable let the spaniards spend their powder there  as for the kaiser

waroutlooks much dimmed for him since the end of may  alas in the end of june what far other jobspost is this that reaches berlin and queen sophie that george i her royal father has suddenly sunk dead with the solstice or summer pause of the sun 21st or 22d june almost uncertain which the majesty of george i did likewise pausein his carriage on the road to osnabrucknever to move more whereupon among the simple people arose rumors of omens preternaturalisms for and against how his desperate megaera of a wife in the act of dying had summoned him as was presumable to appear along with her at the great judgmentbar within year and day and how he has here done it on the other hand some would have it noted how the nightingales in herrenhausen gardens had all ceased singing for the year that night he diedout of loyalty on the part of these little birds it seemed presumable see kohler munzbelustigungen x 88  what we know is he was journeying towards hanover again hopeful of a little hunting at the gorhde and intended seeing osnabruck and his brother the bishop there as he passed that day 21st june 1727 from some feelings of his own he was in great haste for osnabruck hurrying along by extrapost without real cause save hurry of mind he had left his poor old maypole of a mistress on the dutch frontier that morning to follow at more leisure he was struck by apoplexy on the roadarm fallen powerless early in the day head dim and heavy obviously an alarming case but he refused to stop anywhere refused any surgery but such as could be done at once osnabruck osnabruck he

pity on me so they rushed along all day as at the gallop his few attendants and he and when the shades of night fell and speech had now left the poor man he still passionately gasped some gurgle of a

has flung his big burdensenglish crowns hanoverian crownlets sulkinesses indignations lean women and fat and earthly contradictions and confusionsfairly off him and lies there  the man had his big burdens big honors so called absurd enough some of them in this world but he bore them with a certain gravity and discretion a man of more probity insight and general human faculty than he now gets credit for his word was sacred to him he had the courage of a welf or lionman quietly royal in that respect at least his sense of equity of what was true and honorable in men and things remained uneffaced to a respectable degree and surely it had resisted much wilder puddle of muddy infatuations from without and from within if we consider it wellof irreconcilable incoherences bottomless universal hypocrisies solecisms bred with him and imposed on himfew sons of adam had hitherto lived in  he was in one word the first of our hanover series of english kings that hitherto unique sort who are really strange to look at in the history of the world of whom in the english annals there is hitherto no picture to be had nothing but an empty blur of discordant nonsenses and idle generally angry flourishings of the pen by way of picture the english nation having flung its old puritan swordandbible faith into the cesspoolor rather having set its old biblefaith minus any sword well up in the organloft with plenty of revenue there to preach and organ at discretion on condition always of meddling with nobodys practice fartherthought the same such their mistake a mighty pretty arrangement but found it hitch before long they had to throw out their beautiful nellgwynn defenders of the faith fling them also into the cesspool and were rather at a loss what next to do where is our real king then who is to lead us heavenward then to rally the noble of us to him in some small measure and save the rest and their affairs from running devilwardthe english nation being in some difficulty as to kings the english nation clutched up the readiest that came to hand here is our king said theyagain under mistake still under their old mistake and what was singular they then avenged themselves by mocking calumniating by angrily speaking writing and laughing at the poor mistaken king so clutchedit is high time the english were candidly asking themselves with very great seriousness indeed what it was they had done in the sight of god and man on that and the prior occasion and above all what it is they will now propose to do in the sequel of it dig goldnuggets and rally the ignoble of us  georges poor lean mistress coming on at the usual rate of the road was met next morning by the sad tidings she sprang from her carriage into the dusty highway tore her hair or headdress halffrantic declared herself a ruined woman and drove direct to berlin there to compose her old mind she was not ill seen at court there had her connections in the world fieldmarshal schulenburg who once had the honor of fighting not to his advantage with charles xii and had since grown famous by his antiturk performances in the venetian service is a brother of this poor maypoles and there is a nephew of hers one of friedrich wilhelms fieldofficers here whom we shall meet by and by she has been obliging to queen sophie on occasions they can and do now weep heartily together i believe she returned to england being duchess of kendal with heavy pensions there and assiduously attended divine ordinances according to the german protestant form ever afterwards poor foolish old soul what is this world with all its dukeries  the other or fat mistress cataract of fluid tallow countess of darlington whom i take to have been a halfsister rather sat sorrowful at isleworth and kept for many years a black raven which had come flying in upon her which she somehow understood to be the soul or connected with the soul of his majesty of happy memory horace walpole reminiscences good heavens what fat fluidtallowy stupor and entirely sordid darkness dwells among mankind and occasionally finds itself lifted to the very top by way of sample  friedrich wilhelm wept tenderly to brigadier dubourgay the british minister at berlin an old military gentleman of diplomatic merit who spells rather ill when they spoke of this sad matter my poor old uncle he was so good to me in boyhood in those old days when i blooded cousin georges nose not unkind ah only proud and sad and was called sulky being of few words and heavyladen ah me your excellenz if the little nightingales have all fallen silent what may not i his son and nephew doand the rugged majesty blubbered with great tenderness having fountains of tears withal hidden in the rocky heart of him not suspected by every one dubourgays despatches in the statepaper office  i add only that the fabrice who had poor george in his arms that night is a man worth mentioning the same fabrice fabricius or perhaps goldschmidt in german who went as envoy from the holsteingottorp people to charles xii in his turkish time and stayed with his swedish majesty there for a year or two indeed till the catastrophe came his official letters from that scene are in print this long while though considerably forgotten anecdotes du sejour du roi de suide a bender ou lettres de m le baron de fabrice pour servir delaircissement a lhistoire de charles xii hambourg 1760 8vo a little volume worth many big ones that have been published on that subject the same fabrice following hanover afterwards came across to london in due course and there he did another memorable thing made acquaintance with the monsieur arouet then a young french exile there arouet junior le jeune or l j whoby an ingenious anagram contrived in his indignation at such banishmentwrites himself voltaire ever since who has been publishing a henriade and doing other things now it was by questioning this fabrice and industriously picking the memory of him clean that m de voltaire wrote another book much more of an epic than henri iva history namely of charles xii see voltaire oeuvres completes ii 149 xxx 7 127 came out in 1731 ib xxx avantpropos p ii which seems to me the bestwritten of all his books and wants nothing but truth indeed a dreadful want to make it a possession forever voltaire if you want fine writing adlerfeld and fabrice if you would see the features of the fact these three are still the books upon charles xii     his prussian majesty falls into one of his hypochondriacal fits  before this event his majesty was in gloomy humor and special vexations had superadded themselves early in the spring a difficult huff of quarrel the consummation of a good many grudges long subsisting had fallen out with his neighbor of saxony the majesty of poland august whom we have formerly heard of a conspicuous majesty in those days called even august the great by some persons in his own time but now chiefly remembered by his splendor of upholstery his enormous expenditure in drinking and otherwise also by his three hundred and fiftyfour bastards probably the maximum of any kings performance in that line and called august der starke august the physically strong this exemplary sovereign could not well be a man according to friedrich wilhelms heart accordingly they had their huffs and little collisions now and then that of the protestant directorate and heidelberg protestants for instance indeed it was generally about protestantism and more lately there had been high words and correspondings about the protestants of thorn a bad tragedy of jesuit intrusion and polish ferocity enacted there in 1724 account of it in buchholz i 98102in which sad business friedrich wilhelm loyally interfered though britannic george of blessed memory and others were but lukewarm and nothing could be done in it nothing except angry correspondence with king august very provoking to the poor soul who had no hand but a nominal one in the thorn catastrophe being driven into it by his unruly diet alone  in fact august with his glittering eyes and excellent physical constitution was a very goodhumored fellow supremely pleasant in society and by no means wishful to cheat you or do you a mischief in businessunless his necessities compelled him which often were great but friedrich wilhelm always kept a good eye on such points and had himself suffered nothing from the gay eupeptic son of belial either in their old stralsund copartnery or otherwise so that except for these protestant affairsand alas one other little causefriedrich wilhelm had contentedly left the physically strong to his own course doing the civilities of the road to him when they met and nothing ill had fallen out between them this other little causealas it is the old story of recruiting ones poor hobby again giving offence special recruiting brabbles there had been severe laws passed in saxony about these kidnapping operations and always in the diets when question rose of this matter august had been particularly loud in his denouncings which was unkind though not unexpected but now in the spring of 1727 here has a worse case than any arisen  captain natzmer of i know not what prussian regiment sachsenweimar cuirassiers militairlexikon iii 104 or another had dropt over into saxony to see what could be done in picking up a tall man or two tall men one or two captain natzmer did pick up nay a tall deserter or two saxon soldier inveigled to desert but finding his operations get air he hastily withdrew into brandenburg territory again saxon officials followed him into brandenburg territory snapt him back into saxon tried him by saxon law theresaxon law express in such case condemns him to be hanged and that is his doom accordingly  captain natzmer to swing on the gallows taken on brandenburg territory too and not the least notice given me friedrich wilhelm blazes into flaming whirlwind sends an official gentleman one katsch to his excellenz baron von suhm the crownprinces cultivated friend with this appalling message if natzmer be hanged for certain i will use reprisals you yourself shall swing whereupon suhm in panic fled over the marches to his master who bullied him for his pusillanimous terrors and applied to friedrich wilhelm in fine frenzy of indignant astonishment what in heavens name such meditated outrage on the law of nations and flat insult to the majesty of kings can have meant friedrich wilhelm the first fury being spent sees that he is quite out of square disavows the reprisals upon suhm message misdelivered by my official gentleman that stupid katsch never did intend to hang suhm oh no with much other correspondence in mauvillon ii 189195 more of it than any one will readand is very angry at himself and at the natzmer affair which has brought him into this bad pass into open impropriety into danger of an utter rupture had king august been of quarrelsome turn but king august was not quarrelsome and then seckendorf and the tobaccoparliamenton the kaisers score who wants pragmatic sanction and much else out of these two kings and can at no rate have them quarrel in the present juncturewere eager to quench the fire king august let natzmer go suhm returned to his post pollnitz ii 254 and things hustled themselves into some uneasy posture of silence againuneasy to the sensitive fancy of friedrich wilhelm above all this is his worst collision with his neighbor of saxony and springing from ones hobby again  these sorrows the death of george i with anxieties as to george ii and the course he might take all this it was thought preyed upon his majestys spiritswilhelmina says it was the frequent carousals with seckendorf and an affair chiefly of the royal digestiveapparatus like enoughor both might combine it is certain his majesty fell into one of his hypochondrias at this time talked of abdicating and other gloomy things and was very black indeed so that seckendorf and grumkow began to be alarmed it is several months ago he had franke the halle methodist giving ghostly counsel his majesty ceased to have the newspapers read at dinner and listened to lugubrious frankes exhortations instead did english readers ever hear of franke let them make a momentary acquaintance with this famous german saint august hermann franke a lubeck man born 1663 professor of theology of hebrew lecturer on the bible a wandering persecuted pious man founder of the pietists a kind of german methodists who are still a famed sect in that country and of the waisenhaus at halle grand orphanhouse built by charitable beggings of franke which also still subsists a reverend gentleman very mournful of visage now sixtyfour and for the present at berlin discoursing of things eternal in what wilhelmina thinks a very lugubrious manner well but surely in a very serious manner the shadows of death were already round this poor franke and in a few weeks more he had himself departed died 8th june 1727 but hear wilhelmina what account she gives of her own and the young grenadiermajors behavior on these mournful occasions seckendorfs dinners she considers to be the cause all spiritual sorrows only an adjunct not worth mentioning it is certain enough  his majesty began to become valetudinary and the hypochondria which tormented him rendered his humor very melancholy monsieur franke the famous pietist founder of the orphanhouse at halle university contributed not a little to exaggerate that latter evil this reverend gentleman entertained the king by raising scruples of conscience about the most innocent matters he condemned all pleasures damnable all of them he said even hunting and music you were to speak of nothing but the word of god only all other conversation was forbidden it was always he that carried on the improving talk at table where he did the office of reader as if it had been a refectory of monks the king treated us to a sermon every afternoon his valetdechambre gave out a psalm which we all sang you had to listen to this sermon with as much devout attention as if it had been an apostles my brother and i had all the mind in the world to laugh we tried hard to keep from laughing but often we burst out thereupon reprimand with all the anathemas of the church hurled out on us which we had to take with a contrite penitent air a thing not easy to bring your face to at the moment in a word this dog of a franke he died within few months poor soul ce chien de franke led us the life of a set of monks of la trappe  such excess of bigotry awakened still more gothic thoughts in the king he resolved to abdicate the crown in favor of my brother he used to talk he would reserve for himself 10000 crowns a year and retire with the queen and his daughters to wusterhausen there added he i will pray to god and manage the farming economy while my wife and girls take care of the household matters you are clever he said to me i will give you the inspection of the linen which you shall mend and keep in order taking good charge of laundry matters frederika now thirteen married to anspach two years hence who is miserly shall have charge of all the stores of the house charlotte now eleven duchess of brunswick by and by shall go to market and buy our provisions and my wife shall take charge of the little children says friedrich wilhelm and of the kitchen little children are  1 sophie dorothee now eight who married margraf of schwedt and was unhappy  2 ulrique a grave little soul of seven queen of sweden afterwards  3 august wilhelm age now five became father of a new friedrich wilhelm who was king by and by and produced the kings that still are  4 amelia now four born in the way we saw and  5 henri still in arms just beginning to walk there will be a sixth and no more son of this sixth a berlin roue was killed in 1806 at the battle of jena or a day or two before but the sixth is not yet come to hand  poor friedrich wilhelm what an innocent idylliumwhich cannot be executed by a king he had even begun to work at an instruction or farewell advice for my brother and to point towards various steps which alarmed grumkow and seckendorf to a high degree wilhelmina memoires de bareith i 108  abdication with a crownprince ready to fall into the arms of england and a sudden finis to our blackart will by no means suit seckendorf and grumkow yet here is winter coming solitary wusterhausen with the misty winds piping round it will make matters worse something must be contrived and what the two after study persuade fieldmarshal flemming over at warsaw august the strongs chief man the flemming of voltaires charles xii prussian by birth though this long while in saxon service that if he the fieldmarshal were to pay accidentally as it were a little visit to his native brandenburg just now it might have fine effects on those foolish berlinwarsaw clouds that had risen the fieldmarshal well affected in such a case manages the little visit readily persuading the polish majesty and dissipates the clouds straightwaybeing well received by friedrich wilhelm and seconded by the tobaccoparliament with all its might out at wusterhausen everything is comfortably settled nay madam flemming young brilliant and direct from the seat of fashion it was she that first built up wilhelminas hair on just principles and put some life into her appearance wilhelmina i 117 and now the fieldmarshal tobaccoparliament suggesting it hints farther if his prussian majesty in the mere greatness of his mind were to appear suddenly in dresden when his royal friend was next therewhat a sunburst after clouds were that how welcome to the polish majestyhm na would it thenthe polish majesty puts that out of question specially sends invitation for the carnivaltime just coming and friedrich wilhelm will accordingly see dresden and him on that occasion ib i 108 109 pollnitz ii 254 fassman p 374 in those days carnival means fashionable season rural nobility rallying to headquarters for a while and social gayeties going on and in protestant countries it means nothing more  this in substance was the real origin of friedrich wilhelms sudden visit to dresden which astonished the world in january next it makes a great figure in the old books it did kindle dresden carnival and the physically strong into supreme illumination for the time being and proved the seal of good agreement and even of a kind of friendliness between this heteroclite pair of sovereignsif anybody now cared for those points it is with our crownprinces share in it that we are alone concerned and that may require a chapter to itself     chapter iii  visit to dresden  one of the most important adventures for our young crownprince was this visit of his along with papa to dresden in the carnival of 1728 visit contrived by seckendorf and company as we have seen to divert the kings melancholy and without view to the crownprince at all the crownprince now sixteen and not in the best favor with his father had not been intended to accompany was to stay at potsdam and diligently drill nevertheless an estafette came for him from the gallant polish majestywilhelmina had spoken a word to good suhm who wrote to his king and the hospitable message came friedrich made no loiteringto dresden is but a hundred miles one good dayhe arrived there on the morrow after his father king on the 14th january 1728 dates fassmann crownprince on the 15th which i find was thursday the crownprince lodged with fieldmarshal flemming friedrich wilhelm having come in no state refused king augusts pressings and took up his quarters with the general fieldmarshal wackerbarth commandant in dresdenpleasant old military gentleman who had besieged stralsund along with him in times gone except grumkow derschau and one or two of less importance with the due minimum of valetry he had brought no retinue the crownprince had finkenstein and kalkstein with him tutor and subtutor officially there and he lodges with old count flemming and his clever fashionable madamthe diligent but unsuccessful flemming a courtier of the highest civility though iracund and with a passion for making treaties whom we know since charles xiis time  amongst the round of splendors now set on foot friedrich wilhelm had by accident of nature the spectacle of a house on firerather a symbolic one in those partsafforded him almost to start with deep in the first saturday night or rather about two in the morning of sunday wackerbarths grand house kindling by negligence somewhere in the garrets blazed up irrepressible and with its endless upholsteries with a fine library even went all into flame so that his majesty scarcely saving his chatoulle box of preciosities had to hurry out in undressover to flemmings where his son was where they both continued thenceforth this was the one touch of rough amid so much of dulcet that occurred no evil this touch almost rather otherwise except to poor wackerbarth whose fine house lay wrecked by it  the visit lasted till february 12th four weeks and a day never was such thricemagnificent carnival amusements illuminations cannonsalvoings and fireworks operas comedies redoubts sowbaitings fox and badgerbaiting reviewing running at the ringdinners of neverimagined quality this as a daily item needs no express mention  to the young soldierapprentice all this was of course in pleasant contrast with the potsdam guardhouse and friedrich wilhelm himself is understood to have liked at least the dinners and the airy courteous ways light tablewit and extreme good humor of the host a successful visit burns off like successful fireworks piece after piece and what more is to be said of all this nothingnor if we could help it of another little circumstance not mentioned by the newspapers or fassmann which constitutes the meaning of this visit for us now it is a matter difficult to handle in speech an english editor chary of such topics will let two witnesses speak credible both though not eyewitnesses and leave it to the reader so babbling pollnitz is the first witness he deposes after alluding to the sumptuous dinings and drinkings there  one day the two kings after dinner went in domino to the redoubt ridotto what we now call rout or evening party august had a mind to take an opportunity and try whether the reports of friedrich wilhelms indifference to the fair sex were correct or not to this end he had had a young damsel junge person of extraordinary beauty introduced into some sideroom where they now entered she was lying on a bed in a loose gauzy undress and though masked showed so many charms to the eye that the imagination could not but judge very favorably of the rest the king of poland approached in that gallant way of his which had gained him such favor with women he begged her to unmask she at first affected reluctance and would not he then told her who he was and said he hoped she would not refuse when two kings begged her to show them this complaisance she thereupon took off her mask and showed them one of the loveliest faces in the world august seemed quite enchanted and said as if it had been the first time he ever saw her he could not comprehend how so bewitching a beauty had hitherto remained unknown to him  friedrich wilhelm could not help looking at her he said to the king of poland she is very beautiful it must be ownedbut at the same instant turned his eyes away from her and left the room and the ridotto altogether without delay went home and shut himself in his room he then sent for herr von grumkow and bitterly complained that the king of poland wanted to tempt him herr von grumkow who was neither so chaste nor so conscientious as the king was for making a jest of the matter but the king took a very serious tone and commanded him to tell the king of poland in his name that he begged him very much not to expose him again to accidents of that nature unless he wished to have him quit dresden at once herr von grumkow did his message the king of poland laughed heartily at it went straight to friedrich wilhelm and excused himself the king of prussia however kept his grim look so that august ceased joking and turned the dialogue on some other subject pollnitz ii 256  this is pollnitzs testimony gathered from the whispers of the tabagie or rumors in the courtcircles and may be taken as indisputable in the main wilhelmina deriving from similar sources and equally uncertain in details paints more artistically nor has she forgotten the sequel for her brother which at present is the essential circumstance  one evening when the rites of bacchus had been well attended to the king of poland led the king my father strolling about by degrees into a room very richly ornamented all the furniture and arrangements of which were in a quite exquisite taste the king charmed with what he saw paused to contemplate the beauties of it a little when all on a sudden a curtain rose and displayed to him one of the most extraordinary sights it was a girl in the condition of our first parents carelessly lying on a bed this creature was more beautiful than they paint venus and the graces she presented to view a form of ivory whiter than snow and more gracefully shaped than the venus de medici at florence the cabinet which contained this treasure was lighted by so many waxcandles that their brilliancy dazzled you and gave a new splendor to the beauties of the goddess  the authors of this fine comedy did not doubt but the object would make an impression on the kings heart but it was quite otherwise no sooner had he cast his eyes on the beauty than he whirled round with indignation and seeing my brother behind him he pushed him roughly out of the room and immediately quitted it himself very angry at the scene they had been giving him he spoke of it that same evening to grumkow in very strong terms and declared with emphasis that if the like frolics were tried on him again he would at once quit dresden  with my brother it was otherwise in spite of the kings care he had got a full view of that cabinet venus and the sight of her did not inspire in him so much horror as in his father wilhelmina i 112very likely notand in fact he obtained her from the king of poland in a rather singular way dune facon assez singulieredescribable in condensed terms as follows  wilhelmina says her poor brother had been already charmed over head and ears by a gay young baggage of a countess orzelska a very high and airy countess there whose history is not to be touched except upon compulsion and as if with a pair of tongsthrice famous as she once was in this saxon court of beelzebub she was king augusts natural daughter a french milliner in warsaw had produced her for him there in due time a male of the three hundred and fiftyfour one rutowski soldier by profession whom we shall again hear of took her for mistress regardless of natural halfsisterhood which perhaps he did not know of the admiring rutowski being of a participative turn introduced her after a while to his honored parent and hers by whom nextheavens human language is unequal to the history of such things and it is in this capacity she now shines supreme in the saxon court ogling poor young fritz and driving him distractedwhich phenomenon the beelzebub parentlover noticed with pain and jealousy it would appear  his polish majesty distinguished her extremely says pollnitz memoires ii261 and was continually visiting her so that the universal inference wasto the above unspeakable effect she was of fine figure had something grand in her air and carriage and the prettiest humor in the world she often appeared in mens clothes which became her very well people said she was extremely openhanded as indeed the beelzebub parentlover was of the like quality when he had cash about him and to her at this time he was profuse beyond limit truly a tempting aspect of the devil this expensive orzelska something beautiful in her if there are no laws in this universe not so beautiful if there are enough to turn the head of a poor crownprince if she like for some time he is just sixteen gone one of the prettiest lads and sprightliest his homage clearly enough is not disagreeable to the baggage wherefore jealous august the beelzebubparent takes his measures signifies to fritz in direct terms or by discreet diplomatic hints and innuendoes that he can have the cabinet venus formera her name of operasinger kindhoping thereby that the orzelska will be left alone in time coming a facon assez singuliere for a sovereign majesty and beelzebub parentlover thinks wilhelmina  thus has our poor fritz fallen into the wake of beelzebub and is not in a good way under such and no better guidance in this illicit premature manner he gets his introduction to the paradise of the world the formera beautiful as painted chaos yes herand why not after a while the orzelska too all the same a wonderful armidagarden sure enough and cannot one adore the painted divine beauties there lovely as certain apples of the dead sea for some timethe miseries all this brought into his existenceinto his relations with a father very rigorous in principle and with a universe still more sofor years to come were neither few nor small and that is the main outcome of the dresden visitings for him and us  great pledges pass between the two kings prussian crownprince decorated with the order of the saxon eagle or what supreme distinction they had rutowski taken over to berlin to learn war and drill where he did not remain long in fact a certain liking seems to have risen between the two heteroclite individualities which is perhaps worth remembering as a point in natural history if not otherwise one other small result of the visit is of pictorial nature in the famed dresden gallery there is still a picture high up visible if you have glasses where the saxon courtpainter on friedrich wilhelms bidding it is said soon after these auspicious occurrences represents the two majesties as large as life in their respective costumes and features short potsdam grenadiercolonel and tall saxon darius or sardanapalus in the act of shaking hands symbolically burying past grudges and swearing eternal friendship so to speak forster i 226 to this editor the picture did not seem good for much but friedrich wilhelms portrait in it none of the best may be of use to travelling friends of his who have no other  the visit ended on the 12th of february as the newspapers testify long before daybreak at three in the morning friedrich wilhelm who had smoked after dinner till nine the night before and taken leave of everybody was on the road but was astonished to find king august and the electoral prince or heirapparent who had privately sat up for the purpose insist on conducting him to his carriage boyer xxxv 198 great tokens of affection known to the newspapers there were and one token not yet known a promise on king augusts part that he would return this evermemorable compliment in person at potsdam and berlin in a few months remember then  as for the poor crownprince whom already his father did not like he now fell into circumstances more abstruse than ever in that and other respects bad health a dangerous lingering fit of that soon after his return home was one of the first consequences frequent fits of bad health for some years coming with ominous rumors consultations of physicians and reports to the paternal majesty which produced small comfort in that quarter the sad truth dimly indicated is sufficiently visible his life for the next four or five years was extremely dissolute poor young man he has got into a disastrous course consorts chiefly with debauched young fellows as lieutenants katte keith and others of their stamp who lead him on ways not pleasant to his father nor conformable to the laws of this universe health either of body or of mind is not to be looked for in his present way of life the bright young soul with its fine strengths and gifts wallowing like a young rhinoceros in the mudbathsome say it is wholesome for a human soul not we  all this is too certain rising to its height in the years we are now got to and not ending for four or five years to come and the reader can conceive all this and whether its effects were good or not friedrich wilhelms oldstanding disfavor is converted into open aversion and protest many times into fits of sorrow rage and despair on his luckless sons behalfand it appears doubtful whether this bright young human soul comparable for the present to a rhinoceros wallowing in the mudbath with nothing but its snout visible and a dirty gurgle all the sound it makes will ever get out again or not  the rhinoceros soul got out but not uninjured alas no bitterly polluted tragically dimmed of its finest radiances for the remainder of life the distinguished sauerteig in his springwurzeln has these words to burn away in mad waste the divine aromas and plainly celestial elements from our existence to change our holyofholies into a place of riot to make the soul itself hard impious barren surely a day is coming when it will be known again what virtue is in purity and continence of life how divine is the blush of young human cheeks how high beneficent sternly inexorable if forgotten is the duty laid not on women only but on every creature in regard to these particulars well if such a day never come again then i perceive much else will never come magnanimity and depth of insight will never come heroic purity of heart and of eye noble pious valor to amend us and the age of bronze and lacquer how can they ever come the scandalous bronzelacquer age of hungry animalisms spiritual impotencies and mendacities will have to run its course till the pit swallow it  in the case of friedrich it is certain such a day never fully came the age of bronze and lacquer so as it then stoodrelieved truly by a backbone of real spartan iron of right battle steel when needed this was all the world he ever got to dream of his ideal compared to that of some was but low his existence a hard and barren though a genuine one and only worth much memory in the absence of better enough of all that     the physically strong pays his countervisit  august the strong paid his returnvisit in may following of which sublime transaction stupendous as it then was to the journalistic mind we should now make no mention except for its connection with those pointsand more especially for a foolish rumor which now rose about prince fred and the doublemarriage on occasion of it the magnificence of this visit and reception being so extremeking august for one item sailing to it with sound of trumpet and hautbois in silken flotillas gayer than cleopatras down the elbethere was a rush towards berlin of what we will not call the scum but must call the foam of mankind rush of the idle moneyed populations from all countries and such a crowd there for the three weeks as was seldom seen foam everywhere is stirred up and encouraged to get under way  prince frederick of hanover and england duke of edinburgh as they now call him duke of gloucester no longer it would seem nor prince of wales as yet he foamy as another had thoughts of coming and rumor of him rose very high in berlinhow high we have still singular proof here is a myth generated in the busy courtimagination of berlin at this time written down by pollnitz as plain fact afterwards and from him idly copied into coxe coxes walpole london 1798 i 520 and other english books we abridge from watery pollnitz taking care of any sense he has this is what ran in certain highfrizzled heads then and there and was dealt out in whispers to a privileged few watery pollnitzs informers among them till they got a myth made of it frederick duke of edinburgh second hope of england at this time he is the hero  it appears this loose young gentleman standing in no favor with his sovereign father had never yet been across to england the royal parent preferring rather not to have him in sight and was living idle at hanover very eager to be wedded to wilhelmina as one grand and at present grandest resource of his existence it is now may 1728 and frederick duke of edinburgh is twentyone he writes to his aunt and intended motherinlaw queen sophie date not ascertainable to a day note burnt as soon as read that he can endure this tantalizing suspense no longer such endless higgling about a supreme blessedness virtually agreed upon may be sport to others but is death to him that he will come privately at once and wed his wilhelmina and so make an end the bigwigs to adjust it afterwards as they can and may whereupon sophie dorothee gladdest of women sends for dubourgay the british ambassador brigadier dubourgay the respectable old gentleman who spells ill who is strong for the doublemarriage always to tell him what fine news there is and what answer she has sent respectable dubourgay stands silent with lengthening face your majesty how unfortunate that i of all men now hear it i must instantly despatch a courier with the news to london and the respectable man stoically deaf to her majestys entreaties to all considerations but that of his evident duty sends the courier thinks pollnitznips thereby that fine hanover speculation in the bud sees prince fred at once summoned over to england and produces several effects nearly the whole of which on examining the documents dubourgays despatches 1728 29 may 1 june 5 october in the statepaper office here proves to be myth  pollnitz himself adds two circumstances in regard to it which are pretty impossible as first that friedrich wilhelm had joyfully consented to this clandestine marriage and was eagerly waiting for it second that george ii too had privately favored or even instigated the adventure being at heart willing to escape the trouble of messages to parliament to put his son in the wrong and i know not what pollnitz ii 272274 the particles of fact in the affair are likewise two first that queen sophie and from her the courtier public generally expected the hanover royal highness who probably had real thoughts of seeing berlin and his intended on this occasion dubourgay reports daily rumors of the royal highness being actually seen there in an evanescent manner and wilhelmina says her mother was so certain of him she took every ass or mule for the royal highnessheartily indifferent to wilhelmina this is the first particle of fact the second is that a subaltern official about the royal highness one lamothe of hanover who had appeared in berlin about that time was thrown into prison not long after for what misbehavior none knewfor encouraging dissolute royal highness in wild schemes it was guessed and so the myth grew and was found ready for pollnitz and his followers royal highness did come over to england not then as the myth bears but nine months afterwards in december next and found other means of irritating his imperative flighty irascible and rather foolish little father in an everincreasing degree very coldly received at court it is said ill seen by walpole and the powers being too likely to become a focus of opposition there  the visit meanwhile though there came no duke of edinburgh to see it was sublime in the extreme polish majesty being magnificence itself and the frugal friedrich wilhelm lighting up his dim court into insurpassable brilliancy regardless of expense so that even the smoking parliament where august attended now and then became luminous the crownprince who in late months had languished in a state of miserable health in a manner ominous to his physicians confined mostly to his room or his bed was now happily on foot againand wilhelmina notes one circumstance which much contributed to his recovery that the fair orzelska had attended her natural or unnatural parent on this occasion and seemed to be as wilhelmina thinks uncommonly kind to the crownprince the heirapparent of saxony a taciturn inoffensive rather opaquelooking gentleman now turned of thirty and gone over to papistry long since with views to be king of poland by and by which proved effectual as we shall find was also here count bruhl too still in a very subaltern capacity and others whom we and the crownprince shall have to know the heirapparents wife actual kaisers niece late kaiser josephs daughter a severe austrian lady haughtier than lovely has stayed at home in dresden  but here at first hand is a slight view of that unique polish majesty the saxon man of sin which the reader may be pleased to accept out of idle curiosity if for no better reason we abridge from wilhelmina i 124 whom fassmann kindled to triple accuracy by this grand

particular form that he only pretended to like them upon which in just indignation she disowned and dismissed him and falling herself to be czarina not long afterwards and taking bieren the courlander

and rows of resplendent people crowding in to dinner and she could not but contrast the splendor of the polish retinues and their plumages and draperies with the straitbuttoned prussian dignitaries all in mere soldier uniform succinct blue coat white linen gaiters and no superfluity even in the epaulettes and red facings at table she says they drank much talked little and bored one another a great deal sennuyoient beaucoup     of princess whilhelminas four kings and other ineffectual suitors  dilapidated polish majesty we observed was extremely attentive to wilhelmina nor could she ascertain for long after what the particular reason was long after wilhelmina ascertained that there had been the wonderfulest scheme concocting or as good as concocted in these swearings of eternal friendship no other than that of marrying her wilhelmina now a slim maiden coming nineteen to this dilapidated saxon man of sin going or limping fiftyfive and broken by debauches terribles rivers of

wilhelmina i 114 what would wilhelmina have thought one shudders to contemplatehopes it might mostly be loose brainweb and courtier speculation never settled towards fact  it is certain the dilapidated polish majesty having become a widower questions would rise will not he marry again and with whom certain also he wants friedrich wilhelms alliance having great schemes on the anvil which are like to be delicate and perilousschemes of partitioning poland no less that is to say cutting off the outskirts of poland flinging them to neighboring sovereigns as propitiation or price of goodwill and rendering the rest hereditary in his family pragmatic sanction once acceded to would probably propitiate the kaiser for which and other reasons polish majesty still keeps that card in his hand friedrich wilhelms alliance with such an army and such a treasury the uses of that are evident to the polish majestyby the blessing of heaven however his marriage with wilhelmina never came to anything his electoral prince heirapparent objected to the jointures and alienations softly steadily and the project had to drop before wilhelmina ever knew of it  and this man is probably one of the four kings she was to be asked by a swedish officer with some skill in palmistry many years ago looked into her innocent little hand and prophesied she was to be in terms of courtship engagement or as good as engagement with four kings and to wed none of them wilhelmina counts them in her mature days the first will surprise everybodycharles xii of swedenwho never can have been much of a suitor the rather as the young lady was then only six gone but who might like enough be talked of by transient thirdparties in those old stralsund times the secondcannot we guess who the second is the third is this august the dilapidated strong as to the second wilhelmina sees already in credulous moments that it may be hanover fred whom she will never marry eitherand does not see nor did at the time of writing her memoires in 1744 say the books that fred never would come to kingship and that the palmistry was incomplete in that point the fourth again is clearly young czar peter ii of whom there was transient talk or project some short time after this of the dilapidated third but that too came to nothing the poor young lad died while only fifteen nay he had already fallen in love with his aunt

intelligent history of this anne at least of her wars where mannstein himself usually had part  all which would be nothing or almost less to wilhelmina walking fancyfree therewere it not for papa and

king augusts pay not without capacity of drink and the like some allegeotherwise a mere betitled betasselled elderly military gentleman of no special qualities evil or goodwho will often turn up again in this history but fails always to make any impression on us except that of a serene highness in the abstract unexceptionable human mask of polite turn behung with titles and no doubt a stomach in the inside of it he now and afterwards by all opportunities diligently continued his attentions in the wilhelmina quarter for a good while it was never guessed what he could be driving at till at last queen sophie becoming aware of it took him to task with cold severity reminded him that some things are on ones level and some things not to which humbly bowing in unfeigned penitence he retired from the audacity back foremost would never even in dreams have presumed had not his prussian majesty authorized would now since her prussian majesty had that feeling withdraw silently and live forgotten as an obscure royal highness in the abstract though fallen widower lately ought to do and so at least there was an end of that matter one might hopethough in effect it still abortively started up now

chapter iv  doublemarriage project is not dead  and the doublemarriage in such circumstances are we to consider it as dead then in the soul of queen sophie and those she can influence it lives flamebright but with all others it has fallen into a very dim state friedrich wilhelm is still privately willing perhaps in a degree wishful but the delays the supercilious neglects have much disgusted him and he in the mean while entertains those new speculations george ii never a lover of the prussian majestys nor loved by him has been very high and distant ever since his accession offensive rather than otherwise he also is understood to be vaguely willing for the thing willing enough would it be so kind as accomplish itself without trouble to him but the settlements the

especially her son the more important of them     crownprince friedrich writes certain letters  queen sophie did not overturn the empire but she did almost overturn her own and her familys existence by these courses which were not wise in her case it is certain she persuaded crownprince friedrich who was always his mothers boy and who perhaps needed little bidding in this instance to write to queen caroline of england letters one or several thricedangerous letters setting forth in substance his deathless affection to that beauty of the world her majestys divine daughter the princess amelia

at once one letter supremely dangerous should it come to be known wilhelmina has copied for us wilhelmina i 183in official style for it is the mothers composition this one and without date to itthe guessable date is about two years hence and we will give the poor document farther on if there be place for it  such particulars are yet deeply unknown to friedrich wilhelm but he surmises the general drift of things in that quarter and how a disobedient son crossing his fathers will in every point abets his mothers disobedience itself audacious enough in regard to this one it is a fearful aggravation of friedrich wilhelms illhumor with such a son which has long been upon the growing hand his dislikes we know were otherwise neither few nor small mere dislikes properly so called or dissimilarities to friedrich wilhelm a good many of them dissimilarities also to a higher pattern some but these troubles of the doublemarriage will now hurry them the just and the unjust of them towards the flaming pitch the poor youth has a bad time and the poor father too whose humor we know surly gusts of indignation not unfrequently cuffs and strokes or still worse a settled aversion and

while presumed to come to my dear papa partly because he forbade me but chiefly because i had reason to expect a still worse reception than usual and for fear of angering my dear papa by my present request i have preferred making it in writing to him  i therefore beg my dear papa to be gracious to me and can here say that after long reflection my conscience has not accused me of any the least thing with which i could reproach myself but if i have against my will and knowledge done anything that has angered my dear papa i herewith most submissively beg forgiveness and hope my dear papa will lay aside that cruel hatred which i cannot but notice in all his treatment of me i could not otherwise suit myself to it as i always thought i had a gracious papa and now have to see the contrary i take confidence then and hope that my dear papa will consider all this and again be gracious to me and in the mean while i assure him that i will never all my days fail with my will and

effeminate fellow efeminirten kerl who has no human inclination in him who puts himself to shame cannot ride nor shoot and withal is dirty in his person frizzles his hair like a fool and does not cut it off and all this i have a thousand times reprimanded but all in vain and no improvement in nothing keine besserung in nits ist for the rest haughty proud as a churl speaks to nobody but some few and is not popular and affable and cuts grimaces with his face as if he were a fool and does my will in nothing unless held to it by force nothing out of loveand has pleasure in nothing but following his own whims own kopfno use to him in anything else this is the answer  friedrich wilhelm  preuss i 27 from cramer pp 33 34     doublemarriage project reemerges in an official shape  these are not favorable outlooks for the doublemarriage nevertheless it comes and goes and within three weeks later we are touched almost with a kind of pity to see it definitely emerging in a kind of official state once more for the question is symbolical of important political questions the question means withal what is to be done in these dreadful congressofsoissons complexities and mad reelings of the terrestrial balance shall we hold by a dubious and rather losing kaiser of this kind in spite of his dubieties his highly inexplicit procedures for which he may have reasons about the promise of julich and berg or shall we not clutch at england after alland perhaps bring him to terms the smoking parliament had no hansard but we guess its debates mostly done in dumbshow were cloudy abstruse and abundant at this time the prussian ministers if they had any power take different sides old ilgen the oldest and ablest of them is strong for england  enough in the beginning of october queen sophie by express desire of his majesty who will have explicit yes or no on that matter writes to england a letter private and official of such purportletter now invisible which dubourgay is proud to transmit despatch 5th october 1728 in statepaper office dubourgay is proud and old ilgen her majesty informed me on the morrow wept for joy so zealous was he on that side poor old gentlemanrespectable rusty old iron safe with seven locks which nobody would now care to pickhe died few weeks after at his post as was proper and saw no doublemarriage after all but dubourgay shakes out his feathers the doublemarriage being again evidently alive  for england answers cordially enough if not with all the hurry friedrich wilhelm wanted yea we are willing for the thingand meets with great equanimity and liberality the new whims difficulties and misgivings which arose on friedrich wilhelms part at a wearisome rate as the negotiation went on and which are always frankly smoothed away again by the cooler party why did not the bargain close then alas one finds the answer yea had unfortunately set his prussian majesty on viewing through magnifiers what advantages there might have been in no this is a difficulty there is no clearing away probably too the tobaccoparliament was industrious friedrich wilhelm at last tries if half will not do anxious as we all too much are to say yes and no being in great straits poor manyour prince of wales to wed wilhelmina at once the other match to stand over to which the english government answers always briefly no both the marriages or nonewill the reader consent to a few compressed glances into the extinct dubourgay correspondence much compressed and here and there a rushlight stuck in it for his behoof dubourgay at berlin writes my lord townshend in st jamess reads usually rather languid in answering  berlin 9th november 1728 prussian majesty much pleased with english answers to the yesorno question will send a minister to our court about the time his britannic majesty may think of coming over to his german dominions would finkenstein head tutor or would knyphausen distinguished official here be the agreeable man either answer the english either is good  berlin same date queen sent for me just now is highly content with the state of things i have now said her majesty the pleasure to tell you that i am free god be blessed of all the anguish i have labored under for some time past which was so great that i have several times been on the point of sending for you to procure my brothers protection for my son who i thought ran the greatest danger from the artifices of seckendorf andpoor queen  nov 16th queen told me when the court was at wusterhausen two months ago hunting partridges and wild swine fassmann p 386 seckendorf and grumkow intrigued for a match between wilhelmina and the prince of weissenfels elderly royal highness in the abstract whom we saw already thereby to prevent a closer union between the prussian and english courtsand grumkow having withal the private view of ousting his antagonist the prince of anhalt old dessauer whom he had to meet in duel but did not fight as weissenfels once soninlaw would certainly be made commanderinchief dubourgay in statepaper office prussian despatches vol xxxv to the extrusion of anhalt from that office which notable piece of policy her majesty by a little plain speech took her opportunity of putting an end to as we saw for the rest the dutch minister and also the french secretaries here greatly interested about the peace of europe and the congress of soissons in these weeks have had a communication from this court of the favorable disposition ours is in with respect to the double matchbeneficent for the terrestrial balance as they and i hope so that things look well alas  december 25th queen sent for me yesterday hopes she does no wrong in complaining of her husband to her brother king shows scruples about the marriages does not relish the expense of an establishment for the prince hopes at all events the marriage will not take place for a year yetwould like to know what dowry the english princess is to bringno dowry with our princess the english answer nor shall you give any with yours  newyears day 1729 queen sent for me king is getting intractable about the marriages she reasoned with him from two oclock till eight without the least permanent effect it is his covetousness i dubourgay privately thinkknyphausen who knows the king well privately tells me he will come round it is his avarice thinks knyphausen too nay it is also his jealousy of the prince who is very popular with the army king does everything to mortify him uses him like a child crownprince bears it with admirable patience this is knyphausens weak notion rather a weak creaky official gentleman i should gather of a cryptosplenetic turn queen told me some days later his majesty illused the crownprince because he did not drink hard enough makes him hunt though ill is very hard upon the poor crownprincewho for the rest sends loving messages to england as usual dubourgay 16th january covertly meaning the princess amelia as usual some while ago i must inform your lordship the prince was spoken to by papa as would appear to sound his inclination as to the princess caroline princess likewise of england and whose age some eighteen months less than his own might be suitabler the princess amelia being half a year his elder caroline born 10th june 1713 amelia 10th july 1711 butmark how true he stoodhis royal highness broke out into such raptures of love and passion for the princess amelia and showed so much impatience for the conclusion of that match as gave the king of prussia a great deal of surprise and the queen as much satisfaction truth is if an old brigadier diplomatist may be judge the great and good qualities of that young prince both of person and mind deserve a distinct and particular account with which i shall trouble your lordship another day despatch 25th december 1728which unluckily i never did his lordship townshend having it would seem too little curiosity on the subject  and so the matter wavers and in spite of dubourgays and queen sophies industry and the crownprinces willing mind there can nothing definite be made of it at this time friedrich wilhelm goes on visits goes on huntings leaves the matter to itself to mature a little thus the negotiation hangs fire and will do sotill dreadful waterspouts come and perhaps quench it altogether     his majesty slaughters 3602 head of wild swine  his majesty is off for a hunting visit to the old dessauercrownprince with him who hates hunting then 19th january 1729 says the reverential fassmann he is off for a grand hunt at copenick then for a grander in pommern crownprince still with him such a slaughter of wild swine as was seldom heard of and as never occurred again no fewer than 1882 head stuck of wild swine 300 of them of uncommon magnitude in the stettin and other pommern regions together with 1720 stuck in the mark brandenburg once 450 in a day in all 3602 stuck never was his majesty in better spirits a very nimrod or hunting centaur trampling the cobwebs of diplomacy and the cares of life under his victorious hoofs all this slaughter of swine 3602 stuck by tale was done in the season 1729 from which observes the adoring fassmann p 387 is to be inferred the importance at least in wild swine of those royal forests in pommern and the mark not to speak of his majestys supreme talent in hunting as in other things  what friedrich wilhelm did with such a mass of wild pork not an ounce of it was wasted every ounce of it brought money in for there exist official schedules lists as for a windowtax or propertytax drawn up by his majestys contrivance in the chief localities every man according to the house he keeps is bound to take at a just value by weight such and such quotities of suddenly slaughtered wild swine one or so manyand consume them at his leisure as ham or otherwisecash payable at a fixed term and no abatement made forster beneckendorf if they had an index i for this is a king that cannot stand waste at all thrifty himself and the cause of thrift     falls ill in consequence and the doublemarriage cannot get forward  this was one of friedrich wilhelms grandest huntingbouts this of january 1729 at all events he will never have another such by such fierce riding and defiance of the winter elements and rules of regimen his majesty returned to potsdam with ill symptoms of healthsymptoms never seen before except transiently three years ago after a similar bout when the doctors shaking their heads had mentioned the word goutnarrenpossen friedrich wilhelm had answered goutbut now february 1729 it is gout in very deed his poor majesty has to admit i am gouty then shall have gout for companion henceforth i am breaking up then which is a terrible message to a man his majestys age is not fortyone till august coming but he has hunted furiously  adoring fassmann gives a quite touching account of friedrich wilhelms performances under gout now and generally which were begun on this occasion how he suffered extremely yet never neglected his royal duties in any press of pain could seldom get any sleep till towards four or five in the morning and then had to be content with an hour or two after which his official secretaries came in with their papers and he signed despatched resolved with best judgmentthe top of the morning always devoted to business at noon up if possible and dines in dressinggown with queen and children after dinner commonly to bed again and would paint in oil sometimes do light joinerwork chiselling and inlaying by and by lie inactive with select friends sitting round some of whom had the right of entry others not under penalties buddenbrock derschau rough old marlborough stagers were generally there these and two other personsgrumkow and seckendorf whom fassmann does not name lest he get into troublesat well within earshot round the bed and always at the head was theiro majesty the queen sometimes with the kings hand laid in hers and his face turned up to her as if he sought assuagemento my dim old friend let us dry our tears  sometimes the crownprince read aloud in some french book title not given crownprinces voice known to me as very fine generally the princess louisa was in the room too louisa who became of anspach shortly not wilhelmina who lies in fever and relapse and smallpox and close at deaths door almost since the beginning of these bad days the crownprince reads we say with a voice of melodious clearness in french more or less instructive at other times there went on discourse about public matters foreign news things in general discourse of a cheerful or of a serious nature always with some substance of sense in itand not the least smut permitted as is too much the case in certain higher circles says adoring fassmann who privately knows of courts perhaps the glorwurdigste gloryworthiest august the greats court for one with their hired tomfools not yet an extinct species attempting to ground wit on that bad basis prussian majesty could not endure any zoten profanity and indecency both avaunt he had to hold out in this way awake till ten oclock for the chance of nights sleep earlier in the afternoon we said he perhaps does a little in oilpainting having learnt something of that art in young timesthere is a poor artist in attendance to mix the colors and do the first sketch of the thing specimens of such pictures still exist portraits generally all with this epigraph fredericus wilhelmus in tormentis pinxit painted by friedrich wilhelm in his torments and are worthy the attention of the curious fassmann p 392 see forster c is not this a sublime patient  fassmann admits there might be spurts of impatience now and then but how richly did majesty make it good again after reflection he was also subject to whims even about people whom he otherwise esteemed one meritorious gentleman who shall be nameless much thought of by the king his majestys nerves could not endure though his mind well did makes my gout worse to see him drilling in the esplanade there let another do itand vouchsafed an apologetic assurance to the meritorious gentleman afflicted in consequenceo my dim old friend these surely are sublimities of the sickbed so it lasted for some five weeks long well on towards the summer of this bad year 1729 wilhelmina says in briefer business language and looking only at the wrong side of the tapestry it was a hellonearth to us les peines du purgatoire ne pouvaient egaler celles que nous endurions i 157 and supports the statement by abundant examples during those flamy weeks  for in the interim withal the english negotiation is as good as gone out nay there are waterspouts brewing aloft yonder enough to wash negotiation from the world of which terrible weatherphenomena we shall have to speak by and by but must first by way of commentary give a glance at soissons and the terrestrial libra so far as necessary for human objectsnot far by any means     chapter v  congress of soissons sixth crisis in the spectrehunt  the socalled spanish war and dangerous futile siege of gibraltar had not ended at the death of george i though measures had already been agreed upon by the kaiser and parties interested to end itonly the king of spain or kings wife we should say made difficulties difficulties she and kept firing without effect at the fortress for about a year more after which her humor or her powder being out spanish majesty signed like the others peace again for all and sundry of us preliminaries of peace signed at paris 31st may 1727 three weeks before georges death peace itself finally at the pardo or at madrid the termagant having spent her powder 6th march 1728 scholl ii 212 213 and a congress bless the mark to settle on what terms in every point  congress say at aixlachapelle say at cambrai againfor there are difficulties about the place or say finally at soissons where fleury wished it to be that he might get the reins of it better in hand and where it finally wasand where the ghost or name of it yet is an empty enigma in the memories of some men congress of soissons did meet 14th june 1728 opened itself as a corporeal entity in this world sat for above a yearand did nothing fleury quite declining the pragmatic sanction though the anxious kaiser was ready to make astonishing sacrifices give up his ostend company paper shadow of a company or what you will of that kindif men would have conformed  these diplomatic gentlemensay are they aught they seem to understand me by each at once his choppy finger laying on his skinny lips princes of the powers of the air shall we define them it is certain the solid earth or her facts except being held in perpetual terror by such workings of the shadowworld reaped no effect from those twenty years of congressing seckendorf himself might as well have lain in bed as ridden those 25000 miles and done such quantities of doubledistillations no effect at all only some futile gunpowder spent on gibraltar and splinters of shot and shells salable as old iron found about the rocks there which is not much of an effect for twenty years of such industry  the sublime congress of soissons met as we say at the above date just while the polish majesty was closing his berlin visit but found itself no abler for work than that of cambrai had been the deputies from france i do not mention nor from spain nor from austria the deputies from england were colonel or now properly brigadiergeneral stanhope afterwards lord harrington horace walpole who is roberts brother and whose secretary is sir thomas robinson quoi done crusoe whom we shall hear of farther and stephen poyntz a once bright gentleman now dim and obsolete whom the readers of coxes walpole have some nominal acquaintance with here for chronologys sake is a clipping from the old english newspapers to accompany them there is rumor that polly peachum is gone to attend the congress at soissons where it is thought she will make as good a figure and do her country as much service as several others that shall be nameless mists weekly journal 29th june 1728  their task seemed easy to the sanguine mind the kaiser has agreed with spain in the italianapanage matter with the seapowers in regard to his ostend company which is abolished forever what then is to prevent a speedy progress and glad conclusion the pragmatic sanction accept my pragmatic sanction said the kaiser let that be the preliminary of all thingsnot the preliminary answered fleury we will see to that as we go on not the preliminary by any means there was the rub the sly old cardinal had his private treaties with sardinia views of his own in the mediterranean in the rhine quarter and answered steadily not the preliminary by any means the kaiser was equally inflexible whereupon immensities of protocolling arguing and the congress fell into complete languor say the histories scholl ii 215 congress ate its dinner heartily and wrote immensely for the space of eighteen months but advanced no hairsbreadth anywhither no prospect before it but that of dinner only for unlimited periods  kaiser will have his pragmatic sanction or not budge from the place stands mulelike amid the rain of cudgellings from the bystanders can be beaten to death but stir he will nothints glances of the eye pass between elizabeth farnese and the other bystanders suddenly 9th november 1729 it is found they have all made a treaty of seville with elizabeth farnese france england holland spain have all closeditalian apanages to be at once secured ostend to be at once suppressed with what else behoovesand the kaiser is left alone standing upon his pragmatic sanction there nobody bidding him now budge  at which the kaiser is naturally thrice and four times wroth and alarmedand seckendorf in the tabakscollegium had need to be doubly busy as we shall find he is though without effect when the time comes roundbut we have not yet got to november of this year 1729 there are still six or eight important months between us and that important months and a prussianenglish waterspout as we have named it to be seen with due wonder in the political sky  congress of soissons now fallen mythical to mankind and as inane as that of cambrai is perhaps still memorable in one or two slight points first it has in it as one of the austrian deputies that baron von bentenrieder tallest of living diplomatists who was pressed at one time for a prussian soldierreaders recollect it walking through the streets of halberstadt to stretch his long limbs till his carriage came up the prussian sentries laid hold of him excellent potsdam giant this oneand haled him off to their guardhouse till carriage and lackeys came then thousand humblest pardons your excellenz who forgave the fellows barely possible some lighter readers might wish to see for one moment an excellenz that has been seized by a pressgang which perhaps never happened to any other excellenzthe like of which i have been told might merit him a soiree from strongminded women in some remoter parts of the world not to say that he is the tallest of living diplomatists another unique circumstancebentenrieder soon died and had his place at soissons filled up by an excellenz of the ordinary height who had never been pressed but nothing can rob the congress of this fact that it once had bentenrieder for member and so far is entitled to the pluperfect distinction in one particular  another point is humanly interesting in this congress but cannot fully be investigated for want of dates always we perceive according to the news of it that reach berlinof england going right for the kaiser or going wrong for himhis prussian majestys treatment of his children varies if england go right for the kaiser well and his majesty is in goodhumor with queen with crownprince and wilhelmina if england go wrong for the kaiser dark clouds gather on the royal brow in the royal heart explode in thunderstorms and at length crockery goes flying through the rooms blows descend on the poor princes back and her majesty is in tears mere chaos come again for as a general rule unless the english negotiation have some prospering fit and produce exceptional phenomena friedrich wilhelm ever loyal in heart stands steadfast by his kaiser ever ready to strike out los zu schlagen as he calls it with his best strength in behalf of a cause which good soul he thinks is essentially germanall the readier if at any time it seem now exclusively german the french spanish english and other unlovely foreign world being clean cut loose from it or even standing ranked against it when will it go off then wann geht es los asks friedrich wilhelm often diligently drilling his sixty thousand and snorting contempt on ungermanism undeutschheit be it on the part of friends or of enemies good soul and whether he will ever get julich and berg out of it is distractingly problematical and the tobaccoparliament is busy with him  curious to see so far as dates go how friedrich wilhelm changes his tune to wife and children in exact correspondence to the notes given out at soissons for a kaiser and his pragmatic sanction poor prussian household poor back and heart of crownprince what a concert it is in this world smoking parliament for souffleur let the big diplomatist bassoon of the universe go this way there are caresses for a young soldier and his behavior in the giant regiment let the same bassoon sound that way bangs and knocks descend on him the two keep time togetherso busy is the smoking parliament with his majesty of prussia the world has seen with horror and wonder friedrich wilhelms beating of his grown children but the pair of meerkatzen or enchanted demonapes disguised as loyal councillors riding along with him the length of a terrestrial equator have not been so familiar to the world seckendorf grumkow we had often heard of devildiplomatists and shuddered over horrible pictures of them in novels hoping it was all fancy but here actually is a pair of them transcending all novelsperhaps the highest cognizable fact to be met with in devildiplomacy and it may be a kind of comfort to readers both to know it and to discern gradually what the just gods make of it withal devildiplomatists do exist at least have existed never doubt it farther and their astonishingly dexterous mendacities and enchanted spiderwebscan these go any road but one in this universe  that the congress of cambrai was not a myth we convinced ourselves by a letter of voltaires who actually saw it dining there in the year 1722 as he passed that way here for soissons in like manner are two letters by a less celebrated but a still known english hand which as utterances in presence of the fact itself leave no doubt on the subject these the afflicted reader will perhaps consent to take a glance of if the congress of soissons for the sake of memorable objects concerned there is still to be remembered and believed in for a little whilethe question arises how to do it then  the writer of these letters is a serious rather longnosed young english gentleman not without intelligence and of a wholesome and honest nature who became lord lyttelton first of those lords called also the good lord father of the bad a lineal descendant of that lyttelton upon whom coke sits or seems to sit till the end of things author by and by of a history of henry the second and other wellmeant books a man of real worth who attained to some note in the world he is now upon the grand tourwhich ran at that time by luneville and lorraine as would appear at which point we shall first take him up he writes to his father sir thomas at hagley among the pleasant hills of worcestershiredate shortly after the assembling of that congress to rear of himand we strive to add a minimum of commentary the piece of negligence the mr dnone of mortals now knows who or what they were  to sir thomas lyttelton bart at hagley  luneville 21st july 1728  dear siri thank you for so kindly forgiving the piece of negligence i acquainted you of in my last young fellows are often guilty of voluntary forgetfulness in those affairs but i assure you mine was quite accidentalnever mind it my son  mr d tells you true that i am weary of losing money at cards but it is no less certain that without them i shall soon be weary of lorraine the spirit of quadrille obsolete game at cards has possessed the land from morning till midnight there is nothing else in every house in

wellbred man you must play genteelly at quadrille would you get a reputation of good sense show judgment at quadrille however in summer one may pass a day without quadrille because there are agreeable promenades and little parties out of doors but in winter you are reduced to play at it or sleep like a fly till the return of spring  indeed in the morning the duke huntsmark that duke and two sons he has but my malicious stars have so contrived it that i am no more a sportsman than a gamester there are no men of learning in the whole country on the contrary it is a character they despise a man of quality caught me the other day reading a latin author and asked me with an air of contempt whether i was designed for the church all this would be tolerable if i was not doomed to converse with a set of english who are still more ignorant than the french and from whom with my utmost endeavors i cannot be absent six hours in the day lord blankbaltimore or heavenknowswhois the only one among them who has common sense and he is so scandalously debauched in his principles as well as practice that his conversation is equally shocking to my morals and my reasoncould not one contrive to get away from them to soissons for example to see business going on and the terrestrial balance settling itself a little  my only improvement here is in the company of the duke who is a truly distinguished duke to his bad country and in the exercise of the academyof horsemanship or what i have been absent from the latter near three weeks by reason of a sprain i got in the sinews of my leg my duty to my

opportunity to swallow it whole while the people are so busy with quadrille parties the present duke returning from exile found his land in desolation much of it running fast to wild forest again and he has signalized himself by unwearied efforts in every direction to put new life into it which have been rather successful lyttelton we perceive finds improvement in his company the name of this brave duke is leopold age now fortynine life and reign not far from done a man about whom even voltaire gets into enthusiasm siecle de louis xiv oeuvres xxvi 9597 hubner t 281  the court and country

ofwhom we shall often see beaten in this world at the head of menbut let us now get to soissons itself skipping an intermediate letter or two  to sir thomas lyttelton bart at hagley  soissons 28th october 1728  i thank you my dear sir for complying so much with my inclinations as to let me stay some time at soissons but as you have not fixed how long i wait for farther orders  one of my chief reasons for disliking luneville was the multitude of english there who most of them were such worthless fellows that they were a dishonor to the name and nation with these i was obliged to dine and sup and pass a great part of my time you may be sure i avoided it as much as possible but malgre moi i suffered a great deal to prevent any comfort from other people they had made a law among themselves not to admit any foreigner into their company so that there was nothing but english talked from june to januaryon the contrary my countrymen at soissons are men of virtue and good sense they mix perpetually with the french and converse for the most part in that language i will trouble you no more upon this subject but give me leave to say that however capricious i may have been on other subjects my sentiments in this particular are the strongest proofs i ever gave you of my strong and hereditary aversion to vice and folly  mr stanhope our minister the colonel or brigadiergeneral is always at fontainebleau i went with mr poyntz poyntz not yet a dim figure but a brilliant who hints about employing me to paris for four days when the colonel himself was there to meet him he received me with great civility and kindness we have done expecting mr walpole fixed he in the court regions who is obliged to keep strict guard over the cardinal sly old fleury for fear the german ministers should take him from us they pull and haul the poor old gentleman so many ways that he does not know where to turn or into whose arms to throw himself never fear him  ripperdas escape to englandgrand diplomatic bulldog that was who took refuge in colonel stanhopes at madrid to no purpose and kindled the sputtering at gibraltar is now got across to england and will go to morocco and farther to no purposewill very much embroil affairs which did not seem to want another obstacle to hinder them from coming to an accommodation if the devil is not very much wanting to his own interests in this business it is impossible that the good work of peace should go on much longer after all most young fellows are of his party and wish he may bring matters to a war for they make but ill ministers at a congress but would make good soldiers in a campaign  no news from madam blank and her beloved husband their unreasonable fondness for each other can never last they will soon grow as cold to one another as the town to the beggars opera and cannot warm again you think pray heaven i may prove a false prophet but married love and english music are too domestic to continue long in favor  november 20th soissons still this is one of the agreeablest towns in france the people are infinitely obliging to strangers we are of all their parties and perpetually share with them in their pleasures i have learnt more french since i came hither than i should have picked up in a twelvemonth in lorraine  a fool with a majority on his side is the greatest tyrant in the worldhow can i go back to loiter in lorraine honored father where fools are in such majority then the extraordinary civilities i receive from mr poyntz he has in a manner taken me into his family will evidently make an apprentice of me the first packet that comes from fontainebleau i expect to be employed which is no small pleasure to me and will i hope be of service  december 20th a sudden order to mr poyntz has broken all my measures he goes tomorrow to paris to stay there in the room of messrs stanhope and walpole who are on their return for england congress falling into complete languor if we knew it but ought not i to accompany this friendly and distinguished mr poyntz who has already given me papers to copyin fact i am setting off with him honored father  prince fredericks

public notice of it why should he there will be fine struggling for places in this princes new household i hope my brother will come in for one ayscoughs lyttelton iii 200231  but here we pull the string of the curtain upon lyttelton and upon his congress falling into complete languor congress destined after dining for about a year more to explode in the treaty of seville and to leave the kaiser sitting horrorstruck solitary amid the wreck of political naturewhich latter however pieces itself together again for him and others beneficent treaty of vienna was at last achieved treaty and

the newyears time of 1729 and must look again into the magnanimous sickroom which ensued thereon where a small piece of business is going forward what a magnanimous patient friedrich wilhelm was in fassmanns judgment we know but it will be good to show both sides of the tapestry and let wilhelmina also speak the small business is only a treaty of marriage for one of our princesses not wilhelmina but louisa the next younger who has been asked and will consent as appears  fassmann makes a very touching scene of it king is in bed ill of his gout after that slaughter of the 3602 wild swine attendants are sitting round his majesty in the way we know queen sophie at his head seckendorf and several others round the bed letters arrive princess frederika louisa a very young lady has also had a letter which she sees by the seal will be interesting but which she must not herself open she steps in with it beautiful as an angel but rather foolish and a spoilt child of fifteen says wilhelmina trips softly in with it hands it to the king give it to thy mother let her read it says the king mother reads it with audible soft voice formal demand in marriage from the serenity of anspach as foreseen  hearken louisa hore luise it is still time said the king tell us wouldst thou rather go to anspach now or stay with me if thou choose to stay thou shalt want for nothing either to the end of thy life speakat such unexpected question says fassmann there rose a fine blush over the princesss face who seemed to be at a loss for her answer however she soon collected herself kissed his majestys hand and said most gracious papa i will to anspach to which the king very well then god give thee all happiness and thousand blessingsbut hearken louisa the kings majesty was pleased at the same time to add we will make a bargain thou and i you have excellent flour at anspach schones mehl but in hams and smoked sausages you dont come up either in quality or quantity to us in this country now i for my part like good pastries so from time to time thou shalt send me a box of nice flour and i will keep thee in hams and sausages wilt thou louisa that the princess answered yea says poor fassmann with the tear in his eye may readily be supposed nay all that heard the thing round the royal bed theresimple humanities of that kind from so great a kinghad almost or altogether tears in their eyes fassmann pp 393 394  this surely is a very touching scene but now listen to wilhelminas account of another on the same subject between the same parties at table no date indicated or a wrong one but evidently after this in fact we find it was about the beginning of march 1729 and had sad consequences for wilhelmina  at table his majesty told the queen that he had letters from anspach the young margraf to be at berlin in may for his wedding that m bremer his tutor was just coming with the ring of betrothal for louisa he asked my sister if that gave her pleasure and how she would regulate her housekeeping when married my sister had got into the way of telling him whatever she thought and hometruths sometimes without his taking it ill she answered with her customary frankness that she would have a good table which should be delicately served and added she which shall be better than yours and if i have children i will not maltreat them like you nor force them to eat what they have an aversion towhat do you mean by that replied the king what is there wanting at my tablethere is this wanting she said that one cannot have enough and the little there is consists of coarse potherbs that nobody can eat the king as was not unnatural had begun to get angry at her first answer this last put him quite in a fury but all his anger fell on my brother and me he first threw a plate at my brothers head who ducked out of the way he then let fly another at me which i avoided in like manner a hailstorm of abuse followed these first hostilities he rose into a passion against the queen reproaching her with the bad training she gave her children and addressing my brother you have reason to curse your mother said he for it is she that causes your being an illgoverned fellow un mal gouverne i had a preceptor continued he who was an honest man i remember always a story he told me in my youth there was a man at carthage who had been condemned to die for many crimes he had committed while they were leading him to execution he desired he might speak to his mother they brought his mother he came near as if to whisper something to herand bit away a piece of her ear i treat you thus said he to make you an example to all parents who take no heed to bring up their children in the practice of virtuemake the application continued he always addressing my brother and getting no answer from him he again set to abusing us till he could speak no longer we rose from table as we had to pass near him in going out he aimed a great blow at me with his crutch which if i had not jerked away from it would have ended me he chased me for a while in his wheelchair but the people drawing it gave me time to escape into the queens chamber wilhelmina i 159  poor wilhelmina beaten upon by papa in this manner takes to bed in miserable feverish pain is ordered out by mamma to evening party all the same is evidently falling very ill ill i will cure you says papa next day and makes her swallow a great draught of wine which completes the thing declared smallpox say all the doctors now so that wilhelmina is absent thenceforth as fassmann already told us from the magnanimous paternal sickroom and lies balefully eclipsed till the paternal gout and some other things have run their course smallpox what will prince fred think a perfect fright if she do live say the english courtgossips in the interim but we are now arrived at a very singular prussianenglish phenomenon and ought to take a new chapter     chapter vi  imminency of war or duel between the britannic and prussian majesties  the doublemarriage negotiation hung fire in the end of 1728 but everybody thought especially queen sophie thought it would come to perfection old ilgen almost the last thing he did shed tears of joy about it these fine outlooks received a sad shock in the year now come when secret grudges burst out into open flame and berlin instead of scenic splendors for a polish majesty was clangorous with note of preparation for imminent war probably queen sophie never had a more agitated summer than this of 1729 we are now arrived at that thricefamous quarrel or almost duel of friedrich wilhelm and his britannic brotherinlaw little george ii and must try to riddle from those distracted papermasses some notice of it not wholly unintelligible to the reader it is loudly talked of loudly but alas also loosely to a degree in all manner of dull books and is at once thricefamous and extremely obscure the fact is nature intended it for eternal oblivionand that sure enough would have been its fate long since had not persons who were then thought to be of no importance but are now seen to be of some stood connected with it more or less  friedrich wilhelm for his own part had seen in the death of george i an evil omen from the english quarter and all along in spite of transient appearances to the contrary had said to himself if the first george with his solemnities and tacit sublimities was offensive now and then what will the second george be the second george has been an offence from the beginning in which notions the smoking parliament vitally interested to do it in these perilous soissons times big with the fate of the empire and universe is assiduous to confirm his majesty the smoking parliament at potsdam at berlin in the solitudes of wusterhausen has been busy and much tobacco much meditation and insinuation have gone up in clouds more abstruse than ever since the death of george i  it is certain george ii was a proud little fellow very high and airy in his ways not at all the man to friedrich wilhelms heart nor reciprocally a man of some worth too scrupulously kept his word say the witnesses a man always conscious to himself am not i a man of honor then to a punctilious degree for the rest courageous as a welf and had some sense withalthough truly not much and indeed as it were none at all in comparison to what he supposed he hadone can fancy the aversion of the little dapper royalty to this heavyfooted prussian barbarian and the prussian barbarians to him the bloody nose in childhood was but a symbol of what passed through life in return for his bloody nose little george five years the elder had carried off caroline of anspach and left friedrich wilhelm sorrowing a neglected cubpoor honest beast tragically shorn of his beauty offences could not fail these two cousins went on offending one another by the mere act of living simultaneously a natural hostility that between george ii and friedrich wilhelm anterior to caroline of anspach and independent of the collisions of interest that might fall out between them enmity as between a glancing selfsatisfied fop and a loutish thicksoled man of parts who feels himself the better though the less successful housemastiff seeing itself neglected driven to its hutch for a tricksy ape dressed out in ribbons who gets favor in the drawingroom  george i perceive by the very statepapers george and his english lords have a provoking slighting tone towards friedrich wilhelm they answer his violent convictions and thoroughgoing rapid proposals by brief official negation with an air of superioritytraces of a polite sneer perceptible occasionally a mere clown of a king thinks george a mere gesticulating coxcomb thinks friedrich wilhelm mein bruder der comodiant my brother the playactor particolored merryandrew of a highflying turn was friedrich wilhelms private name for him in after days which george repaid by one equal to it my brother the headbeadle of the holy roman

a lumbering nickname but intrinsically not without felicity and the wittiest thing i know of little george  special cause of quarrel they had none that was of the least significance and at this time prudent friends were striving to unite them closer and closer as the true policy for both english townshend himself rather wishing it as the best prussian officials eagerly did queen sophie passionate for it and only a purchased grumkow a seckendorf and the tobaccoparliament set against it the treaty of wusterhausen was not known but the fact of some treaty made or making some imperial negotiation always going on was too evident and friedrich wilhelms partialities to the kaiser and his seckendorf could be a secret nowhere  negotiation always going on we say for such indeed was the casethe kaiser striving always to be loose again having excellent reasons a secret bargain to the contrary to wit in regard to that julichandberg succession proposing substitutes for julich and berg and friedrich wilhelm refusing to accept any imaginable substitute anything but the article itself so that i believe the treaty of wusterhausen was never perfectly ratified after all but hung for so many years always on the point of being so these are the uses of your purchased grumkow and of riding the length of a terrestrial equator keeping a majesty in company if by a doublemarriage with england that intricate web of chicanery had been once fairly slit in two and new combinations formed on a basis not of fastandloose could it have been of disadvantage to either of the countries or to either of their kingsreal and grave causes for agreement we find real or grave causes for quarrel none anywhere but light or imaginary causes which became at last effectual can be enumerated to the length of three or four     cause first the hanover jointheritages which are not in a liquid state  first the ahlden heritage was one cause of disagreement which lasted long the poor mother of george ii and of queen sophie had left considerable properties three million thalers that is 900000 pounds say some but all was rather in an unliquid state not so much as her will was to be had the will with a 10000 pounds or so was in the hands of a certain graf von bar one of her confidants in that sad imprisonment money lent him busching says beitrage zur lebensgeschichte denkwurdiger personen halle 17831789 i 306  nussler some distracted fractions of business correspondence with this bar in memoirs of sophia dorothea unintelligible as usual there to set up a waxbleachery at casseland the said count von bar was off with it testamentary paper and all gone to the reichshofrath at vienna supreme judges in the empire of such matters who accordingly issued him a protection to start with so that when the hanover people attempted to lay hold of the questionable waxbleaching count at frankfurtonmaynsecretly sending a lieutenant and twelve men for that objecthe produces his protection paper and the lieutenant and twelve men had to hasten home again ibid count von bar had to be tried at lawnever ask with what resultsand this itself was a long story then as to the other properties of the poor duchess question arises are they allodia or are they feudathat is to say shall the son have them or the daughter in short there was no end to questions friedrich wilhelm has an envoy at hanover one kannegiesser laboring at hanover the second of such he has been obliged to send who finds plenty of employment in that matter my brother the comodiant quietly put his fathers will in his pocket i have heard and paid no regard to it except what he was compelled to pay by chesterfield and others will he do the like with his poor mothers will patience your majesty he is not a covetous man but a selfwilled and a proudalways conscious to himself that he is the soul of honor this poor brother king  nay withal before these testamentary bickerings are settled here has a new jointheritage fallen

are to settle at least the recent part of them let kannegiesser keep his eyes open kannegiesser is an expert highmannered man but said to be subject to sharpness of temper and not in the best favor with the hanover people that is cause first     cause second the troubles of mecklenburg  then secondly there is the business of mecklenburg deplorable business for mecklenburg and for everybody within wind of itmy poor readers included readers rememberwhat reader can ever forgetthat extraordinary duke of mecklenburg the unique of husbands as we had to call him who came with his extraordinary duchess to wait on her uncle peter the russian say rather samoeidic czar at magdeburg a dozen years ago we feared it was in the fates we might meet that man again and so it turns out the unique of husbands has proved also to be the unluckiest of misgoverning dukes in his epoch and spreads mere trouble all round him mecklenburg is in a bad way this long while especially these ten years past owing to the charlestwelfth wars or whatever it was owing to this unlucky duke had fallen into want of more money and impoverished mecklenburg alleged that it was in no condition to pay more almost on his accession while the tarbarrels were still blazing years before we ever saw him he demanded new subvention from his ritters the squires of the country subvention new in mecklenburg though common in other sovereign german states and at one time in mecklenburg too the ritters would not pay the duke would compel them ritters appeal to kaiser in reichshofrath who proves favorable to the ritters duke still declines obeying kaiser asserts that he is himself in such matter the sovereign kaiser fulminates what of rusty thunder he has about him to which the duke flung on his back by it still continues contumacious in mind and tongue and so between thunder and contumacy as between hammer and stithy the poor country writhes painfully ever since and is an affliction to everybody near it  for ten years past the unluckiest of misgoverning dukes has been in utter controversy with his rittersat law with them before the courts of the empire nay occasionally trying certain of them himself and cutting off their heads getting russian regiments and then obliged to renounce russian regimentsin short a very great trouble to mankind thereabouts michaelis ii 416435 so that the kaiser in reichshofrath about the date indicated year 1719 found good to send military coercion on him and intrusted that function to the hanoverbrunswick people to george i more especially to whom as kreishauptmann captain of the circle circle of lowersaxony where the contumacy had occurred such function naturally fell the hanover sovereignty sending 13000 men horse foot and artillery into mecklenburg soon did their function with only some slight flourishes of fighting on the part of the contumacious dukein which his chief captain one schwerin distinguishes himself kurt von schwerin whom we shall know better by and by for he went into the prussian service shortly after colonel von schwerin did well what was in him but could not save a refractory duke against such odds the contumacious duke was obliged to fly his countrydeposed or to begin with suspended a brother of his being put in as interim dukeand the unique of husbands and paragon of mismanaging dukes lives about dantzig ever since on a pension allowed him by his interim brother contumacious to the last and still stirring up strife though now with diminished means uncle peter being now dead and russian help much cut off  the hanover sovereignties did their function soon enough but their expenses for it these they have in vain demanded ever since no money to be got from mecklenburg and mecklenburg owes us ten tons of goldthat is to say 1000000 thalers tou being the tenth part of a million in that coin hanover therefore holds possessionand has held ever since with competent small military forceof certain districts in mecklenburg taxes of these will subsist our soldiery in the interim and yield interest the principal once paid we at once give them up principal by these schedules if you care to count them is one million thalers ten tonnen goldes as above said or about 150000 pounds and so it has stood for ten years past mecklenburg the most anarchic of countries owing to the kind of ritters and kind of duke it has poor souls it is evident they have all lost their beaten road and got among the ignes fatui and peatpools none knows the necessities and sorrows of this poor idle duke himself in his young years before accession he once tried soldiering served one campaign with charles xii but was glad to return to hamburg again to the peaceable scenes of fashionable life there see german spy london 1725 by lediard biographer of marlborough for a lively picture of the then hamburgresort of northern moneyed idleness as well as of better things then his russian unique of wiveshis probable adventures prior and subsequent in uncle peters sphere can these have been pleasant to him the angry ritters too their country had got much trampled to pieces in the charlestwelfth wars stralsund sieges money seemed necessary to the duke and the ritters were very scarce of it add on both sides pride and want of sense with mutual anger going on crescendo and we have the sad phenomenon now visible a duke fled to dantzig anarchic ritters none the better for his going duke perhaps threatening to return and much flurrying his poor interim brother and stirring up the anarchiesin brief mecklenburg become a house on fire for behoof of neighbors and self  in these miserable brabbles friedrich wilhelm did not hitherto officially interfere though not uninterested in them being a next neighbor and even by known treaties eventual heir should the mecklenburg line die out but we know he was not in favor with the kaiser in those old years so the military coercion had been done by other hands and he had not shared in the management at all he merely watched the course of things always advised the duke to submit to law and be peaceable was sometimes rather sorry for him too as would appear  last year however 1728doubtless it was one of seckendorfs minor measures done in tobaccoparliamentfriedrich wilhelm now a pet of the kaisers is discovered to be fairly concerned in that matter and is conjoined with the hanoverbrunswick commissioners for mecklenburg kaiser specially requiring that his prussian majesty shall help in executing imperial orders in the neighboring anarchic country which rather huffed little georgehitherto since his fathers death the principal or as good as sole commissionerif so big a britannic majesty could be huffed by paltry slights of that kind friedrich wilhelm who has much meditated mecklenburg strains his intellect sometimes to an intense degree to find out ways of settling it george who has never cared to meditate it nor been able if he had is capable of sniffing scornfully at friedrich wilhelms projects on the matter and dismissing them as moonshine dubourgay despatches and the answers to them more than once to a wise muchmeditative housemastiff can that be pleasant from an unthinking dizened creature of the ape species the troubles of mecklenburg and discrepancies thereupon are capable of becoming a second source of quarrel     causes third and fourthand cause fifth worth all the others  cause third is the old story of recruiting a standing cause between prussia and all its neighbors and the fourth cause is the tiniest of all the meadow of clamei meadow of clamei some square yards of boggy ground which after long study one does find to exist in the obscurest manner discoverable in the best maps of germanysome twenty miles south of the elbe river on the boundary between hanoverluneburg and prussiamagdeburg dubious on which side of the boundary lonesome unknown patch of meadow lying far amid peaty wildernesses in those salzwedel regions unknown to all writing mortals as yet but which threatens in this summer of 1729 to become famous as runnymead among the meadows of history and the fifth causein short there was no real cause of the least magnitude the effect was produced by the combination of many small and imaginary ones for if there is a will to quarrel we know there is a way and perhaps the fifth namable cause in efficiency worth all the others together might be found in the debates of the smoking parliament that season were the journal of its proceedings extant we gather symptoms indisputable enough of very diligent elaborations and insinuations there and conclude that to have been the really effective cause clouds had risen between the two courts but except for the tobaccoparliament there never could have thunder come from them  very soon after georges accession there began clouds to rise the perfectly accomplished little george assuming a severe and high air towards his rustic brotherinlaw we cannot stand these prussian enlistments and encroachments rectify these in a high and severe manner says george to his hanover officials george is not warm on his throne till there comes in accordingly from the hanover officials a complaint to that effect and even a list of hanoverian subjects who are owing to various injustices now serving in the prussian ranks your prussian majesty is requested to return us these men  this list is dated 22d january 1728 george only a few months old in his new authority as yet the prussian majesty grumbles painfully responsive will with eagerness do whatever is just most surely but is his britannic majesty aware hanover officials are quite misinformed as to the circumstancesand does not return any of the men merely a pacific grumble and nothing done in regard to the complaints then there is the meadow of clamei which we spoke of that belongs to brandenburg you say nevertheless the contiguous parts of hanover have rights upon it some eight cartloads of hay worth say almost 5 pounds or 10 pounds sterling who is to mow that grass i wonder  friedrich wilhelm feels that all this is a pettifogging vexatious course of procedure and that his little cousin the comodiant is not treating him very like a gentleman is he your majesty suggests the smoking parliamentabout the middle of march dubourgay hears borck an official not of the grumkow party sulkily commenting on the constant hostility of the hanover ministry to us in all manner of pointsinquires withal could not mecklenburg be somehow settled his prussian majesty being somewhat anxious upon it despatch 17th march 1729 anxious yes his poor majesty intensely meditative of such a matter in the nightwatches is capable of springing out of bed with an eureka i have found what will do and demanding writing materials he writes or dictates in his shirt the good anxious majesty despatches his eureka by estafette on the wings of the wind and your townshend your unmeditative george receives it with curt official negative and a polite sneer dubourgay 12th14th april 1729 and the answer from st jamess  a few weeks farther on this is what the newspapers report of mecklenburg in spite of his prussian majestys desire to have some mercy shown the poor infatuated duke the elector of hanover and the duke of brunswickwolfenbuttel his britannic majesty and squire in that sad business refuse to withdraw their forces out of mecklenburg or part with the chest of the revenues thereof until an entire satisfaction be given them for the arrears of the charges they have been at

no george does not write pays for his posthorsesflourishes along to hanover in absolute silence towards his clownish brotherinlaw you would say he looks over the head of him as if there were no such clown in existencehe has never yet so much as notified his arrival what is this there exists no prussia then for little george friedrich wilhelms inarticulate interjectionary utterances in clangorous metallic tone we can fancy them now and then and the tobaccoparliament is busy british minister dubourgay steady old military gentleman who spells imperfectly but is intent to keep down mischief writes at last to hanover submissively suggesting could not as was the old wont some notification of the kings arrival be sent hither which would console his prussian majesty to which my lord townshend answers has not been the custom i am informed wrong informed your lordship not necessary in the circumstances which is a high course between neighbors and royal gentlemen and kinsfolk the prussian court hereupon likewise shuts its lips no mention of the hanoverian court not even by her majesty and to englishmen for several weeks past dubourgay some inarticulate metallic growl in

bailiff of hanoverian buhlitz unpicturesque traveller will find the peatsmoky little village of buhlitz near by a dusty little town called luchow midway from hamburg to magdeburg altogether peaty mossy country in the salzwedel district where used to be wendic populations and a marck or border fortress of salzwedel set up against thembailiff of buhlitz i say sallies forth with several carts with all the population of the village with a troop of horse to escort and probably flags flying and some kind of drums beatingpublicly rakes together the hay defiant of the prussian majesty and all men loads it on his carts and rolls home with it leaving to the brandenburgers nothing but stubble and the memory of having mown for hanover to eat this is the 28th june 1729 king of prussia is now at magdeburg reviewing his troops within a hundred miles of these contested quagcountries who can blame him that he flames up now into clear blaze of royal indignation the correspondence henceforth becomes altogether lively but in the britannic archives there is nothing of itdubourgay having received warning from my lord townshend to be altogether ignorant of the matter henceforth and let the hanover officials manage it his prussian majesty returns home in the most tempestuous condition  we may judge what a time queen sophie had of it what scenes there were with crownprince friedrich and wilhelmina in her majestys apartment and elsewhere friedrich wilhelm is fast mounting to the redhot pitch the bullyings the beatings even of these poor children lovesick one of them are lamentable to

crockery ensued fritz he deliberately detests as a servant of the devil incorrigibly rebelling against the paternal will and going on those dissolute courses a silly french cockatoo suspected of disbelief in scripture given to nothing but fifing and playbooks who will bring prussia aud himself to a bad end god grant he do not finish on the gallows sighed the sad father once to grumkow the records of these things lie written far and wide in the archives of many countries as well as in wilhelminas book  to me there was one undiplomatic reflection continually present heavens could nobody have got a bit of rope and hanged those two diplomatic swindlers clearly of the scoundrel genus more than common pickpockets are thereby had certain young hearts and honest old ones too escaped being broken and many a thing might have gone better than it did jarnibleu herr feldzeugmeister though you are an orthodox protestant this thousandfold perpetual habit of distilled lying seems to me a bad one i do not blame an old military gentleman with a brow so puckered as yours for having little of the milk of human kindness so called but this of breaking by force of lies merely and for your own uses the hearts of poor innocent creatures nay of grinding them slowly in the mortar and employing their fathers hand to do it withal thisherr general forgive me but there are moments when i feel as if the extinction of probably the intensest scoundrel of that epoch might have been a satisfactory eventalas it could not be seckendorf is lying abroad for his kaiser the only really able man we have

the part of sovereigns though they are rare karl ludwig of the pfalz winterkings son for example did as is understood challenge turenne for burning the pfalz first burning that poor country got but nothing came of it owing to turennes prudence friedrich wilhelm sees well that it all comes from georges private humor why should human blood be shed except georges and mine friedrich wilhelm is decisive for sending off the cartel he has even settled the particulars and sees in his glowing poetic mind how the transaction may be say at hildesheim for place derschau shall be my second brigadier

gentleman give the world a spectacle which might have been very wholesome to the world of two kings voiding their quarrel by duel and fair personal fence  in england the report goes not without foundation think lord hervey and men of sarcastic insight in the higher circles that it was his britannic majesty who sent or would have sent a challenge of single combat to his prussian majesty the latter being the passive party report flung into an inverse posture as is liable to happen going now with its feet uppermost not without foundation thinks lord hervey but whether it the cartel was carried and rejected or whether the prayers and remonstrances of lord townshend prevented the gauntlet being actually thrown down is a point which to me lord hervey at least has never been cleared lord hervey memoirs of george ii london 1848 i 127  the prussian ministers no less than townshend would feel well that this of duel will never do astonishment flebile lulibrium tragical tehee from

kannegiessers official reports which will themselves tell the rest of the story thank heaven  to his prussian majesty from herr kannegiesser  no 1 done at hanover 15th august 1729  on the 15th day of august at ten oclock in the morning i received two orders of council these are the eureka never ask farther what they are despatched on the 13th instant at seven in the evening whereupon i immediately went to the councilchamber here and informed the herr von hartoff private secretary who met me in a room adjoining that having something to propose to his ministry now sitting deliberative in the interior here something to propose to his ministry on the part of the prussian ministers it was necessary i should speak to them herr von hartoff after having reported my demand let me know he had received orders from the ministry to defer what i had to say to another time  i replied that since i could not be allowed the honor of an audience at that time i thought myself obliged to acquaint him i had received an order from berlin to apply to the ministry of this place in the name of the ministers of prussia and make the most pressing instances for a speedy answer to a letter lately delivered to them by herr hofrath reichenbath my worthy assistant here answer to his letter in the first place and to desire that the answer might be lodged in my hands in order to remit it with safety  herr von hartoff returned immediately to the councilchamber and after having told the ministers what i had said brought me the following answer in about halfaquarter of an hour seven minutes by the watch that the ministers of this court would not fail answering the said letter as soon as possible and would take care to give me notice of it and send the answer to me  that was all that the punctual kannegiesser could get out of them but continues he not thinking this reply sufficient i added that delays being dangerous i would come again the next day for a more precise answer  rather a highmannered positive man this kannegiesser of the ahlden heritages not without sharpness of temper if the hanover officials drive it too far   no 2at hanover 16th august 1729  according to the orders received from the king my master and pursuant of my promise of yesterday i went at noon this day to the castle schloss for the purpose of making appearance in the councilchamber where the ministers were assembled  i let them know i was there by van hartoff privy secretary and in the mildest terms desired to be admitted to speak with them which was refused me a second time and the following answer delivered me by van hartoff that since the prussian ministers had intrusted me with this commission the ministers of this court had directed him to draw up my yesterdays proposals in writing and report them to the council  whereupon i said i could not conceive any reason why i was the only person who could not be admitted to audience that however as the ministers of this court were pleased to authorize him herr von hartoff to receive my proposals i was obliged to tell him as the first or preliminary point of my commission i had received orders to be very pressing with the said ministers of this court for an answer to a letter from the prussian ministry lately delivered by herr legationsrath von reichenbach and finding that the said answer was not yet finished i would stay two days for it that i might be more secure of getting it but that then i should come to put them in mind of it and desire audience in order to acquit myself of the rest of my commission  the privy secretary drew up what i said in writing immediately afterwards he reported it to the ministry and brought me this answer that the ministers of this court would be as good as their word of yesterday and answer the abovementioned letter with all possible expedition after which we parted   no 3at hanover 17th august 1729  at two in the afternoon this day herr von hartoff came to my house and let me know he had business of consequence from the ministry and that he would return at five by my direction he was told i should expect him  at the time appointed he came and told me that the ministers of the court understanding from him that i designed to ask audience tomorrow did not doubt but my business would be to remind them of the answer which i had demanded yesterday and the day before that such applications were not customary among sovereign princes that they the ministers dared not treat farther in that affair with me that they desired me not to mention it to them again till they had received directions from his britannic majesty to whom they had made their report and that as soon as they received their instructions the result of these should be communicated to me  to this i replied that i did not expect the ministers of this court would refuse me the audience which i designed to ask tomorrow and that therefore i would not fail of being at the councilchamber at eleven next day according to bargain to know their answer to the rest of my proposalssecretary von hartoff would not hear of this resolution and assured me positively he had orders to listen to nothing more on the subject from me after which he left me   no 4at hanover 18th august 1729  at eleven this day i went to the councilchamber for the third time and desired secretary hartoff to prevail with the ministry to allow me to speak with them and communicate what the king of prussia had ordered me to propose  herr von hartoff gave them an account of my request and brought me for answer that i must wait a little because the ministers were not yet all assembled which i did but after having made me stay almost an hour and after the president of the council was come herr von hartoff came out to me and repeated what he had said yesterday in very positive and absolute terms that the ministers were resolved not to see me and had expressly forbid him taking any paper at my hands  to which i replied that this was very hard usage and the world would see how the king of prussia would relish it but having strict orders from his majesty my most gracious master to make a declaration to the ministers of hanover in his name and finding herr von hartoff would neither receive it nor take a copy of it i had only to tell him that i was under the necessity of leaving it in writingand had brought the paper with me let herr von hartoff observeand that now as the council were pleased to refuse to take it i was obliged to leave the said declaration on a table in an adjoining room in the presence of herr von hartoff and other secretaries of the council whom i desired to lay it before the ministry  after this i went home but had scarcely entered my apartment when a messenger returned me the declaration still sealed as i left it by order of the ministers and perceiving i was not inclined to receive it he laid it on my table and immediately left the house a letter from an english traveller to his friend at london relating to the differences betwixt the courts of prussia and hanover with copies of c translated from the french london a millar at buchanans head 1730 pp 2934 an excellent

advent of horse foot and artillery regiments at magdeburg actual rendezvous begun and with a frightful equable velocity going on day after day on the 15th day of september if fates almanac hold steady there will be 44000 of them ready there such a mass of potentialbattle as george or the hanover officiality areready to fight  alas far enough from that forces of their own they have after a sort subsidized hessians danes these they can begin to stir up but they have not a regiment ready for fighting and have nothing if all were ready which this 44000 cannot too probably sweep out of the world

not recorded for us only that he gets praise from his father so dexterous and perfect is he with the giants and their getting into gear nor is there says our foreign correspondent the least truth in your rumor that the prussian forces officers or men marched with bad will conspicuously the reverse is the truth as i myself can testify pamphlet cited above and his britannic majesty now making a dreadful flutter to assemble as fast as possible is like to get quite flung into the bogs by this terrible orson  what an amazement among the gazetteers thunderclouds of war mounting up over the zenith in this manner and blotting out the sun may produce an effect on the congress of soissons presumably and his imperial majesty left sitting desolate on his pragmatic sanction gloomily watching events may find something turn up to his advantage prussia and england are sufficiently in quarrel at any rate perhaps almost too muchthe pope in these circumstances did a curious thing the pope having prayed lately for rain and got it proceeds now in the end of september while such warrumors are still at their height in rome to pray or even do a public mass or some other socalled pontificality in the chapel of philip neri in the new church by way of still more effectual miracle prays namely that heaven would be graciously pleased to foment and blow up to the proper degree this quarrel between the two chief heretic powers heavens chief enemies whereby holy religion might reap a good benefit if it pleased heaven but this time the miracle did not go off according to program extract of a letter from rome 24th september 1729 in townshends despatch whitehall 10th outober 1729  for at this point before the pope had prayed but while the troops and artillery were evidently all on march such an artillery as i who am kaisers artillerymaster for my poor part never had the happiness to see before in any country snuffles seckendorf in the smoking parliament and now swords are as it were drawn and in the air make horrid circlesthe neighbors interfere heavens i put up your swordsand the huge worldwide tumult suddenly i think in the very first days of this month september collapses sinks into something you can put into a snuffbox  of course it could never come to actual battle after all too high a pickleherring tragedy that here is a comodiant not wanting to be smitten into the bogs an honest orson who wants nothing nor has ever wanted but fairplay fairplay and not to be insulted on the streets or have ones poor hobby quite knocked from under oneneighbors as we say struck in france holland all the neighbors at this point do it by arbitration wolfenbuttel for the one sachsengotha for the other commissioners to meet at brunswick and that accordingly was the course fixed upon and settlement by that method was accomplished without difficulty in some six months hence 16th april 1730 forster ii 105 whether clamei was awarded to hanover or to brandenburg i never knew or how the hay of it is cut at this moment i only know there was no battle on the subject though at one time there was like to be such a clash of battle as the old markgraves never had with their old wends not if we put all their battlings into one  seckendorfs radiant brow has to pucker itself again this fine project of boiling the kaisers eggs by setting the world on fire has not prospered after all the gloomy old villain came to her majesty one day dubourgay 30th july 1729 while things were near the hottest and said or insinuated he was the man that could do these businesses and bring about the doublemarriage itself if her majesty were not so harsh upon him whereupon her majesty reporting to dubourgay threw out the hint what if we that is you did give him a forty or fifty thousand thalers verily for he will do anything for money to which townshend answers from the gohrde to the effect pooh he is a mere bag of noxious futilities consists of gall mainly and rusty old lies and crotchets breathing very copperas through those old choppy lips of his let him go to the next spring at the happy end of the arbitration which he had striven all he could to mar and to retard he fell quite ill took to his bed for two dayscolics or one knows not whatand i cant say i am very sorry for him writes the respectable dubourgay 25th april 1730 on the 8th day of september 1729 friedrich crownprince reenters potsdam ib 11th sept 1729 with his two battalions of giants he has done so well the king goes out from berlin to see him march in with them rejoicing to find something of a soldier in the young graceless after all the king distributed 100000 thalers 15000 pounds among his army being well pleased with their behavior and doubtless right glad to be out of such a business the ahlden heritages will now get liquidated mecklenburgour knyphausen with the hanover consorts will settle mecklenburg and all shall be well again we hope  the fact on some of these points turned out different but it was now of less importance as to knyphausens proceedings at mecklenburg after the happy peace they were not so successful as had been hoped need of quarrel however between the majesties there henceforth was not in mecklenburg and if slight rufflings and collisions did arise it was not till after our poor doublemarriage was at any rate quite out of the game and they are without significance to us but the truth is though knyphausen did his best no settlement came nor indeed could ever come shall we sum up that sorry matter here and wash our hands of it     troubles of mecklenburg for the last time  knyphausen we say proved futile nor could human wit have succeeded the exasperated duke was contumacious irrational the two majesties kept pulling different ways upon him matters grew from very bad to worse and mecklenburg continued long a running sore not many months after this i think still in 1729 the irrational duke having got money out of russia came home again from dantzig to notable increase of the anarchies in mecklenburg though without other result for himself the irrational duke proved more contumacious than ever fell into deeper trouble than everat length 1733 he made proclamation to the peasantry to rise and fight for him who did turn out with their billhooks and bludgeons under captains named by him to the amount of 18000 peasantswith such riot as may be fancied but without other result so that the hanover commissioners decided to seize the very residenz cities schwerin and domitz from this mad duke and make the country clear of himhis brother being interim manager always under countenance of the commissioners which transactions especially which contemplated seizure of the residence cities friedrich wilhelm eventual heir could not see with equanimity at all but having no forces in the country what could he do being jointcommissioner this long while past though without armed interference hitherto he privately resolves that he will have forces there the rather as the poor duke professes penitence and flies to him for help poor soul his russian unique of wives has just died far enough away from him this long while past what a life they have had these two uniques  enough on the 19th of october 1733 lieutenantgeneral schwerinthe same who was colonel schwerin the dukes chief captain here at the beginning of these troubles now lientenantgeneral and a distinguished prussian officermarches into mecklenburg with three regiments one of foot two of horse buchholz i 122 142 michaelis ii 433 437 he doubtless will help in quelling those peasant and other anarchies privately his mission is most delicate he is not to fight with the hanoverians is delicately but effectually to shove them well away from the residence cities and fasten himself down in those parts which the lieutenantgeneral dexterously does a nights quarter here in parchimsuch is the lieutenantgenerals request polite but impressive from the outskirts of that little town a town essential to certain objects and in fact the point he is aiming at nights quarter you cannot refuse it to this prussian company marching under the kaisers commission no the hanoverian lieutenant of foot dare not take upon him to refusebut next morning he is himself invited to withdraw the prussians having orders to continue here in parchim and so with the other points and towns that are essential in the enterprise on hand a dexterous lieutenantgeneral this schwerinhis two horsecolonels are likewise men to be noted colonel wreech with a charming young wife perhaps a too charming colonel truchsess von waldburg known afterwards with distinction in london society and widely otherwise and thus in the end of 1733 the mecklenburg residence cities happen what may are secured for their poor irrational duke these things may slightly ruffle some tempers at hanover but it is now 1733 and our poor doublemarriage is clean out of the game by that time  the irrational duke could not continue in his residence cities with the brother administering over him still proving contumacious he needed absolutely to be driven out to wismar or i know not whither went wandering about for almost twenty years to come disturbed and stirring up disturbance died 1747 still in that sad posture interim brother with posterity succeeding michaelis ii 434440 but hanover and prussia interfered no farther the brother administered on his own footing supported by troops hired from hamburg hanover and prussia 400 hanoverians 200 prussians merely retained hold of their respective hypothecs districts held in pawn till the expenses should be paidmillion of thalers and by those late anarchies a new heavy score run up  prussia and hanover retained hold of their hypothecs for as to the expenses what hope was there fifty years hence we find the prussian hypothecs occupied as at first and rights of enlistment exercised never in this world were those expenses paidnor could be any part of them the last accounts were george iii of england on marrying in 1761 a mecklenburg princessold queen charlotte then young enoughhandsomely tore up the bill and so ended that part of a desperate debt but of the prussian part there was no end nor like to be any down to this day says buchholz in 1775 two squadrons of the ziethen hussars usually lie there and rights of enlisting are exercised i conclude the french revolution and its wars wiped away this other desperate item and now let us hope that mecklenburg is better off than formerlythat at least our hands are clear of it in time coming i add only with satisfaction that this unique of dukes was no ancestor of old queen charlottes but only a remote welshuncle far enough apartcannot be too far     one nussler settles the ahlden heritages sends the money home in boxes  knyphausen did not settle mecklenburg as we perceive neither did kannegiesser and the unliquidated heritages prosper at hanover quite to perfection one heritage that of uncle osnabruck little george flatly refused to share feudum the whole of that not allodium any part of it so that a sister cannot claim which i think was confirmed by the arbitrators at brunswick thereby ending that then as to the ahlden allodia or feudakannegiesser blamably or not never could make much of the business a precise strict man as we saw at the hanover councilroom lately whom the hanover people did not like so he made little of it nay at the end of next year december 1730 sending in his accounts to berlin he demands in addition to the three thalers or nine shillings daily allowed him almost a second nine shillings for sundries chiefly for hairpowder and shoeblacking and is instantly recalled and vanishes from history at this point busching beitrage i 307 c nussler  upon which friedrich wilhelm selects another sends deal boxes along with him to bring home what cash there is this ones name is nussler an expectant prussian official an adroit man whom we shall meet again doing work he has the nine shillings a day without hairpowder or blacking while employed here at berlin no constant salary whateverhad to borrow 75 pounds for outfit on this businessdoes a great deal of work without wages in hope of effective promotion by and by which did follow after tedious years friedrich wilhelm finding him on such proof other proof will not do fit for promoting to steady employment  nussler was very active at hanover and had his deal boxes but hardly got them filled according to hope however in some eighteen months he had actually worked out in difficult instalments about 13000 pounds and dug the matter to the bottom he came home with his last instalment not disapproved of to berlin may 1732 six years after the poor duchesss death so the ahlden allodia too had their end     chapter vii  a marriage not the doublemarriage crownprince deep in trouble  while the hanover imminency was but beginning and horrid crisis of war or duelwas yet in nobodys thoughts the anspach wedding 30th may 1729 had gone on at berlin to friedrich wilhelms satisfaction not to his queens the match being but a poor one the bride was frederika louisa not the eldest of their daughters but the nexteldest younger than wilhelmina and still hardly fifteen the first married of the family very young she and gets a very young margrafwho

pollnitz then memoirs and letters besides the memoirs of brandenburg posthumous which we often cite all by this poor man only the last has any historical value and that not much the first two are only worth consulting cautiously as loose contemporary babblewritten for the dutch booksellers one can perceive and as i gather is impatient to see him settled that she may retire and die  friday forenoon 19th may 1729 the young margraf arrived in person at berlinjust seventeen gone saturday last poor young soul and very foolish sublime royal carriage met him at the prussian frontier and this day what is more interesting our crownprince rides out to meet him mounts into the royal carriage beside him and the two young fools drive in such a cavalcade of hoofs and wheelstalking we know not whatinto

this new brotherinlaw testifies wilhelmina in many places finances in disorder mothers wise management ceasing too soon has only partially availed king has lent some hundreds of thousands of crowns to anspach says friedrich at a later period which there is no chance of ever being repaid all is in disorder there in the finance way if the margraf gets his hunting and his heroning he laughs at all the rest and his people pluck him bare at every hand schulenburgs letter in forster iii 72 nor do the married couple agree to perfectionfar from it hate one another like cat and dog like the fire comme le

sickness she has hadnot smallpox at all as malicious english rumor gave it in englandand looks prettier than ever writes dubourgay  here is a marriage then first in the familybut not the doublemarriage by a long way the late hanover tornado sudden waterspout as we called it has quenched that negotiation and one knows not in what form it will resuscitate itself the royal mind both at berlin and st jamess is in a very uncertain state after such a phenomenon  friedrich wilhelms favor for the crownprince marching home so gallantly with his potsdam giants did not last long a few weeks later in the autumn we have again ominous notices from dubourgay and here otherwise obtained is a glimpse into the interior of the berlin schloss momentary perfect clearness as by a flash of lightning on the state of matters there which will be illuminative to the reader     crownprinces domesticities seen in a flash of lightning  this is another of those tragicomic scenes tragic enough in effect between father and son son now about eighteenfit to be getting through oxford had he been an english gentleman of private station it comes from the irrefragable nicolai who dates it about this time uncertain as to month or day  fritzs love of music especially of fluting is already known to us now a certain quantz was one of his principal instructors in that art and indeed gave him the last finish of perfection in it quantz famed saxon musicmaster and composer leader of the courtband in saxony king of fluteplayers in his daya villagefarriers son from the gottingen region and himself destined to shoe horses had not imperative nature prevailed over hindrancesquantz ever from fritzs sixteenth year was wont to come occasionally express from dresden for a week or two and give the young man lessons on the flute the young mans mother good queen feekin had begged this favor for him from the saxon sovereignties and pleaded hard for it at home or at worst kept it secret there it was one of the many good maternities clandestine and public which she was always ready to achieve for him where possibleas he also knew full well in his young grateful heart and never forgot however old he grew illustrious quantz we say gives fritz lessons on the flute and here is a scene they underwentthey and a certain brisk young soldier fellow lieutenant von katte who was there too of whom the reader will tragically hear more in time  on such occasions fritz was wont to pull off the tight prussian coat or coatie and clap himself into flowing brocade of the due roominess and splendorbright scarlet dressinggown done in gold with tags and sashes completeand so in a temporary manner feel that there was such a thing as a gentlemans suitable apparel he would take his musiclessons follow his clandestine studies in that favorable dressthus buffon we hear was wont to shave and put on clean linen before he sat down to write finding it more comfortable so though again there have been others who could write in considerable disorder not to say litter and palpable imperfection of equipment samuel johnson for instance did some really grand writing in a room where there was but one chair and that one incapable of standing unless you sat on it having only three feet a man is to fit himself to what is round him but surely a crownprince may be indulged in a little brocade in his leisure moments  fritz and quantz sat doing music an unlawful thing in this pleasant but also unlawful costume when lieutenant katte who was on watch in the outer room rushes in distraction in his aspect majesty just here quick double quick katte snatches the musicbooks and flutes snatches quantz hurries with him and them into some wallpress or closet for firewood and stands quaking there our poor prince has flung aside his brocade got on his military coatie and would fain seem busy with important or indifferent routine matters but alas he cannot undo the french hairdressing cannot change the graceful french bag into the strict prussian queue in a moment the french bag betrays him kindles the paternal vigilancealas the paternal wrath into a tornado pitch for his vigilant suspecting majesty searches about finds the brocade article behind a screen crams it with loud indignation into the fire finds all the illicit french books confiscates them on the spot confiscates all manner of contraband goodsand there was mere sulphurous whirlwind in those serene spaces for about an hour if his majesty had looked into the woodcloset his majesty by heavens express mercy omitted that haude the bookseller was sent for ordered to carry off that poisonous french cabinetlibrary in mass sell every book of it to an undiscerning public at what price it will fetch which latter part of his order haude in deep secrecy ventured to disobey being influenced thereto haude in deep secrecy kept the cabinetlibrary secure and lent the prince book after book from it as his royal highness required them  friedrich it is whispered in tobaccoparliament has been known in his irreverent impatience to call the grenadier uniform his shroud sterbekittel or deathclothes so imprisoning to the young mind and body paternal majesty has heard this blasphemous rumor hence doubtless in part his fury against the wider brocade garment  it was quantz himself that reported this explosion to authentic nicolai many years afterwards confessing that he trembled every joint of him in the woodcloset during that hour of hurricane and the rather as he had on a red dresscoat whioh color foremost of the flaring colors he knew to be his majestys aversion on a mans back nicolai anekdoten berlin 1790 ii 148 of incomparable quantz and his heartthrilling adagios we hope to hear again

getting beyond his depth in trouble  it is not certain that the late imminency of duel had much to do with such explosions the hanover imminency which we likened to a tropical waterspout or sudden thunderous blottingout of the sky to the astonished gazetteers seems rather to have passed away as waterspouts doleaving the earth and air if anything a little refreshed by such crisis leaving that is to say the two majesties a little less disposed for open quarrel or rash utterance of their ill humor in time coming but in the mean while all mutual interests are in a painful state of suspended animation in berlin there is a privately rebellious spouse and household there is a tobaccoparliament withaland the royal mind sensitive imaginative as a poets as a womans and liable to transports as of a norse baresark is of uncertain movement such a load of intricacies and exaggerated anxieties hanging on it the royal mind goes like the most confused smokejack sure only to have revolutions and

eighteen in a couple of months and feels the indignity of such things begs of mamma to be excused in future he has much to suffer from his father again writes dubourgay in the end of november it is difficult to conceive the vile stratagems that are made use of to provoke the father against the son dubourgay 28th november 1729 or again take this as perhaps marking an epoch in the business a fortnight farther on  december 10th 1729 his prussian majesty cannot bear the sight of either the prince or princess royal the other day he asked the prince kalkstein makes you english does not he kalkstein your old tutor borck knyphausen finkenstein they are all of that vile clique to which the prince answered i respect the english because i know the people there love me upon which the king seized him by the collar struck him fiercely with his cane in fact rained showers of blows upon him and it was only by superior strength thinks dubourgay that the poor prince escaped worse there is a general apprehension of something tragical taking place before long  truly the situation is so violent it cannot last and in effect a wild thought not quite new ripens to a resolution in the crownprince under such pressures in reference to which as we grope and guess here is a billet to mamma which wilhelmina has preserved wilhelmina omits all trace of date as usual but dubourgay in the above excerpt probably supplies that defect   friedrich to his mother potsdam december 1729  i am in the uttermost despair what i had always apprehended has at last come on me the king has entirely forgotten that i am his son this morning i came into his room as usual at the first sight of me or at the first passage of kalksteindialogue with me he sprang forward seized me by the collar and struck me a shower of cruel blows with his rattan i tried in vain to screen myself he was in so terrible a rage almost out of himself it was only weariness not my superior strength that made him give up  i am driven to extremity i have too much honor to endure such treatment and i am resolved to put an end to it in one way or another wilhelmina i 175  is not this itself sufficiently tragical not the first stroke he had got we can surmise but the first torrent of strokes and open beating like a slavewhich to a proud young man and prince at such age is indeed intolerable wilhelmina knows too well what he meaus by ending it in one way or another but strives to reassure mamma as to its meaning flight or the like desperate resolution mere violence of the moment argues wilhelmina terribly aware that it is deeperrooted than that  flight is not a new idea to the crownprince in a negative form we have seen it present in the minds of bystanders a crownprince determined not to fly whispered they dubourgay 9th august 1729 supra p 129 some weeks ago wilhelmina writes the kings bad treatments began again on his reappearance at potsdam after the hunting he never saw my brother without threatening him with his cane my brother told me day after day he would endure everything from the king only not blows and that if it ever came to such extremity he would be prepared to deliver himself by running off and here it would seem the extremity has actually come  wilhelmina pitying her poor brother but condemning him on many points continues i 173 174 lieutenant keith that wild companion of his had been gone some time stationed in wesel with his regiment which fact let us also keep in mind keiths departure had been a great joy to me in the hope my brother would now lead a more regular life but it proved quite otherwise a second favorite and a much more dangerous succeeded keith this was a young man of the name of katte captainlieutenant in the regiment gensdarmes he was highly connected in the army his mother had been a daughter of feldmarschall graf von wartenslebena highest dignitary of the last generation kattes father now a general of distinction rose also to be feldmarschall cousins too sons of a kammerpresident von katte at magdeburg rose to army rank in time coming but not this poor kattewhom let the reader note  general katte his father continues wilhelmina had sent him to the universities and afterwards to travel desiring he should be a lawyer but as there was no favor to expect out of the army the young man found himself at last placed there contrary to his expectation he continued to apply himself to studies he had wit bookculture acquaintance with the world the good company which he continued to frequent had given him polite manners to a degree then rare in berlin his physiognomy was rather disagreeable than otherwise a pair of thick black eyebrows almost covered the eyes of him his look had in it something ominous presage of the fate he met with a tawny skin torn by smallpox increased his ugliness he affected the freethinker and carried libertinism to excess a great deal of ambition and headlong rashness accompanied this vice a dangerous adviser here in the berlin element with lightnings goingsuch a favorite was not the man to bring back my brother from his follies this i learned at our mammas and my return to berlin from the wusterhausen and the potsdam tribulationsand think of it not without terror now that the extremity seems coming or come     chapter ix  doublemarriage shall be or shall not be  for one thing friedrich wilhelm weary of all this english pother and futility will end the doublemarriage speculation wilhelmina shall be disposed of and so an end friedrich wilhelm once the hunting was over at wusterhausen ran across southwardto lubnow wilhelmina calls itto lubben in the nether lausitz 25th october 1729 fassmann p 404 a short days drive there to meet incognito the jovial polish majesty on his route towards dresden to see a review or so and have a little talk with the evercheerful man of sin grumkow and seckendorf of course these accompany majestys shadow is not surer  review was held at lubben weissenfels commanderinchief taking charge dinner also a dinner or two with much talk and drinkand there it was settled wilhelmina has since known that weissenfels royal highness in the abstract was to be her husband after all weissenfels will do either weissenfels or else the margraf of schwedt thinks friedrich wilhelm somebody shall marry the baggage out of hand and let us have done with that grumkow as we know was very anxious for it calculating thereby to out the ground from under the old dessauer and make this weissenfels generalissimo of prussia a patriotic thought polish majesty lent hand always willing to oblige  friedrich wilhelm on his return homewards went round by dahme for a nightnot dam o princess there is no such town or schloss round by dahme a little town and patch of territory in the saxon countries which was weissenfelss apanagewhere plenty of tokay cheered the royal heart and in such mood it seemed as if ones daughter might do very well in this extremely limited position and weissenfels though with dark misgivings as to queen sophie was but too happy to consent the foolish creature a little given to liquor too friedrich wilhelm with this fine project in his head drove home to potsdamand there laid about him on the poor crownprince in the way we have seen terrifying queen and princess who are at berlin till christmas and the carnival be over friedrich wilhelm means to see the polish majesty again before longprobably so soon as this of weissenfels is fairly got through the female parliament where it is like there will be difficulties  christmas came to berlin and the king with it who did the gayeties for a week or two and spoke nothing about business to his female parliament dubourgay saw him at parade on newyears morning whither all manner of foreign dignitaries had come to pay their respects well cried the king to dubourgay we shall have a war thenuniversa1 deadly tug at those italian apanages for and against an insulted kaiserwar and then all that is crooked will be pulled straight so spake friedrich wilhelm on the newyears morning war in italy universal spasm of wrestle there being now the expectation of foolish mankind crooked will be pulled straight thinks friedrich wilhelm and perhaps certain high majesties deaf to the voice of shouldnot will understand that of cannot excellenzcrooked will become straight indeed if so your majesty the sooner the better i ventured to answer dubourgay 8th january 1730  new years day is not well in and the ceremonial wishes over when friedrich wilhelm his mind full of serious domestic and foreign matter withdraws to potsdam again and therefrom begins fulminating in a terrible manner on his womankind at berlin what we called his female parliamenttoo much given to opposition courses at present intends to have his measures passed there in defiance of opposition straightway and an end put to this inexpressible doublemarriage higglehaggle speed to him we will saythree high crises occur three or even four which can now without much detail be made intelligible to the patient reader on the back of which we look for some catastrophe and finis to the businessany catastrophe that will prove a finis how welcome will it be     wilhelmina to be married out of hand crisis first england shall say yes or say no  still early in january a few days after his majestys return to potsdam three high official gentlemen count fink van finkenstein old tutor to the prince grumkow and general borck announce themselves one morning have a pressing message from the king to her majesty wilhelmina i 180 queen is astonished expecting anything soonerthis regards me i have a dreading shuddered wilhelmina to mamma no matter said the queen shrugging her shoulders one must have firmness and that is not what i shall wantand her majesty went into the audiencechamber leaving wilhelmina in such tremors  finkenstein a friendly man as borck too is explains to her majesty that they three have received each a letter overnightletter from the king enjoining in the first place silence under pain of death in the second place apprising them that he the king will no longer endure her majestys disobedience in regard to the marriage of his daughter but will banish daughter and mother to oranienburg quasidivorce and outer darkness unless there be compliance with his sovereign will thirdly that they are accordingly to go all three to her majesty to deliver the enclosed royal autograph which finkenstein presents testifying what said sovereign will is and on the above terms expect her majestys replyas they have now sorrowfully done finkenstein and borck with real sorrow grumkow with the reverse of real  sovereign will is to the effect write to england one other time will you at once marry or not at once yea or no answer can be here within a fortnight three weeks even in case of bad winds if the answer be not yea at once then you madam you at once choose weissenfels or schwedt one or the otherunder what penalties you know oranienburg and worse  here is a crisis but her majesty did not want firmness write to england yes willingly but as to weissenfels and schwedt whatever answer come from englandimpossible steadily answers her majesty there was much discourse suasive argumentative grumkow quoting scripture on her majesty as the devil can on occasion says wilhelmina express scriptures wives be obedient to your husbands and the like texts but her majesty on the scripture side too gave him as good as he brought did not bethuel the son of milcah genesis xxiv 1458 when abrahams servant asked his daughter in marriage for young isaac answer we will call the damsel and inquire of her mouth and they called rebecca and said unto her wilt thou go with this man and she said i will go scripture for scripture herr von grumkow wives must obey their husbands surely yes but the husbands are to command things just and reasonable the kings procedure is not accordant with that law he is for doing violence to my daughters inclination and rendering her unhappy for the rest of her dayswill give her a brutal debauchee fat weissenfels so describable in strong language a younger brother who is nothing but the king of polands officer landless and without means to live according to his rank or can it be the state that will profit from such a marriage if they have a household the king will have to support itwrite to england yes but whatever the answer of england weissenfels never a thousand times sooner see my child in her grave than hopelessly miserable here a qualm overtook her majesty for in fact she is in an interesting state third month of her time i am not well you should spare me gentlemen in the state i am ini do not accuse the king concluded she i know hurling a glance at grumkow to whom i owe all thisand withdrew to her interior privacies reading there with wilhelmina the kings cruel letter and weeping largely though firm to the death wilhelmina i 179182 dubourgay has nothingprobably had heard nothing there being silence under pain of death for the moment  what to do in such a crisis assemble the female parliament for one thing good madam finkenstein old tutors wife good mamsell bulow mamsell sonsfeld wilhelminas governess and other faithful womenwell if we can keep away traitresses female spies that are prowling about especially one ramen a queens soubrette who gets trusted with everything and betrays everything upon whom wilhelmina is often eloquent never was such a traitress took dubourgays bribe which the queen had advised and all the same betrays everythingbribe included and the queen so bewitched can keep nothing from her female parliament must take precautions about the ramenfor the rest female parliament advises two things 1 pressing letter to england that of course written with the eloquence of despair and then 2 that in case of utter extremity her majesty pretend to fall ill that is crisis first and that is their expedient upon it  letter goes to england therefore setting forth the extremity of strait and pinch now or never o my sister caroline many such have gone first and last but this is the strongest of all nay the crownprince too shall write to his aunt of england you wilhelmina draw out a fit brief letter for him send it to potsdam he will copy it there wilhelmina i 183 so orders the mother wilhelmina does it with a terrified heart crownprince copies without scruple i have already given your majesty my word of honor never to wed any one but the princess amelia your daughter i here reiterate that promise in case your majesty will consent to my sisters marriageshould that alone prove possible in the present intricacies we are all reduced to such a state thatwilhelmina gives the letter in full but as it is professedly of her own composition a loose vague piece the very date of which you have to grope out for yourself it cannot even count among the several letters written by the crownprince both before and after it to the same effect which are now probably all of them lost trace of one copy of answer from queen caroline to what seems to have been one answer rather of dissuasive tenor is in statepaper office prussian despatches vol xldateless probably some months later in 1780 without regret to anybody and we will not reckon it worth transcribing farther such missive such two missives not now found in any archive speed to england by express may the winds be favorable her majesty waits anxious at berlin ready to take refuge in a bed of sickness should bad come to worse     dubourgay strikes a light for the english court  in england in the mean while they have received a curious little piece of secret information one reichenbach prussian envoy at londondubourgay has long marvelled at the man and at the news he sends to berlin here of date 17th january 1730 is a letter on that subject from dubourgay official but private as yet for george tilson esqtilson is undersecretary in the foreign office whose name often turns up on such occasions in the dubourgay the robinson and other extinct paperheaps of that time dubourgay dates doubly by old and new style in general we print by the new only unless the contrary be specified   to george tilson esq private  berlin 6th jan 1729 by new style 17th jan 1730  siri believe you may remember that we have for a long time suspected that most of reichenbachs despatches were dictated by some people here about two days ago a paper fell into my hands realized quietly for a consideration containing an account of money charged to the brothers jourdan and lautiers merchants here by their correspondent in london for sending letters from properly in or through your city to reichenbach  jourdan and lautierss london correspondents are mr thomas greenhill in little bell alley and mr john motteux in st mary axe mr guerin my agent knows them very well having paid them several little bills on my accountbetter ask mr guerin i know not through the hands of which of those merchants the abovementioned letters have passed but you have ways enough to find it out if you think it worth while i make no manner of doubt but grumkow and his party make use of this conveyance to sic their instructions to reichenbach in the account which i have seen eighteenpence is charged for carrying each letter to reichenbach the charge in general is for thirtytwo letters and refers to a former account so that they must have been long at it  i am with the greatest truth  dubourgay   here is a trail which tilson will have no difficulty in running down i forget whether it was in bell alley or st mary axe that the nest was found but found it soon was and the due springes were set and game came steadily dropping inletters to and letters fromwhich when once his britannic majesty had with reluctance given warrant to open and decipher them threw light on prussian affairs and yielded fine sport and speculation in the britannic majestys apartment on an evening  this is no other than the celebrated cipher correspondence between grumkow and reichenbach grumkow covertly instructing his slave reichenbach what the london news shall be reichenbach answering him to hear is to obey correspondence much noised of in the modern prussian books and which was no doubt very wonderful to tilson and companycapable of being turned to uses they thought the reader shall see specimens by and by and he will find it unimportant enough and unspeakably stupid to him it does show grumkow as the extreme of subtle fowlers and how the dirtyfingered seckendorf and he cooked their birdlime but to us that is not new though at st jamess it was perhaps uses may lie in it there at all events it is a pretty topic in queen carolines apartment on an evening and the little majesty and she with various laughters and reflections can discern a little how a poor king of prussia is befooled by his servants and in what way a fierce bear is led about by the nose and dances to grumkows piping poor soul much of his late raging and growling perhaps it was only grumkows and not his does not hate us he perhaps but only grumkow through him this doleful enchantment and that the royal wild bear dances only to tunes ought to be held in mind when we want anything with himthose amid the teheeings are reflections that cannot escape queen caroline and her little george while the prussian express unknown to them is on the road     wilhelmina to be married out of hand crisis second england shall have said no  the prussian express queen sophies courier to england made his best speed but he depends on the winds for even arriving there and then he depends on the chances for an answer there an uncertain courier as to time and it was not in the power of speed to keep pace with friedrich wilhelms impatience no answer yet growls friedrich wilhelm before a fortnight is gone no answerand january has not ended till a new deputation of the same three gentlemen finkenstein borck grumkow again waits on the queen for whom there is now this other message wednesday 25th january 1730 so dubourgay dates it so likewise wilhelmina right for once a day i shall never forget adds she  finkenstein and borck merciful persons and always of the english party were again profoundly sorry borck has a blaze of temper in him withal we hear he apprised grumkow at one point of the dialogue that he grumkow was a scoundrel so dubourgay calls itwhich was one undeniable truth offered there that day but what can anything profit the message is whatever the answer now be from england i will have nothing to do with it negative procrastinative affirmative to me it shall be zero you madam have to choose for wilhelmina between weissenfels and schwedt otherwise i myself will choose and upon you and her will alight oranienburg outer darkness and just penalties of mutiny against the authority set over you by god and men weissenfels or schwedt choose straightway this is the kings message by these three  you can inform the king replied her majesty wilhelmina i 188 that he will never make me consent to render my daughter miserable and that so long as a breath of life un souffle de vie remains in me i will not permit her to take either the one or the other of those persons is that enough for you sir added her majesty turning to grumkow for you sir who are the author of my misfortunes may my curse fall upon you and your house you have this day killed me but i doubt not heaven will hear my prayer and avenge these wrongs dubourgay 28th january 1730 wilhelmina i 188 who suppresses the maledictory partand herewith to a bed of sickness as the one refuge left  her majesty does now in fact take to bed at berlin fallen very ill it would appear which gives some pause to friedrich wilhelm till he ascertain poorly for certain report the doctors even friedrich wilhelms doctor the humane doctors have silently given one another the hint for berlin is one tempest of whispers about her majestys domestic sorrows poorly for interesting reasonsperhaps be worse before she is better your majestyhmph thinks friedrich wilhelm out at potsdam and then the treacherous ramen reports that it is all shamming and his majesty a bear though a loving one is driven into wrath again and so wavers from side to side  it is certain the queen held faster or looser by her bed of sickness as a main refuge in these emergencies the last shift of oppressed womankindsanctioned by female parliament in this instance has had a miscarriage writes dubourgay from berlin gossip at the beginning of the business nay at one time she became really ill to a dangerous length and his majesty did not at first believe it and then was like to break his heart poor bear aud pardoned wilhelmina and even fritz at the mothers requesttill symptoms mended again wilhelmina i 207 jarnibleu herr seckendorf grumkow serves us honorably dienet ehrlichdoes not heambiguous bed of sickness a refuge in time of trouble did not quite terminate till may next when her majestys time came a fine young prince the result 23d may 1730 august ferdinand her last child and this mode of refuge in trouble ceased to be necessary     wilhelmina to be married out of hand crisis third majesty himself will choose then  directly on the back of that peremptory act of disobedience by the womankind on wednesday last friedrich wilhelm came to berlin himself he stormfully reproached his queen regardless of the sickbed intimated the infallible certainty that wilhelmina nevertheless would wed without delay and that either weissenfels or schwedt would be the man and this said he straightway walked out to put the same in execution  walked namely to the mother margravine of schwedt the lady in high colors old dessauers sister and proposed to her that wilhelmina should marry her sonthe supreme wish of my life your majesty replied she of the high colors but against the princesss own will how can i accept such happiness alas your majesty i never canand flatly refused his majesty on those terms a thing wilhelmina will ever gratefully remember of her wilhelmina i 197  so that the king is now reduced to weissenfels and returns still more indignant to her majestys apartment weissenfels however it shall be and frightful rumors go that he is written to that he is privately coming and that there will be no remedy wilhelmina i 197 wilhelmina formerly almost too florid is gone to a shadow her waist hardly half an ell worn down by these agitations the prince and she if the king see either of themit is safer to run or squat behind screens     how friedrich prince of baireuth came to be the man after all  in this high wind of extremity the king now on the spot and in such temper borck privately advises that her majesty bend a littlepretend to give up the english connection and propose a third party to get rid of weissenfelswhat third party thenwell there is young brandenburgculmbach for example heirapparent of baireuth friedrich a handsome enough young prince just coming home from the grand tour we hear will have a fine territory when his father dies age is suitable old kinship with the house all moneyquarrels settled eight or ten years ago why not himexcellent said her majesty and does suggest him to the king in the next schwedtweissenfels onslaught friedrich wilhelm grumbles an assent well thenbut i will be passive observe not a groschen of dowry for one thing  and this is the first appearance of the young margraf friedrich heirapparent of baireuth who comes in as a hypothetic figure at this late stageand will carry off the fair prize as is well known still only doing the grand tour little dreaming of the high fortune about to drop into his mouth so many wooers four kings among them suing in vain him without suing the fates appoint to be the man  not a bad young fellow at all though no king wilhelmina we shall find takes charmingly to him like a good female soul regretless of the four kingsfinds her own safe little island there the prettiest in the world after such perils of drowning in stormy seasof his brandenburg genealogy degree of cousinship to queen caroline of england and to the lately wedded young gentleman of anspach queen carolines nephew we shall say nothing farther having already spoken of it and even drawn an abstruse diagram of it antea vol v p 309c sufficient for the most genealogical reader but in regard to that of the peremptory not a groschen of dowry from friedrich wilhelm which was but a bark after all and proved the reverse of a bite from his majesty there may a word of explanation be permissible  the ancestor of this baireuth prince friedrichas readers knew once but doubtless have forgotten againwas a younger son and for six generations so it stood not till the father of this friedrich was of good age and only within these few years did the elder branch die out and the younger in the person of said father succeed to baireuth friedrichs grandfather as all these progenitors had done lived poorly like cadets on apanages and makeshifts  so that the young princes father george friedrich present incumbent as we may call him of baireuth found himselfwith a couple of brothers he has whom also we may transiently see by and byin very straitened circumstances in their young years their father son of younger sons as we saw was himself poor and he had fourteen of them as family now in old king friedrich is time it became apparent as the then reigning margraf of baireuths children all died soon after birth that one of these necessitous fourteen was likely to succeed in baireuth if they could hold out old king friedrich thereupon said you have chances of succession true enoughbut nobody knows what will become of that sell your chance to me who am ultimate heir of all i will give you a round sumthe little domain of weverlingen in the halberstadt country and say half a million thalers there you can live comfortably and support your fourteen childrendone said the necessitous cousin went to weverlingen accordingly and there lived the rest of his days till 1708 leaving his necessitous fourteen or about ten of them that were alive and growing up still all minors and necessitous enough  the young men george friedrich at the top of them kept silence in weverlingen and conformed to papa having nothing to live upon elsewhere but they had their own thoughts especially as their cousin of baireuth was more and more likely to die childless and at length being in the kaisers service as soldiers some of them and having made what interest was feasible they early in friedrich wilhelms reign burst out that is to say appealed to the reichshofrath imperial aulic council at vienna chief court of the empire in such cases openly protesting there that their papa had no power to make such a bargain selling their birthright for immediate pottage and that in brief they would not stand by it at alland summoned friedrich wilhelm to show cause why they should  long lawsuit in consequence lengthy lawpleadings and much parchment and wiggery in that german tripleelixir of chancerylittle to the joy of friedrich wilhelm friedrich wilhelm from the first was fairness itself pay me back the money and let it be in all points as you say answered friedrich wilhelm from the first alas the money was eaten how could the money be paid back the reichshofrath dubitatively shook its wig for years bargain bad in law but money clearly repayable the money was and is goodwhat shall be done about the money at length in 1722 friedrich wilhelm of himself settled with this present margraf then heirpresumptive how by steady slow instalments it could be possible from the revenues of baireuth thriftily administered to pay back that halfmillion and odd thalers and the now margraf ever since his accession in 1726 has been annually doing it so that there is at this time nothing but composed kinship and friendship between the two courts the little and the big only friedrich wilhelm especially with his will crossed in this matter of the baireuth marriage thinks to himself throw more money into such a gulf the 600000 thalers had better be got out first and says he will give no dowry at all nor take any charge not so much as give away the bride but be passive in the matter  queen sophie delighted to conquer grumkow at any rate is charmed with this notion of baireuth and for a moment forgets all other considerations should england prove slack and fail what a resource will baireuth be compared with weissenfels and wilhelmina entering her majesty breaks forth into admiration over the victory or halfvictory just gained what a husband for you this my dear in comparison and as wilhelmina cannot quite join in the rapture on a sudden and cannot even consent unless papa too give his real countenance to the match mamma flies out upon the poor young lady wilhelmina i 201 take the grand turk or the great mogul then said the queen and follow your own caprice i should not have brought so many sorrows on myself had i known you better follow the kings bidding then it is your own affair i will no longer trouble myself about your concernsand spare me please the sorrow of your odious presence for i cannot stand it wilhelmina wished to reply but the answer was silence go i tell you and i retired all in tears  all in tears the doublemarriage drifting furiously this long while in such a sea as never was and breakers now close aleehave the desperate crew fallen to stavingin the liquorcasks and quarrelling with one anotherevident one thing is her majesty cannot be considered a perfectly wise mother we shall see what her behavior is when wilhelmina actually weds this respectable young prince ungrateful creature to wish papas consent as well as mine that is the maternal feeling at this moment and wilhelmina weeps bitterly as one of the unluckiest of young ladies  nay her brother himself who is sick of this permanent hurricane and would fain see the end of it at any price takes mammas part and wilhelmina and he come to high words on the matter this was the unkindest cut of allbut of course this healed in a day poor prince he has his own allowance of insults disgraces blows has just been found out in some plan or suspicion of a plan found out to be in debt at least and been half miraculously pardonedand except in flight he still sees no deliverance ahead five days ago 22d january 1730 there came out a cabinetorder summary act of parliament so to speak against lending money to princes of the blood were it even to the princeroyal a crime and misdemeanor that shall now be and forfeiture of the money is only part of the penalty according to this cabinetorder rumor is the crownprince had purchased a vehicle and appurtenances at leipzig and was for running off certainty is he was discovered to have borrowed 1000 thalers from a certain moneyed man at berlin money made from french scrip in mississippi laws timewhich debt friedrich wilhelm instantly paid your whole debt then is that tell me the wholemy whole debt answered the prince who durst not own to about 9000 other thalers 1500 pounds he has borrowed from other quarters first and last friedrich wilhelm saw perhaps some premonition of flight or of desperate measures in this business and was unexpectedly mild paid the 1000 thalers instantly adding the cabinetorder against future contingencies ranke i 296 forster c the prince was in this humor when he took mammas side and redoubled wilhelminas grief     doublemarriage on the edge of shipwreck flies off a kind of carrierpigeon or noahsdove to england with cry for help  faithful mamsell bulow consoles the princess wait i have news that will put her majesty in fine humorand she really proved as good as her word her news is dubourgay and knyphausen in this extremity of pinch have decided to send off not letters merely but a speaking messenger to the english court one dr villa some kind of

to go instantly will explain what the fatal pass we are reduced to is and whether princess wilhelmina is the fright some represent her there or not  her majesty is overjoyed to hear it who would not be her majesty writes letters of the due vehemency thinks wilhelminadare not write at all says dubourgaybut loads villa with presents with advices with her whole heart speeds him under way dismissed turned off for some fault or otheror perhaps because the princess knows enough of english so the rumor goes in villas berlin circle  the chaplain set out with his despatches says wilhelmina who does not name him but is rather eloquent upon his errand loaded with presents from the queen on taking leave of me he wept warm tears he said saluting in the english fashioni hope with bended knee and the maidens fingers at his lipshe would deny his country if it did not do its duty on this occasion and so hastened forth on his errand like a carrierpigeon sent in extremitylike noahsdove in the deluge
