48521067	twice told tales                        the threefold destiny                           a fairy legend                       by nathaniel hawthorne    i have sometimes produced a singular and not unpleasing effect so far as my own mind was concerned by imagining a train of incidents in which the spirit and mechanism of the fairy legend should be combined with the characters and manners of familiar life  in the little tale which follows a subdued tinge of the wild and wonderful is thrown over a sketch of new england personages and scenery yet it is hoped without entirely obliterating the sober hues of nature  rather than a story of events claiming to be real it may be considered as an allegory such as the writers of the last century would have expressed in the shape of an eastern tale but to which i have endeavored to give a more lifelike warmth than could be infused into those fanciful productions  in the twilight of a summer eve a tall dark figure over which long and remote travel had thrown an outlandish aspect was entering a village not in fairy londe but within our own familiar boundaries the staff on which this traveller leaned had been his companion from the spot where it grew in the jungles of hindostan the hat that overshadowed his sombre brow had shielded him from the suns of spain but his cheek had been blackened by the redhot wind of an arabian desert and had felt the frozen breath of an arctic region  long sojourning amid wild and dangerous men he still wore beneath his vest the ataghan which he had once struck into the throat of a turkish robber  in every foreign clime he had lost something of his new england characteristics and perhaps from every people he had unconsciously borrowed a new peculiarity so that when the worldwanderer again trod the street of his native village it is no wonder that he passed unrecognized though exciting the gaze and curiosity of all  yet as his arm casually touched that of a young woman who was wending her way to an evening lecture she started and almost uttered a cry  ralph cranfield was the name that she half articulated  can that be my old playmate faith egerton thought the traveller looking round at her figure but without pausing  ralph cranfield from his youth upward had felt himself marked out for a high destiny  he had imbibed the ideawe say not whether it were revealed to him by witchcraft or in a dream of prophecy or that his brooding fancy had palmed its own dictates upon him as the oracles of a sibylbut he had imbibed the idea and held it firmest among his articles of faith that three marvellous events of his life were to be confirmed to him by three signs  the first of these three fatalities and perhaps the one on which his youthful imagination had dwelt most fondly was the discovery of the maid who alone of all the maids on earth could make him happy by her love  he was to roam around the world till he should meet a beautiful woman wearing on her bosom a jewel in the shape of a heart whether of pearl or ruby or emerald or carbuncle or a changeful opal or perhaps a priceless diamond ralph cranfield little cared so long as it were a heart of one peculiar shape  on encountering this lovely stranger he was bound to address her thus  maiden i have brought you a heavy heart  may i rest its weight on you  and if she were his fated brideif their kindred souls were destined to form a union here below which all eternity should only bind more closelyshe would reply with her finger on the heartshaped jewel this token which i have worn so long is the assurance that you may  and secondly ralph cranfield had a firm belief that there was a mighty treasure hidden somewhere in the earth of which the burialplace would be revealed to none but him  when his feet should press upon the mysterious spot there would be a hand before him pointing downwardwhether carved of marble or hewn in gigantic dimensions on the side of a rocky precipice or perchance a hand of flame in empty air he could not tell but at least he would discern a hand the forefinger pointing downward and beneath it the latin word effodedig  and digging thereabouts the gold in coin or ingots the precious stones or of whatever else the treasure might consist would be certain to reward his toil  the third and last of the miraculous events in the life of this highdestined man was to be the attainment of extensive influence and sway over his fellowcreatures  whether he were to be a king and founder of an hereditary throne or the victorious leader of a people contending for their freedom or the apostle of a purified and regenerated faith was left for futurity to show  as messengers of the sign by which ralph cranfield might recognize the summons three venerable men were to claim audience of him  the chief among them a dignified and majestic person arrayed it may be supposed in the flowing garments of an ancient sage would be the bearer of a wand or prophets rod with this wand or rod or staff the venerable sage would trace a certain figure in the air and then proceed to make known his heaveninstructed message which if obeyed must lead to glorious results  with this proud fate before him in the flush of his imaginative youth ralph cranfield had set forth to seek the maid the treasure and the venerable sage with his gift of extended empire  and had he found them  alas it was not with the aspect of a triumphant man who had achieved a nobler destiny than all his fellows but rather with the gloom of one struggling against peculiar and continual adversity that he now passed homeward to his mothers cottage  he had come back but only for a time to lay aside the pilgrims staff trusting that his weary manhood would regain somewhat of the elasticity of youth in the spot where his threefold fate had been foreshown him there had been few changes in the village for it was not one of those thriving places where a years prosperity makes more than the havoc of a centurys decay but like a gray hair in a young mans head an antiquated little town full of old maids and aged elms and mossgrown dwellings  few seemed to be the changes here  the drooping elms indeed had a more majestic spread the weatherblackened houses were adorned with a denser thatch of verdant moss and doubtless there were a few more gravestones in the burialground inscribed with names that had once been familiar in the village street  yet summing up all the mischief that ten years had wrought it seemed scarcely more than if ralph cranfield had gone forth that very morning and dreamed a daydream till the twilight and then turned back again  but his heart grew cold because the village did not remember him as he remembered the village  here is the change sighed he striking his hand upon his breast who is this man of thought and care weary with worldwandering and heavy with disappointed hopes  the youth returns not who went forth so joyously  and now ralph cranfield was at his mothers gate in front of the small house where the old lady with slender but sufficient means had kept herself comfortable during her sons long absence  admitting himself within the enclosure he leaned against a great old tree trifling with his own impatience as people often do in those intervals when years are summed into a moment  he took a minute survey of the dwellingits windows brightened with the skygleans its doorway with the half of a millstone for a step and the faintly traced path waving thence to the gate  he made friends again with his childhoods friend the old tree against which he leaned and glancing his eye adown its trunk beheld something that excited a melancholy smile  it was a halfobliterated inscriptionthe latin word effodewhich he remembered to have carved in the bark of the tree with a whole days toil when he had first begun to muse about his exalted destiny  it might be accounted a rather singular coincidence that the bark just above the inscription had put forth an excrescence shaped not unlike a hand with the forefinger pointing obliquely at the word of fate  such at least was its appearance in the dusky light  now a credulous man said ralph cranfield carelessly to himself might suppose that the treasure which i have sought round the world lies buried after all at the very door of my mothers dwelling that would be a jest indeed  more he thought not about the matter for now the door was opened and an elderly woman appeared on the threshold peering into the dusk to discover who it might be that had intruded on her premises and was standing in the shadow of her tree  it was ralph cranfields mother pass we over their greeting and leave the one to her joy and the other to his restif quiet rest he found  but when morning broke he arose with a troubled brow for his sleep and his wakefulness had alike been full of dreams  all the fervor was rekindled with which he had burned of yore to unravel the threefold mystery of his fate  the crowd of his early visions seemed to have awaited him beneath his mothers roof and thronged riotously around to welcome his return  in the wellremembered chamberon the pillow where his infancy had slumberedhe had passed a wilder night than ever in an arab tent or when he had reposed his head in the ghastly shades of a haunted forest  a shadowy maid had stolen to his bedside and laid her finger on the scintillating heart a hand of flame had glowed amid the darkness pointing downward to a mystery within the earth a hoary sage had waved his prophetic wand and beckoned the dreamer onward to a chair of state  the same phantoms though fainter in the daylight still flitted about the cottage and mingled among the crowd of familiar faces that were drawn thither by the news of ralph cranfields return to bid him welcome for his mothers sake there they found him a tall dark stately man of foreign aspect courteous in demeanor and mild of speech yet with an abstracted eye which seemed often to snatch a glance at the invisible  meantime the widow cranfield went bustling about the house full of joy that she again had somebody to love and be careful of and for whom she might vex and tease herself with the petty troubles of daily life it was nearly noon when she looked forth from the door and descried three personages of note coming along the street through the hot sunshine and the masses of elmtree shade  at length they reached her gate and undid the latch  see ralph exclaimed she with maternal pride here is squire hawkwood and the two other selectmen coming on purpose to see you now do tell them a good long story about what you have seen in foreign parts  the foremost of the three visitors squire hawkwood was a very pompous but excellent old gentleman the head and prime mover in all the affairs of the village and universally acknowledged to be one of the sagest men on earth  he wore according to a fashion even then becoming antiquated a threecornered hat and carried a silverheaded cane the use of which seemed to be rather for flourishing in the air than for assisting the progress of his legs  his two companions were elderly and respectable yeomen who retaining an anterevolutionary reverence for rank and hereditary wealth kept a little in the squires rear  as they approached along the pathway ralph cranfield sat in an oaken elbowchair half unconsciously gazing at the three visitors and enveloping their homely figures in the misty romance that pervaded his mental world  here thought he smiling at the conceithere come three elderly personages and the first of the three is a venerable sage with a staff  what if this embassy should bring me the message of my fate  while squire hawkwood and his colleagues entered ralph rose from his seat and advanced a few steps to receive them and his stately figure and dark countenance as he bent courteously towards his guests had a natural dignity contrasting well with the bustling importance of the squire  the old gentleman according to invariable custom gave an elaborate preliminary flourish with his cane in the air then removed his threecornered hat in order to wipe his brow and finally proceeded to make known his errand  my colleagues and myself began the squire are burdened with momentous duties being jointly selectmen of this village  our minds for the space of three days past have been laboriously bent on the selection of a suitable person to fill a most important office and take upon himself a charge and rule which wisely considered may be ranked no lower than those of kings and potentates  and whereas you our native townsman are of good natural intellect and well cultivated by foreign travel and that certain vagaries and fantasies of your youth are doubtless long ago corrected taking all these matters i say into due consideration we are of opinion that providence lath sent you hither at this juncture for our very purpose  during this harangue cranfield gazed fixedly at the speaker as if he beheld something mysterious and unearthly in his pompous little figure and as if the squire had worn the flowing robes of an ancient sage instead of a squareskirted coat flapped waistcoat velvet breeches and silk stockings  nor was his wonder without sufficient cause for the flourish of the squires staff marvellous to relate had described precisely the signal in the air which was to ratify the message of the prophetic sage whom cranfield had sought around the world  and what inquired ralph cranfield with a tremor in his voicewhat may this office be which is to equal me with kings and potentates  no less than instructor of our village school answered squire hawkwood the office being now vacant by the loath of the venerable master whitaker after a fifty years incumbency  i will consider of your proposal replied ralph cranfield hurriedly and will make known my decision within three days  after a few more words the village dignitary and his companions took their leave  but to cranfields fancy their images were still present and became more and more invested with the dim awfulness of figures which had first appeared to him in a dream and afterwards had shown themselves in his waking moments assuming homely aspects among familiar things  his mind dwelt upon the features of the squire till they grew confused with those of the visionary sage and one appeared but the shadow of the other  the same visage he now thought had looked forth upon him from the pyramid of cheops the same form had beckoned to him among the colonnades of the alhambra the same figure had mistily revealed itself through the ascending steam of the great geyser  at every effort of his memory he recognized some trait of the dreamy messenger of destiny in this pompous bustling selfimportant little great man of the village  amid such musings ralph cranfield sat all day in the cottage scarcely hearing and vaguely answering his mothers thousand questions about his travels and adventures  at sunset he roused himself to take a stroll and passing the aged elmtree his eye was again caught by the semblance of a hand pointing downward at the halfobliterated inscription as cranfield walked down the street of the village the level sunbeams threw his shadow far before him and he fancied that as his shadow walked among distant objects so had there been a presentiment stalking in advance of him throughout his life  and when he drew near each object over which his tall shadow had preceded him still it proved to beone of the familiar recollections of his infancy and youth every crook in the pathway was remembered  even the more transitory characteristics of the scene were the same as in bygone days  a company of cows were grazing on the grassy roadside and refreshed him with their fragrant breath   it is sweeter thought he than the perfume which was wafted to our shipp from the spice islands  the round little figure of a child rolled from a doorway and lay laughing almost beneath cranfields feet  the dark and stately man stooped down and lifting the infant restored him to his mothers arms  the children said he to himself and sighed and smiledthe children are to be my charge  and while a flow of natural feeling gushed like a wellspring in his heart he came to a dwelling which he could nowise forbear to enter  a sweet voice which seemed to come from a deep and tender soul was warbling a plaintive little air within  he bent his head and passed through the lowly door  as his foot sounded upon the threshold a young woman advanced from the dusky interior of the house at first hastily and then with a more uncertain step till they met face to face  there was a singular contrast in their two figures he dark and picturesqueone who had battled with the worldwhom all suns had shone upon and whom all winds had blown on a varied course she neat comely and quietquiet even in her agitationas if all her emotions had been subdued to the peaceful tenor of her life  yet their faces all unlike as they were had an expression that seemed not so aliena glow of kindred feeling flashing upward anew from halfextinguished embers  you are welcome home said faith egerton  but cranfield did not immediately answer for his eye had been caught by an ornament in the shape of a heart which faith wore as a brooch upon her bosom  the material was the ordinary white quartz and he recollected having himself shaped it out of one of those indian arrowheads which are so often found in the ancient haunts of the red men  it was precisely on the pattern of that worn by the visionary maid  when cranfield departed on his shadowy search he had bestowed this brooch in a gold setting as a parting gift to faith egerton  so faith you have kept the heart said he at length  yes said she blushing deeply then more gayly and what else have you brought me from beyond the sea  faith replied ralph cranfield uttering the fated words by an uncontrollable impulse  i have brought you nothing but a heavy heart  may i rest its weight on you  this token which i have worn so long said faith laying her tremulous finger on the heart is the assurance that you may  faith faith cried cranfield clasping her in his arms you have interpreted my wild and weary dream  yes the wild dreamer was awake at last  to find the mysterious treasure he was to till the earth around his mothers dwelling and reap its products  instead of warlike command or regal or religious sway he was to rule over the village children  and now the visionary maid had faded from his fancy and in her place he saw the playmate of his childhood  would all who cherish such wild wishes but look around them they would oftenest find their sphere of duty of prosperity and happiness within those precincts and in that station where providence itself has cast their lot  happy they who read the riddle without a weary worldsearch or a lifetime spent in vain
