78819553	oscar wilde miscellaneous     contents  preface by robert ross a florentine tragedya fragment la sainte courtisanea fragment     preface by robert ross     as to my personal attitude towards criticism i confess in brief the following if my works are good and of any importance whatever for the further development of art they will maintain their place in spite of all adverse criticism and in spite of all hateful suspicions attached to my artistic intentions  if my works are of no account the most gratifying success of the moment and the most enthusiastic approval of as augurs cannot make them endure  the wastepaper press can devour them as it has devoured many others and i will not shed a tear    and the world will move on just the samerichard strauss  the contents of this volume require some explanation of an historical nature  it is scarcely realised by the present generation that wildes works on their first appearance with the exception of de profundis were met with almost general condemnation and ridicule  the plays on their first production were grudgingly praised because their obvious success could not be ignored but on their subsequent publication in book form they were violently assailed  that nearly all of them have held the stage is still a source of irritation among certain journalists  salome however enjoys a singular career  as every one knows it was prohibited by the censor when in rehearsal by madame bernhardt at the palace theatre in 1892  on its publication in 1893 it was greeted with greater abuse than any other of wildes works and was consigned to the usual irrevocable oblivion  the accuracy of the french was freely canvassed and of course it is obvious that the french is not that of a frenchman  the play was passed for press however by no less a writer than marcel schwob whose letter to the paris publisher returning the proofs and mentioning two or three slight alterations is still in my possession  marcel schwob told me some years afterwards that he thought it would have spoiled the spontaneity and character of wildes style if he had tried to harmonise it with the diction demanded by the french academy  it was never composed with any idea of presentation  madame bernhardt happened to say she wished wilde would write a play for her he replied in jest that he had done so  she insisted on seeing the manuscript and decided on its immediate production ignorant or forgetful of the english law which prohibits the introduction of scriptural characters on the stage  with his keen sense of the theatre wilde would never have contrived the long speech of salome at the end in a drama intended for the stage even in the days of long speeches  his threat to change his nationality shortly after the censors interference called forth a most delightful and good natured caricature of him by mr bernard partridge in punch  wilde was still in prison in 1896 when salome was produced by lugne poe at the theatre de loeuvre in paris but except for an account in the daily telegraph the incident was hardly mentioned in england i gather that the performance was only a qualified success though lugne poes triumph as herod was generally acknowledged  in 1901 within a year of the authors death it was produced in berlin from that moment it has held the european stage  it has run for a longer consecutive period in germany than any play by any englishman not excepting shakespeare  its popularity has extended to all countries where it is not prohibited  it is performed throughout europe asia and america  it is played even in yiddish  this is remarkable in view of the many dramas by french and german writers who treat of the same theme  to none of them however is wilde indebted flaubert maeterlinck some would add ollendorff and scripture are the obvious sources on which he has freely drawn for what i do not hesitate to call the most powerful and perfect of all his dramas but on such a point a trustee and executor may be prejudiced because it is the most valuable asset in wildes literary estate  aubrey beardsleys illustrations are too well known to need more than a passing reference  in the world of art criticism they excited almost as much attention as wildes drama has excited in the world of intellect  during may 1905 the play was produced in england for the first time at a private performance by the new stage club  no one present will have forgotten the extraordinary tension of the audience on that occasion those who disliked the play and its author being hypnotised by the extraordinary power of mr robert farquharsons herod one of the finest pieces of acting ever seen in this country my friends the dramatic critics and many of them are personal friends fell on salome with all the vigour of their predecessors twelve years before  unaware of what was taking place in germany they spoke of the play as having been dragged from obscurity  the official receiver in bankruptcy and myself were however better informed  and much pleasure has been derived from reading those criticisms all carefully preserved along with the list of receipts which were simultaneously pouring in from the german performances to do the critics justice they never withdrew any of their printed opinions which were all trotted out again when the play was produced privately for the second time in england by the literary theatre society in 1906  in the speaker of july 14th 1906 however some of the iterated misrepresentations of fact were corrected  no attempt was made to controvert the opinion of an ignorant critic  his veracity only was impugned  the powers of vaticination possessed by such judges of drama can be fairly tested in the career of salome on the european stage apart from the opera in an introduction to the english translation published by mr john lane it is pointed out that wildes confusion of herod antipas matt xiv 1 with herod the great matt ii 1 and herod agrippa i acts xii 23 is intentional and follows a mediaeval convention  there is no attempt at historical accuracy or archaeological exactness  those who saw the marvellous decor of mr charles ricketts at the second english production can form a complete idea of what wilde intended in that respect although the stage management was clumsy and amateurish  the great opera of richard strauss does not fall within my province but the fag ends of its popularity on the continent have been imported here oddly enough through the agency of the palace theatre where salome was originally to have been performed  of a young ladys dancing or of that of her rivals i am not qualified to speak  i note merely that the critics who objected to the horror of one incident in the drama lost all selfcontrol on seeing that incident repeated in dumb show and accompanied by fescennine corybantics  except in name and borrowed notoriety the musichall sensation has no relation whatever to the drama which so profoundly moved the whole of europe and the greatest living musician  the adjectives of contumely are easily transmuted into epithets of adulation when a prominent ecclesiastic succumbs like king herod to the fascination of a dancer  it is not usually known in england that a young french naval officer unaware that dr strauss was composing an opera on the theme of salome wrote another music drama to accompany wildes text  the exclusive musical rights having been already secured by dr strauss lieutenant marriottes work cannot be performed regularly  one presentation however was permitted at lyons the composers native town where i am told it made an extraordinary impression  in order to give english readers some faint idea of the worldwide effect of wildes drama my friend mr walter ledger has prepared a short bibliography of certain english and continental translations   at the time of wildes trial the nearly completed ms of la sainte courtisane was entrusted to mrs leverson the wellknown novelist who in 1897 went to paris on purpose to restore it to the author wilde immediately left the only copy in a cab  a few days later he laughingly informed me of the loss and added that a cab was a very proper place for it  i have explained elsewhere that he looked on his works with disdain in his last years though he was always full of schemes for writing others  all my attempts to recover the lost work failed  the passages here reprinted are from some odd leaves of a first draft  the play is of course not unlike salome though it was written in english  it expanded wildes favourite theory that when you convert some one to an idea you lose your faith in it the same motive runs through mr w h  honorius the hermit so far as i recollect the story falls in love with the courtesan who has come to tempt him and he reveals to her the secret of the love of god  she immediately becomes a christian and is murdered by robbers  honorius the hermit goes back to alexandria to pursue a life of pleasure  two other similar plays wilde invented in prison ahab and isabel and pharaoh he would never write them down though often importuned to do so  pharaoh was intensely dramatic and perhaps more original than any of the group  none of these works must be confused with the manuscripts stolen from 16 tite street in 1895namely the enlarged version of mr w h the second draft of a florentine tragedy and the duchess of padua which existing in a prompt copy was of less importance than the others nor with the cardinal of arragon the manuscript of which i never saw  i scarcely think it ever existed though wilde used to recite proposed passages for it   some years after wildes death i was looking over the papers and letters rescued from tite street when i came across loose sheets of manuscript and typewriting which i imagined were fragments of the duchess of padua on putting them together in a coherent form i recognised that they belonged to the lost florentine tragedy  i assumed that the opening scene though once extant had disappeared one day however mr willard wrote that he possessed a typewritten fragment of a play which wilde had submitted to him and this he kindly forwarded for my inspection  it agreed in nearly every particular with what i had taken so much trouble to put together this suggests that the opening scene had never been written as mr willards version began where mine did  it was characteristic of the author to finish what he never began  when the literary theatre society produced salome in 1906 they asked me for some other short drama by wilde to present at the same time as salome does not take very long to play  i offered them the fragment of a florentine tragedy  by a fortunate coincidence the poet and dramatist mr thomas sturge moore happened to be on the committee of this society and to him was entrusted the task of writing an opening scene to make the play complete 1 it is not for me to criticise his work but there is justification for saying that wilde himself would have envied with an artists envy such lines as    we will sup with the moon like persian princes that in babylon sup in the hanging gardens of the king   in a stylistic sense mr sturge moore has accomplished a feat in reconstruction whatever opinions may be held of a florentine tragedy by wildes admirers or detractors  the achievement is particularly remarkable because mr sturge moore has nothing in common with wilde other than what is shared by all real poets and dramatists  he is a landed proprietor on parnassus not a trespasser  in england we are more familiar with the poachers time and death are of course necessary before there can come any adequate recognition of one of our most original and gifted singers among his works are the vinedresser and other poems 1899 absalom a chronicle play 1903 and the centaurs booty 1903  mr sturge moore is also an art critic of distinction and his learned works on durer 1905 and correggio 1906 are more widely known i am sorry to say than his powerful and enthralling poems  once again i must express my obligations to mr stuart mason for revising and correcting the proofs of this new edition  robert ross     a florentine tragedya fragment     characters  guido bardi a florentine prince simone a merchant bianna his wife  the action takes place at florence in the early sixteenth century  the door opens they separate guiltily and the husband enters  simone  my good wife you come slowly were it not better to run to meet your lord  here take my cloak take this pack first  tis heavy  i have sold nothing save a furred robe unto the cardinals son who hopes to wear it when his father dies and hopes that will be soon  but who is this why you have here some friend  some kinsman doubtless newly returned from foreign lands and fallen upon a house without a host to greet him i crave your pardon kinsman  for a house lacking a host is but an empty thing and void of honour a cup without its wine a scabbard without steel to keep it straight a flowerless garden widowed of the sun again i crave your pardon my sweet cousin  bianca  this is no kinsman and no cousin neither  simone  no kinsman and no cousin  you amaze me who is it then who with such courtly grace deigns to accept our hospitalities  guido  my name is guido bardi  simone  what  the son of that great lord of florence whose dim towers like shadows silvered by the wandering moon i see from out my casement every night sir guido bardi you are welcome here twice welcome  for i trust my honest wife most honest if uncomely to the eye hath not with foolish chatterings wearied you as is the wont of women  guido  your gracious lady whose beauty is a lamp that pales the stars and robs dianas quiver of her beams has welcomed me with such sweet courtesies that if it be her pleasure and your own i will come often to your simple house and when your business bids you walk abroad i will sit here and charm her loneliness lest she might sorrow for you overmuch what say you good simone  simone  my noble lord you bring me such high honour that my tongue like a slaves tongue is tied and cannot say the word it would  yet not to give you thanks were to be too unmannerly  so i thank you from my hearts core  it is such things as these that knit a state together when a prince so nobly born and of such fair address forgetting unjust fortunes differences comes to an honest burghers honest home as a most honest friend  and yet my lord i fear i am too bold  some other night we trust that you will come here as a friend tonight you come to buy my merchandise is it not so  silks velvets what you will i doubt not but i have some dainty wares will woo your fancy  true the hour is late but we poor merchants toil both night and day to make our scanty gains  the tolls are high and every city levies its own toll and prentices are unskilful and wives even lack sense and cunning though bianca here has brought me a rich customer tonight is it not so bianca  but i waste time where is my pack  where is my pack i say open it my good wife  unloose the cords kneel down upon the floor  you are better so nay not that one the other  despatch despatch buyers will grow impatient oftentimes we dare not keep them waiting  ay tis that give it to me with care  it is most costly touch it with care  and now my noble lord  nay pardon i have here a lucca damask the very web of silver and the roses so cunningly wrought that they lack perfume merely to cheat the wanton sense  touch it my lord is it not soft as water strong as steel and then the roses  are they not finely woven i think the hillsides that best love the rose at bellosguardo or at fiesole throw no such blossoms on the lap of spring or if they do their blossoms droop and die such is the fate of all the dainty things that dance in wind and water  nature herself makes war on her own loveliness and slays her children like medea  nay but my lord look closer still  why in this damask here it is summer always and no winters tooth will ever blight these blossoms  for every ell i paid a piece of gold  red gold and good the fruit of careful thrift  guido  honest simone enough i pray you  i am well content tomorrow i will send my servant to you who will pay twice your price  simone  my generous prince i kiss your hands  and now i do remember another treasure hidden in my house which you must see  it is a robe of state woven by a venetian  the stuff cutvelvet the pattern pomegranates  each separate seed wrought of a pearl  the collar all of pearls as thick as moths in summer streets at night and whiter than the moons that madmen see through prison bars at morning  a male ruby burns like a lighted coal within the clasp the holy father has not such a stone nor could the indies show a brother to it the brooch itself is of most curious art cellini never made a fairer thing to please the great lorenzo  you must wear it there is none worthier in our city here and it will suit you well  upon one side a slim and horned satyr leaps in gold to catch some nymph of silver  upon the other stands silence with a crystal in her hand no bigger than the smallest ear of corn that wavers at the passing of a bird and yet so cunningly wrought that one would say it breathed or held its breath  worthy bianca would not this noble and most costly robe suit young lord guido well  nay but entreat him he will refuse you nothing though the price be as a princes ransom  and your profit shall not be less than mine  bianca  am i your prentice why should i chaffer for your velvet robe  guido  nay fair bianca i will buy the robe and all things that the honest merchant has i will buy also  princes must be ransomed and fortunate are all high lords who fall into the white hands of so fair a foe  simone  i stand rebuked  but you will buy my wares will you not buy them  fifty thousand crowns would scarce repay me  but you my lord shall have them for forty thousand  is that price too high name your own price  i have a curious fancy to see you in this wonder of the loom amidst the noble ladies of the court a flower among flowers  they say my lord these highborn dames do so affect your grace that where you go they throng like flies around you each seeking for your favour  i have heard also of husbands that wear horns and wear them bravely a fashion most fantastical  guido  simone your reckless tongue needs curbing and besides you do forget this gracious lady here whose delicate ears are surely not attuned to such coarse music  simone  true  i had forgotten nor will offend again  yet my sweet lord youll buy the robe of state  will you not buy it but forty thousand crownstis but a trifle to one who is giovanni bardis heir  guido  settle this thing tomorrow with my steward antonio costa  he will come to you and you shall have a hundred thousand crowns if that will serve your purpose  simone  a hundred thousand said you a hundred thousand  oh be sure that will for all time and in everything make me your debtor  ay from this time forth my house with everything my house contains is yours and only yours  a hundred thousand my brain is dazed  i shall be richer far than all the other merchants  i will buy vineyards and lands and gardens  every loom from milan down to sicily shall be mine and mine the pearls that the arabian seas store in their silent caverns  generous prince this night shall prove the herald of my love which is so great that whatsoeer you ask it will not be denied you  guido  what if i asked for white bianca here  simone  you jest my lord she is not worthy of so great a prince she is but made to keep the house and spin is it not so good wife  it is so  look your distaff waits for you  sit down and spin women should not be idle in their homes for idle fingers make a thoughtless heart sit down i say  bianca  what shall i spin  simone  oh spin some robe which dyed in purple sorrow might wear for her own comforting  or some longfringed cloth in which a newborn and unwelcome babe might wail unheeded or a dainty sheet which delicately perfumed with sweet herbs might serve to wrap a dead man  spin what you will i care not i  bianca  the brittle thread is broken the dull wheel wearies of its ceaseless round the duller distaff sickens of its load i will not spin tonight  simone  it matters not tomorrow you shall spin and every day shall find you at your distaff  so lucretia was found by tarquin  so perchance lucretia waited for tarquin  who knows  i have heard strange things about mens wives  and now my lord what news abroad  i heard today at pisa that certain of the english merchants there would sell their woollens at a lower rate than the just laws allow and have entreated the signory to hear them  is this well should merchant be to merchant as a wolf and should the stranger living in our land seek by enforced privilege or craft to rob us of our profits  guido  what should i do with merchants or their profits  shall i go and wrangle with the signory on your count and wear the gown in which you buy from fools or sell to sillier bidders  honest simone woolselling or woolgathering is for you my wits have other quarries  bianca  noble lord i pray you pardon my good husband here his soul stands ever in the marketplace and his heart beats but at the price of wool yet he is honest in his common way to simone and you have you no shame  a gracious prince comes to our house and you must weary him with most misplaced assurance  ask his pardon  simone  i ask it humbly  we will talk tonight of other things  i hear the holy father has sent a letter to the king of france bidding him cross that shield of snow the alps and make a peace in italy which will be worse than a war of brothers and more bloody than civil rapine or intestine feuds  guido  oh we are weary of that king of france who never comes but ever talks of coming what are these things to me  there are other things closer and of more import good simone  bianca to simone  i think you tire our most gracious guest what is the king of france to us  as much as are your english merchants with their wool        simone  is it so then  is all this mighty world narrowed into the confines of this room with but three souls for poor inhabitants ay there are times when the great universe like cloth in some unskilful dyers vat shrivels into a handbreadth and perchance that time is now  well let that time be now let this mean room be as that mighty stage whereon kings die and our ignoble lives become the stakes god plays for  i do not know why i speak thus  my ride has wearied me and my horse stumbled thrice which is an omen that bodes not good to any  alas my lord how poor a bargain is this life of man and in how mean a market are we sold when we are born our mothers weep but when we die there is none weeps for us  no not one passes to back of stage  bianca  how like a common chapman does he speak i hate him soul and body  cowardice has set her pale seal on his brow  his hands whiter than poplar leaves in windy springs shake with some palsy and his stammering mouth blurts out a foolish froth of empty words like water from a conduit  guido  sweet bianca he is not worthy of your thought or mine the man is but a very honest knave full of fine phrases for lifes merchandise selling most dear what he must hold most cheap a windy brawler in a world of words i never met so eloquent a fool  bianca  oh would that death might take him where he stands  simone turning round  who spake of death  let no one speak of death what should death do in such a merry house with but a wife a husband and a friend to give it greeting  let death go to houses where there are vile adulterous things chaste wives who growing weary of their noble lords draw back the curtains of their marriage beds and in polluted and dishonoured sheets feed some unlawful lust  ay tis so strange and yet so  you do not know the world you are too single and too honourable i know it well  and would it were not so but wisdom comes with winters  my hair grows grey and youth has left my body  enough of that tonight is ripe for pleasure and indeed i would be merry as beseems a host who finds a gracious and unlookedfor guest waiting to greet him  takes up a lute but what is this my lord why you have brought a lute to play to us oh play sweet prince  and if i am too bold pardon but play  guido  i will not play tonight some other night simone  to bianca  you and i together with no listeners but the stars or the more jealous moon  simone  nay but my lord nay but i do beseech you  for i have heard that by the simple fingering of a string or delicate breath breathed along hollowed reeds or blown into cold mouths of cunning bronze those who are curious in this art can draw poor souls from prisonhouses  i have heard also how such strange magic lurks within these shells that at their bidding casements open wide and innocence puts vineleaves in her hair and wantons like a maenad  let that pass your lute i know is chaste  and therefore play ravish my ears with some sweet melody my soul is in a prisonhouse and needs music to cure its madness  good bianca entreat our guest to play  bianca  be not afraid our wellloved guest will choose his place and moment that moment is not now  you weary him with your uncouth insistence  guido  honest simone some other night  tonight i am content with the low music of biancas voice who when she speaks charms the too amorous air and makes the reeling earth stand still or fix his cycle round her beauty  simone  you flatter her she has her virtues as most women have but beauty in a gem she may not wear it is better so perchance  well my dear lord if you will not draw melodies from your lute to charm my moody and oertroubled soul youll drink with me at least  motioning guido to his own place  your place is laid fetch me a stool bianca  close the shutters set the great bar across  i would not have the curious world with its small prying eyes to peer upon our pleasure  now my lord give us a toast from a full brimming cup starts back what is this stain upon the cloth  it looks as purple as a wound upon christs side wine merely is it  i have heard it said when wine is spilt blood is spilt also but thats a foolish tale  my lord i trust my grape is to your liking  the wine of naples is fiery like its mountains  our tuscan vineyards yield a more wholesome juice  guido  i like it well honest simone and with your good leave will toast the fair bianca when her lips have like red roseleaves floated on this cup and left its vintage sweeter  taste bianca  bianca drinks  oh all the honey of hyblean bees matched with this draught were bitter good simone you do not share the feast  simone  it is strange my lord i cannot eat or drink with you tonight some humour or some fever in my blood at other seasons temperate or some thought that like an adder creeps from point to point that like a madman crawls from cell to cell poisons my palate and makes appetite a loathing not a longing goes aside  guido  sweet bianca this common chapman wearies me with words i must go hence  tomorrow i will come tell me the hour  bianca  come with the youngest dawn until i see you all my life is vain  guido  ah loose the falling midnight of your hair and in those stars your eyes let me behold mine image as in mirrors  dear bianca though it be but a shadow keep me there nor gaze at anything that does not show some symbol of my semblance  i am jealous of what your vision feasts on  bianca  oh be sure your image will be with me always  dear love can translate the very meanest thing into a sign of sweet remembrances but come before the lark with its shrill song has waked a world of dreamers  i will stand upon the balcony  guido  and by a ladder wrought out of scarlet silk and sewn with pearls will come to meet me  white foot after foot like snow upon a rosetree  bianca  as you will you know that i am yours for love or death  guido  simone i must go to mine own house  simone  so soon  why should you  the great duomos bell has not yet tolled its midnight and the watchmen who with their hollow horns mock the pale moon lie drowsy in their towers  stay awhile i fear we may not see you here again and that fear saddens my too simple heart  guido  be not afraid simone  i will stand most constant in my friendship but tonight i go to mine own home and that at once tomorrow sweet bianca  simone  well well so be it i would have wished for fuller converse with you my new friend my honourable guest but that it seems may not be  and besides i do not doubt your father waits for you wearying for voice or footstep  you i think are his one child  he has no other child you are the gracious pillar of his house the flower of a garden full of weeds your fathers nephews do not love him well so run folks tongues in florence  i meant but that men say they envy your inheritance and look upon your vineyards with fierce eyes as ahab looked on naboths goodly field but that is but the chatter of a town where women talk too much  goodnight my lord fetch a pine torch bianca  the old staircase is full of pitfalls and the churlish moon grows like a miser niggard of her beams and hides her face behind a muslin mask as harlots do when they go forth to snare some wretched soul in sin  now i will get your cloak and sword  nay pardon my good lord it is but meet that i should wait on you who have so honoured my poor burghers house drunk of my wine and broken bread and made yourself a sweet familiar  oftentimes my wife and i will talk of this fair night and its great issues  why what a sword is this ferraras temper pliant as a snake and deadlier i doubt not  with such steel one need fear nothing in the moil of life i never touched so delicate a blade i have a sword too somewhat rusted now we men of peace are taught humility and to bear many burdens on our backs and not to murmur at an unjust world and to endure unjust indignities we are taught that and like the patient jew find profit in our pain  yet i remember how once upon the road to padua a robber sought to take my packhorse from me i slit his throat and left him  i can bear dishonour public insult many shames shrill scorn and open contumely but he who filches from me something that is mine ay though it be the meanest trencherplate from which i feed mine appetiteoh he perils his soul and body in the theft and dies for his small sin  from what strange clay we men are moulded  guido  why do you speak like this  simone  i wonder my lord guido if my sword is better tempered than this steel of yours shall we make trial  or is my state too low for you to cross your rapier against mine in jest or earnest  guido  naught would please me better than to stand fronting you with naked blade in jest or earnest  give me mine own sword fetch yours  tonight will settle the great issue whether the princes or the merchants steel is better tempered  was not that your word fetch your own sword  why do you tarry sir  simone  my lord of all the gracious courtesies that you have showered on my barren house this is the highest  bianca fetch my sword thrust back that stool and table  we must have an open circle for our match at arms and good bianca here shall hold the torch lest what is but a jest grow serious  bianca to guido  oh kill him kill him  simone  hold the torch bianca they begin to fight  simone  have at you  ah  ha would you  he is wounded by guido  a scratch no more  the torch was in mine eyes do not look sad bianca  it is nothing your husband bleeds tis nothing  take a cloth bind it about mine arm  nay not so tight more softly my good wife  and be not sad i pray you be not sad  no take it off what matter if i bleed  tears bandage off  again again simone disarms guido my gentle lord you see that i was right my sword is better tempered finer steel but let us match our daggers  bianca to guido kill him kill him  simone  put out the torch bianca  bianca puts out torch  now my good lord now to the death of one or both of us or all three it may be  they fight  there and there ah devil do i hold thee in my grip simone overpowers guido and throws him down over table  guido  fool take your strangling fingers from my throat i am my fathers only son the state has but one heir and that false enemy france waits for the ending of my fathers line to fall upon our city  simone  hush your father when he is childless will be happier as for the state i think our state of florence needs no adulterous pilot at its helm your life would soil its lilies  guido  take off your hands take off your damned hands  loose me i say  simone  nay you are caught in such a cunning vice that nothing will avail you and your life narrowed into a single point of shame ends with that shame and ends most shamefully  guido  oh let me have a priest before i die  simone  what wouldst thou have a priest for  tell thy sins to god whom thou shalt see this very night and then no more for ever  tell thy sins to him who is most just being pitiless most pitiful being just  as for myself    guido  oh help me sweet bianca help me bianca thou knowest i am innocent of harm  simone  what is there life yet in those lying lips die like a dog with lolling tongue  die  die and the dumb river shall receive your corse and wash it all unheeded to the sea  guido  lord christ receive my wretched soul tonight  simone  amen to that  now for the other  he dies  simone rises and looks at bianca  she comes towards him as one dazed with wonder and with outstretched arms  bianca  why did you not tell me you were so strong  simone  why did you not tell me you were beautiful  he kisses her on the mouth  curtain     la sainte courtisane or the woman covered with jewels     the scene represents the corner of a valley in the thebaid  on the right hand of the stage is a cavern  in front of the cavern stands a great crucifix  on the left sand dunes  the sky is blue like the inside of a cup of lapis lazuli  the hills are of red sand  here and there on the hills there are clumps of thorns  first man  who is she  she makes me afraid  she has a purple cloak and her hair is like threads of gold  i think she must be the daughter of the emperor  i have heard the boatmen say that the emperor has a daughter who wears a cloak of purple  second man  she has birds wings upon her sandals and her tunic is of the colour of green corn  it is like corn in spring when she stands still  it is like young corn troubled by the shadows of hawks when she moves  the pearls on her tunic are like many moons  first man  they are like the moons one sees in the water when the wind blows from the hills  second man  i think she is one of the gods  i think she comes from nubia  first man  i am sure she is the daughter of the emperor  her nails are stained with henna  they are like the petals of a rose  she has come here to weep for adonis  second man  she is one of the gods  i do not know why she has left her temple  the gods should not leave their temples  if she speaks to us let us not answer and she will pass by  first man  she will not speak to us  she is the daughter of the emperor  myrrhina  dwells he not here the beautiful young hermit he who will not look on the face of woman  first man  of a truth it is here the hermit dwells  myrrhina  why will he not look on the face of woman  second man  we do not know  myrrhina  why do ye yourselves not look at me  first man  you are covered with bright stones and you dazzle our eyes  second man  he who looks at the sun becomes blind  you are too bright to look at  it is not wise to look at things that are very bright  many of the priests in the temples are blind and have slaves to lead them  myrrhina  where does he dwell the beautiful young hermit who will not look on the face of woman  has he a house of reeds or a house of burnt clay or does he lie on the hillside  or does he make his bed in the rushes  first man  he dwells in that cavern yonder  myrrhina  what a curious place to dwell in  first man  of old a centaur lived there  when the hermit came the centaur gave a shrill cry wept and lamented and galloped away  second man  no  it was a white unicorn who lived in the cave when it saw the hermit coming the unicorn knelt down and worshipped him  many people saw it worshipping him  first man  i have talked with people who saw it        second man  some say he was a hewer of wood and worked for hire but that may not be true        myrrhina  what gods then do ye worship  or do ye worship any gods there are those who have no gods to worship  the philosophers who wear long beards and brown cloaks have no gods to worship  they wrangle with each other in the porticoes  the   laugh at them  first man  we worship seven gods  we may not tell their names  it is a very dangerous thing to tell the names of the gods  no one should ever tell the name of his god  even the priests who praise the gods all day long and eat of their food with them do not call them by their right names  myrrhina  where are these gods ye worship  first man  we hide them in the folds of our tunics  we do not show them to any one  if we showed them to any one they might leave us  myrrhina  where did ye meet with them  first man  they were given to us by an embalmer of the dead who had found them in a tomb  we served him for seven years  myrrhina  the dead are terrible  i am afraid of death  first man  death is not a god  he is only the servant of the gods  myrrhina  he is the only god i am afraid of  ye have seen many of the gods  first man  we have seen many of them  one sees them chiefly at night time  they pass one by very swiftly  once we saw some of the gods at daybreak  they were walking across a plain  myrrhina  once as i was passing through the market place i heard a sophist from cilicia say that there is only one god  he said it before many people  first man  that cannot be true  we have ourselves seen many though we are but common men and of no account  when i saw them i hid myself in a bush  they did me no harm        myrrhina  tell me more about the beautiful young hermit  talk to me about the beautiful young hermit who will not look on the face of woman  what is the story of his days  what mode of life has he  first man  we do not understand you  myrrhina  what does he do the beautiful young hermit  does he sow or reap  does he plant a garden or catch fish in a net  does he weave linen on a loom  does he set his hand to the wooden plough and walk behind the oxen  second man  he being a very holy man does nothing  we are common men and of no account  we toll all day long in the sun  sometimes the ground is very hard  myrrhina  do the birds of the air feed him  do the jackals share their booty with him  first man  every evening we bring him food  we do not think that the birds of the air feed him  myrrhina  why do ye feed him  what profit have ye in so doing  second man  he is a very holy man  one of the gods whom he has offended has made him mad  we think he has offended the moon  myrrhina  go and tell him that one who has come from alexandria desires to speak with him  first man  we dare not tell him  this hour he is praying to his god  we pray thee to pardon us for not doing thy bidding  myrrhina  are ye afraid of him  first man  we are afraid of him  myrrhina  why are ye afraid of him  first man  we do not know  myrrhina  what is his name  first man  the voice that speaks to him at night time in the cavern calls to him by the name of honorius  it was also by the name of honorius that the three lepers who passed by once called to him  we think that his name is honorius  myrrhina  why did the three lepers call to him  first man  that he might heal them  myrrhina  did he heal them  second man  no  they had committed some sin  it was for that reason they were lepers  their hands and faces were like salt  one of them wore a mask of linen  he was a kings son  myrrhina  what is the voice that speaks to him at night time in his cave  first man  we do not know whose voice it is  we think it is the voice of his god  for we have seen no man enter his cavern nor any come forth from it        myrrhina  honorius  honorius from within  who calls honorius  myrrhina  come forth honorius        my chamber is ceiled with cedar and odorous with myrrh  the pillars of my bed are of cedar and the hangings are of purple  my bed is strewn with purple and the steps are of silver  the hangings are sewn with silver pomegranates and the steps that are of silver are strewn with saffron and with myrrh  my lovers hang garlands round the pillars of my house  at night time they come with the flute players and the players of the harp  they woo me with apples and on the pavement of my courtyard they write my name in wine  from the uttermost parts of the world my lovers come to me  the kings of the earth come to me and bring me presents  when the emperor of byzantium heard of me he left his porphyry chamber and set sail in his galleys  his slaves bare no torches that none might know of his coming  when the king of cyprus heard of me he sent me ambassadors  the two kings of libya who are brothers brought me gifts of amber  i took the minion of caesar from caesar and made him my playfellow he came to me at night in a litter  he was pale as a narcissus and his body was like honey  the son of the praefect slew himself in my honour and the tetrarch of cilicia scourged himself for my pleasure before my slaves  the king of hierapolis who is a priest and a robber set carpets for me to walk on  sometimes i sit in the circus and the gladiators fight beneath me once a thracian who was my lover was caught in the net  i gave the signal for him to die and the whole theatre applauded  sometimes i pass through the gymnasium and watch the young men wrestling or in the race  their bodies are bright with oil and their brows are wreathed with willow sprays and with myrtle  they stamp their feet on the sand when they wrestle and when they run the sand follows them like a little cloud  he at whom i smile leaves his companions and follows me to my home  at other times i go down to the harbour and watch the merchants unloading their vessels  those that come from tyre have cloaks of silk and earrings of emerald  those that come from massilia have cloaks of fine wool and earrings of brass when they see me coming they stand on the prows of their ships and call to me but i do not answer them  i go to the little taverns where the sailors lie all day long drinking black wine and playing with dice and i sit down with them  i made the prince my slave and his slave who was a tyrian i made my lord for the space of a moon  i put a figured ring on his finger and brought him to my house  i have wonderful things in my house  the dust of the desert lies on your hair and your feet are scratched with thorns and your body is scorched by the sun  come with me honorius and i will clothe you in a tunic of silk  i will smear your body with myrrh and pour spikenard on your hair  i will clothe you in hyacinth and put honey in your mouth  love   honorius  there is no love but the love of god  myrrhina  who is he whose love is greater than that of mortal men  honorius  it is he whom thou seest on the cross myrrhina  he is the son of god and was born of a virgin  three wise men who were kings brought him offerings and the shepherds who were lying on the hills were wakened by a great light  the sibyls knew of his coming  the groves and the oracles spake of him  david and the prophets announced him  there is no love like the love of god nor any love that can be compared to it  the body is vile myrrhina  god will raise thee up with a new body which will not know corruption and thou shalt dwell in the courts of the lord and see him whose hair is like fine wool and whose feet are of brass  myrrhina  the beauty    honorius  the beauty of the soul increases until it can see god therefore myrrhina repent of thy sins  the robber who was crucified beside him he brought into paradise  exit  myrrhina  how strangely he spake to me  and with what scorn did he regard me  i wonder why he spake to me so strangely        honorius  myrrhina the scales have fallen from my eyes and i see now clearly what i did not see before  take me to alexandria and let me taste of the seven sins  myrrhina  do not mock me honorius nor speak to me with such bitter words  for i have repented of my sins and i am seeking a cavern in this desert where i too may dwell so that my soul may become worthy to see god  honorius  the sun is setting myrrhina  come with me to alexandria  myrrhina  i will not go to alexandria  honorius  farewell myrrhina  myrrhina  honorius farewell  no no do not go        i have cursed my beauty for what it has done and cursed the wonder of my body for the evil that it has brought upon you  lord this man brought me to thy feet  he told me of thy coming upon earth and of the wonder of thy birth and the great wonder of thy death also  by him o lord thou wast revealed to me  honorius  you talk as a child myrrhina and without knowledge loosen your hands  why didst thou come to this valley in thy beauty  myrrhina  the god whom thou worshippest led me here that i might repent of my iniquities and know him as the lord  honorius  why didst thou tempt me with words  myrrhina  that thou shouldst see sin in its painted mask and look on death in its robe of shame    footnotes  1  thomas sturge moores opening is not included in this project gutenberg etext for copyright reasons
