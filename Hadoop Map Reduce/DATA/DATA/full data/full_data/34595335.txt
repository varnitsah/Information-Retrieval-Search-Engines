34595335	the school for scandal     the text of the school for scandal  the text of the school for scandal in this edition is taken by mr fraser raes generous permission from his sheridans plays now printed as he wrote them  in his prefatory notes xxxvii mr rae writes  the manuscript of it the school for scandal in sheridans own handwriting is preserved at frampton court and is now printed in this volume  this version differs in many respects from that which is generally known and i think it is even better than that which has hitherto been read and acted as i have endeavoured to reproduce the works of sheridan as he wrote them i may be told that he was a bad hand at punctuating and very bad at spelling    but sheridans shortcomings as a speller have been exaggerated  lest sheridans shortcomings either in spelling or in punctuation should obscure the text i have in this edition inserted in brackets some explanatory suggestions  it has seemed best also to adopt a uniform method for indicating stagedirections and abbreviations of the names of characters  there can be no gain to the reader in reproducing for example sheridans different indications for the part of lady sneerwelllady sneerwell lady sneer lady sn and lady s or his varying use of exit and ex or his inconsistencies in the use of italics in the stagedirections  since however sheridans biographers from moore to fraser rae have shown that no authorised or correct edition of the school for scandal was published in sheridans lifetime there seems unusual justification for reproducing the text of the play itself with absolute fidelity to the original manuscript  mr ridgway who repeatedly sought to obtain a copy corrected by the author according to moores account life of sheridan i p 260 was told by mr sheridan as an excuse for keeping it back that he had been nineteen years endeavouring to satisfy himself with the style of the school for scandal but had not yet succeeded  mr rae sheridan i p 332 recorded his discovery of the manuscript of two acts of the school for scandal prepared by sheridan for publication and hoped before his death to publish this partial revision  numberless unauthorized changes in the play have been made for histrionic purposes from the first undated dublin edition to that of mr augustin daly current texts may usually be traced directly or indirectly to the twovolume murray edition of sheridans plays in 1821 some of the changes from the original manuscript such as the blending of the parts of miss verjuice and snake are doubtless effective for reasons of dramatic economy but many of the cuts are to be regretted from the readers standpoint  the student of english drama will prefer sheridans own text to editorial emendations however clever or effective for dramatic ends        the school for scandal       a comedy       a portrait1       addressed to mrs crewe      with the comedy of the school for scandal       by r b sheridan esq  tell

maiden madness virulently bold attend ye skilled to coin the precious tale creating proof where innuendos fail whose practised memories cruelly exact omit no circumstance except the fact attend all ye who boastor old or young the living libel of a slanderous tongue so shall my theme as far contrasted be as saints by fiends or hymns by calumny come gentle amoret for neath that name in worthier verse

couldst thou the humblest sketch create of her or slightest charm couldst imitate could thy blest strain in kindred colours trace the faintest wonder of her form and face poets would study the immortal line and reynolds own his art subdued by thine that art which well might added lustre give to natures best and heavens superlative on granbys cheek might bid new glories rise or point a purer beam from devons eyes hard is the task to shape that beautys praise whose judgment scorns the homage flattery pays but praising amoret we cannot err no tongue oervalues heaven or flatters her yet she by fates perversenessshe alone would doubt our truth nor deem such praise her own adorning fashion unadornd by dress simple from taste and not from carelessness discreet in gesture in deportment mild not stiff with prudence nor uncouthly wild no state has amoret no studied mien she frowns no goddess and she moves no queen the softer charm that in her manner lies is framed to captivate yet not surprise it justly suits th expression of her face tis less than dignity and more than grace on her pure cheek the native hue is such that formd by heavn to be admired so much the hand divine with a less partial care might well have fixd a fainter crimson there and bade the gentle inmate of her breast inshrined modestysupply the rest but who the peril of her lips shall paint strip them of smilesstill still all words are faint but moving love himself appears to teach their action though denied to rule her speech and thou who seest her speak and dost not hear mourn not her distant accents scape thine ear viewing those lips thou still mayst make pretence to judge of what she says and swear tis sense clothd with such grace with such expression fraught they move in meaning and they pause in thought but dost thou farther watch with charmd surprise the mild irresolution of her eyes curious to mark how frequent they repose in brief eclipse and momentary close ah seest thou not an ambushd cupid there too timrous of his charge with jealous care veils and unveils those beams of heavnly light too full too fatal else for mortal sight nor yet such pleasing vengeance fond to meet in pardning dimples hope a safe retreat what though her peaceful breast should neer allow subduing frowns to arm her altered brow by love i swear and by his gentle wiles more fatal still the mercy of her smiles thus lovely thus adornd possessing all of bright or fair that can to woman fall the height of vanity might well be thought prerogative in her and natures fault yet gentle amoret in mind supreme as well as charms rejects the vainer theme and half mistrustful of her beautys store she barbs with wit those darts too keen before read in all knowledge that her sex should reach though greville or the muse should deign to teach fond to improve nor timrous to discern how far it is a womans grace to learn in millars dialect she would not prove apollos priestess but apollos love graced by those signs which truth delights to own the timid blush and mild submitted tone whateer she says though sense appear throughout displays the tender hue of female doubt deckd with that charm how lovely wit appears how graceful science when that robe she wears such too her talents and her bent of mind as speak a sprightly heart by thought refined a taste for mirth by contemplation schoold a turn for ridicule by candour ruled a scorn of folly which she tries to hide an awe of talent which she owns with pride   peace idle muse no more thy strain prolong but yield a theme thy warmest

inserted  verjuice  they were madamand as i copied them myself in a feigned hand there can be no suspicion whence they came  lady sneerwell  did you circulate the report of lady brittles intrigue with captain boastall  verjuice  madam by this time lady brittle is the talk of half the townand i doubt not in a week the men will toast her as a demirep  lady sneerwell  what have you done as to the insinuation as to a certain baronets lady and a certain cook  verjuice  that is in as fine a train as your ladyship could wish i told the story yesterday to my own maid with directions to communicate it directly to my hairdresser  he i am informed has a brother who courts a milliners prentice in pallmall whose mistress has a first cousin whose sister is feme femme de chambre to mrs clackitso that in the common course of things it must reach mrs clackits ears within fourandtwenty hours and then you know the business is as good as done  lady sneerwell  why truly mrs clackit has a very pretty talent a great deal of industryyetyesbeen tolerably successful in her wayto my knowledge she has been the cause of breaking off six matches of three sons being disinherited and four daughters being turned out of doors  of three several elopements as many close confinementsnine separate maintenances and two divorces nay i have more than once traced her causing a teteatete in the town and country magazinewhen the parties perhaps had never seen each others faces before in the course of their lives  verjuice  she certainly has talents  lady sneerwell  but her manner is gross  verjuice  tis very true  she generally designs well has a free tongue and a bold inventionbut her colouring is too dark and her outline often extravagantshe wants that delicacy of tintand mellowness of sneerwhich distinguish your ladyships scandal  lady sneerwell  ah you are partial verjuice  verjuice  not in the leasteverybody allows that lady sneerwell can do more with a word or a look than many can with the most laboured detail even when they happen to have a little truth on their side to support it  lady sneerwell  yes my dear verjuice  i am no hypocrite to deny the satisfaction i reap from the success of my efforts  wounded myself in the early part of my life by the envenomed tongue of slander i confess i have since known no pleasure equal to the reducing others to the level of my own injured reputation  verjuice  nothing can be more naturalbut my dear lady sneerwell there is one affair in which you have lately employed me wherein i confess i am at a loss to guess your motives  lady sneerwell  i conceive you mean with respect to my neighbour sir peter teazle and his familylappetand has my conduct in this matter really appeared to you so mysterious      exit maid  verjuice  entirely so  lady sneerwell  verjuice an old batchelor as sir peter was having taken a young wife from out of the countryas lady teazle isare certainly fair subjects for a little mischievous raillery but here are two young mento whom sir peter has acted as a kind of guardian since their fathers death the eldest possessing the most amiable character and universally well spoken of the youngest the most dissipated and extravagant young fellow in the kingdom without friends or caracterthe former one an avowed admirer of yours and apparently your favourite the latter attached to maria sir peters wardand confessedly beloved by her  now on the face of these circumstances it is utterly unaccountable to me why you a young widow with no great jointureshould not close with the passion of a man of such character and expectations as mr surfaceand more so why you should be so uncommonly earnest to destroy the mutual attachment subsisting between his brother charles and maria  lady sneerwell  then at once to unravel this misteryi must inform you that love has no share whatever in the intercourse between mr surface and me  verjuice  no  lady sneerwell  his real attachment is to maria or her fortune but finding in his brother a favoured rival he has been obliged to mask his pretensionsand profit by my assistance  verjuice  yet still i am more puzzled why you should interest yourself in his success  lady sneerwell  heavens how dull you are cannot you surmise the weakness which i hitherto thro shame have concealed even from youmust i confess that charlesthat libertine that extravagant that bankrupt in fortune and reputationthat he it is for whom i am thus anxious and malicious and to gain whom i would sacrificeeverything  verjuice  now indeedyour conduct appears consistent and i no longer wonder at your enmity to maria but how came you and surface so confidential  lady sneerwell  for our mutual interestbut i have found out him a long time since altho he has contrived to deceive everybody besidei know him to be artful selfish and malicious while with sir peter and indeed with all his acquaintance he passes for a youthful miracle of prudencegood sense and benevolence  verjuice  yes yesi know sir peter vows he has not his equal in england and above all he praises him as a man of sentiment  lady sneerwell  true and with the assistance of his sentiments and hypocrisy he has brought sir peter entirely in his interests with respect to maria and is now i believe attempting to flatter lady teazle into the same good opinion towards himwhile poor charles has no friend in the housethough i fear he has a powerful one in marias heart against whom we must direct our schemes  servant  mr surface  lady sneerwell  shew him up  he generally calls about this time i dont wonder at peoples giving him to me for a lover       enter surface  surface  my dear lady sneerwell how do you do todayyour most obedient  lady sneerwell  miss verjuice has just been arraigning me on our mutual attachment now but i have informed her of our real views and the purposes for which our geniuses at present cooperate you know how useful she has been to usand believe me the confidence is not illplaced  surface  madam it is impossible for me to suspect that a lady of miss verjuices sensibility and discernment  lady sneerwell  wellwellno compliments nowbut tell me when you saw your mistress or what is more material to me your brother  surface  i have not seen either since i saw youbut i can inform you that they are at present at variancesome of your stories have taken good effect on maria  lady sneerwell  ah my dear verjuice the merit of this belongs to you  but do your brothers distresses encrease  surface  every hour  i am told he had another execution in his house yesterdayin short his dissipation and extravagance exceed anything i have ever heard of  lady sneerwell  poor charles  surface  true madamnotwithstanding his vices one cant help feeling for himah poor charles  im sure i wish it was in my power to be of any essential service to himfor the man who does not share in the distresses of a brothereven though merited by his own misconductdeserves  lady sneerwell  o lud you are going to be moral and forget that you are among friends  surface  egad thats trueill keep that sentiment till i see sir peter  however it is certainly a charity to rescue maria from such a libertine whoif he is to be reclaimd can be so only by a person of your ladyships superior accomplishments and understanding  verjuice  twould be a hazardous experiment  surface  butmadamlet me caution you to place no more confidence in our friend snake the libelleri have lately detected him in frequent conference with old rowland rowley who was formerly my fathers steward and has never been a friend of mine  lady sneerwell  im not disappointed in snake i never suspected the fellow to have virtue enough to be faithful even to his own villany       enter maria  maria my dearhow do you dowhats the matter  maria  o here is that disagreeable lover of mine sir benjamin backbite has just calld at my guardians with his odious uncle crabtreeso i slipt out and ran hither to avoid them  lady sneerwell  is that all  verjuice  lady sneerwellill go and write the letter i mentiond to you  surface  if my brother charles had been of the party madam perhaps you would not have been so much alarmed  lady sneerwell  nay nowyou are severe for i dare swear the truth of the matter is maria heard you were herebut my dearwhat has sir benjamin done that you should avoid him so  maria  oh he has done nothingbut his conversation is a perpetual libel on all his acquaintance  surface  aye and the worst of it is there is no advantage in not knowing them for hell abuse a stranger just as soon as his best friendand crabtree is as bad  lady sneerwell  nay but we should make allowancesir benjamin is a wit and a poet  maria  for my parti own madamwit loses its respect with me when i see it in company with malicewhat do you think mr surface  surface  certainly madam to smile at the jest which plants a thorn on anothers breast is to become a principal in the mischief  lady sneerwell  pshawtheres no possibility of being witty without a little ill naturethe malice of a good thing is the barb that makes it stickwhats your opinion mr surface  surface  certainly madamthat conversation where the spirit of raillery is suppressed will ever appear tedious and insipid  maria  well ill not debate how far scandal may be allowable but in a man i am sure it is always contemtablewe have pride envy rivalship and a thousand motives to depreciate each other but the maleslanderer must have the cowardice of a woman before he can traduce one  lady sneerwell  i wish my cousin verjuice hadnt left usshe should embrace you  surface  ah shes an old maid and is privileged of course       enter servant  madam mrs candour is below and if your ladyships at leisure will leave her carriage  lady sneerwell  beg her to walk in  now maria however here is a character to your taste for tho mrs candour is a little talkative everybody allows her to be the bestnatured and best sort of woman  maria  yes with a very gross affectation of good nature and benevolenceshe does more mischief than the direct malice of old crabtree  surface  efaith tis very true lady sneerwellwhenever i hear the current running again the characters of my friends i never think them in such danger as when candour undertakes their defence  lady sneerwell  hush here she is       enter mrs candour  mrs candour  my dear lady sneerwell how have you been this century i have never seen you tho i have heard of you very often mr surfacethe world says scandalous things of youbut indeed it is no matter what the world says for i think one hears nothing else but scandal  surface  just so indeed maam  mrs candour  ah maria childwhat is the whole affair off between you and charles  his extravagance i presumethe town talks of nothing else  maria  i am very sorry maam the town has so little to do  mrs candour  true true child but theres no stopping peoples tongues  i own i was hurt to hear itas i indeed was to learn from the same quarter that your guardian sir peter and lady teazle have not agreed lately so well as could be wishd  maria  tis strangely impertinent for people to busy themselves so  mrs candour  very true child but whats to be done  people will talktheres no preventing itwhy it was but yesterday i was told that miss gadabout had eloped with sir filagree flirt  but lord there is no minding what one hears tho to be sure i had this from very good authority  maria  such reports are highly scandalous  mrs candour  so they are childshameful shameful but the world is so censorious no character escapes  lord now who would have suspected your friend miss prim of an indiscretion yet such is the illnature of people that they say her unkle stopped her last week just as she was stepping into a postchaise with her dancingmaster  maria  ill answer fort there are no grounds for the report  mrs candour  oh no foundation in the world i dare swear no more probably than for the story circulated last month of mrs festinos affair with colonel cassinotho to be sure that matter was never rightly cleard up  surface  the license of invention some people take is monstrous indeed  maria  tis so but in my opinion those who report such things are equally culpable  mrs candour  to be sure they are tale bearers are as bad as the tale makerstis an old observation and a very true onebut whats to be done as i said beforehow will you prevent people from talkingtoday mrs clackitt assured me mr and mrs honeymoon were at last become mere man and wifelike the rest of their acquaintanceshe likewise hinted that a certain widow in the next street had got rid of her dropsy and recovered her shape in a most surprising mannerat the same time miss tattle who was by affirmd that lord boffalo had discoverd his lady at a house of no extraordinary fameand that sir harry bouquet and tom saunter were to measure swords on a similar provocation  butlord do you think i would report these thingsno no  tale bearers as i said before are just as bad as the talemakers  surface  ah mrs candour if everybody had your forbearance and good nature  mrs candour  i confess mr surface i cannot bear to hear people traduced behind their backs and when ugly circumstances come out against our acquaintances i own i always love to think the bestby the bye i hope tis not true that your brother is absolutely ruind  surface  i am afraid his circumstances are very bad indeed maam  mrs candour  ah  i heard sobut you must tell him to keep up his spiritseverybody almost is in the same waylord spindle sir thomas splint captain quinze and mr nickitall up i hear within this week so if charles is undone hell find half his acquaintance ruind too and that you know is a consolation  surface  doubtless maama very great one       enter servant  servant  mr crabtree and sir benjamin backbite  lady sneerwell  soh maria you see your lover pursues you positively you shant escape       enter crabtree and sir benjamin backbite  crabtree  lady sneerwell i kiss your hand  mrs candour i dont believe you are acquainted with my nephew sir benjamin backbite egad maam he has a pretty witand is a pretty poet too isnt he lady sneerwell  sir benjamin  o fie uncle  crabtree  nay egad its truei back him at a rebus or a charade against the best rhymer in the kingdomhas your ladyship heard the epigram he wrote last week on lady frizzles feather catching firedo benjamin repeat itor the charade you made last night extempore at mrs drowzies conversazionecome now your first is the name of a fish your second a great naval commanderand  sir benjamin  dear unclenowprithee  crabtree  efaith maamtwould surprise you to hear how ready he is at all these things  lady sneerwell  i wonder sir benjamin you never publish anything  sir benjamin  to say truth maam tis very vulgar to print and as my little productions are mostly satires and lampoons i find they circulate more by giving copies in confidence to the friends of the partieshowever i have some loveelegies which when favoured with this ladys smile i mean to give to the public pointing to maria  crabtree  fore heaven maam theyll immortalize youyoull be handed down to posterity like petrarchs laura or wallers sacharissa  sir benjamin  yes madam i think you will like themwhen you shall see in a beautiful quarto page how a neat rivulet of text shall meander thro a meadow of marginfore gad they will be the most elegant things of their kind  crabtree  but ladies have you heard the news  mrs candour  what sir do you mean the report of  crabtree  no maam thats not itmiss nicely is going to be married to her own footman  mrs candour  impossible  crabtree  ask sir benjamin  sir benjamin  tis very true maameverything is fixed and the wedding livery bespoke  crabtree  yes and they say there were pressing reasons fort  mrs candour  it cannot beand i wonder any one should believe such a story of so prudent a lady as miss nicely  sir benjamin  o lud maam thats the very reason twas believed at once  she has always been so cautious and so reserved that everybody was sure there was some reason for it at bottom  lady sneerwell  yes a tale of scandal is as fatal to the reputation of a prudent lady of her stamp as a fever is generally to those of the strongest constitutions but there is a sort of puny sickly reputation that is always ailing yet will outlive the robuster characters of a hundred prudes  sir benjamin  true madam there are valetudinarians in reputation as well as constitutionwho being conscious of their weak part avoid the least breath of air and supply their want of stamina by care and circumspection  mrs candour  well but this may be all mistakeyou know sir benjamin very trifling circumstances often give rise to the most injurious tales  crabtree  that they do ill be sworn maamdid you ever hear how miss shepherd came to lose her lover and her character last summer at tunbridgesir benjamin you remember it  sir benjamin  o to be sure the most whimsical circumstance  lady sneerwell  how was it pray  crabtree  why one evening at mrs pontos assemblythe conversation happened to turn on the difficulty of breeding novascotia sheep in this countrysays a young lady in company i have known instances of itfor miss letitia shepherd a first cousin of mine had a novascotia sheep that produced her twinswhat cries the old dowager lady dundizzy who you know is as deaf as a post has miss letitia shepherd had twinsthis mistakeas you may imagine threw the whole company into a fit of laughinghowever twas the next morning everywhere reported and in a few days believed by the whole town that miss letitia shepherd had actually been brought to bed of a fine boy and girland in less than a week there were people who could name the father and the farm house where the babies were put out to nurse  lady sneerwell  strange indeed  crabtree  matter of fact i assure youo lud mr surface pray is it true that your uncle sir oliver is coming home  surface  not that i know of indeed sir  crabtree  he has been in the east indies a long timeyou can scarcely remember himi believesad comfort on his arrival to hear how your brother has gone on  surface  charles has been imprudent sir to be sure but i hope no busy people have already prejudiced sir oliver against him he may reform  sir benjamin  to be sure he mayfor my part i never believed him to be so utterly void of principle as people sayand tho he has lost all his friends i am told nobody is better spoken of by the jews  crabtree  thats true egad nephewif the old jewry was a ward i believe charles would be an aldermanno man more popular there fore gad i hear he pays as many annuities as the irish tontine and that whenever hes sick they have prayers for the recovery of his health in the synagogue  sir benjamin  yet no man lives in greater splendourthey tell me when he entertains his friendshe can sit down to dinner with a dozen of his own securities have a score tradesmen waiting in the antichamber and an officer behind every guests chair  surface  this may be entertainment to you gentlemen but you pay very little regard to the feelings of a brother

nay sir peter they are people of rank and fortune and remarkably tenacious of reputation  sir peter  yes egad they are tenacious of reputation with a vengeance for they dont chuse anybody should have

the utmostand i dont think she looks more  sir benjamin  ah theres no judging by her looks unless one was to see her face  lady sneerwell  wellwellif she does take some pains to repair the ravages of timeyou must allow she effects it with great ingenuityand surely thats better than the careless manner in which the widow ocre chaulks her wrinkles  sir benjamin  nay nowyou are severe upon the widowcomecome it isnt that she paints so illbut when she has finished her face she joins it on so badly to her neck that she looks like a mended statue in which the connoisseur sees at once that the heads modern tho the trunks antique  crabtree  ha ha ha well said nephew  mrs candour  ha ha ha  well you make me laugh but i vow i hate you for itwhat do you think of miss simper  sir benjamin  why she has very pretty teeth  lady teazle  yes and on that account when she is neither speaking nor laughing which very seldom happensshe never absolutely shuts her mouth but leaves it always on ajar as it were  mrs candour  how can you be so illnatured  lady teazle  nay i allow even thats better than the pains mrs prim takes to conceal her losses in frontshe draws her mouth till it resembles the aperture of a poorsbox and all her words appear to slide out edgewise  lady sneerwell  very well lady teazle i see you can be a little severe  lady teazle  in defence of a friend it is but justice but here comes sir peter to spoil our pleasantry       enter sir peter  sir peter  ladies your obedientmercy on mehere is the whole set a characters dead at every word i suppose  mrs candour  i am rejoiced you are come sir peterthey have been so censorious and lady teazle as bad as any one  sir peter  that must be very distressing to you mrs candour i dare swear  mrs candour  o they will allow good qualities to nobodynot even good nature to our friend mrs pursy  lady teazle  what the fat dowager who was at mrs codrilles quadrilles last night  lady sneerwell  nayher bulk is her misfortune and when she takes such pains to get rid of it you ought not to reflect on her  mrs candour  tis very true indeed  lady teazle  yes i know she almost lives on acids and small whey laces herself by pulleys and often in the hottest noon of summer you may see her on a little squat pony with her hair plaited up behind like a drummers and puffing round the ring on a full trot  mrs candour  i thank you lady teazle for defending her  sir peter  yes a good defence truly  mrs candour  but for sir benjamin he is as censorious as miss sallow  crabtree  yes and she is a curious being to pretend to be censoriousan awkward gawky without any one good point under heaven  lady sneerwell  positively you shall not be so very severe miss sallow is a relation of mine by marriage and as for her person great allowance is to be madefor let me tell you a woman labours under many disadvantages who tries to pass for a girl at sixandthirty  mrs candour  tho surely she is handsome stilland for the weakness in her eyes considering how much she reads by candlelight it is not to be wonderd at  lady sneerwell  true and then as to her mannerupon my word i think it is particularly graceful considering she never had the least education  for you know her mother was a welch milliner and her father a sugarbaker at bristow  sir benjamin  ah you are both of you too goodnatured  sir peter  yes damned goodnatured  her own relation mercy on me  aside  mrs candour  for my part i own i cannot bear to hear a friend illspoken of  sir peter  no to be sure  sir benjamin  ah you are of a moral turn mrs candour and can sit for an hour to hear lady stucco talk sentiments  lady sneerwell  nay i vow lady stucco is very well with the dessert after dinner for shes just like the spanish fruit one cracks for mottoesmade up of paint and proverb  mrs candour  well i never will join in ridiculing a friend and so i constantly tell my cousin ogleand you all know what pretensions she has to be critical in beauty  lady teazle  o to be sure she has herself the oddest countenance that ever was seentis a collection of features from all the different countries of the globe  sir benjamin  so she has indeedan irish front  crabtree  caledonian locks  sir benjamin  dutch nose  crabtree  austrian lips  sir benjamin  complexion of a spaniard  crabtree  and teeth a la chinoise  sir benjamin  in short her face resembles a table dhote at spa where no two guests are of a nation  crabtree  or a congress at the close of a general warwherein all the members even to her eyes appear to have a different interest and her nose and chin are the only parties likely to join issue  mrs candour  ha ha ha  sir peter  mercy on my life a person they dine with twice a week aside  lady sneerwell  gogoyou are a couple of provoking toads  mrs candour  nay but i vow you shall not carry the laugh off so for give me leave to say that mrs ogle  sir peter  madammadami beg your pardontheres no stopping these good gentlemens tonguesbut when i tell you mrs candour that the lady they are abusing is a particular friend of mine i hope youll not take her part  lady sneerwell  ha ha ha well said sir peterbut you are a cruel creaturetoo phlegmatic yourself for a jest and too peevish to allow wit in others  sir peter  ah madam true wit is more nearly allowd allied to good nature than your ladyship is aware of  lady sneerwell  true sir peteri believe they are so near akin that they can never be united  sir benjamin  o rather madam suppose them man and wife because one seldom sees them together  lady teazle  but sir peter is such an enemy to scandal i believe he would have it put down by parliament  sir peter  fore heaven madam if they were to consider the sporting with reputation of as much importance as poaching on manors and pass an act for the preservation of famethere are many would thank them for the bill  lady sneerwell  o lud sir peter would you deprive us of our privileges  sir peter  aye madamand then no person should be permitted to kill characters or run down reputations but qualified old maids and disappointed widows  lady sneerwell  go you monster  mrs candour  but sure you would not be quite so severe on those who only report what they hear  sir peter  yes madam i would have law merchant for that too and in all cases of slander currency whenever the drawer of the lie was not to be found the injured party should have a right to come on any of the indorsers  crabtree  well for my part i believe there never was a scandalous tale without some foundation3  lady sneerwell  come ladies shall we sit

 sir peter  your ladyship must excuse meim called away by particular businessbut i leave my character behind me      exit  sir benjamin  well certainly lady teazle that lord of yours is a strange beingi could tell you some stories of him would make you laugh heartily if he wernt your husband  lady teazle  o pray dont mind thatcome do lets hear em      join the rest of the company going into the next room  surface  maria i see you have no satisfaction in this society  maria  how is it possible i should  if to raise malicious smiles at the infirmities or misfortunes of those who have never injured us be the province of wit or humour heaven grant me a double portion of dullness  surface  yet they appear more illnatured than they arethey have no malice at heart  maria  then is their conduct still more contemptible for in my opinionnothing could excuse the intemperance of their tongues but a natural and ungovernable bitterness of mind  surface  undoubtedly madamand it has always been a sentiment of minethat to propagate a malicious truth wantonlyis more despicable than to falsify from revenge but can you maria feel thus for others and be unkind to me alonenay is hope to be denied the tenderest passion  maria  why will you distress me by renewing this subject  surface  ah maria you would not treat me thus and oppose your guardians sir peters wishesbut that i see that my profligate brother is still a favourd rival  maria  ungenerously urgedbut whatever my sentiments of that unfortunate young man are be assured i shall not feel more bound to give him up because his distresses have sunk him so low as to deprive him of the regard even of a brother  surface  nay but maria do not leave me with a frownby all thats honest i sweargads life heres lady teazleyou must not no you shallfor tho i have the greatest regard for lady teazle  maria  lady teazle  surface  yet were sir peter to suspect       enter lady teazle and comes forward  lady teazle  whats this praydo you take her for mechild you are wanted in the next roomwhats all this pray  surface  o the most unlucky circumstance in nature  maria has somehow suspected the tender concern i have for your happiness and threatend to acquaint sir peter with her suspicionsand i was just endeavouring to reason with her when you came  lady teazle  indeed but you seemd to adopta very tender mode of reasoningdo you usually argue on your knees  surface  o shes a childand i thought a little bombast but lady teazle when are you to give me your judgment on my library as you promised  lady teazle  nono i begin to think it would be imprudent and you know i admit you as a lover no farther than fashion requires  surface  truea mere platonic cicisbeo what every london wife is entitled to  lady teazle  certainly one must not be out of the fashionhowever i have so much of my country prejudices leftthatthough sir peters ill humour may vex me ever so it never shall provoke me to  surface  the only revenge in your powerwell i applaud your moderation  lady teazle  goyou are an insinuating hypocritebut we shall be missdlet us join the company  surface  true but we had best not return together  lady teazle  well dont stayfor maria shant come to hear any more of your reasoning i promise you      exit  surface  a curious dilemma truly my politics have run me into i wanted at first only to ingratiate myself with lady teazle that she might not be my enemy with mariaand i have i dont know how become her serious lover so that i stand a chance of committing a crime i never meditatedand probably of losing maria by the pursuitsincerely i begin to wish i had never made such a point of gaining so very good a character for it has led me into so many curst rogueries that i doubt i shall be exposed at last      exit        scene iiiat sir peters       rowley and sir oliver  sir oliver  ha ha ha and so my old friend is married hey a young wife out of the countryha ha that he should have stood bluff to old bachelor so long and sink into a husband at last  rowley  but you must not rally him on the subject sir olivertis a tender point i assure you though he has been married only seven months  sir oliver  ah then he has been just half a year on the stool of repentancepoor peter  but you say he has entirely given up charlesnever sees him hey  rowley  his prejudice against him is astonishingand i am sure greatly increased by a jealousy of him with lady teazlewhich he has been industriously led into by a scandalous society in the neighbourhoodwho have contributed not a little to charless ill name  whereas the truth is i believe if the lady is partial to either of them his brother is the favourite  sir oliver  ayei knowthere are a set of malicious prating prudent gossips both male and female who murder characters to kill time and will rob a young fellow of his good name before he has years to know the value of it   but i am not to be prejudiced against my nephew by such i promise you  no noif charles has done nothing false or mean i shall compound for his extravagance  rowley  then my life ont you will reclaim him  ah sir it gives me new vigour to find that your heart is not turned against him and that the son of my good old master has one friend however left  sir oliver  what shall i forget master rowleywhen i was at his house myselfegad my brother and i were neither of us very prudent youthsand yet i believe you have not seen many better men than your old master was  rowley  tis this reflection gives me assurance that charles may yet be a credit to his familybut here comes sir peter  sir oliver  egad so he doesmercy on mehes greatly altered and seems to have a settled married lookone may read husband in his face at this distance       enter sir peter  sir peter  ha  sir olivermy old friendwelcome to england a thousand times  sir oliver  thank youthank yousir peterand efaith i am as glad to find you well believe me  sir peter  ah tis a long time since we metsixteen year i doubt sir oliverand many a cross accident in the time  sir oliver  aye i have had my sharebut what i find you are marriedhey my old boywellwell it cant be helpdand so i wish you joy with all my heart  sir peter  thank youthanks sir oliveryes i have entered into the happy state but well not talk of that now  sir oliver  true true sir peter old friends shouldnt begin on grievances at first meeting  no no  rowley  take care pray sir  sir oliver  wellso one of my nephews i find is a wild roguehey  sir peter  wildoh my old friendi grieve for your disappointment therehes a lost young man indeedhowever his brother will make you amends joseph is indeed what a youth should beeverybody in the world speaks well of him  sir oliver  i am sorry to hear ithe has too good a character to be an honest fellow  everybody speaks well of him  psha then he has bowd as low to knaves and fools as to the honest dignity of virtue  sir peter  what sir oliver do you blame him for not making enemies  sir oliver  yesif he has merit enough to deserve them  sir peter  wellwellyoull be convinced when you know himtis edification to hear him conversehe professes the noblest sentiments  sir oliver  ah plague on his sentimentsif he salutes me with a scrap sentence of morality in his mouth i shall be sick directly but however dont mistake me sir peter i dont mean to defend charless errorsbut before i form my judgment of either of them i intend to make a trial of their heartsand my friend rowley and i have planned something for the purpose  rowley  and sir peter shall own he has been for once mistaken  sir peter  my life on josephs honour  sir oliver  well come give us a bottle of good wineand well drink the lads healths and tell you our scheme  sir peter  alons allons then  sir oliver  but dont sir peter be so severe against your old friends son  sir peter  tis his vices and follies have made me his enemy  rowley  comecomesir peter consider how early he was left to his own guidance  sir oliver  odds my lifei am not sorry that he has run out of the course a littlefor my part i hate to see dry prudence clinging to the green juices of youthtis like ivy round a sapling and spoils the growth of the tree       end of the second act          act iii        scene iat sir peters       sir peter sir oliver and rowley  sir peter  well then we will see the fellows first and have our wine afterwardsbut how is this master rowleyi dont see the jet of your scheme  rowley  why sirthis mr stanley whom i was speaking of is nearly related to them by their mother  he was once a merchant in dublin but has been ruined by a series of undeserved misfortunesand now lately coming over to solicit the assistance of his friends here has been flyng flung into prison by some of his creditors where he is now with two helpless boys  sir oliver  aye and a worthy fellow too i remember him  but what is this to lead to  rowley  you shall hearhe has applied by letter both to mr surface and charlesfrom the former he has received nothing but evasive promises of future service while charles has done all that his extravagance has left him power to doand he is at this time endeavouring to raise a sum of moneypart of which in the midst of his own distresses i know he intends for the service of poor stanley  sir oliver  ah he is my brothers son  sir peter  well but how is sir oliver personally to  rowley  why sir i will inform charles and his brother that stanley has obtaind permission to apply in person to his friendsand as they have neither of them ever seen him let sir oliver assume his characterand he will have a fair opportunity of judging at least of the benevolence of their dispositions  sir peter  pshaw this will prove nothingi make no doubt charles is coxcomb and thoughtless enough to give money to poor relations if he had it  sir oliver  then he shall never want it  i have brought a few rupees home with me sir peterand i only want to be sure of bestowing them rightly  rowley  then sir believe me you will find in the youngest brother one who in the midst of folly and dissipationhas still as our immortal bard expresses it     a tear for pity and a hand open as the day for melting charity  sir peter  pish  what signifies his having an open hand or purse either when he has nothing left to givebut if you talk of humane sentimentsjoseph is the manwell well make the trial if you please  but where is the fellow whom you brought for sir oliver to examine relative to charless affairs  rowley  below waiting his commands and no one can give him better intelligencethis sir oliver is a friendly jew who to do him justice has done everything in his power to bring your nephew to a proper sense of his extravagance  sir peter  pray let us have him in  rowley  desire mr moses to walk upstairs       calls to servant  sir peter  but pray why should you suppose he will speak the truth  rowley  oh i have convinced him that he has no chance of recovering certain sums advanced to charles but through the bounty of sir oliver who he knows is arrived so that you may depend on his fidelity to his interest  i have also another evidence in my power one snake whom i shall shortly produce to remove some of your prejudices sir peter relative to charles and lady teazle  sir peter  i have heard too much on that subject  rowley  here comes the honest israelite       enter moses  this is sir oliver  sir oliver  siri understand you have lately had great dealings with my nephew charles  moses  yes sir oliveri have done all i could for him but he was ruined before he came to me for assistance  sir oliver  that was unlucky trulyfor you have had no opportunity of showing your talents  moses  none at alli hadnt the pleasure of knowing his distresses till he was some thousands worse than nothing till it was impossible to add to them  sir oliver  unfortunate indeed but i suppose you have done all in your power for him honest moses  moses  yes he knows thatthis very evening i was to have brought him a gentleman from the city who does not know him and will i believe advance some money  sir peter  what one charles has never had money from before  moses  yesmr premium of crutched friars  sir peter  egad sir oliver a thought strikes mecharles you say doesnt know mr premium  moses  not at all  sir peter  now then sir oliver you may have a better opportunity of satisfying yourself than by an old romancing tale of a poor relation go with my friend moses and represent mr premium and then ill answer fort youll see your nephew in all his glory  sir oliver  egad i like this idea better than the other and i may visit joseph afterwards as old stanley  sir peter  true so you may  rowley  well this is taking charles rather at a disadvantage to be surehowever mosesyou understand sir peter and will be faithful  moses  you may depend upon meand this is near the time i was to have gone  sir oliver  ill accompany you as soon as you please moses but holdi have forgot one thinghow the plague shall i be able to pass for a jew  moses  theres no needthe principal is christian  sir oliver  is heim very sorry to hear itbut then again ant i rather too smartly dressed to look like a moneylender  sir peter  not at all twould not be out of character if you went in your own carriagewould it moses  moses  not in the least  sir oliver  wellbuthow must i talk theres certainly some cant of usury and mode of treating that i ought to know  sir peter  oh theres not much to learnthe great point as i take it is to be exorbitant enough in your demands hey moses  moses  yes thats very great point  sir oliver  ill answer fort ill not be wanting in thatill ask him eight or ten per cent on the loanat least  moses  youll be found out directlyif you ask him no more than that youll be discovered immediately  sir oliver  heywhat the plaguehow much then  moses  that depends upon the circumstancesif he appears not very anxious for the supply you should require only forty or fifty per centbut if you find him in great distress and want the monies very badyou may ask double  sir peter  a goodhonest trade youre learning sir oliver  sir oliver  truly i think soand not unprofitable  moses  then you knowyou havent the monies yourself but are forced to borrow them for him of a friend  sir oliver  o i borrow it of a friend do i  moses  and your friend is an unconsciond dogbut you cant help it  sir oliver  my friends an unconscionable dog is he  moses  yesand he himself hasnt the monies by himbut is forced to sell stockat a great loss  sir oliver  he is forced to sell stock is heat a great loss is hewell thats very kind of him  sir peter  efaith sir olivermr premium i meanyoull soon be master of the tradebut moses would have him inquire if the borrower is a minor  moses  o yes  sir peter  and in that case his conscience will direct him  moses  to have the bond in another name to be sure  sir oliver  wellwell i shall be perfect  sir peter  but hearkee wouldnt you have him also run out a little against the annuity billthat would be in character i should think  moses  very much  rowley  and lament that a young man now must be at years of discretion before he is suffered to ruin himself  moses  aye great pity  sir peter  and abuse the public for allowing merit to an act whose only object is to snatch misfortune and imprudence from the rapacious relief of usury and give the minor a chance of inheriting his estate without being undone by coming into possession  sir oliver  sosomoses shall give me further instructions as we go together  sir peter  you will not have much time for your nephew lives hard bye  sir oliver  oh neverfear  my tutor appears so able that tho charles lived in the next street it must be my own fault if i am not a compleat rogue before i turn the corner      exeunt sir oliver and moses  sir peter  sonow i think sir oliver will be convincedyou shant follow them rowley  you are partial and would have prepared charles for tother plot  rowley  no upon my word sir peter  sir peter  well go bring me this snake and ill hear what he has to say presently  i see maria and want to speak with her      exit rowley i should be glad to be convinced my suspicions of lady teazle and charles were unjusti have never yet opened my mind on this subject to my friend joseph    i am determined  i will do ithe will give me his opinion sincerely       enter maria  so childhas mr surface returned with you  maria  no sirhe was engaged  sir peter  wellmariado you not reflect the more you converse with that amiable young man what return his partiality for you deserves  maria  indeed sir peteryour frequent importunity on this subject distresses me extremelyyou compell me to declare that i know no man who has ever paid me a particular attention whom i would not prefer to mr surface  sir peter  soh  heres perversenessnonomaria tis charles only whom you would prefertis evident his vices and follies have won your heart  maria  this is unkind siryou know i have obeyd you in neither seeing nor corresponding with himi have heard enough to convince me that he is unworthy my regardyet i cannot think it culpable if while my understanding severely condemns his vices my heart suggests some pity for his distresses  sir peter  well well pity him as much as you please but give your heart and hand to a worthier object  maria  never to his brother  sir peter  goperverse and obstinate but take care madam you have never yet known what the authority of a guardian is dont compel me to inform you of it  maria  i can only

been very impatient nowo lud dont pretend to look gravei vow i couldnt come before  surface  o madam punctuality is a species of constancy a very unfashionable quality in a lady  lady teazle  upon my word you ought to pity me do you now sir peter is grown so illtempered to me of late and so jealous of charles too thats the best of the story isnt it  surface  i am glad my scandalous friends keep that up aside  lady teazle  i am sure i wish he would let maria marry him and then perhaps he would be convinceddont youmr surface  surface  indeed i do notaside  o certainly i dofor then my dear lady teazle would also be convinced how wrong her suspicions were of my having any design on the silly girl  lady teazle  wellwell im inclined to believe youbesides i really never could perceive why she should have so any admirers  surface  o for her fortunenothing else  lady teazle  i believe so for tho she is certainly very pretty yet she has no conversation in the worldand is so grave and reservedthat i declare i think shed have made an excellent wife for sir peter  surface  so she would  lady teazle  thenone never hears her speak ill of anybodywhich you know is mighty dull  surface  yet she doesnt want understanding  lady teazle  no more she doesyet one is always disapointed when one hears her speakfor though her eyes have no kind of meaning in themshe very seldom talks nonsense  surface  naynay surelyshe has very fine eyes  lady teazle  why so she hastho sometimes one fancies theres a little sort of a squint  surface  a squinto fielady teazle  lady teazle  yes yesi vow nowcome there is a lefthanded cupid in one eyethats the truth ont  surface  wellhis aim is very direct howeverbut lady sneerwell has quite corrupted you  lady teazle  no indeedi have not opinion enough of her to be taught by her and i know that she has lately raisd many scandalous hints of mewhich you know one always hears from one common friend or other  surface  why to say truth i believe you are not more obliged to her than others of her acquaintance  lady teazle  but isnt it provoking to hear the most illnatured things said to one and theres my friend lady sneerwell has circulated i dont know how many scandalous tales of me and all without any foundation too thats what vexes me  surface  aye madam to be sure that is the provoking circumstance without foundationyes yestheres the mortification indeed for when a slanderous story is believed against onethere certainly is no comfort like the consciousness of having deserved it  lady teazle  no to be surethen id forgive their malice but to attack me who am really so innocentand who never say an illnatured thing of anybodythat is of any friend and then sir peter tooto have him so peevishand so suspicious when i know the integrity of my own heartindeed tis monstrous  surface  but my dear lady teazle tis your own fault if you suffer itwhen a husband entertains a groundless suspicion of his wife and withdraws his confidence from herthe original compact is broke and she owes it to the honour of her sex to endeavour to outwit him  lady teazle  indeedso that if he suspects me without cause it follows that the best way of curing his jealousy is to give him reason fort  surface  undoubtedlyfor your husband should never be  deceived in youand in that case it becomes you to be frail in compliment to his discernment  lady teazle  to be sure what you say is very reasonableand when the consciousness of my own innocence  surface  ah  my dearmadam there is the great mistaketis this very conscious innocence that is of the greatest prejudice to you what is it makes you negligent of forms and careless of the worlds opinionwhy the consciousness of your innocencewhat makes you thoughtless in your conduct and apt to run into a thousand little imprudenceswhy the consciousness of your innocencewhat makes you impatient of sir peters temper and outrageous at his suspicions why the consciousness of your own innocence  lady teazle  tis very true  surface  now my dear lady teazle if you but once make a trifling faux pas you cant conceive how cautious you would grow and how ready to humour and agree with your husband  lady teazle  do you think so  surface  o im sure ont and then youd find all scandal would cease at oncefor in short your character at present is like a person in a plethora absolutely dying of too much health  lady teazle  sosothen i perceive your prescription is that i must sin in my own defenceand part with my virtue to preserve my reputation  surface  exactly so upon my credit maam  lady teazle  well certainly this is the oddest doctrineand the newest receipt for avoiding calumny  surface  an infallible one believe meprudence like experience must be paid for  lady teazle  why if my understanding were once convinced  surface  oh certainly madam your understanding should be convincedyesyesheaven forbid i should persuade you to do anything you thought wrongnonoi have too much honor to desire it  lady teazle  dontyou think we may as well leave honor out of the argument  rises  surface  ahthe ill effects of your country education i see still remain with you  lady teazle  i doubt they do indeedand i will fairly own to you that if i could be persuaded to do wrong it would be by sir peters illusagesooner than your honourable logic after all  surface  then by

made me very unhappy  surface  indeed im very sorry to hear it  sir peter  yes tis but too plain she has not the least regard for mebut whats worse i have pretty good authority to suspect that she

my dear friend i knew you would sympathize with me  surface  yesbelieve me sir petersuch a discovery would hurt me just as much as it would you  sir peter  i am convinced of itahit is a happiness to

its own integrity is ever slowest to credit anothers treachery  sir peter  truebut your brother has no sentimentyou never hear him talk so  surface  well there certainly is no knowing what men are capable of nothere is no knowingyet i cant but think lady teazle herself has too much principle  sir peter  aye but whats principle against the flattery of a handsomelively young fellow  surface  thats very true  sir peter  and then you know the difference of our ages makes it very improbable that she should have any great affection for meand if she were to be frail and i were to make it publicwhy the town would only laugh at the foolish old batchelor who had married a girl  surface  thats trueto be sure people would laugh  sir peter  laughaye and make balladsand paragraphs and the devil knows what of me  surface  noyou must never make it public  sir peter  but then again that the nephew of my old friend sir oliver should be the person to attempt such an injury hurts me more nearly  surface  undoubtedlywhen ingratitude barbs the dart of injury the wound has double danger in it  sir peter  ayei that was in a manner left his guardian in his house he had been so often entertaindwho never in my life denied him my advice  surface  o tis not to be creditedthere may be a man capable of such baseness to be surebut for my part till you can give me positive proofs you must excuse me withholding my belief  however if this should be proved on him he is no longer a brother of mine i disclaim kindred with himfor the man who can break thro the laws of hospitalityand attempt the wife of his friend deserves to be branded as the pest of society  sir peter  what a difference there is between youwhat noble sentiments  surface  but i cannot suspect lady teazles honor  sir peter  im sure i wish to think well of herand to remove all ground of quarrel between usshe has lately reproachd me more than once with having made no settlement on herand in our last quarrel she

deplore that the gay dream of dissipations oer and say ye fair was ever lively wife born with a genius for the highest life like me untimely blasted in her bloom like me condemnd to such a dismal doom save moneywhen i just knew how to waste it leave londonjust as i began to taste it   must i then watch the early crowing cock the melancholy ticking of a clock in a lone rustic hall for ever pounded with dogs cats rats and squalling brats surrounded with humble curate can i now retire while good sir peter boozes with the squire and at backgammon mortify my soul that pants for loo or flutters at a vole sevens the main  dear sound that must expire lost at hot cockles round a christmas fire the transient hour of fashion too soon spent farewell the tranquil mind farewell content farewell the plumed head the cushiond tete that takes the cushion from its proper seat that spiritstirring drumcard drums i mean spadilleodd trickpambastoking and queen and you ye knockers that with brazen throat the welcome visitors approach denote farewell all quality of high renown pride pomp and circumstance of glorious town farewell your revels i partake no more and lady teazles occupations oer all this i told our bard he smiled and said twas clear i ought to play deep tragedy next year meanwhile he drew wise morals from his play and in these solemn periods stalkd away blessd were the fair like you her faults who stoppd and closed her follies when the curtain droppd no more in vice or error to engage or play the fool at large on lifes great stage
