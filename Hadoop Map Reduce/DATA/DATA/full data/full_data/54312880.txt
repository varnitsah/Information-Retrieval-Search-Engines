eighteen hundred and four a few crusted characters     the sons veto   chapter i   to the eyes of a man viewing it from behind the nutbrown hair was a wonder and a mystery  under the black beaver hat surmounted by its tuft of black feathers the long locks braided and twisted and coiled like the rushes of a basket composed a rare if somewhat barbaric example of ingenious art  one could understand such weavings and coilings being wrought to last intact for a year or even a calendar month but that they should be all demolished regularly at bedtime after a single day of permanence seemed a reckless waste of successful fabrication  and she had done it all herself poor thing  she had no maid and it was almost the only accomplishment she could boast of  hence the unstinted pains  she was a young invalid ladynot so very much of an invalidsitting in a wheeled chair which had been pulled up in the front part of a green enclosure close to a bandstand where a concert was going on during a warm june afternoon  it had place in one of the minor parks or private gardens that are to be found in the suburbs of london and was the effort of a local association to raise money for some charity  there are worlds within worlds in the great city and though nobody outside the immediate district had ever heard of the charity or the band or the garden the enclosure was filled with an interested audience sufficiently informed on all these  as the strains proceeded many of the listeners observed the chaired lady whose back hair by reason of her prominent position so challenged inspection  her face was not easily discernible but the aforesaid cunning tressweavings the white ear and poll and the curve of a cheek which was neither flaccid nor sallow were signals that led to the expectation of good beauty in front  such expectations are not infrequently disappointed as soon as the disclosure comes and in the present case when the lady by a turn of the head at length revealed herself she was not so handsome as the people behind her had supposed and even hopedthey did not know why  for one thing alas the commonness of this complaint she was less young than they had fancied her to be  yet attractive her face unquestionably was and not at all sickly  the revelation of its details came each time she turned to talk to a boy of twelve or thirteen who stood beside her and the shape of whose hat and jacket implied that he belonged to a wellknown public school  the immediate bystanders could hear that he called her mother  when the end of the recital was reached and the audience withdrew many chose to find their way out by passing at her elbow  almost all turned their heads to take a full and near look at the interesting woman who remained stationary in the chair till the way should be clear enough for her to be wheeled out without obstruction  as if she expected their glances and did not mind gratifying their curiosity she met the eyes of several of her observers by lifting her own showing these to be soft brown and affectionate orbs a little plaintive in their regard  she was conducted out of the gardens and passed along the pavement till she disappeared from view the schoolboy walking beside her  to inquiries made by some persons who watched her away the answer came that she was the second wife of the incumbent of a neighbouring parish and that she was lame  she was generally believed to be a woman with a storyan innocent one but a story of some sort or other  in conversing with her on their way home the boy who walked at her elbow said that he hoped his father had not missed them  he have been so comfortable these last few hours that i am sure he cannot have missed us she replied  has dear mothernot have exclaimed the publicschool boy with an impatient fastidiousness that was almost harsh  surely you know that by this time  his mother hastily adopted the correction and did not resent his making it or retaliate as she might well have done by bidding him to wipe that crumby mouth of his whose condition had been caused by surreptitious attempts to eat a piece of cake without taking it out of the pocket wherein it lay concealed  after this the pretty woman and the boy went onward in silence  that question of grammar bore upon her history and she fell into reverie of a somewhat sad kind to all appearance  it might have been assumed that she was wondering if she had done wisely in shaping her life as she had shaped it to bring out such a result as this  in a remote nook in north wessex forty miles from london near the thriving countytown of aldbrickham there stood a pretty village with its church and parsonage which she knew well enough but her son had never seen  it was her native village gaymead and the first event bearing upon her present situation had occurred at that place when she was only a girl of nineteen  how well she remembered it that first act in her little tragicomedy the death of her reverend husbands first wife  it happened on a spring evening and she who now and for many years had filled that first wifes place was then parlourmaid in the parsons house  when everything had been done that could be done and the death was announced she had gone out in the dusk to visit her parents who were living in the same village to tell them the sad news  as she opened the white swinggate and looked towards the trees which rose westward shutting out the pale light of the evening sky she discerned without much surprise the figure of a man standing in the hedge though she roguishly exclaimed as a matter of form oh sam how you frightened me  he was a young gardener of her acquaintance  she told him the particulars of the late event and they stood silent these two young people in that elevated calmly philosophic mind which is engendered when a tragedy has happened close at hand and has not happened to the philosophers themselves  but it had its bearing upon their relations  and will you stay on now at the vicarage just the same asked he  she had hardly thought of that  oh yesi suppose she said everything will be just as usual i imagine  he walked beside her towards her mothers  presently his arm stole round her waist  she gently removed it but he placed it there again and she yielded the point  you see dear sophy you dont know that youll stay on you may want a home and i shall be ready to offer one some day though i may not be ready just yet  why sam how can you be so fast  ive never even said i liked ee and it is all your own doing coming after me  still it is nonsense to say i am not to have a try at you like the rest  he stooped to kiss her a farewell for they had reached her mothers door  no sam you shant she cried putting her hand over his mouth  you ought to be more serious on such a night as this  and she bade him adieu without allowing him to kiss her or to come indoors  the vicar just left a widower was at this time a man about forty years of age of good family and childless  he had led a secluded existence in this college living partly because there were no resident landowners and his loss now intensified his habit of withdrawal from outward observation  he was still less seen than heretofore kept himself still less in time with the rhythm and racket of the movements called progress in the world without  for many months after his wifes decease the economy of his household remained as before the cook the housemaid the parlourmaid and the man outofdoors performed their duties or left them undone just as nature prompted themthe vicar knew not which  it was then represented to him that his servants seemed to have nothing to do in his small family of one  he was struck with the truth of this representation and decided to cut down his establishment  but he was forestalled by sophy the parlourmaid who said one evening that she wished to leave him  and why said the parson  sam hobson has asked me to marry him sir  welldo you want to marry  not much  but it would be a home for me  and we have heard that one of us will have to leave  a day or two after she said i dont want to leave just yet sir if you dont wish it  sam and i have quarrelled  he looked up at her  he had hardly ever observed her before though he had been frequently conscious of her soft presence in the room  what a kittenlike flexuous tender creature she was  she was the only one of the servants with whom he came into immediate and continuous relation what should he do if sophy were gone  sophy did not go but one of the others did and things went on quietly again  when mr twycott the vicar was ill sophy brought up his meals to him and she had no sooner left the room one day than he heard a noise on the stairs  she had slipped down with the tray and so twisted her foot that she could not stand  the village surgeon was called in the vicar got better but sophy was incapacitated for a long time and she was informed that she must never again walk much or engage in any occupation which required her to stand long on her feet  as soon as she was comparatively well she spoke to him alone  since she was forbidden to walk and bustle about and indeed could not do so it became her duty to leave  she could very well work at something sitting down and she had an aunt a seamstress  the parson had been very greatly moved by what she had suffered on his account and he exclaimed no sophy lame or not lame i cannot let you go  you must never leave me again  he came close to her and though she could never exactly tell how it happened she became conscious of his lips upon her cheek  he then asked her to marry him  sophy did not exactly love him but she had a respect for him which almost amounted to veneration  even if she had wished to get away from him she hardly dared refuse a personage so reverend and august in her eyes and she assented forthwith to be his wife  thus it happened that one fine morning when the doors of the church were naturally open for ventilation and the singing birds fluttered in and alighted on the tiebeams of the roof there was a marriageservice at the communionrails which hardly a soul knew of  the parson and a neighbouring curate had entered at one door and sophy at another followed by two necessary persons whereupon in a short time there emerged a newlymade husband and wife  mr twycott knew perfectly well that he had committed social suicide by this step despite sophys spotless character and he had taken his measures accordingly  an exchange of livings had been arranged with an acquaintance who was incumbent of a church in the south of london and as soon as possible the couple removed thither abandoning their pretty country home with trees and shrubs and glebe for a narrow dusty house in a long straight street and their fine peal of bells for the wretchedest onetongued clangour that ever tortured mortal ears  it was all on her account  they were however away from every one who had known her former position and also under less observation from without than they would have had to put up with in any country parish  sophy the woman was as charming a partner as a man could possess though sophy the lady had her deficiencies  she showed a natural aptitude for little domestic refinements so far as related to things and manners but in what is called culture she was less intuitive  she had now been married more than fourteen years and her husband had taken much trouble with her education but she still held confused ideas on the use of was and were which did not beget a respect for her among the few acquaintances she made  her great grief in this relation was that her only child on whose education no expense had been and would be spared was now old enough to perceive these deficiencies in his mother and not only to see them but to feel irritated at their existence  thus she lived on in the city and wasted hours in braiding her beautiful hair till her once apple cheeks waned to pink of the very faintest  her foot had never regained its natural strength after the accident and she was mostly obliged to avoid walking altogether  her husband had grown to like london for its freedom and its domestic privacy but he was twenty years his sophys senior and had latterly been seized with a serious illness  on this day however he had seemed to be well enough to justify her accompanying her son randolph to the concert    chapter ii   the next time we get a glimpse of her is when she appears in the mournful attire of a widow  mr twycott had never rallied and now lay in a wellpacked cemetery to the south of the great city where if all the dead it contained had stood erect and alive not one would have known him or recognized his name  the boy had dutifully followed him to the grave and was now again at school  throughout these changes sophy had been treated like the child she was in nature though not in years  she was left with no control over anything that had been her husbands beyond her modest personal income  in his anxiety lest her inexperience should be overreached he had safeguarded with trustees all he possibly could  the completion of the boys course at the public school to be followed in due time by oxford and ordination had been all previsioned and arranged and she really had nothing to occupy her in the world but to eat and drink and make a business of indolence and go on weaving and coiling the nutbrown hair merely keeping a home open for the son whenever he came to her during vacations  foreseeing his probable decease long years before her her husband in his lifetime had purchased for her use a semidetached villa in the same long straight road whereon the church and parsonage faced which was to be hers as long as she chose to live in it  here she now resided looking out upon the fragment of lawn in front and through the railings at the everflowing traffic or bending forward over the windowsill on the first floor stretching her eyes far up and down the vista of sooty trees hazy air and drab housefacades along which echoed the noises common to a suburban main thoroughfare  somehow her boy with his aristocratic schoolknowledge his grammars and his aversions was losing those wide infantine sympathies extending as far as to the sun and moon themselves with which he like other children had been born and which his mother a child of nature herself had loved in him he was reducing their compass to a population of a few thousand wealthy and titled people the mere veneer of a thousand million or so of others who did not interest him at all  he drifted further and further away from her  sophys milieu being a suburb of minor tradesmen and underclerks and her almost only companions the two servants of her own house it was not surprising that after her husbands death she soon lost the little artificial tastes she had acquired from him and becamein her sons eyesa mother whose mistakes and origin it was his painful lot as a gentleman to blush for  as yet he was far from being man enoughif he ever would beto rate these sins of hers at their true infinitesimal value beside the yearning fondness that welled up and remained penned in her heart till it should be more fully accepted by him or by some other person or thing  if he had lived at home with her he would have had all of it but he seemed to require so very little in present circumstances and it remained stored  her life became insupportably dreary she could not take walks and had no interest in going for drives or indeed in travelling anywhere nearly two years passed without an event and still she looked on that suburban road thinking of the village in which she had been born and whither she would have gone backo how gladlyeven to work in the fields  taking no exercise she often could not sleep and would rise in the night or early morning and look out upon the then vacant thoroughfare where the lamps stood like sentinels waiting for some procession to go by  an approximation to such a procession was indeed made early every morning about one oclock when the country vehicles passed up with loads of vegetables for covent garden market  she often saw them creeping along at this silent and dusky hourwaggon after waggon bearing green bastions of cabbages nodding to their fall yet never falling walls of baskets enclosing masses of beans and peas pyramids of snowwhite turnips swaying howdahs of mixed producecreeping along behind aged nighthorses who seemed ever patiently wondering between their hollow coughs why they had always to work at that still hour when all other sentient creatures were privileged to rest  wrapped in a cloak it was soothing to watch and sympathize with them when depression and nervousness hindered sleep and to see how the fresh greenstuff brightened to life as it came opposite the lamp and how the sweating animals steamed and shone with their miles of travel  they had an interest almost a charm for sophy these semirural people and vehicles moving in an urban atmosphere leading a life quite distinct from that of the daytime toilers on the same road  one morning a man who accompanied a waggonload of potatoes gazed rather hard at the housefronts as he passed and with a curious emotion she thought his form was familiar to her  she looked out for him again  his being an oldfashioned conveyance with a yellow front it was easily recognizable and on the third night after she saw it a second time  the man alongside was as she had fancied sam hobson formerly gardener at gaymead who would at one time have married her  she had occasionally thought of him and wondered if life in a cottage with him would not have been a happier lot than the life she had accepted  she had not thought of him passionately but her now dismal situation lent an interest to his resurrectiona tender interest which it is impossible to exaggerate  she went back to bed and began thinking  when did these marketgardeners who travelled up to town so regularly at one or two in the morning come back  she dimly recollected seeing their empty waggons hardly noticeable amid the ordinary daytraffic passing down at some hour before noon  it was only april but that morning after breakfast she had the window opened and sat looking out the feeble sun shining full upon her  she affected to sew but her eyes never left the street  between ten and eleven the desired waggon now unladen reappeared on its return journey but sam was not looking round him then and drove on in a reverie  sam cried she  turning with a start his face lighted up  he called to him a little boy to hold the horse alighted and came and stood under her window  i cant come down easily sam or i would she said  did you know i lived here  well mrs twycott i knew you lived along here somewhere  i have often looked out for ee  he briefly explained his own presence on the scene  he had long since given up his gardening in the village near aldbrickham and was now manager at a marketgardeners on the south side of london it being part of his duty to go up to covent garden with waggonloads of produce two or three times a week  in answer to her curious inquiry he admitted that he had come to this particular district because he had seen in the aldbrickham paper a year or two before the announcement of the death in south london of the aforetime vicar of gaymead which had revived an interest in her dwellingplace that he could not extinguish leading him to hover about the locality till his present post had been secured  they spoke of their native village in dear old north wessex the spots in which they had played together as children  she tried to feel that she was a dignified personage now that she must not be too confidential with sam  but she could not keep it up and the tears hanging in her eyes were indicated in her voice  you are not happy mrs twycott im afraid he said  o of course not  i lost my husband only the year before last  ah  i meant in another way  youd like to be home again  this is my homefor life  the house belongs to me  but i understandshe let it out then  yes sam  i long for homeour home  i should like to be there and never leave it and die there but she remembered herself  thats only a momentary feeling  i have a son you know a dear boy  hes at school now  somewhere handy i suppose  i see theres lots on em along this road  o no  not in one of these wretched holes  at a public schoolone of the most distinguished in england  chok it all of course  i forget maam that youve been a lady for so many years  no i am not a lady she said sadly  i never shall be  but hes a gentleman and thatmakes ito how difficult for me    chapter iii   the acquaintance thus oddly reopened proceeded apace  she often looked out to get a few words with him by night or by day  her sorrow was that she could not accompany her one old friend on foot a little way and talk more freely than she could do while he paused before the house  one night at the beginning of june when she was again on the watch after an absence of some days from the window he entered the gate and said softly now wouldnt some air do you good  ive only half a load this morning  why not ride up to covent garden with me  theres a nice seat on the cabbages where ive spread a sack  you can be home again in a cab before anybody is up  she refused at first and then trembling with excitement hastily finished her dressing and wrapped herself up in cloak and veil afterwards sidling downstairs by the aid of the handrail in a way she could adopt on an emergency  when she had opened the door she found sam on the step and he lifted her bodily on his strong arm across the little forecourt into his vehicle  not a soul was visible or audible in the infinite length of the straight flat highway with its everwaiting lamps converging to points in each direction  the air was fresh as country air at this hour and the stars shone except to the northeastward where there was a whitish lightthe dawn  sam carefully placed her in the seat and drove on  they talked as they had talked in old days sam pulling himself up now and then when he thought himself too familiar  more than once she said with misgiving that she wondered if she ought to have indulged in the freak  but i am so lonely in my house she added and this makes me so happy  you must come again dear mrs twycott  there is no time o day for taking the air like this  it grew lighter and lighter  the sparrows became busy in the streets and the city waxed denser around them  when they approached the river it was day and on the bridge they beheld the full blaze of morning sunlight in the direction of st pauls the river glistening towards it and not a craft stirring  near covent garden he put her into a cab and they parted looking into each others faces like the very old friends they were  she reached home without adventure limped to the door and let herself in with her latch key unseen  the air and sams presence had revived her her cheeks were quite pinkalmost beautiful  she had something to live for in addition to her son  a woman of pure instincts she knew there had been nothing really wrong in the journey but supposed it conventionally to be very wrong indeed  soon however she gave way to the temptation of going with him again and on this occasion their conversation was distinctly tender and sam said he never should forget her notwithstanding that she had served him rather badly at one time  after much hesitation he told her of a plan it was in his power to carry out and one he should like to take in hand since he did not care for london work it was to set up as a master greengrocer down at aldbrickham the countytown of their native place he knew of an openinga shop kept by aged people who wished to retire  and why dont you do it then sam she asked with a slight heartsinking  because im not sure ifyoud join me  i know you wouldntcouldnt such a lady as yeve been so long you couldnt be a wife to a man like me  i hardly suppose i could she assented also frightened at the idea  if you could he said eagerly youd ony have to sit in the back parlour and look through the glass partition when i was away sometimesjust to keep an eye on things  the lameness wouldnt hinder that    id keep you as genteel as ever i could dear sophyif i might think of it he pleaded  sam ill be frank she said putting her hand on his  if it were only myself i would do it and gladly though everything i possess would be lost to me by marrying again  i dont mind that  its more independent  thats good of you dear dear sam  but theres something else  i have a son    i almost fancy when i am miserable sometimes that he is not really mine but one i hold in trust for my late husband  he seems to belong so little to me personally so entirely to his dead father  he is so much educated and i so little that i do not feel dignified enough to be his mother    well he would have to be told  yes  unquestionably  sam saw her thought and her fear  still you can do as you like sophymrs twycott he added  it is not you who are the child but he  ah you dont know  sam if i could i would marry you some day  but you must wait a while and let me think  it was enough for him and he was blithe at their parting  not so she to tell randolph seemed impossible  she could wait till he had gone up to oxford when what she did would affect his life but little  but would he ever tolerate the idea  and if not could she defy him  she had not told him a word when the yearly cricketmatch came on at lords between the public schools though sam had already gone back to aldbrickham  mrs twycott felt stronger than usual she went to the match with randolph and was able to leave her chair and walk about occasionally  the bright idea occurred to her that she could casually broach the subject while moving round among the spectators when the boys spirits were high with interest in the game and he would weigh domestic matters as feathers in the scale beside the days victory  they promenaded under the lurid july sun this pair so wide apart yet so near and sophy saw the large proportion of boys like her own in their broad white collars and dwarf hats and all around the rows of great coaches under which was jumbled the debris of luxurious luncheons bones piecrusts champagnebottles glasses plates napkins and the family silver while on the coaches sat the proud fathers and mothers but never a poor mother like her  if randolph had not appertained to these had not centred all his interests in them had not cared exclusively for the class they belonged to how happy would things have been  a great huzza at some small performance with the bat burst from the multitude of relatives and randolph jumped wildly into the air to see what had happened  sophy fetched up the sentence that had been already shaped but she could not get it out  the occasion was perhaps an inopportune one  the contrast between her story and the display of fashion to which randolph had grown to regard himself as akin would be fatal  she awaited a better time  it was on an evening when they were alone in their plain suburban residence where life was not blue but brown that she ultimately broke silence qualifying her announcement of a probable second marriage by assuring him that it would not take place for a long time to come when he would be living quite independently of her  the boy thought the idea a very reasonable one and asked if she had chosen anybody  she hesitated and he seemed to have a misgiving  he hoped his stepfather would be a gentleman he said  not what you call a gentleman she answered timidly  hell be much as i was before i knew your father and by degrees she acquainted him with the whole  the youths face remained fixed for a moment then he flushed leant on the table and burst into passionate tears  his mother went up to him kissed all of his face that she could get at and patted his back as if he were still the baby he once had been crying herself the while  when he had somewhat recovered from his paroxysm he went hastily to his own room and fastened the door  parleyings were attempted through the keyhole outside which she waited and listened  it was long before he would reply and when he did it was to say sternly at her from within i am ashamed of you  it will ruin me  a miserable boor a churl a clown  it will degrade me in the eyes of all the gentlemen of england  say no moreperhaps i am wrong  i will struggle against it she cried miserably  before randolph left her that summer a letter arrived from sam to inform her that he had been unexpectedly fortunate in obtaining the shop  he was in possession it was the largest in the town combining fruit with vegetables and he thought it would form a home worthy even of her some day  might he not run up to town to see her  she met him by stealth and said he must still wait for her final answer the autumn dragged on and when randolph was home at christmas for the holidays she broached the matter again  but the young gentleman was inexorable  it was dropped for months renewed again abandoned under his repugnance again attempted and thus the gentle creature reasoned and pleaded till four or five long years had passed  then the faithful sam revived his suit with some peremptoriness  sophys son now an undergraduate was down from oxford one easter when she again opened the subject  as soon as he was ordained she argued he would have a home of his own wherein she with her bad grammar and her ignorance would be an encumbrance to him  better obliterate her as much as possible  he showed a more manly anger now but would not agree  she on her side was more persistent and he had doubts whether she could be trusted in his absence  but by indignation and contempt for her taste he completely maintained his ascendency and finally taking her before a little cross and altar that he had erected in his bedroom for his private devotions there bade her kneel and swear that she would not wed samuel hobson without his consent  i owe this to my father he said  the poor woman swore thinking he would soften as soon as he was ordained and in full swing of clerical work  but he did not  his education had by this time sufficiently ousted his humanity to keep him quite firm though his mother might have led an idyllic life with her faithful fruiterer and greengrocer and nobody have been anything the worse in the world  her lameness became more confirmed as time went on and she seldom or never left the house in the long southern thoroughfare where she seemed to be pining her heart away  why maynt i say to sam that ill marry him  why maynt i she would murmur plaintively to herself when nobody was near  some four years after this date a middleaged man was standing at the door of the largest fruiterers shop in aldbrickham  he was the proprietor but today instead of his usual business attire he wore a neat suit of black and his window was partly shuttered  from the railwaystation a funeral procession was seen approaching it passed his door and went out of the town towards the village of gaymead  the man whose eyes were wet held his hat in his hand as the vehicles moved by while from the mourning coach a young smoothshaven priest in a high waistcoat looked black as a cloud at the shop keeper standing there  december 1891     for conscience sake   chapter i   whether the utilitarian or the intuitive theory of the moral sense be upheld it is beyond question that there are a few subtlesouled persons with whom the absolute gratuitousness of an act of reparation is an inducement to perform it while exhortation as to its necessity would breed excuses for leaving it undone  the case of mr millborne and mrs frankland particularly illustrated this and perhaps something more  there were few figures better known to the local crossingsweeper than mr millbornes in his daily comings and goings along a familiar and quiet london street where he lived inside the door marked eleven though not as householder  in age he was fifty at least and his habits were as regular as those of a person can be who has no occupation but the study of how to keep himself employed  he turned almost always to the right on getting to the end of his street then he went onward down bond street to his club whence he returned by precisely the same course about six oclock on foot or if he went to dine later on in a cab  he was known to be a man of some means though apparently not wealthy  being a bachelor he seemed to prefer his present mode of living as a lodger in mrs towneys best rooms with the use of furniture which he had bought ten times over in rent during his tenancy to having a house of his own  none among his acquaintance tried to know him well for his manner and moods did not excite curiosity or deep friendship  he was not a man who seemed to have anything on his mind anything to conceal anything to impart  from his casual remarks it was generally understood that he was countryborn a native of some place in wessex that he had come to london as a young man in a bankinghouse and had risen to a post of responsibility when by the death of his father who had been fortunate in his investments the son succeeded to an income which led him to retire from a business life somewhat early  one evening when he had been unwell for several days doctor bindon came in after dinner from the adjoining medical quarter and smoked with him over the fire  the patients ailment was not such as to require much thought and they talked together on indifferent subjects  i am a lonely man bindona lonely man millborne took occasion to say shaking his head gloomily  you dont know such loneliness as mine    and the older i get the more i am dissatisfied with myself  and to day i have been through an accident more than usually haunted by what above all other events of my life causes that dissatisfactionthe recollection of an unfulfilled promise made twenty years ago  in ordinary affairs i have always been considered a man of my word and perhaps it is on that account that a particular vow i once made and did not keep comes back to me with a magnitude out of all proportion i daresay to its real gravity especially at this time of day  you know the discomfort caused at night by the halfsleeping sense that a door or window has been left unfastened or in the day by the remembrance of unanswered letters  so does that promise haunt me from time to time and has done today particularly  there was a pause and they smoked on  millbornes eyes though fixed on the fire were really regarding attentively a town in the west of england  yes he continued i have never quite forgotten it though during the busy years of my life it was shelved and buried under the pressure of my pursuits  and as i say today in particular an incident in the law report of a somewhat similar kind has brought it back again vividly however what it was i can tell you in a few words though no doubt you as a man of the world will smile at the thinness of my skin when you hear it    i came up to town at oneandtwenty from toneborough in outer wessex where i was born and where before i left i had won the heart of a young woman of my own age  i promised her marriage took advantage of my promise andam a bachelor  the old story  the other nodded  i left the place and thought at the time i had done a very clever thing in getting so easily out of an entanglement  but i have lived long enough for that promise to return to bother meto be honest not altogether as a pricking of the conscience but as a dissatisfaction with myself as a specimen of the heap of flesh called humanity  if i were to ask you to lend me fifty pounds which i would repay you next midsummer and i did not repay you i should consider myself a shabby sort of fellow especially if you wanted the money badly  yet i promised that girl just as distinctly and then coolly broke my word as if doing so were rather smart conduct than a mean action for which the poor victim herself encumbered with a child and not i had really to pay the penalty in spite of certain pecuniary aid that was given  there thats the retrospective trouble that i am always unearthing and you may hardly believe that though so many years have elapsed and it is all gone by and done with and she must be getting on for an old woman now as i am for an old man it really often destroys my sense of selfrespect still  o i can understand it  all depends upon the temperament  thousands of men would have forgotten all about it so would you perhaps if you had married and had a family  did she ever marry  i dont think so  o noshe never did  she left toneborough and later on appeared under another name at exonbury in the next county where she was not known  it is very seldom that i go down into that part of the country but in passing through exonbury on one occasion i learnt that she was quite a settled resident there as a teacher of music or something of the kind  that much i casually heard when i was there two or three years ago  but i have never set eyes on her since our original acquaintance and should not know her if i met her  did the child live asked the doctor  for several years certainly replied his friend  i cannot say if she is living now  it was a little girl  she might be married by this time as far as years go  and the motherwas she a decent worthy young woman  o yes a sensible quiet girl neither attractive nor unattractive to the ordinary observer simply commonplace  her position at the time of our acquaintance was not so good as mine  my father was a solicitor as i think i have told you  she was a young girl in a musicshop and it was represented to me that it would be beneath my position to marry her hence the result  well all i can say is that after twenty years it is probably too late to think of mending such a matter  it has doubtless by this time mended itself  you had better dismiss it from your mind as an evil past your control  of course if mother and daughter are alive or either you might settle something upon them if you were inclined and had it to spare  well i havent much to spare and i have relations in narrow circumstancesperhaps narrower than theirs  but that is not the point were i ever so rich i feel i could not rectify the past by money  i did not promise to enrich her  on the contrary i told her it would probably be dire poverty for both of us  but i did promise to make her my wife  then find her and do it said the doctor jocularly as he rose to leave  ah bindon  that of course is the obvious jest  but i havent the slightest desire for marriage i am quite content to live as i have lived  i am a bachelor by nature and instinct and habit and everything  besides though i respect her still for she was not an atom to blame i havent any shadow of love for her  in my mind she exists as one of those women you think well of but find uninteresting  it would be purely with the idea of putting wrong right that i should hunt her up and propose to do it offhand  you dont think of it seriously said his surprised friend  i sometimes think that i would if it were practicable simply as i say to recover my sense of being a man of honour  i wish you luck in the enterprise said doctor bindon  youll soon be out of that chair and then you can put your impulse to the test butafter twenty years of silencei should say dont    chapter ii   the doctors advice remained counterpoised in millbornes mind by the aforesaid mood of seriousness and sense of principle approximating often to religious sentiment which had been evolving itself in his breast for months and even years  the feeling however had no immediate effect upon mr millbornes actions  he soon got over his trifling illness and was vexed with himself for having in a moment of impulse confided such a case of conscience to anybody  but the force which had prompted it though latent remained with him and ultimately grew stronger  the upshot was that about four months after the date of his illness and disclosure millborne found himself on a mild spring morning at paddington station in a train that was starting for the west  his many intermittent thoughts on his broken promise from time to time in those hours when loneliness brought him face to face with his own personality had at last resulted in this course  the decisive stimulus had been given when a day or two earlier on looking into a postoffice directory he learnt that the woman he had not met for twenty years was still living on at exonbury under the name she had assumed when a year or two after her disappearance from her native town and his she had returned from abroad as a young widow with a child and taken up her residence at the former city  her condition was apparently but little changed and her daughter seemed to be with her their names standing in the directory as mrs leonora frankland and miss frankland teachers of music and dancing  mr millborne reached exonbury in the afternoon and his first business before even taking his luggage into the town was to find the house occupied by the teachers  standing in a central and open place it was not difficult to discover a wellburnished brass doorplate bearing their names prominently  he hesitated to enter without further knowledge and ultimately took lodgings over a toyshop opposite securing a sittingroom which faced a similar drawing or sittingroom at the franklands where the dancing lessons were given  installed here he was enabled to make indirectly and without suspicion inquiries and observations on the character of the ladies over the way which he did with much deliberateness  he learnt that the widow mrs frankland with her one daughter frances was of cheerful and excellent repute energetic and painstaking with her pupils of whom she had a good many and in whose tuition her daughter assisted her  she was quite a recognized townswoman and though the dancing branch of her profession was perhaps a trifle worldly she was really a seriousminded lady who being obliged to live by what she knew how to teach balanced matters by lending a hand at charitable bazaars assisting at sacred concerts and giving musical recitations in aid of funds for bewildering happy savages and other such enthusiasms of this enlightened country  her daughter was one of the foremost of the bevy of young women who decorated the churches at easter and christmas was organist in one of those edifices and had subscribed to the testimonial of a silver brothbasin that was presented to the reverend mr walker as a token of gratitude for his faithful and arduous intonations of six months as subprecentor in the cathedral  altogether mother and daughter appeared to be a typical and innocent pair among the genteel citizens of exonbury  as a natural and simple way of advertising their profession they allowed the windows of the musicroom to be a little open so that you had the pleasure of hearing all along the street at any hour between sunrise and sunset fragmentary gems of classical music as interpreted by the young people of twelve or fourteen who took lessons there  but it was said that mrs frankland made most of her income by letting out pianos on hire and by selling them as agent for the makers  the report pleased millborne it was highly creditable and far better than he had hoped  he was curious to get a view of the two women who led such blameless lives  he had not long to wait to gain a glimpse of leonora  it was when she was standing on her own doorstep opening her parasol on the morning after his arrival  she was thin though not gaunt and a good wellwearing thoughtful face had taken the place of the one which had temporarily attracted him in the days of his nonage  she wore black and it became her in her character of widow  the daughter next appeared she was a smoothed and rounded copy of her mother with the same decision in her mien that leonora had and a bounding gait in which he traced a faint resemblance to his own at her age  for the first time he absolutely made up his mind to call on them  but his antecedent step was to send leonora a note the next morning stating his proposal to visit her and suggesting the evening as the time because she seemed to be so greatly occupied in her professional capacity during the day  he purposely worded his note in such a form as not to require an answer from her which would be possibly awkward to write  no answer came  naturally he should not have been surprised at this and yet he felt a little checked even though she had only refrained from volunteering a reply that was not demanded  at eight the hour fixed by himself he crossed over and was passively admitted by the servant  mrs frankland as she called herself received him in the large musicanddancing room on the firstfloor front and not in any private little parlour as he had expected  this cast a distressingly businesslike colour over their first meeting after so many years of severance  the woman he had wronged stood before him welldressed even to his metropolitan eyes and her manner as she came up to him was dignified even to hardness  she certainly was not glad to see him  but what could he expect after a neglect of twenty years  how do you do mr millborne she said cheerfully as to any chance caller  i am obliged to receive you here because my daughter has a friend downstairs  your daughterand mine  ahyes yes she replied hastily as if the addition had escaped her memory  but perhaps the less said about that the better in fairness to me  you will consider me a widow please  certainly leonora      he could not get on her manner was so cold and indifferent  the expected scene of sad reproach subdued to delicacy by the run of years was absent altogether  he was obliged to come to the point without preamble  you are quite free leonorai mean as to marriage  there is nobody who has your promise or  o yes quite free mr millborne she said somewhat surprised  then i will tell you why i have come  twenty years ago i promised to make you my wife and i am here to fulfil that promise  heaven forgive my tardiness  her surprise was increased but she was not agitated  she seemed to become gloomy disapproving  i could not entertain such an idea at this time of life she said after a moment or two  it would complicate matters too greatly  i have a very fair income and require no help of any sort  i have no wish to marry    what could have induced you to come on such an errand now  it seems quite extraordinary if i may say so  it musti daresay it does millborne replied vaguely and i must tell you that impulsei mean in the sense of passionhas little to do with it  i wish to marry you leonora i much desire to marry you  but it is an affair of conscience a case of fulfilment  i promised you and it was dishonourable of me to go away  i want to remove that sense of dishonour before i die  no doubt we might get to love each other as warmly as we did in old times  she dubiously shook her head  i appreciate your motives mr millborne but you must consider my position and you will see that short of the personal wish to marry which i dont feel there is no reason why i should change my state even though by so doing i should ease your conscience  my position in this town is a respected one i have built it up by my own hard labours and in short i dont wish to alter it  my daughter too is just on the verge of an engagement to be married to a young man who will make her an excellent husband  it will be in every way a desirable match for her  he is downstairs now  does she knowanything about me  o no no god forbid  her father is dead and buried to her  so that you see things are going on smoothly and i dont want to disturb their progress  he nodded  very well he said and rose to go  at the door however he came back again  still leonora he urged i have come on purpose and i dont see what disturbance would be caused  you would simply marry an old friend  wont you reconsider  it is no more than right that we should be united remembering the girl  she shook her head and patted with her foot nervously  well i wont detain you he added  i shall not be leaving exonbury yet  you will allow me to see you again  yes i dont mind she said reluctantly  the obstacles he had encountered though they did not reanimate his dead passion for leonora did certainly make it appear indispensable to his peace of mind to overcome her coldness  he called frequently  the first meeting with the daughter was a trying ordeal though he did not feel drawn towards her as he had expected to be she did not excite his sympathies  her mother confided to frances the errand of her old friend which was viewed by the daughter with strong disfavour  his desire being thus uncongenial to both for a long time millborne made not the least impression upon mrs frankland  his attentions pestered her rather than pleased her  he was surprised at her firmness and it was only when he hinted at moral reasons for their union that she was ever shaken  strictly speaking he would say we ought as honest persons to marry and thats the truth of it leonora  i have looked at it in that light she said quickly  it struck me at the very first  but i dont see the force of the argument  i totally deny that after this interval of time i am bound to marry you for honours sake  i would have married you as you know well enough at the proper time  but what is the use of remedies now  they were standing at the window  a scantlywhiskered young man in clerical attire called at the door below  leonora flushed with interest  who is he said mr millborne  my francess lover  i am so sorryshe is not at home  ah they have told him where she is and he has gone to find her    i hope that suit will prosper at any rate  why shouldnt it  well he cannot marry yet and frances sees but little of him now he has left exonbury  he was formerly doing duty here but now he is curate of st johns ivell fifty miles up the line  there is a tacit agreement between them butthere have been friends of his who object because of our vocation  however he sees the absurdity of such an objection as that and is not influenced by it  your marriage with me would help the match instead of hindering it as you have said  do you think it would  it certainly would by taking you out of this business altogether  by chance he had found the way to move her somewhat and he followed it up  this view was imparted to mrs franklands daughter and it led her to soften her opposition  millborne who had given up his lodging in exonbury journeyed to and fro regularly till at last he overcame her negations and she expressed a reluctant assent  they were married at the nearest church and the goodwillwhatever that wasof the musicanddancing connection was sold to a successor only too ready to jump into the place the millbornes having decided to live in london    chapter iii   millborne was a householder in his old district though not in his old street and mrs millborne and their daughter had turned themselves into londoners  frances was well reconciled to the removal by her lovers satisfaction at the change  it suited him better to travel from ivell a hundred miles to see her in london where he frequently had other engagements than fifty in the opposite direction where nothing but herself required his presence  so here they were furnished up to the attics in one of the small but popular streets of the west district in a house whose front till lately of the complexion of a chimneysweep had been scraped to show to the surprised wayfarer the bright yellow and red brick that had lain lurking beneath the soot of fifty years  the social lift that the two women had derived from the alliance was considerable but when the exhilaration which accompanies a first residence in london the sensation of standing on a pivot of the world had passed their lives promised to be somewhat duller than when at despised exonbury they had enjoyed a nodding acquaintance with three fourths of the town  mr millborne did not criticise his wife he could not  whatever defects of hardness and acidity his original treatment and the lapse of years might have developed in her his sense of a realized idea of a reestablished selfsatisfaction was always thrown into the scale on her side and outweighed all objections  it was about a month after their settlement in town that the household decided to spend a week at a wateringplace in the isle of wight and while there the reverend percival cope the young curate aforesaid came to see them frances in particular  no formal engagement of the young pair had been announced as yet but it was clear that their mutual understanding could not end in anything but marriage without grievous disappointment to one of the parties at least  not that frances was sentimental  she was rather of the imperious sort indeed and to say all the young girl had not fulfilled her fathers expectations of her but he hoped and worked for her welfare as sincerely as any father could do  mr cope was introduced to the new head of the family and stayed with them in the island two or three days  on the last day of his visit they decided to venture on a two hours sail in one of the small yachts which lay there for hire  the trip had not progressed far before all except the curate found that sailing in a breeze did not quite agree with them but as he seemed to enjoy the experience the other three bore their condition as well as they could without grimace or complaint till the young man observing their discomfort gave immediate directions to tack about  on the way back to port they sat silent facing each other  nausea in such circumstances like midnight watching fatigue trouble fright has this marked effect upon the countenance that it often brings out strongly the divergences of the individual from the norm of his race accentuating superficial peculiarities to radical distinctions unexpected physiognomies will uncover themselves at these times in well known faces the aspect becomes invested with the spectral presence of entombed and forgotten ancestors and family lineaments of special or exclusive cast which in ordinary moments are masked by a stereotyped expression and mien start up with crude insistence to the view  frances sitting beside her mothers husband with mr cope opposite was naturally enough much regarded by the curate during the tedious sail home at first with sympathetic smiles  then as the middleaged father and his child grew each grayfaced as the pretty blush of frances disintegrated into spotty stains and the soft rotundities of her features diverged from their familiar and reposeful beauty into elemental lines cope was gradually struck with the resemblance between a pair in their discomfort who in their ease presented nothing to the eye in common  mr millborne and frances in their indisposition were strangely startlingly alike  the inexplicable fact absorbed copes attention quite  he forgot to smile at frances to hold her hand and when they touched the shore he remained sitting for some moments like a man in a trance  as they went homeward and recovered their complexions and contours the similarities one by one disappeared and frances and mr millborne were again masked by the commonplace differences of sex and age  it was as if during the voyage a mysterious veil had been lifted temporarily revealing a strange pantomime of the past  during the evening he said to her casually is your stepfather a cousin of your mother dear frances  oh no said she  there is no relationship  he was only an old friend of hers  why did you suppose such a thing  he did not explain and the next morning started to resume his duties at ivell  cope was an honest young fellow and shrewd withal  at home in his quiet rooms in st peters street ivell he pondered long and unpleasantly on the revelations of the cruise  the tale it told was distinct enough and for the first time his position was an uncomfortable one  he had met the franklands at exonbury as parishioners had been attracted by frances and had floated thus far into an engagement which was indefinite only because of his inability to marry just yet  the franklands past had apparently contained mysteries and it did not coincide with his judgment to marry into a family whose mystery was of the sort suggested  so he sat and sighed between his reluctance to lose frances and his natural dislike of forming a connection with people whose antecedents would not bear the strictest investigation  a passionate lover of the oldfashioned sort might possibly never have halted to weigh these doubts but though he was in the church copes affections were fastidiousdistinctly tempered with the alloys of the centurys decadence  he delayed writing to frances for some while simply because he could not tune himself up to enthusiasm when worried by suspicions of such a kind  meanwhile the millbornes had returned to london and frances was growing anxious  in talking to her mother of cope she had innocently alluded to his curious inquiry if her mother and her stepfather were connected by any tie of cousinship  mrs millborne made her repeat the words  frances did so and watched with inquisitive eyes their effect upon her elder  what is there so startling in his inquiry then she asked  can it have anything to do with his not writing to me  her mother flinched but did not inform her and frances also was now drawn within the atmosphere of suspicion  that night when standing by chance outside the chamber of her parents she heard for the first time their voices engaged in a sharp altercation  the apple of discord had indeed been dropped into the house of the millbornes  the scene within the chamberdoor was mrs millborne standing before her dressingtable looking across to her husband in the dressingroom adjoining where he was sitting down his eyes fixed on the floor  why did you come and disturb my life a second time she harshly asked why did you pester me with your conscience till i was driven to accept you to get rid of your importunity  frances and i were doing well the one desire of my life was that she should marry that good young man  and now the match is broken off by your cruel interference  why did you show yourself in my world again and raise this scandal upon my hardwon respectabilitywon by such weary years of labour as none will ever know  she bent her face upon the table and wept passionately  there was no reply from mr millborne  frances lay awake nearly all that night and when at breakfasttime the next morning still no letter appeared from mr cope she entreated her mother to go to ivell and see if the young man were ill  mrs millborne went returning the same day  frances anxious and haggard met her at the station  was all well  her mother could not say it was though he was not ill  one thing she had found out that it was a mistake to hunt up a man when his inclinations were to hold aloof  returning with her mother in the cab frances insisted upon knowing what the mystery was which plainly had alienated her lover  the precise words which had been spoken at the interview with him that day at ivell mrs millborne could not be induced to repeat but thus far she admitted that the estrangement was fundamentally owing to mr millborne having sought her out and married her  and why did he seek you outand why were you obliged to marry him asked the distressed girl  then the evidences pieced themselves together in her acute mind and her colour gradually rising she asked her mother if what they pointed to was indeed the fact  her mother admitted that it was  a flush of mortification succeeded to the flush of shame upon the young womans face  how could a scrupulously correct clergyman and lover like mr cope ask her to be his wife after this discovery of her irregular birth  she covered her eyes with her hands in a silent despair  in the presence of mr millborne they at first suppressed their anguish but by and by their feelings got the better of them and when he was asleep in his chair after dinner mrs millbornes irritation broke out the embittered frances joined her in reproaching the man who had come as the spectre to their intended feast of hymen and turned its promise to ghastly failure  why were you so weak mother as to admit such an enemy to your houseone so obviously your evil geniusmuch less accept him as a husband after so long  if you had only told me all i could have advised you better  but i suppose i have no right to reproach him bitter as i feel and even though he has blighted my life for ever  frances i did hold out i saw it was a mistake to have any more to say to a man who had been such an unmitigated curse to me  but he would not listen he kept on about his conscience and mine till i was bewildered and said yes    bringing us away from a quiet town where we were known and respectedwhat an illconsidered thing it was  o the content of those days  we had society there people in our own position who did not expect more of us than we expected of them  here where there is so much there is nothing  he said london society was so bright and brilliant that it would be like a new world  it may be to those who are in it but what is that to us two lonely women we only see it flashing past    o the fool the fool that i was  now millborne was not so soundly asleep as to prevent his hearing these animadversions that were almost execrations and many more of the same sort  as there was no peace for him at home he went again to his club where since his reunion with leonora he had seldom if ever been seen but the shadow of the troubles in his household interfered with his comfort here also he could not as formerly settle down into his favourite chair with the evening paper reposeful in the celibates sense that where he was his worlds centre had its fixture  his world was now an ellipse with a dual centrality of which his own was not the major  the young curate of ivell still held aloof tantalizing frances by his elusiveness  plainly he was waiting upon events  millborne bore the reproaches of his wife and daughter almost in silence but by degrees he grew meditative as if revolving a new idea  the bitter cry about blighting their existence at length became so impassioned that one day millborne calmly proposed to return again to the country not necessarily to exonbury but if they were willing to a little old manorhouse which he had found was to be let standing a mile from mr copes town of ivell  they were surprised and despite their view of him as the bringer of ill were disposed to accede  though i suppose said mrs millborne to him it will end in mr copes asking you flatly about the past and your being compelled to tell him which may dash all my hopes for frances  she gets more and more like you every day particularly when she is in a bad temper  people will see you together and notice it and i dont know what may come of it  i dont think they will see us together he said but he entered into no argument when she insisted otherwise  the removal was eventually resolved on the townhouse was disposed of and again came the invasion by furnituremen and vans till all the movables and servants were whisked away  he sent his wife and daughter to an hotel while this was going on taking two or three journeys himself to ivell to superintend the refixing and the improvement of the grounds  when all was done he returned to them in town  the house was ready for their reception he told them and there only remained the journey  he accompanied them and their personal luggage to the station only having he said to remain in town a short time on business with his lawyer  they went dubious and discontentedfor the muchloved cope had made no sign  if we were going down to live here alone said mrs millborne to her daughter in the train and there was no intrusive telltale presence    but let it be  the house was a lovely little place in a grove of elms and they liked it much  the first person to call upon them as new residents was mr cope he was delighted to find that they had come so near and though he did not say this meant to live in such excellent style  he had not however resumed the manner of a lover  your father spoils all murmured mrs millborne  but three days later she received a letter from her husband which caused her no small degree of astonishment  it was written from boulogne  it began with a long explanation of settlements of his property in which he had been engaged since their departure  the chief feature in the business was that mrs millborne found herself the absolute owner of a comfortable sum in personal estate and frances of a lifeinterest in a larger sum the principal to be afterwards divided amongst her children if she had any  the remainder of his letter ran as hereunder     i have learnt that there are some derelictions of duty which cannot    be blotted out by tardy accomplishment  our evil actions do not    remain isolated in the past waiting only to be reversed like    locomotive plants they spread and reroot till to destroy the    original stem has no material effect in killing them  i made a    mistake in searching you out i admit it whatever the remedy may be    in such cases it is not marriage and the best thing for you and me is    that you do not see me more  you had better not seek me for you will    not be likely to find me you are well provided for and we may do    ourselves more harm than good by meeting again     f m  millborne in short disappeared from that day forward  but a searching inquiry would have revealed that soon after the millbornes went to ivell an englishman who did not give the name of millborne took up his residence in brussels a man who might have been recognized by mrs millborne if she had met him  one afternoon in the ensuing summer when this gentleman was looking over the english papers he saw the announcement of miss frances franklands marriage  she had become the reverend mrs cope  thank god said the gentleman  but his momentary satisfaction was far from being happiness  as he formerly had been weighted with a bad conscience so now was he burdened with the heavy thought which oppressed antigone that by honourable observance of a rite he had obtained for himself the reward of dishonourable laxity  occasionally he had to be helped to his lodgings by his servant from the cercle he frequented through having imbibed a little too much liquor to be able to take care of himself  but he was harmless and even when he had been drinking said little  march 1891     a tragedy of two ambitions   chapter i   the shouts of the villageboys came in at the window accompanied by broken laughter from loungers at the inndoor but the brothers halborough worked on  they were sitting in a bedroom of the mastermillwrights house engaged in the untutored reading of greek and latin  it was no tale of homeric blows and knocks argonautic voyaging or theban family woe that inflamed their imaginations and spurred them onward  they were plodding away at the greek testament immersed in a chapter of the idiomatic and difficult epistle to the hebrews  the dogday sun in its decline reached the low ceiling with slanting sides and the shadows of the great goatswillow swayed and interchanged upon the walls like a spectral army manoeuvring  the open casement which admitted the remoter sounds now brought the voice of some one close at hand  it was their sister a pretty girl of fourteen who stood in the court below  i can see the tops of your heads  whats the use of staying up there  i like you not to go out with the streetboys but do come and play with me  they treated her as an inadequate interlocutor and put her off with some slight word  she went away disappointed  presently there was a dull noise of heavy footsteps at the side of the house and one of the brothers sat up  i fancy i hear him coming he murmured his eyes on the window  a man in the light drab clothes of an oldfashioned country tradesman approached from round the corner reeling as he came  the elder son flushed with anger rose from his books and descended the stairs  the younger sat on till after the lapse of a few minutes his brother re entered the room  did rosa see him  no  nor anybody  no  what have you done with him  hes in the strawshed  i got him in with some trouble and he has fallen asleep  i thought this would be the explanation of his absence no stones dressed for miller kench the great wheel of the sawmills waiting for new floatboards even the poor folk not able to get their waggons wheeled  what is the use of poring over this said the younger shutting up donnegans lexicon with a slap  o if we had only been able to keep mothers nine hundred pounds what we could have done  how well she had estimated the sum necessary  four hundred and fifty each she thought  and i have no doubt that we could have done it on that with care  this loss of the nine hundred pounds was the sharp thorn of their crown it was a sum which their mother had amassed with great exertion and self denial by adding to a chance legacy such other small amounts as she could lay hands on from time to time and she had intended with the hoard to indulge the dear wish of her heartthat of sending her sons joshua and cornelius to one of the universities having been informed that from four hundred to four hundred and fifty each might carry them through their terms with such great economy as she knew she could trust them to practise  but she had died a year or two before this time worn out by too keen a strain towards these ends and the money coming unreservedly into the hands of their father had been nearly dissipated  with its exhaustion went all opportunity and hope of a university degree for the sons  it drives me mad when i think of it said joshua the elder  and here we work and work in our own bungling way and the utmost we can hope for is a term of years as national schoolmasters and possible admission to a theological college and ordination as despised licentiates  the anger of the elder was reflected as simple sadness in the face of the other  we can preach the gospel as well without a hood on our surplices as with one he said with feeble consolation  preach the gospeltrue said joshua with a slight pursing of mouth but we cant rise  let us make the best of it and grind on  the other was silent and they drearily bent over their books again  the cause of all this gloom the millwright halborough now snoring in the shed had been a thriving mastermachinist notwithstanding his free and careless disposition till a taste for a more than adequate quantity of strong liquor took hold of him since when his habits had interfered with his business sadly  already millers went elsewhere for their gear and only one set of hands was now kept going though there were formerly two  already he found a difficulty in meeting his men at the weeks end and though they had been reduced in number there was barely enough work to do for those who remained  the sun dropped lower and vanished the shouts of the village children ceased to resound darkness cloaked the students bedroom and all the scene outwardly breathed peace  none knew of the fevered youthful ambitions that throbbed in two breasts within the quiet creepercovered walls of the millwrights house  in a few months the brothers left the village of their birth to enter themselves as students in a training college for schoolmasters first having placed their young sister rosa under as efficient a tuition at a fashionable wateringplace as the means at their disposal could command    chapter ii   a man in semiclerical dress was walking along the road which led from the railwaystation into a provincial town  as he walked he read persistently only looking up once now and then to see that he was keeping on the foot track and to avoid other passengers  at those moments whoever had known the former students at the millwrights would have perceived that one of them joshua halborough was the peripatetic reader here  what had been simple force in the youths face was energized judgment in the mans  his character was gradually writing itself out in his countenance  that he was watching his own career with deeper and deeper interest that he continually heard his days before him and cared to hear little else might have been hazarded from what was seen there  his ambitions were in truth passionate yet controlled so that the germs of many more plans than ever blossomed to maturity had place in him and forward visions were kept purposely in twilight to avoid distraction  events so far had been encouraging  shortly after assuming the mastership of his first school he had obtained an introduction to the bishop of a diocese far from his native county who had looked upon him as a promising young man and taken him in hand  he was now in the second year of his residence at the theological college of the cathedraltown and would soon be presented for ordination  he entered the town turned into a back street and then into a yard keeping his book before him till he set foot under the arch of the latter place  round the arch was written national school and the stonework of the jambs was worn away as nothing but boys and the waves of ocean will wear it  he was soon amid the singsong accents of the scholars  his brother cornelius who was the schoolmaster here laid down the pointer with which he was directing attention to the capes of europe and came forward  thats his brother jos whispered one of the sixth standard boys  hes going to be a pason hes now at college  corney is going to be one too when hes saved enough money said another  after greeting his brother whom he had not seen for several months the junior began to explain his system of teaching geography  but halborough the elder took no interest in the subject  how about your own studies he asked  did you get the books i sent  cornelius had received them and he related what he was doing  mind you work in the morning  what time do you get up  the younger replied halfpast five  halfpast four is not a minute too soon this time of the year  there is no time like the morning for construing  i dont know why but when i feel even too dreary to read a novel i can translatethere is something mechanical about it i suppose  now cornelius you are rather behindhand and have some heavy reading before you if you mean to get out of this next christmas  i am afraid i have  we must soon sound the bishop  i am sure you will get a title without difficulty when he has heard all  the subdean the principal of my college says that the best plan will be for you to come there when his lordship is present at an examination and hell get you a personal interview with him  mind you make a good impression upon him  i found in my case that that was everything and doctrine almost nothing  youll do for a deacon corney if not for a priest  the younger remained thoughtful  have you heard from rosa lately he asked i had a letter this morning  yes  the little minx writes rather too often  she is homesickthough brussels must be an attractive place enough  but she must make the most of her time over there  i thought a year would be enough for her after that highclass school at sandbourne but i have decided to give her two and make a good job of it expensive as the establishment is  their two rather harsh faces had softened directly they began to speak of their sister whom they loved more ambitiously than they loved themselves  but where is the money to come from joshua  i have already got it  he looked round and finding that some boys were near withdrew a few steps  i have borrowed it at five per cent from the farmer who used to occupy the farm next our field  you remember him  but about paying him  i shall pay him by degrees out of my stipend  no cornelius it was no use to do the thing by halves  she promises to be a most attractive not to say beautiful girl  i have seen that for years and if her face is not her fortune her face and her brains together will be if i observe and contrive aright  that she should be every inch of her an accomplished and refined woman was indispensable for the fulfilment of her destiny and for moving onwards and upwards with us and shell do it you will see  id half starve myself rather than take her away from that school now  they looked round the school they were in  to cornelius it was natural and familiar enough but to joshua with his limited human sympathies who had just dropped in from a superior sort of place the sight jarred unpleasantly as being that of something he had left behind  i shall be glad when you are out of this he said and in your pulpit and well through your first sermon  you may as well say inducted into my fat living while you are about it  ah welldont think lightly of the church  theres a fine work for any man of energy in the church as youll find he said fervidly torrents of infidelity to be stemmed new views of old subjects to be expounded truths in spirit to be substituted for truths in the letter      he lapsed into reverie with the vision of his career persuading himself that it was ardour for christianity which spurred him on and not pride of place  he had shouldered a body of doctrine and was prepared to defend it tooth and nail solely for the honour and glory that warriors win  if the church is elastic and stretches to the shape of the time shell last i suppose said cornelius  if not  only think i bought a copy of paleys evidences best edition broad margins excellent preservation at a bookstall the other day forninepence and i thought that at this rate christianity must be in rather a bad way  no no said the other almost angrily  it only shows that such defences are no longer necessary  mens eyes can see the truth without extraneous assistance  besides we are in for christianity and must stick to her whether or no  i am just now going right through puseys library of the fathers  youll be a bishop joshua before you have done  ah said the other bitterly shaking his head  perhaps i might have beeni might have been  but where is my dd or lld and how be a bishop without that kind of appendage  archbishop tillotson was the son of a sowerby clothier but he was sent to clare college  to hail oxford or cambridge as alma mater is not for mefor us  my god when i think of what we should have beenwhat fair promise has been blighted by that cursed worthless  hush hush    but i feel it too as much as you  i have seen it more forcibly lately  you would have obtained your degree long before this timepossibly fellowshipand i should have been on my way to mine  dont talk of it said the other  we must do the best we can  they looked out of the window sadly through the dusty panes so high up that only the sky was visible  by degrees the haunting trouble loomed again and cornelius broke the silence with a whisper he has called on me  the living pulses died on joshuas face which grew arid as a clinker when was that he asked quickly  last week  how did he get hereso many miles  came by railway  he came to ask for money  ah  he says he will call on you  joshua replied resignedly  the theme of their conversation spoilt his buoyancy for that afternoon  he returned in the evening cornelius accompanying him to the station but he did not read in the train which took him back to the fountall theological college as he had done on the way out  that ineradicable trouble still remained as a squalid spot in the expanse of his life  he sat with the other students in the cathedral choir next day and the recollection of the trouble obscured the purple splendour thrown by the panes upon the floor  it was afternoon  all was as still in the close as a cathedralgreen can be between the sunday services and the incessant cawing of the rooks was the only sound  joshua halborough had finished his ascetic lunch and had gone into the library where he stood for a few moments looking out of the large window facing the green  he saw walking slowly across it a man in a fustian coat and a battered white hat with a muchruffled nap having upon his arm a tall gipsywoman wearing long brass earrings  the man was staring quizzically at the west front of the cathedral and halborough recognized in him the form and features of his father  who the woman was he knew not  almost as soon as joshua became conscious of these things the subdean who was also the principal of the college and of whom the young man stood in more awe than of the bishop himself emerged from the gate and entered a path across the close  the pair met the dignitary and to joshuas horror his father turned and addressed the subdean  what passed between them he could not tell  but as he stood in a cold sweat he saw his father place his hand familiarly on the subdeans shoulder the shrinking response of the latter and his quick withdrawal told his feeling  the woman seemed to say nothing but when the subdean had passed by they came on towards the college gate  halborough flew along the corridor and out at a side door so as to intercept them before they could reach the front entrance for which they were making  he caught them behind a clump of laurel  by jerry heres the very chap  well youre a fine fellow jos never to send your father as much as a twist o baccy on such an occasion and to leave him to travel all these miles to find ye out  first who is this said joshua halborough with pale dignity waving his hand towards the buxom woman with the great earrings  dammy the misess  your stepmother  didnt you know id married  she helped me home from market one night and we came to terms and struck the bargain  didnt we selinar  oi by the great lord an we did simpered the lady  well what sort of a place is this you are living in asked the millwright  a kind of houseofcorrection apparently  joshua listened abstractedly his features set to resignation  sick at heart he was going to ask them if they were in want of any necessary any meal when his father cut him short by saying why weve called to ask ye to come round and take potluck with us at the cockandbottle where weve put up for the day on our way to see misesss friends at binegar fair where theyll be lying under canvas for a night or two  as for the victuals at the cock i cant testify to em at all but for the drink theyve the rarest drop of old tom that ive tasted for many a year  thanks but i am a teetotaller and i have lunched said joshua who could fully believe his fathers testimony to the gin from the odour of his breath  you see we have to observe regular habits here and i couldnt be seen at the cockandbottle just now  o dammy then dont come your reverence  perhaps you wont mind standing treat for those who can be seen there  not a penny said the younger firmly  youve had enough already  thank you for nothing  by the bye who was that spindlelegged shoe buckled parson feller we met by now  he seemed to think we should poison him  joshua remarked coldly that it was the principal of his college guardedly inquiring did you tell him whom you were come to see  his father did not reply  he and his strapping gipsy wifeif she were his wifestayed no longer and disappeared in the direction of the high street  joshua halborough went back to the library  determined as was his nature he wept hot tears upon the books and was immeasurably more wretched that afternoon than the unwelcome millwright  in the evening he sat down and wrote a letter to his brother in which after stating what had happened and expatiating upon this new disgrace in the gipsy wife he propounded a plan for raising money sufficient to induce the couple to emigrate to canada  it is our only chance he said  the case as it stands is maddening  for a successful painter sculptor musician author who takes society by storm it is no drawback it is sometimes even a romantic recommendation to hail from outcasts and profligates but for a clergyman of the church of england  cornelius it is fatal  to succeed in the church people must believe in you first of all as a gentleman secondly as a man of means thirdly as a scholar fourthly as a preacher fifthly perhaps as a christianbut always first as a gentleman with all their heart and soul and strength  i would have faced the fact of being a small machinists son and have taken my chance if hed been in any sense respectable and decent  the essence of christianity is humility and by the help of god i would have brazened it out  but this terrible vagabondage and disreputable connection  if he does not accept my terms and leave the country it will extinguish us and kill me  for how can we live and relinquish our high aim and bring down our dear sister rosa to the level of a gipsys stepdaughter    chapter iii   there was excitement in the parish of narrobourne one day  the congregation had just come out from morning service and the whole conversation was of the new curate mr halborough who had officiated for the first time in the absence of the rector  never before had the feeling of the villagers approached a level which could be called excitement on such a matter as this  the droning which had been the rule in that quiet old place for a century seemed ended at last  they repeated the text to each other as a refrain o lord be thou my helper  not within living memory till today had the subject of the sermon formed the topic of conversation from the church door to churchyard gate to the exclusion of personal remarks on those who had been present and on the weeks news in general  the thrilling periods of the preacher hung about their minds all that day  the parish being steeped in indifferentism it happened that when the youths and maidens middleaged and old people who had attended church that morning recurred as by a fascination to what halborough had said they did so more or less indirectly and even with the subterfuge of a light laugh that was not real so great was their shyness under the novelty of their sensations  what was more curious than that these unconventional villagers should have been excited by a preacher of a new school after forty years of familiarity with the old hand who had had charge of their souls was the effect of halboroughs address upon the occupants of the manorhouse pew including the owner of the estate  these thought they knew how to discount the mere sensational sermon how to minimize flash oratory to its bare proportions but they had yielded like the rest of the assembly to the charm of the newcomer  mr fellmer the landowner was a young widower whose mother still in the prime of life had returned to her old position in the family mansion since the death of her sons wife in the year after her marriage at the birth of a fragile little girl  from the date of his loss to the present time fellmer had led an inactive existence in the seclusion of the parish a lack of motive seemed to leave him listless  he had gladly reinstated his mother in the gloomy house and his main occupation now lay in stewarding his estate which was not large  mrs fellmer who had sat beside him under halborough this morning was a cheerful straightforward woman who did her marketing and her almsgiving in person was fond of oldfashioned flowers and walked about the village on very wet days visiting the parishioners  these the only two great ones of narrobourne were impressed by joshuas eloquence as much as the cottagers  halborough had been briefly introduced to them on his arrival some days before and their interest being kindled they waited a few moments till he came out of the vestry to walk down the churchyardpath with him mrs fellmer spoke warmly of the sermon of the good fortune of the parish in his advent and hoped he had found comfortable quarters  halborough faintly flushing said that he had obtained very fair lodgings in the roomy house of a farmer whom he named  she feared he would find it very lonely especially in the evenings and hoped they would see a good deal of him  when would he dine with them could he not come that dayit must be so dull for him the first sunday evening in country lodgings  halborough replied that it would give him much pleasure but that he feared he must decline  i am not altogether alone he said  my sister who has just returned from brussels and who felt as you do that i should be rather dismal by myself has accompanied me hither to stay a few days till she has put my rooms in order and set me going  she was too fatigued to come to church and is waiting for me now at the farm  oh but bring your sisterthat will be still better  i shall be delighted to know her  how i wish i had been aware  do tell her please that we had no idea of her presence  halborough assured mrs fellmer that he would certainly bear the message but as to her coming he was not so sure  the real truth was however that the matter would be decided by him rosa having an almost filial respect for his wishes  but he was uncertain as to the state of her wardrobe and had determined that she should not enter the manorhouse at a disadvantage that evening when there would probably be plenty of opportunities in the future of her doing so becomingly  he walked to the farm in long strides  this then was the outcome of his first mornings work as curate here  things had gone fairly well with him  he had been ordained he was in a comfortable parish where he would exercise almost sole supervision the rector being infirm  he had made a deep impression at starting and the absence of a hood seemed to have done him no harm  moreover by considerable persuasion and payment his father and the dark woman had been shipped off to canada where they were not likely to interfere greatly with his interests  rosa came out to meet him  ah you should have gone to church like a good girl he said  yesi wished i had afterwards  but i do so hate church as a rule that even your preaching was underestimated in my mind  it was too bad of me  the girl who spoke thus playfully was fair tall and sylphlike in a muslin dress and with just the coquettish desinvolture which an english girl brings home from abroad and loses again after a few months of native life  joshua was the reverse of playful the world was too important a concern for him to indulge in light moods  he told her in decided practical phraseology of the invitation  now rosa we must gothats settledif youve a dress that can be made fit to wear all on the hop like this  you didnt of course think of bringing an evening dress to such an outoftheway place  but rosa had come from the wrong city to be caught napping in those matters  yes i did said she  one never knows what may turn up  well done  then off we go at seven  the evening drew on and at dusk they started on foot rosa pulling up the edge of her skirt under her cloak out of the way of the dews so that it formed a great windbag all round her and carrying her satin shoes under her arm  joshua would not let her wait till she got indoors before changing them as she proposed but insisted on her performing that operation under a tree so that they might enter as if they had not walked  he was nervously formal about such trifles while rosa took the whole proceedingwalk dressing dinner and allas a pastime  to joshua it was a serious step in life  a more unexpected kind of person for a curates sister was never presented at a dinner  the surprise of mrs fellmer was unconcealed  she had looked forward to a dorcas or martha or rhoda at the outside and a shade of misgiving crossed her face  it was possible that had the young lady accompanied her brother to church there would have been no dining at narrobourne house that day  not so with the young widower her son  he resembled a sleeper who had awaked in a summer noon expecting to find it only dawn  he could scarcely help stretching his arms and yawning in their faces so strong was his sense of being suddenly aroused to an unforeseen thing  when they had sat down to table he at first talked to rosa somewhat with the air of a ruler in the land but the woman lurking in the acquaintance soon brought him to his level and the girl from brussels saw him looking at her mouth her hands her contour as if he could not quite comprehend how they got created then he dropped into the more satisfactory stage which discerns no particulars  he talked but little she said much  the homeliness of the fellmers to her view though they were regarded with such awe down here quite disembarrassed her  the squire had become so unpractised had dropped so far into the shade during the last year or so of his life that he had almost forgotten what the world contained till this evening reminded him his mother after her first moments of doubt appeared to think that he must be left to his own guidance and gave her attention to joshua  with all his foresight and doggedness of aim the result of that dinner exceeded halboroughs expectations  in weaving his ambitions he had viewed his sister rosa as a slight bright thing to be helped into notice by his abilities but it now began to dawn upon him that the physical gifts of nature to her might do more for them both than natures intellectual gifts to himself  while he was patiently boring the tunnel rosa seemed about to fly over the mountain  he wrote the next day to his brother now occupying his own old rooms in the theological college telling him exultingly of the unanticipated debut of rosa at the manorhouse  the next post brought him a reply of congratulation dashed with the counteracting intelligence that his father did not like canadathat his wife had deserted him which made him feel so dreary that he thought of returning home  in his recent satisfaction at his own successes joshua halborough had wellnigh forgotten his chronic troublelatterly screened by distance but it now returned upon him he saw more in this brief announcement than his brother seemed to see  it was the cloud no bigger than a mans hand    chapter iv   the following december a day or two before christmas mrs fellmer and her son were walking up and down the broad gravel path which bordered the east front of the house  till within the last halfhour the morning had been a drizzling one and they had just emerged for a short turn before luncheon  you see dear mother the son was saying it is the peculiarity of my position which makes her appear to me in such a desirable light  when you consider how i have been crippled at starting how my life has been maimed that i feel anything like publicity distasteful that i have ye no political ambition and that my chief aim and hope lie in the education of the little thing annie has left me you must see how desirable a wife like miss halborough would be to prevent my becoming a mere vegetable  if you adore her i suppose you must have her replied his mother with dry indirectness  but youll find that she will not be content to live on here as you do giving her whole mind to a young child  thats just where we differ  her very disqualification that of being a nobody as you call it is her recommendation in my eyes  her lack of influential connections limits her ambition  from what i know of her a life in this place is all that she would wish for  she would never care to go outside the parkgates if it were necessary to stay within  being in love with her albert and meaning to marry her you invent your practical reasons to make the case respectable  well do as you will i have no authority over you so why should you consult me  you mean to propose on this very occasion no doubt  dont you now  by no means  i am merely revolving the idea in my mind  if on further acquaintance she turns out to be as good as she has hitherto seemedwell i shall see  admit now that you like her  i readily admit it  she is very captivating at first sight  but as a stepmother to your child  you seem mighty anxious albert to get rid of me  not at all  and i am not so reckless as you think  i dont make up my mind in a hurry  but the thought having occurred to me i mention it to you at once mother  if you dislike it say so  i dont say anything  i will try to make the best of it if you are determined  when does she come  tomorrow  all this time there were great preparations in train at the curates who was now a householder  rosa whose two or three weeks stay on two occasions earlier in the year had so affected the squire was coming again and at the same time her younger brother cornelius to make up a family party  rosa who journeyed from the midlands could not arrive till late in the evening but cornelius was to get there in the afternoon joshua going out to meet him in his walk across the fields from the railway  everything being ready in joshuas modest abode he started on his way his heart buoyant and thankful if ever it was in his life  he was of such good report himself that his brothers path into holy orders promised to be unexpectedly easy and he longed to compare experiences with him even though there was on hand a more exciting matter still from his youth he had held that in oldfashioned country places the church conferred social prestige up to a certain point at a cheaper price than any other profession or pursuit and events seemed to be proving him right  he had walked about half an hour when he saw cornelius coming along the path and in a few minutes the two brothers met  the experiences of cornelius had been less immediately interesting than those of joshua but his personal position was satisfactory and there was nothing to account for the singularly subdued manner that he exhibited which at first joshua set down to the fatigue of overstudy and he proceeded to the subject of rosas arrival in the evening and the probable consequences of this her third visit  before next easter shell be his wife my boy said joshua with grave exultation  cornelius shook his head  she comes too late he returned  what do you mean  look here  he produced the fountall paper and placed his finger on a paragraph which joshua read  it appeared under the report of petty sessions and was a commonplace case of disorderly conduct in which a man was sent to prison for seven days for breaking windows in that town  well said joshua  it happened during an evening that i was in the street and the offender is our father  nothowi sent him more money on his promising to stay in canada  he is home safe enough  cornelius in the same gloomy tone gave the remainder of his information  he had witnessed the scene unobserved of his father and had heard him say that he was on his way to see his daughter who was going to marry a rich gentleman  the only good fortune attending the untoward incident was that the millwrights name had been printed as joshua alborough  beaten  we are to be beaten on the eve of our expected victory said the elder brother  how did he guess that rosa was likely to marry  good heaven cornelius you seem doomed to bring bad news always do you not  i do said cornelius  poor rosa  it was almost in tears so great was their heartsickness and shame that the brothers walked the remainder of the way to joshuas dwelling  in the evening they set out to meet rosa bringing her to the village in a fly and when she had come into the house and was sitting down with them they almost forgot their secret anxiety in contemplating her who knew nothing about it  next day the fellmers came and the two or three days after that were a lively time  that the squire was yielding to his impulsesmaking up his mindthere could be no doubt  on sunday cornelius read the lessons and joshua preached  mrs fellmer was quite maternal towards rosa and it appeared that she had decided to welcome the inevitable with a good grace  the pretty girl was to spend yet another afternoon with the elder lady superintending some parish treat at the house in observance of christmas and afterwards to stay on to dinner her brothers to fetch her in the evening  they were also invited to dine but they could not accept owing to an engagement  the engagement was of a sombre sort  they were going to meet their father who would that day be released from fountall gaol and try to persuade him to keep away from narrobourne  every exertion was to be made to get him back to canada to his old home in the midlandsanywhere so that he would not impinge disastrously upon their courses and blast their sisters prospects of the auspicious marriage which was just then hanging in the balance  as soon as rosa had been fetched away by her friends at the manorhouse her brothers started on their expedition without waiting for dinner or tea  cornelius to whom the millwright always addressed his letters when he wrote any drew from his pocket and reread as he walked the curt note which had led to this journey being undertaken it was despatched by their father the night before immediately upon his liberation and stated that he was setting out for narrobourne at the moment of writing that having no money he would be obliged to walk all the way that he calculated on passing through the intervening town of ivell about six on the following day where he should sup at the castle inn and where he hoped they would meet him with a carriageandpair or some other such conveyance that he might not disgrace them by arriving like a tramp  that sounds as if he gave a thought to our position said cornelius  joshua knew the satire that lurked in the paternal words and said nothing  silence prevailed during the greater part of their journey  the lamps were lighted in ivell when they entered the streets and cornelius who was quite unknown in this neighbourhood and who moreover was not in clerical attire decided that he should be the one to call at the castle inn  here in answer to his inquiry under the darkness of the archway they told him that such a man as he had described left the house about a quarter of an hour earlier after making a meal in the kitchen settle  he was rather the worse for liquor  then said joshua when cornelius joined him outside with this intelligence we must have met and passed him  and now that i think of it we did meet some one who was unsteady in his gait under the trees on the other side of hendford hill where it was too dark to see him  they rapidly retraced their steps but for a long stretch of the way home could discern nobody  when however they had gone about threequarters of the distance they became conscious of an irregular footfall in front of them and could see a whitish figure in the gloom  they followed dubiously  the figure met another wayfarerthe single one that had been encountered upon this lonely roadand they distinctly heard him ask the way to narrobourne  the stranger repliedwhat was quite truethat the nearest way was by turning in at the stile by the next bridge and following the footpath which branched thence across the meadows  when the brothers reached the stile they also entered the path but did not overtake the subject of their worry till they had crossed two or three meads and the lights from narrobourne manorhouse were visible before them through the trees  their father was no longer walking he was seated against the wet bank of an adjoining hedge  observing their forms he shouted im going to narrobourne who may you be  they went up to him and revealed themselves reminding him of the plan which he had himself proposed in his note that they should meet him at ivell  by jerry id forgot it he said  well what do you want me to do his tone was distinctly quarrelsome  a long conversation followed which became embittered at the first hint from them that he should not come to the village  the millwright drew a quart bottle from his pocket and challenged them to drink if they meant friendly and called themselves men  neither of the two had touched alcohol for years but for once they thought it best to accept so as not to needlessly provoke him  whats in it said joshua  a drop of weak ginandwater  it wont hurt ye  drin from the bottle  joshua did so and his father pushed up the bottom of the vessel so as to make him swallow a good deal in spite of himself  it went down into his stomach like molten lead  ha ha thats right said old halborough  but twas raw spiritha ha  why should you take me in so said joshua losing his selfcommand try as he would to keep calm  because you took me in my lad in banishing me to that cursed country under pretence that it was for my good  you were a pair of hypocrites to say so  it was done to get rid of meno more nor less  but by jerry im a match for ye now  ill spoil your souls for preaching  my daughter is going to be married to the squire here  ive heard the newsi saw it in a paper  it is premature  i know it is true and im her father and i shall give her away or therell be a hell of a row i can assure ye  is that where the gennleman lives  joshua halborough writhed in impotent despair  fellmer had not yet positively declared himself his mother was hardly won round a scene with their father in the parish would demolish as fair a palace of hopes as was ever builded  the millwright rose  if thats where the squire lives im going to call  just arrived from canady with her fortuneha ha  i wish no harm to the gennleman and the gennleman will wish no harm to me  but i like to take my place in the family and stand upon my rights and lower peoples pride  youve succeeded already  wheres that woman you took with you  woman  she was my wife as lawful as the constitutiona sight more lawful than your mother was till some time after you were born  joshua had for many years before heard whispers that his father had cajoled his mother in their early acquaintance and had made somewhat tardy amends but never from his fathers lips till now  it was the last stroke and he could not bear it  he sank back against the hedge  it is over he said  he ruins us all  the millwright moved on waving his stick triumphantly and the two brothers stood still  they could see his drab figure stalking along the path and over his head the lights from the conservatory of narrobourne house inside which albert fellmer might possibly be sitting with rosa at that moment holding her hand and asking her to share his home with him  the staggering whiteybrown form advancing to put a blot on all this had been diminishing in the shade and now suddenly disappeared beside a weir  there was the noise of a flounce in the water  he has fallen in said cornelius starting forward to run for the place at which his father had vanished  joshua awaking from the stupefied reverie into which he had sunk rushed to the others side before he had taken ten steps  stop stop what are you thinking of he whispered hoarsely grasping corneliuss arm  pulling him out  yes yesso am i  butwait a moment  but joshua  her life and happiness you knowcorneliusand your reputation and mineand our chance of rising together all three  he clutched his brothers arm to the bone and as they stood breathless the splashing and floundering in the weir continued over it they saw the hopeful lights from the manorhouse conservatory winking through the trees as their bare branches waved to and fro  the floundering and splashing grew weaker and they could hear gurgling words helpim drownded  rosierosie  well gowe must save him  o joshua  yes yes we must  still they did not move but waited holding each other each thinking the same thought  weights of lead seemed to be affixed to their feet which would no longer obey their wills  the mead became silent  over it they fancied they could see figures moving in the conservatory  the air up there seemed to emit gentle kisses  cornelius started forward at last and joshua almost simultaneously  two or three minutes brought them to the brink of the stream  at first they could see nothing in the water though it was not so deep nor the night so dark but that their fathers light kerseymere coat would have been visible if he had lain at the bottom  joshua looked this way and that  he has drifted into the culvert he said  below the footbridge of the weir the stream suddenly narrowed to half its width to pass under a barrel arch or culvert constructed for waggons to cross into the middle of the mead in haymaking time  it being at present the season of high water the arch was full to the crown against which the ripples clucked every now and then  at this point he had just caught sight of a pale object slipping under  in a moment it was gone  they went to the lower end but nothing emerged  for a long time they tried at both ends to effect some communication with the interior but to no purpose  we ought to have come sooner said the consciencestricken cornelius when they were quite exhausted and dripping wet  i suppose we ought replied joshua heavily  he perceived his fathers walkingstick on the bank hastily picking it up he stuck it into the mud among the sedge  then they went on  shall wesay anything about this accident whispered cornelius as they approached the door of joshuas house  whats the use  it can do no good  we must wait until he is found  they went indoors and changed their clothes after which they started for the manorhouse reaching it about ten oclock  besides their sister there were only three guests an adjoining landowner and his wife and the infirm old rector  rosa although she had parted from them so recently grasped their hands in an ecstatic brimming joyful manner as if she had not seen them for years  you look pale she said  the brothers answered that they had had a long walk and were somewhat tired  everybody in the room seemed charged full with some sort of interesting knowledge the squires neighbour and his wife looked wisely around and fellmer himself played the part of host with a preoccupied bearing which approached fervour  they left at eleven not accepting the carriage offered the distance being so short and the roads dry  the squire came rather farther into the dark with them than he need have done and wished rosa goodnight in a mysterious manner slightly apart from the rest  when they were walking along joshua said with desperate attempt at joviality rosa whats going on  o i she began between a gasp and a bound  he  never mindif it disturbs you  she was so excited that she could not speak connectedly at first the practised air which she had brought home with her having disappeared calming herself she added i am not disturbed and nothing has happened only he said he wanted to ask me something some day and i said never mind that now  he hasnt asked yet and is coining to speak to you about it  he would have done so tonight only i asked him not to be in a hurry  but he will come tomorrow i am sure    chapter v   it was summertime six months later and mowers and haymakers were at work in the meads  the manorhouse being opposite them frequently formed a peg for conversation during these operations and the doings of the squire and the squires young wife the curates sisterwho was at present the admired of most of them and the interest of allmet with their due amount of criticism  rosa was happy if ever woman could be said to be so  she had not learnt the fate of her father and sometimes wonderedperhaps with a sense of reliefwhy he did not write to her from his supposed home in canada  her brother joshua had been presented to a living in a small town shortly after her marriage and cornelius had thereupon succeeded to the vacant curacy of narrobourne  these two had awaited in deep suspense the discovery of their fathers body and yet the discovery had not been made  every day they expected a man or a boy to run up from the meads with the intelligence but he had never come  days had accumulated to weeks and months the wedding had come and gone joshua had tolled and read himself in at his new parish and never a shout of amazement over the millwrights remains  but now in june when they were mowing the meads the hatches had to be drawn and the water let out of its channels for the convenience of the mowers  it was thus that the discovery was made  a man stooping low with his scythe caught a view of the culvert lengthwise and saw something entangled in the recently bared weeds of its bed  a day or two after there was an inquest but the body was unrecognizable  fish and flood had been busy with the millwright he had no watch or marked article which could be identified and a verdict of the accidental drowning of a person unknown settled the matter  as the body was found in narrobourne parish there it had to be buried cornelius wrote to joshua begging him to come and read the service or to send some one he himself could not do it  rather than let in a stranger joshua came and silently scanned the coroners order handed him by the undertaker  i henry giles coroner for the middivision of outer wessex do hereby order the burial of the body now shown to the inquest jury as the body of an adult male person unknown     etc  joshua halborough got through the service in some way and rejoined his brother cornelius at his house  neither accepted an invitation to lunch at their sisters they wished to discuss parish matters together  in the afternoon she came down though they had already called on her and had not expected to see her again  her bright eyes brown hair flowery bonnet lemoncoloured gloves and flush beauty were like an irradiation into the apartment which they in their gloom could hardly bear  i forgot to tell you she said of a curious thing which happened to me a month or two before my marriagesomething which i have thought may have had a connection with the accident to the poor man you have buried today  it was on that evening i was at the manorhouse waiting for you to fetch me i was in the wintergarden with albert and we were sitting silent together when we fancied we heard a cry  we opened the door and while albert ran to fetch his hat leaving me standing there the cry was repeated and my excited senses made me think i heard my own name  when albert came back all was silent and we decided that it was only a drunken shout and not a cry for help  we both forgot the incident and it never has occurred to me till since the funeral today that it might have been this strangers cry  the name of course was only fancy or he might have had a wife or child with a name something like mine poor man  when she was gone the brothers were silent till cornelius said now mark this joshua  sooner or later shell know  how  from one of us  do you think human hearts are ironcased safes that you suppose we can keep this secret for ever  yes i think they are sometimes said joshua  no  it will out  we shall tell  what and ruin herkill her  disgrace her children and pull down the whole auspicious house of fellmer about our ears  no  may idrown where he was drowned before i do it  never never  surely you can say the same cornelius  cornelius seemed fortified and no more was said  for a long time after that day he did not see joshua and before the next year was out a son and heir was born to the fellmers  the villagers rang the three bells every evening for a week and more and were made merry by mr fellmers ale and when the christening came on joshua paid narrobourne another visit  among all the people who assembled on that day the brother clergymen were the least interested  their minds were haunted by a spirit in kerseymere in the evening they walked together in the fields  shes all right said joshua  but here are you doing journeywork cornelius and likely to continue at it till the end of the day as far as i can see  i too with my petty livingwhat am i after all    to tell the truth the church is a poor forlorn hope for people without influence particularly when their enthusiasm begins to flag  a social regenerator has a better chance outside where he is unhampered by dogma and tradition  as for me i would rather have gone on mending mills with my crust of bread and liberty  almost automatically they had bent their steps along the margin of the river they now paused  they were standing on the brink of the wellknown weir  there were the hatches there was the culvert they could see the pebbly bed of the stream through the pellucid water  the notes of the churchbells were audible still jangled by the enthusiastic villagers  why seeit was there i hid his walkingstick said joshua looking towards the sedge  the next moment during a passing breeze something flashed white on the spot to which the attention of cornelius was drawn  from the sedge rose a straight little silverpoplar and it was the leaves of this sapling which caused the flicker of whiteness  his walkingstick has grown joshua added  it was a rough onecut from the hedge i remember  at every puff of wind the tree turned white till they could not bear to look at it and they walked away  i see him every night cornelius murmured    ah we read our hebrews to little account jos  greek text  to have endured the cross despising the shamethere lay greatness  but now i often feel that i should like to put an end to trouble here in this selfsame spot  i have thought of it myself said joshua  perhaps we shall some day murmured his brother  perhaps said joshua moodily  with that contingency to consider in the silence of their nights and days they bent their steps homewards  december 1888     on the western circuit   chapter i   the man who played the disturbing part in the two quiet lives hereafter depictedno great man in any sense by the wayfirst had knowledge of them on an october evening in the city of melchester  he had been standing in the close vainly endeavouring to gain amid the darkness a glimpse of the most homogeneous pile of mediaeval architecture in england which towered and tapered from the damp and level sward in front of him  while he stood the presence of the cathedral walls was revealed rather by the ear than by the eyes he could not see them but they reflected sharply a roar of sound which entered the close by a street leading from the city square and falling upon the building was flung back upon him  he postponed till the morrow his attempt to examine the deserted edifice and turned his attention to the noise  it was compounded of steam barrel organs the clanging of gongs the ringing of handbells the clack of rattles and the undistinguishable shouts of men  a lurid light hung in the air in the direction of the tumult  thitherward he went passing under the arched gateway along a straight street and into the square  he might have searched europe over for a greater contrast between juxtaposed scenes  the spectacle was that of the eighth chasm of the inferno as to colour and flame and as to mirth a development of the homeric heaven  a smoky glare of the complexion of brassfilings ascended from the fiery tongues of innumerable naphtha lamps affixed to booths stalls and other temporary erections which crowded the spacious marketsquare  in front of this irradiation scores of human figures more or less in profile were darting athwart and across up down and around like gnats against a sunset  their motions were so rhythmical that they seemed to be moved by machinery  and it presently appeared that they were moved by machinery indeed the figures being those of the patrons of swings seesaws flyingleaps above all of the three steam roundabouts which occupied the centre of the position  it was from the latter that the din of steam organs came  throbbing humanity in full light was on second thoughts better than architecture in the dark  the young man lighting a short pipe and putting his hat on one side and one hand in his pocket to throw himself into harmony with his new environment drew near to the largest and most patronized of the steam circuses as the roundabouts were called by their owners  this was one of brilliant finish and it was now in full revolution  the musical instrument around which and to whose tones the riders revolved directed its trumpetmouths of brass upon the young man and the long plateglass mirrors set at angles which revolved with the machine flashed the gyrating personages and hobby horses kaleidoscopically into his eyes  it could now be seen that he was unlike the majority of the crowd  a gentlemanly young fellow one of the species found in large towns only and london particularly built on delicate lines well though not fashionably dressed he appeared to belong to the professional class he had nothing square or practical about his look much that was curvilinear and sensuous  indeed some would have called him a man not altogether typical of the middleclass male of a century wherein sordid ambition is the masterpassion that seems to be taking the timehonoured place of love  the revolving figures passed before his eyes with an unexpected and quiet grace in a throng whose natural movements did not suggest gracefulness or quietude as a rule  by some contrivance there was imparted to each of the hobbyhorses a motion which was really the triumph and perfection of roundabout inventivenessa galloping rise and fall so timed that of each pair of steeds one was on the spring while the other was on the pitch  the riders were quite fascinated by these equine undulations in this most delightful holidaygame of our times  there were riders as young as six and as old as sixty years with every age between  at first it was difficult to catch a personality but by and by the observers eyes centred on the prettiest girl out of the several pretty ones revolving  it was not that one with the light frock and light hat whom he had been at first attracted by no it was the one with the black cape grey skirt light gloves andno not even she but the one behind her she with the crimson skirt dark jacket brown hat and brown gloves unmistakably that was the prettiest girl  having finally selected her this idle spectator studied her as well as he was able during each of her brief transits across his visual field she was absolutely unconscious of everything save the act of riding her features were rapt in an ecstatic dreaminess for the moment she did not know her age or her history or her lineaments much less her troubles  he himself was full of vague latterday glooms and popular melancholies and it was a refreshing sensation to behold this young thing then and there absolutely as happy as if she were in a paradise  dreading the moment when the inexorable stoker grimily lurking behind the glittering rococowork should decide that this set of riders had had their pennyworth and bring the whole concern of steamengine horses mirrors trumpets drums cymbals and suchlike to pause and silence he waited for her every reappearance glancing indifferently over the intervening forms including the two plainer girls the old woman and child the two youngsters the newlymarried couple the old man with a clay pipe the sparkish youth with a ring the young ladies in the chariot the pair of journeymancarpenters and others till his select country beauty followed on again in her place  he had never seen a fairer product of nature and at each round she made a deeper mark in his sentiments  the stoppage then came and the sighs of the riders were audible  he moved round to the place at which he reckoned she would alight but she retained her seat  the empty saddles began to refill and she plainly was deciding to have another turn  the young man drew up to the side of her steed and pleasantly asked her if she had enjoyed her ride  o yes she said with dancing eyes  it has been quite unlike anything i have ever felt in my life before  it was not difficult to fall into conversation with her  unreservedtoo unreservedby nature she was not experienced enough to be reserved by art and after a little coaxing she answered his remarks readily  she had come to live in melchester from a village on the great plain and this was the first time that she had ever seen a steamcircus she could not understand how such wonderful machines were made  she had come to the city on the invitation of mrs harnham who had taken her into her household to train her as a servant if she showed any aptitude  mrs harnham was a young lady who before she married had been miss edith white living in the country near the speakers cottage she was now very kind to her through knowing her in childhood so well  she was even taking the trouble to educate her  mrs harnham was the only friend she had in the world and being without children had wished to have her near her in preference to anybody else though she had only lately come allowed her to do almost as she liked and to have a holiday whenever she asked for it  the husband of this kind young lady was a rich winemerchant of the town but mrs harnham did not care much about him in the daytime you could see the house from where they were talking  she the speaker liked melchester better than the lonely country and she was going to have a new hat for next sunday that was to cost fifteen and ninepence  then she inquired of her acquaintance where he lived and he told her in london that ancient and smoky city where everybody lived who lived at all and died because they could not live there  he came into wessex two or three times a year for professional reasons he had arrived from wintoncester yesterday and was going on into the next county in a day or two  for one thing he did like the country better than the town and it was because it contained such girls as herself  then the pleasuremachine started again and to the lighthearted girl the figure of the handsome young man the marketsquare with its lights and crowd the houses beyond and the world at large began moving round as before countermoving in the revolving mirrors on her right hand she being as it were the fixed point in an undulating dazzling lurid universe in which loomed forward most prominently of all the form of her late interlocutor  each time that she approached the half of her orbit that lay nearest him they gazed at each other with smiles and with that unmistakable expression which means so little at the moment yet so often leads up to passion heartache union disunion devotion overpopulation drudgery content resignation despair  when the horses slowed anew he stepped to her side and proposed another heat  hang the expense for once he said  ill pay  she laughed till the tears came  why do you laugh dear said he  becauseyou are so genteel that you must have plenty of money and only say that for fun she returned  haha laughed the young man in unison and gallantly producing his money she was enabled to whirl on again  as he stood smiling there in the motley crowd with his pipe in his hand and clad in the rough peajacket and wideawake that he had put on for his stroll who would have supposed him to be charles bradford raye esquire stuffgownsman educated at wintoncester called to the bar at lincolns inn now going the western circuit merely detained in melchester by a small arbitration after his brethren had moved on to the next countytown    chapter ii   the square was overlooked from its remoter corner by the house of which the young girl had spoken a dignified residence of considerable size having several windows on each floor  inside one of these on the first floor the apartment being a large drawingroom sat a lady in appearance from twentyeight to thirty years of age  the blinds were still undrawn and the lady was absently surveying the weird scene without her cheek resting on her hand  the room was unlit from within but enough of the glare from the marketplace entered it to reveal the ladys face  she was what is called an interesting creature rather than a handsome woman darkeyed thoughtful and with sensitive lips  a man sauntered into the room from behind and came forward  o edith i didnt see you he said  why are you sitting here in the dark  i am looking at the fair replied the lady in a languid voice  oh  horrid nuisance every year  i wish it could be put a stop to  i like it  hm  theres no accounting for taste  for a moment he gazed from the window with her for politeness sake and then went out again  in a few minutes she rang  hasnt anna come in asked mrs harnham  no mm  she ought to be in by this time  i meant her to go for ten minutes only  shall i go and look for her mm said the housemaid alertly  no  it is not necessary she is a good girl and will come soon  however when the servant had gone mrs harnham arose went up to her room cloaked and bonneted herself and proceeded downstairs where she found her husband  i want to see the fair she said and i am going to look for anna  i have made myself responsible for her and must see she comes to no harm she ought to be indoors  will you come with me  oh shes all right  i saw her on one of those whirligig things talking to her young man as i came in  but ill go if you wish though id rather go a hundred miles the other way  then please do so  i shall come to no harm alone  she left the house and entered the crowd which thronged the marketplace where she soon discovered anna seated on the revolving horse  as soon as it stopped mrs harnham advanced and said severely anna how can you be such a wild girl  you were only to be out for ten minutes  anna looked blank and the young man who had dropped into the background came to her assistance  please dont blame her he said politely  it is my fault that she has stayed  she looked so graceful on the horse that i induced her to go round again  i assure you that she has been quite safe  in that case ill leave her in your hands said mrs harnham turning to retrace her steps  but this for the moment it was not so easy to do  something had attracted the crowd to a spot in their rear and the winemerchants wife caught by its sway found herself pressed against annas acquaintance without power to move away  their faces were within a few inches of each other his breath fanned her cheek as well as annas  they could do no other than smile at the accident but neither spoke and each waited passively  mrs harnham then felt a mans hand clasping her fingers and from the look of consciousness on the young fellows face she knew the hand to be his she also knew that from the position of the girl he had no other thought than that the imprisoned hand was annas what prompted her to refrain from undeceiving him she could hardly tell not content with holding the hand he playfully slipped two of his fingers inside her glove against her palm  thus matters continued till the pressure lessened but several minutes passed before the crowd thinned sufficiently to allow mrs harnham to withdraw  how did they get to know each other i wonder she mused as she retreated  anna is really very forwardand he very wicked and nice  she was so gently stirred with the strangers manner and voice with the tenderness of his idle touch that instead of reentering the house she turned back again and observed the pair from a screened nook  really she argued being little less impulsive than anna herself it was very excusable in anna to encourage him however she might have contrived to make his acquaintance he was so gentlemanly so fascinating had such beautiful eyes  the thought that he was several years her junior produced a reasonless sigh  at length the couple turned from the roundabout towards the door of mrs harnhams house and the young man could be heard saying that he would accompany her home  anna then had found a lover apparently a very devoted one  mrs harnham was quite interested in him  when they drew near the door of the winemerchants house a comparatively deserted spot by this time they stood invisible for a little while in the shadow of a wall where they separated anna going on to the entrance and her acquaintance returning across the square  anna said mrs harnham coming up  ive been looking at you  that young man kissed you at parting i am almost sure  well stammered anna he said if i didnt mindit would do me no harm and and him a great deal of good  ah i thought so  and he was a stranger till tonight  yes maam  yet i warrant you told him your name and every thing about yourself  he asked me  but he didnt tell you his  yes maam he did cried anna victoriously  it is charles bradford of london  well if hes respectable of course ive nothing to say against your knowing him remarked her mistress prepossessed in spite of general principles in the young mans favour  but i must reconsider all that if he attempts to renew your acquaintance  a countrybred girl like you who has never lived in melchester till this month who had hardly ever seen a blackcoated man till you came here to be so sharp as to capture a young londoner like him  i didnt capture him  i didnt do anything said anna in confusion  when she was indoors and alone mrs harnham thought what a wellbred and chivalrous young man annas companion had seemed  there had been a magic in his wooing touch of her hand and she wondered how he had come to be attracted by the girl  the next morning the emotional edith harnham went to the usual weekday service in melchester cathedral  in crossing the close through the fog she again perceived him who had interested her the previous evening gazing up thoughtfully at the highpiled architecture of the nave and as soon as she had taken her seat he entered and sat down in a stall opposite hers  he did not particularly heed her but mrs harnham was continually occupying her eyes with him and wondered more than ever what had attracted him in her unfledged maidservant  the mistress was almost as unaccustomed as the maiden herself to the endoftheage young man or she might have wondered less  raye having looked about him awhile left abruptly without regard to the service that was proceeding and mrs harnhamlonely impressionable creature that she wastook no further interest in praising the lord  she wished she had married a london man who knew the subtleties of lovemaking as they were evidently known to him who had mistakenly caressed her hand    chapter iii   the calendar at melchester had been light occupying the court only a few hours and the assizes at casterbridge the next countytown on the western circuit having no business for raye he had not gone thither  at the next town after that they did not open till the following monday trials to begin on tuesday morning  in the natural order of things raye would have arrived at the latter place on monday afternoon but it was not till the middle of wednesday that his gown and grey wig curled in tiers in the best fashion of assyrian basreliefs were seen blowing and bobbing behind him as he hastily walked up the high street from his lodgings  but though he entered the assize building there was nothing for him to do and sitting at the blue baize table in the well of the court he mended pens with a mind far away from the case in progress thoughts of unpremeditated conduct of which a week earlier he would not have believed himself capable threw him into a mood of dissatisfied depression  he had contrived to see again the pretty rural maiden anna the day after the fair had walked out of the city with her to the earthworks of old melchester and feeling a violent fancy for her had remained in melchester all sunday monday and tuesday by persuasion obtaining walks and meetings with the girl six or seven times during the interval had in brief won her body and soul  he supposed it must have been owing to the seclusion in which he had lived of late in town that he had given way so unrestrainedly to a passion for an artless creature whose inexperience had from the first led her to place herself unreservedly in his hands  much he deplored trifling with her feelings for the sake of a passing desire and he could only hope that she might not live to suffer on his account  she had begged him to come to her again entreated him wept  he had promised that he would do so and he meant to carry out that promise  he could not desert her now  awkward as such unintentional connections were the interspace of a hundred mileswhich to a girl of her limited capabilities was like a thousandwould effectually hinder this summer fancy from greatly encumbering his life while thought of her simple love might do him the negative good of keeping him from idle pleasures in town when he wished to work hard  his circuit journeys would take him to melchester three or four times a year and then he could always see her  the pseudonym or rather partial name that he had given her as his before knowing how far the acquaintance was going to carry him had been spoken on the spur of the moment without any ulterior intention whatever  he had not afterwards disturbed annas error but on leaving her he had felt bound to give her an address at a stationers not far from his chambers at which she might write to him under the initials c b  in due time raye returned to his london abode having called at melchester on his way and spent a few additional hours with his fascinating child of nature  in town he lived monotonously every day often he and his rooms were enclosed by a tawny fog from all the world besides and when he lighted the gas to read or write by his situation seemed so unnatural that he would look into the fire and think of that trusting girl at melchester again and again  often oppressed by absurd fondness for her he would enter the dim religious nave of the law courts by the north door elbow other juniors habited like himself and like him unretained edge himself into this or that crowded court where a sensational case was going on just as if he were in it though the police officers at the door knew as well as he knew himself that he had no more concern with the business in hand than the patient idlers at the gallerydoor outside who had waited to enter since eight in the morning because like him they belonged to the classes that live on expectation but he would do these things to no purpose and think how greatly the characters in such scenes contrasted with the pink and breezy anna  an unexpected feature in that peasant maidens conduct was that she had not as yet written to him though he had told her she might do so if she wished  surely a young creature had never before been so reticent in such circumstances  at length he sent her a brief line positively requesting her to write  there was no answer by the return post but the day after a letter in a neat feminine hand and bearing the melchester postmark was handed to him by the stationer  the fact alone of its arrival was sufficient to satisfy his imaginative sentiment  he was not anxious to open the epistle and in truth did not begin to read it for nearly halfanhour anticipating readily its terms of passionate retrospect and tender adjuration  when at last he turned his feet to the fireplace and unfolded the sheet he was surprised and pleased to find that neither extravagance nor vulgarity was there  it was the most charming little missive he had ever received from woman  to be sure the language was simple and the ideas were slight but it was so selfpossessed so purely that of a young girl who felt her womanhood to be enough for her dignity that he read it through twice  four sides were filled and a few lines written across after the fashion of former days the paper too was common and not of the latest shade and surface  but what of those things  he had received letters from women who were fairly called ladies but never so sensible so human a letter as this  he could not single out any one sentence and say it was at all remarkable or clever the ensemble of the letter it was which won him and beyond the one request that he would write or come to her again soon there was nothing to show her sense of a claim upon him  to write again and develop a correspondence was the last thing raye would have preconceived as his conduct in such a situation yet he did send a short encouraging line or two signed with his pseudonym in which he asked for another letter and cheeringly promised that he would try to see her again on some near day and would never forget how much they had been to each other during their short acquaintance    chapter iv   to return now to the moment at which anna at melchester had received rayes letter  it had been put into her own hand by the postman on his morning rounds she flushed down to her neck on receipt of it and turned it over and over  it is mine she said  why yes cant you see it is said the postman smiling as he guessed the nature of the document and the cause of the confusion  o yes of course replied anna looking at the letter forcedly tittering and blushing still more  her look of embarrassment did not leave her with the postmans departure she opened the envelope kissed its contents put away the letter in her pocket and remained musing till her eyes filled with tears  a few minutes later she carried up a cup of tea to mrs harnham in her bedchamber  annas mistress looked at her and said how dismal you seem this morning anna  whats the matter  im not dismal im glad only i  she stopped to stifle a sob  well  ive got a letterand what good is it to me if i cant read a word in it  why ill read it child if necessary  but this is from somebodyi dont want anybody to read it but myself anna murmured  i shall not tell anybody  is it from that young man  i think so anna slowly produced the letter saying then will you read it to me maam  this was the secret of annas embarrassment and flutterings  she could neither read nor write  she had grown up under the care of an aunt by marriage at one of the lonely hamlets on the great midwessex plain where even in days of national education there had been no school within a distance of two miles  her aunt was an ignorant woman there had been nobody to investigate annas circumstances nobody to care about her learning the rudiments though as often in such cases she had been well fed and clothed and not unkindly treated  since she had come to live at melchester with mrs harnham the latter who took a kindly interest in the girl had taught her to speak correctly in which accomplishment anna showed considerable readiness as is not unusual with the illiterate and soon became quite fluent in the use of her mistresss phraseology  mrs harnham also insisted upon her getting a spelling and copy book and beginning to practise in these  anna was slower in this branch of her education and meanwhile here was the letter  edith harnhams large dark eyes expressed some interest in the contents though in her character of mere interpreter she threw into her tone as much as she could of mechanical passiveness  she read the short epistle on to its concluding sentence which idly requested anna to send him a tender answer  nowyoull do it for me wont you dear mistress said anna eagerly and youll do it as well as ever you can please  because i couldnt bear him to think i am not able to do it myself  i should sink into the earth with shame if he knew that  from some words in the letter mrs harnham was led to ask questions and the answers she received confirmed her suspicions  deep concern filled ediths heart at perceiving how the girl had committed her happiness to the issue of this newsprung attachment  she blamed herself for not interfering in a flirtation which had resulted so seriously for the poor little creature in her charge though at the time of seeing the pair together she had a feeling that it was hardly within her province to nip young affection in the bud  however what was done could not be undone and it behoved her now as annas only protector to help her as much as she could  to annas eager request that she mrs harnham should compose and write the answer to this young london mans letter she felt bound to accede to keep alive his attachment to the girl if possible though in other circumstances she might have suggested the cook as an amanuensis  a tender reply was thereupon concocted and set down in edith harnhams hand  this letter it had been which raye had received and delighted in written in the presence of anna it certainly was and on annas humble notepaper and in a measure indited by the young girl but the life the spirit the individuality were edith harnhams  wont you at least put your name yourself she said  you can manage to write that by this time  no no said anna shrinking back  i should do it so bad  hed be ashamed of me and never see me again  the note so prettily requesting another from him had as we have seen power enough in its pages to bring one  he declared it to be such a pleasure to hear from her that she must write every week  the same process of manufacture was accordingly repeated by anna and her mistress and continued for several weeks in succession each letter being penned and suggested by edith the girl standing by the answer read and commented on by edith anna standing by and listening again  late on a winter evening after the dispatch of the sixth letter mrs harnham was sitting alone by the remains of her fire  her husband had retired to bed and she had fallen into that fixity of musing which takes no count of hour or temperature  the state of mind had been brought about in edith by a strange thing which she had done that day  for the first time since rayes visit anna had gone to stay over a night or two with her cottage friends on the plain and in her absence had arrived out of its time a letter from raye  to this edith had replied on her own responsibility from the depths of her own heart without waiting for her maids collaboration  the luxury of writing to him what would be known to no consciousness but his was great and she had indulged herself therein  why was it a luxury  edith harnham led a lonely life  influenced by the belief of the british parent that a bad marriage with its aversions is better than free womanhood with its interests dignity and leisure she had consented to marry the elderly winemerchant as a pis aller at the age of sevenand twentysome three years before this dateto find afterwards that she had made a mistake  that contract had left her still a woman whose deeper nature had never been stirred  she was now clearly realizing that she had become possessed to the bottom of her soul with the image of a man to whom she was hardly so much as a name  from the first he had attracted her by his looks and voice by his tender touch and with these as generators the writing of letter after letter and the reading of their soft answers had insensibly developed on her side an emotion which fanned his till there had resulted a magnetic reciprocity between the correspondents notwithstanding that one of them wrote in a character not her own  that he had been able to seduce another woman in two days was his crowning though unrecognized fascination for her as the sheanimal  they were her own impassioned and pentup ideaslowered to monosyllabic phraseology in order to keep up the disguisethat edith put into letters signed with another name much to the shallow annas delight who unassisted could not for the world have conceived such pretty fancies for winning him even had she been able to write them  edith found that it was these her own foistedin sentiments to which the young barrister mainly responded  the few sentences occasionally added from annas own lips made apparently no impression upon him  the letterwriting in her absence anna never discovered but on her return the next morning she declared she wished to see her lover about something at once and begged mrs harnham to ask him to come  there was a strange anxiety in her manner which did not escape mrs harnham and ultimately resolved itself into a flood of tears  sinking down at ediths knees she made confession that the result of her relations with her lover it would soon become necessary to disclose  edith harnham was generous enough to be very far from inclined to cast anna adrift at this conjuncture  no true woman ever is so inclined from her own personal point of view however prompt she may be in taking such steps to safeguard those dear to her  although she had written to raye so short a time previously she instantly penned another annanote hinting clearly though delicately the state of affairs  raye replied by a hasty line to say how much he was affected by her news he felt that he must run down to see her almost immediately  but a week later the girl came to her mistresss room with another note which on being read informed her that after all he could not find time for the journey  anna was broken with grief but by mrs harnhams counsel strictly refrained from hurling at him the reproaches and bitterness customary from young women so situated  one thing was imperative to keep the young mans romantic interest in her alive rather therefore did edith in the name of her protegee request him on no account to be distressed about the looming event and not to inconvenience himself to hasten down  she desired above everything to be no weight upon him in his career no clog upon his high activities  she had wished him to know what had befallen he was to dismiss it again from his mind  only he must write tenderly as ever and when he should come again on the spring circuit it would be soon enough to discuss what had better be done  it may well be supposed that annas own feelings had not been quite in accord with these generous expressions but the mistresss judgment had ruled and anna had acquiesced  all i want is that niceness you can so well put into your letters my dear dear mistress and that i cant for the life o me make up out of my own head though i mean the same thing and feel it exactly when youve written it down  when the letter had been sent off and edith harnham was left alone she bowed herself on the back of her chair and wept  i wish it was minei wish it was she murmured  yet how can i say such a wicked thing    chapter v   the letter moved raye considerably when it reached him  the intelligence itself had affected him less than her unexpected manner of treating him in relation to it  the absence of any word of reproach the devotion to his interests the selfsacrifice apparent in every line all made up a nobility of character that he had never dreamt of finding in womankind  god forgive me he said tremulously  i have been a wicked wretch  i did not know she was such a treasure as this  he reassured her instantly declaring that he would not of course desert her that he would provide a home for her somewhere  meanwhile she was to stay where she was as long as her mistress would allow her  but a misfortune supervened in this direction  whether an inkling of annas circumstances reached the knowledge of mrs harnhams husband or not cannot be said but the girl was compelled in spite of ediths entreaties to leave the house  by her own choice she decided to go back for a while to the cottage on the plain  this arrangement led to a consultation as to how the correspondence should be carried on and in the girls inability to continue personally what had been begun in her name and in the difficulty of their acting in concert as heretofore she requested mrs harnhamthe only welltodo friend she had in the worldto receive the letters and reply to them offhand sending them on afterwards to herself on the plain where she might at least get some neighbour to read them to her if a trustworthy one could be met with anna and her box then departed for the plain  thus it befel that edith harnham found herself in the strange position of having to correspond under no supervision by the real woman with a man not her husband in terms which were virtually those of a wife concerning a condition that was not ediths at all the man being one for whom mainly through the sympathies involved in playing this part she secretly cherished a predilection subtle and imaginative truly but strong and absorbing  she opened each letter read it as if intended for herself and replied from the promptings of her own heart and no other  throughout this correspondence carried on in the girls absence the highstrung edith harnham lived in the ecstasy of fancy the vicarious intimacy engendered such a flow of passionateness as was never exceeded for conscience sake edith at first sent on each of his letters to anna and even rough copies of her replies but later on these socalled copies were much abridged and many letters on both sides were not sent on at all  though selfish and superficially at least infested with the selfindulgent vices of artificial society there was a substratum of honesty and fairness in rayes character  he had really a tender regard for the country girl and it grew more tender than ever when he found her apparently capable of expressing the deepest sensibilities in the simplest words  he meditated he wavered and finally resolved to consult his sister a maiden lady much older than himself of lively sympathies and good intent  in making this confidence he showed her some of the letters  she seems fairly educated miss raye observed  and bright in ideas she expresses herself with a taste that must be innate  yes  she writes very prettily doesnt she thanks to these elementary schools  one is drawn out towards her in spite of ones self poor thing  the upshot of the discussion was that though he had not been directly advised to do it raye wrote in his real name what he would never have decided to write on his own responsibility namely that he could not live without her and would come down in the spring and shelve her looming difficulty by marrying her  this bold acceptance of the situation was made known to anna by mrs harnham driving out immediately to the cottage on the plain  anna jumped for joy like a little child  and poor crude directions for answering appropriately were given to edith harnham who on her return to the city carried them out with warm intensification  o she groaned as she threw down the pen  annapoor good little foolhasnt intelligence enough to appreciate him  how should she while idont bear his child  it was now february  the correspondence had continued altogether for four months and the next letter from raye contained incidentally a statement of his position and prospects  he said that in offering to wed her he had at first contemplated the step of retiring from a profession which hitherto had brought him very slight emolument and which to speak plainly he had thought might be difficult of practice after his union with her  but the unexpected mines of brightness and warmth that her letters had disclosed to be lurking in her sweet nature had led him to abandon that somewhat sad prospect  he felt sure that with her powers of development after a little private training in the social forms of london under his supervision and a little help from a governess if necessary she would make as good a professional mans wife as could be desired even if he should rise to the woolsack  many a lord chancellors wife had been less intuitively a lady than she had shown herself to be in her lines to him  opoor fellow poor fellow mourned edith harnham  her distress now raged as high as her infatuation  it was she who had wrought him to this pitchto a marriage which meant his ruin yet she could not in mercy to her maid do anything to hinder his plan  anna was coming to melchester that week but she could hardly show the girl this last reply from the young man it told too much of the second individuality that had usurped the place of the first  anna came and her mistress took her into her own room for privacy  anna began by saying with some anxiety that she was glad the wedding was so near  o anna replied mrs harnham  i think we must tell him allthat i have been doing your writing for youlest he should not know it till after you become his wife and it might lead to dissension and recriminations  o misess dear misessplease dont tell him now cried anna in distress  if you were to do it perhaps he would not marry me and what should i do then  it would be terrible what would come to me  and i am getting on with my writing too  i have brought with me the copybook you were so good as to give me and i practise every day and though it is so so hard i shall do it well at last i believe if i keep on trying  edith looked at the copybook  the copies had been set by herself and such progress as the girl had made was in the way of grotesque facsimile of her mistresss hand  but even if ediths flowing caligraphy were reproduced the inspiration would be another thing  you do it so beautifully continued anna and say all that i want to say so much better than i could say it that i do hope you wont leave me in the lurch just now  very well replied the other  but ibut i thought i ought not to go on  why  her strong desire to confide her sentiments led edith to answer truly  because of its effect upon me  but it cant have any  why child  because you are married already said anna with lucid simplicity  of course it cant said her mistress hastily yet glad despite her conscience that two or three outpourings still remained to her  but you must concentrate your attention on writing your name as i write it here    chapter vi   soon raye wrote about the wedding  having decided to make the best of what he feared was a piece of romantic folly he had acquired more zest for the grand experiment  he wished the ceremony to be in london for greater privacy  edith harnham would have preferred it at melchester anna was passive  his reasoning prevailed and mrs harnham threw herself with mournful zeal into the preparations for annas departure  in a last desperate feeling that she must at every hazard be in at the death of her dream and see once again the man who by a species of telepathy had exercised such an influence on her she offered to go up with anna and be with her through the ceremonyto see the end of her as her mistress put it with forced gaiety an offer which the girl gratefully accepted for she had no other friend capable of playing the part of companion and witness in the presence of a gentlemanly bridegroom in such a way as not to hasten an opinion that he had made an irremediable social blunder  it was a muddy morning in march when raye alighted from a fourwheel cab at the door of a registryoffice in the sw district of london and carefully handed down anna and her companion mrs harnham  anna looked attractive in the somewhat fashionable clothes which mrs harnham had helped her to buy though not quite so attractive as an innocent child she had appeared in her country gown on the back of the wooden horse at melchester fair  mrs harnham had come up this morning by an early train and a young mana friend of rayeshaving met them at the door all four entered the registryoffice together  till an hour before this time raye had never known the winemerchants wife except at that first casual encounter and in the flutter of the performance before them he had little opportunity for more than a brief acquaintance  the contract of marriage at a registry is soon got through but somehow during its progress raye discovered a strange and secret gravitation between himself and annas friend  the formalities of the weddingor rather ratification of a previous unionbeing concluded the four went in one cab to rayes lodgings newly taken in a new suburb in preference to a house the rent of which he could ill afford just then  here anna cut the little cake which raye had bought at a pastrycooks on his way home from lincolns inn the night before  but she did not do much besides  rayes friend was obliged to depart almost immediately and when he had left the only ones virtually present were edith and raye who exchanged ideas with much animation  the conversation was indeed theirs only anna being as a domestic animal who humbly heard but understood not  raye seemed startled in awakening to this fact and began to feel dissatisfied with her inadequacy  at last more disappointed than he cared to own he said mrs harnham my darling is so flurried that she doesnt know what she is doing or saying  i see that after this event a little quietude will be necessary before she gives tongue to that tender philosophy which she used to treat me to in her letters  they had planned to start early that afternoon for knollsea to spend the few opening days of their married life there and as the hour for departure was drawing near raye asked his wife if she would go to the writingdesk in the next room and scribble a little note to his sister who had been unable to attend through indisposition informing her that the ceremony was over thanking her for her little present and hoping to know her well now that she was the writers sister as well as charless  say it in the pretty poetical way you know so well how to adopt he added for i want you particularly to win her and both of you to be dear friends  anna looked uneasy but departed to her task raye remaining to talk to their guest  anna was a long while absent and her husband suddenly rose and went to her  he found her still bending over the writingtable with tears brimming up in her eyes and he looked down upon the sheet of notepaper with some interest to discover with what tact she had expressed her goodwill in the delicate circumstances  to his surprise she had progressed but a few lines in the characters and spelling of a child of eight and with the ideas of a goose  anna he said staring whats this  it only meansthat i cant do it any better she answered through her tears  eh  nonsense  i cant she insisted with miserable sobbing hardihood  iididnt write those letters charles  i only told her what to write  and not always that  but i am learning o so fast my dear dear husband  and youll forgive me wont you for not telling you before  she slid to her knees abjectly clasped his waist and laid her face against him  he stood a few moments raised her abruptly turned and shut the door upon her rejoining edith in the drawingroom  she saw that something untoward had been discovered and their eyes remained fixed on each other  do i guess rightly he asked with wan quietude  you were her scribe through all this  it was necessary said edith  did she dictate every word you ever wrote to me  not every word  in fact very little  very little  you wrote a great part of those pages every week from your own conceptions though in her name  yes  perhaps you wrote many of the letters when you were alone without communication with her  i did  he turned to the bookcase and leant with his hand over his face and edith seeing his distress became white as a sheet  you have deceived meruined me he murmured  o dont say it she cried in her anguish jumping up and putting her hand on his shoulder  i cant bear that  delighting me deceptively  why did you do itwhy did you  i began doing it in kindness to her  how could i do otherwise than try to save such a simple girl from misery  but i admit that i continued it for pleasure to myself  raye looked up  why did it give you pleasure he asked  i must not tell said she  he continued to regard her and saw that her lips suddenly began to quiver under his scrutiny and her eyes to fill and droop  she started aside and said that she must go to the station to catch the return train could a cab be called immediately  but raye went up to her and took her unresisting hand  well to think of such a thing as this he said  why you and i are friendsloversdevoted loversby correspondence  yes i suppose  more  more  plainly more  it is no use blinking that  legally i have married hergod help us bothin soul and spirit i have married you and no other woman in the world  hush  but i will not hush  why should you try to disguise the full truth when you have already owned half of it  yes it is between you and me that the bond isnot between me and her  now ill say no more  but o my cruel one i think i have one claim upon you  she did not say what and he drew her towards him and bent over her  if it was all pure invention in those letters he said emphatically give me your cheek only  if you meant what you said let it be lips  it is for the first and last time remember  she put up her mouth and he kissed her long  you forgive me she said crying  yes  but you are ruined  what matter he said shrugging his shoulders  it serves me right  she withdrew wiped her eyes entered and bade goodbye to anna who had not expected her to go so soon and was still wrestling with the letter raye followed edith downstairs and in three minutes she was in a hansom driving to the waterloo station  he went back to his wife  never mind the letter anna today he said gently  put on your things  we too must be off shortly  the simple girl upheld by the sense that she was indeed married showed her delight at finding that he was as kind as ever after the disclosure she did not know that before his eyes he beheld as it were a galley in which he the fastidious urban was chained to work for the remainder of his life with her the unlettered peasant chained to his side  edith travelled back to melchester that day with a face that showed the very stupor of grief her lips still tingling from the desperate pressure of his kiss  the end of her impassioned dream had come  when at dusk she reached the melchester station her husband was there to meet her but in his perfunctoriness and her preoccupation they did not see each other and she went out of the station alone  she walked mechanically homewards without calling a fly  entering she could not bear the silence of the house and went up in the dark to where anna had slept where she remained thinking awhile  she then returned to the drawingroom and not knowing what she did crouched down upon the floor  i have ruined him she kept repeating  i have ruined him because i would not deal treacherously towards her  in the course of half an hour a figure opened the door of the apartment  ahwhos that she said starting up for it was dark  your husbandwho should it be said the worthy merchant  ahmy husbandi forgot i had a husband she whispered to herself  i missed you at the station he continued  did you see anna safely tied up  i hope so for twas time  yesanna is married  simultaneously with ediths journey home anna and her husband were sitting at the opposite windows of a secondclass carriage which sped along to knollsea  in his hand was a pocketbook full of creased sheets closely written over  unfolding them one after another he read them in silence and sighed  what are you doing dear charles she said timidly from the other window and drew nearer to him as if he were a god  reading over all those sweet letters to me signed anna he replied with dreary resignation  autumn 1891     to please his wife   chapter i   the interior of st jamess church in havenpool town was slowly darkening under the close clouds of a winter afternoon  it was sunday service had just ended the face of the parson in the pulpit was buried in his hands and the congregation with a cheerful sigh of release were rising from their knees to depart  for the moment the stillness was so complete that the surging of the sea could be heard outside the harbourbar  then it was broken by the footsteps of the clerk going towards the west door to open it in the usual manner for the exit of the assembly  before however he had reached the doorway the latch was lifted from without and the dark figure of a man in a sailors garb appeared against the light  the clerk stepped aside the sailor closed the door gently behind him and advanced up the nave till he stood at the chancelstep  the parson looked up from the private little prayer which after so many for the parish he quite fairly took for himself rose to his feet and stared at the intruder  i beg your pardon sir said the sailor addressing the minister in a voice distinctly audible to all the congregation  i have come here to offer thanks for my narrow escape from shipwreck  i am given to understand that it is a proper thing to do if you have no objection  the parson after a moments pause said hesitatingly i have no objection certainly  it is usual to mention any such wish before service so that the proper words may be used in the general thanksgiving  but if you wish we can read from the form for use after a storm at sea  ay sure i aint particular said the sailor  the clerk thereupon directed the sailor to the page in the prayerbook where the collect of thanksgiving would be found and the rector began reading it the sailor kneeling where he stood and repeating it after him word by word in a distinct voice  the people who had remained agape and motionless at the proceeding mechanically knelt down likewise but they continued to regard the isolated form of the sailor who in the precise middle of the chancelstep remained fixed on his knees facing the east his hat beside him his hands joined and he quite unconscious of his appearance in their regard  when his thanksgiving had come to an end he rose the people rose also and all went out of church together  as soon as the sailor emerged so that the remaining daylight fell upon his face old inhabitants began to recognize him as no other than shadrach jolliffe a young man who had not been seen at havenpool for several years  a son of the town his parents had died when he was quite young on which account he had early gone to sea in the newfoundland trade  he talked with this and that townsman as he walked informing them that since leaving his native place years before he had become captain and owner of a small coastingketch which had providentially been saved from the gale as well as himself  presently he drew near to two girls who were going out of the churchyard in front of him they had been sitting in the nave at his entry and had watched his doings with deep interest afterwards discussing him as they moved out of church together  one was a slight and gentle creature the other a tall largeframed deliberative girl  captain jolliffe regarded the loose curls of their hair their backs and shoulders down to their heels for some time  who may them two maids be he whispered to his neighbour  the little one is emily hanning the tall one joanna phippard  ah  i recollect em now to be sure  he advanced to their elbow and genially stole a gaze at them  emily you dont know me said the sailor turning his beaming brown eyes on her  i think i do mr jolliffe said emily shyly  the other girl looked straight at him with her dark eyes  the face of miss joanna i dont call to mind so well he continued but i know her beginnings and kindred  they walked and talked together jolliffe narrating particulars of his late narrow escape till they reached the corner of sloop lane in which emily hanning dwelt when with a nod and smile she left them  soon the sailor parted also from joanna and having no especial errand or appointment turned back towards emilys house  she lived with her father who called himself an accountant the daughter however keeping a little stationeryshop as a supplemental provision for the gaps of his somewhat uncertain business  on entering jolliffe found father and daughter about to begin tea  o i didnt know it was teatime he said  ay ill have a cup with much pleasure  he remained to tea and long afterwards telling more tales of his seafaring life  several neighbours called to listen and were asked to come in  somehow emily hanning lost her heart to the sailor that sunday night and in the course of a week or two there was a tender understanding between them  one moonlight evening in the next month shadrach was ascending out of the town by the long straight road eastward to an elevated suburb where the more fashionable houses stoodif anything near this ancient port could be called fashionablewhen he saw a figure before him whom from her manner of glancing back he took to be emily  but on coming up he found she was joanna phippard  he gave a gallant greeting and walked beside her  go along she said or emily will be jealous  he seemed not to like the suggestion and remained  what was said and what was done on that walk never could be clearly recollected by shadrach but in some way or other joanna contrived to wean him away from her gentler and younger rival  from that week onwards jolliffe was seen more and more in the wake of joanna phippard and less in the company of emily and it was soon rumoured about the quay that old jolliffes son who had come home from sea was going to be married to the former young woman to the great disappointment of the latter  just after this report had gone about joanna dressed herself for a walk one morning and started for emilys house in the little crossstreet intelligence of the deep sorrow of her friend on account of the loss of shadrach had reached her ears also and her conscience reproached her for winning him away  joanna was not altogether satisfied with the sailor  she liked his attentions and she coveted the dignity of matrimony but she had never been deeply in love with jolliffe  for one thing she was ambitious and socially his position was hardly so good as her own and there was always the chance of an attractive woman mating considerably above her  it had long been in her mind that she would not strongly object to give him back again to emily if her friend felt so very badly about him  to this end she had written a letter of renunciation to shadrach which letter she carried in her hand intending to send it if personal observation of emily convinced her that her friend was suffering  joanna entered sloop lane and stepped down into the stationeryshop which was below the pavement level  emilys father was never at home at this hour of the day and it seemed as though emily were not at home either for the visitor could make nobody hear  customers came so seldom hither that a five minutes absence of the proprietor counted for little joanna waited in the little shop where emily had tastefully set outas women canarticles in themselves of slight value so as to obscure the meagreness of the stockintrade till she saw a figure pausing without the window apparently absorbed in the contemplation of the sixpenny books packets of paper and prints hung on a string  it was captain shadrach jolliffe peering in to ascertain if emily were there alone moved by an impulse of reluctance to meet him in a spot which breathed of emily joanna slipped through the door that communicated with the parlour at the back  she had frequently done so before for in her friendship with emily she had the freedom of the house without ceremony  jolliffe entered the shop  through the thin blind which screened the glass partition she could see that he was disappointed at not finding emily there  he was about to go out again when emilys form darkened the doorway hastening home from some errand  at sight of jolliffe she started back as if she would have gone out again  dont run away emily dont said he  what can make ye afraid  im not afraid captain jolliffe  onlyonly i saw you all of a sudden andit made me jump  her voice showed that her heart had jumped even more than the rest of her  i just called as i was passing he said  for some paper  she hastened behind the counter  no no emily why do ye get behind there  why not stay by me  you seem to hate me  i dont hate you  how can i  then come out so that we can talk like christians  emily obeyed with a fitful laugh till she stood again beside him in the open part of the shop  theres a dear he said  you mustnt say that captain jolliffe because the words belong to somebody else  ah  i know what you mean  but emily upon my life i didnt know till this morning that you cared one bit about me or i should not have done as i have done  i have the best of feelings for joanna but i know that from the beginning she hasnt cared for me more than in a friendly way and i see now the one i ought to have asked to be my wife  you know emily when a man comes home from sea after a long voyage hes as blind as a bathe cant see whos who in women  they are all alike to him beautiful creatures and he takes the first that comes easy without thinking if she loves him or if he might not soon love another better than her  from the first i inclined to you most but you were so backward and shy that i thought you didnt want me to bother ee and so i went to joanna  dont say any more mr jolliffe dont said she choking  you are going to marry joanna next month and it is wrong toto  o emily my darling he cried and clasped her little figure in his arms before she was aware  joanna behind the curtain turned pale tried to withdraw her eyes but could not  it is only you i love as a man ought to love the woman he is going to marry and i know this from what joanna has said that she will willingly let me off  she wants to marry higher i know and only said yes to me out of kindness  a fine tall girl like her isnt the sort for a plain sailors wife you be the best suited for that  he kissed her and kissed her again her flexible form quivering in the agitation of his embrace  i wonderare you surejoanna is going to break off with you  o are you sure  because  i know she would not wish to make us miserable  she will release me  o i hopei hope she will  dont stay any longer captain jolliffe  he lingered however till a customer came for a penny stick of sealing wax and then he withdrew  green envy had overspread joanna at the scene   she looked about for a way of escape  to get out without emilys knowledge of her visit was indispensable  she crept from the parlour into the passage and thence to the front door of the house where she let herself noiselessly into the street  the sight of that caress had reversed all her resolutions  she could not let shadrach go  reaching home she burnt the letter and told her mother that if captain jolliffe called she was too unwell to see him  shadrach however did not call  he sent her a note expressing in simple language the state of his feelings and asked to be allowed to take advantage of the hints she had given him that her affection too was little more than friendly by cancelling the engagement  looking out upon the harbour and the island beyond he waited and waited in his lodgings for an answer that did not come  the suspense grew to be so intolerable that after dark he went up the high street  he could not resist calling at joannas to learn his fate  her mother said her daughter was too unwell to see him and to his questioning admitted that it was in consequence of a letter received from himself which had distressed her deeply  you know what it was about perhaps mrs phippard he said  mrs phippard owned that she did adding that it put them in a very painful position  thereupon shadrach fearing that he had been guilty of an enormity explained that if his letter had pained joanna it must be owing to a misunderstanding since he had thought it would be a relief to her  if otherwise he would hold himself bound by his word and she was to think of the letter as never having been written  next morning he received an oral message from the young woman asking him to fetch her home from a meeting that evening  this he did and while walking from the town hall to her door with her hand in his arm she said  it is all the same as before between us isnt it shadrach  your letter was sent in mistake  it is all the same as before he answered if you say it must be  i wish it to be she murmured with hard lineaments as she thought of emily  shadrach was a religious and scrupulous man who respected his word as his life  shortly afterwards the wedding took place jolliffe having conveyed to emily as gently as possible the error he had fallen into when estimating joannas mood as one of indifference    chapter ii   a month after the marriage joannas mother died and the couple were obliged to turn their attention to very practical matters  now that she was left without a parent joanna could not bear the notion of her husband going to sea again but the question was what could he do at home  they finally decided to take on a grocers shop in high street the goodwill and stock of which were waiting to be disposed of at that time  shadrach knew nothing of shopkeeping and joanna very little but they hoped to learn  to the management of this grocery business they now devoted all their energies and continued to conduct it for many succeeding years without great success  two sons were born to them whom their mother loved to idolatry although she had never passionately loved her husband and she lavished upon them all her forethought and care  but the shop did not thrive and the large dreams she had entertained of her sons education and career became attenuated in the face of realities  their schooling was of the plainest but being by the sea they grew alert in all such nautical arts and enterprises as were attractive to their age  the great interest of the jolliffes married life outside their own immediate household had lain in the marriage of emily  by one of those odd chances which lead those that lurk in unexpected corners to be discovered while the obvious are passed by the gentle girl had been seen and loved by a thriving merchant of the town a widower some years older than herself though still in the prime of life  at first emily had declared that she never never could marry any one but mr lester had quietly persevered and had at last won her reluctant assent  two children also were the fruits of this union and as they grew and prospered emily declared that she had never supposed that she could live to be so happy  the worthy merchants home one of those large substantial brick mansions frequently jammed up in oldfashioned towns faced directly on the high street nearly opposite to the grocery shop of the jolliffes and it now became the pain of joanna to behold the woman whose place she had usurped out of pure covetousness looking down from her position of comparative wealth upon the humble shopwindow with its dusty sugarloaves heaps of raisins and canisters of tea over which it was her own lot to preside  the business having so dwindled joanna was obliged to serve in the shop herself and it galled and mortified her that emily lester sitting in her large drawingroom over the way could witness her own dancings up and down behind the counter at the beck and call of wretched twopenny customers whose patronage she was driven to welcome gladly persons to whom she was compelled to be civil in the street while emily was bounding along with her children and her governess and conversing with the genteelest people of the town and neighbourhood  this was what she had gained by not letting shadrach jolliffe whom she had so faintly loved carry his affection elsewhere  shadrach was a good and honest man and he had been faithful to her in heart and in deed  time had clipped the wings of his love for emily in his devotion to the mother of his boys he had quite lived down that impulsive earlier fancy and emily had become in his regard nothing more than a friend  it was the same with emilys feelings for him  possibly had she found the least cause for jealousy joanna would almost have been better satisfied  it was in the absolute acquiescence of emily and shadrach in the results she herself had contrived that her discontent found nourishment  shadrach was not endowed with the narrow shrewdness necessary for developing a retail business in the face of many competitors  did a customer inquire if the grocer could really recommend the wondrous substitute for eggs which a persevering bagman had forced into his stock he would answer that when you did not put eggs into a pudding it was difficult to taste them there and when he was asked if his real mocha coffee was real mocha he would say grimly as understood in small shops  one summer day when the big brick house opposite was reflecting the oppressive suns heat into the shop and nobody was present but husband and wife joanna looked across at emilys door where a wealthy visitors carriage had drawn up  traces of patronage had been visible in emilys manner of late  shadrach the truth is you are not a businessman his wife sadly murmured  you were not brought up to shopkeeping and it is impossible for a man to make a fortune at an occupation he has jumped into as you did into this  jolliffe agreed with her in this as in everything else  not that i care a ropes end about making a fortune he said cheerfully  i am happy enough and we can rub on somehow  she looked again at the great house through the screen of bottled pickles  rub onyes she said bitterly  but see how well off emmy lester is who used to be so poor  her boys will go to college no doubt and think of yoursobliged to go to the parish school  shadrachs thoughts had flown to emily  nobody he said goodhumouredly ever did emily a better turn than you did joanna when you warned her off me and put an end to that little simpering nonsense between us so as to leave it in her power to say aye to lester when he came along  this almost maddened her  dont speak of bygones she implored in stern sadness  but think for the boys and my sake if not for your own what are we to do to get richer  well he said becoming serious to tell the truth i have always felt myself unfit for this business though ive never liked to say so  i seem to want more room for sprawling a more open space to strike out in than here among friends and neighbours  i could get rich as well as any man if i tried my own way  i wish you would  what is your way  to go to sea again  she had been the very one to keep him at home hating the semiwidowed existence of sailors wives  but her ambition checked her instincts now and she said do you think success really lies that way  i am sure it lies in no other  do you want to go shadrach  not for the pleasure of it i can tell ee  theres no such pleasure at sea joanna as i can find in my back parlour here  to speak honest i have no love for the brine  i never had much  but if it comes to a question of a fortune for you and the lads it is another thing  thats the only way to it for one born and bred a seafarer as i  would it take long to earn  well that depends perhaps not  the next morning shadrach pulled from a chest of drawers the nautical jacket he had worn during the first months of his return brushed out the moths donned it and walked down to the quay  the port still did a fair business in the newfoundland trade though not so much as formerly  it was not long after this that he invested all he possessed in purchasing a partownership in a brig of which he was appointed captain a few months were passed in coasttrading during which interval shadrach wore off the landrust that had accumulated upon him in his grocery phase and in the spring the brig sailed for newfoundland  joanna lived on at home with her sons who were now growing up into strong lads and occupying themselves in various ways about the harbour and quay  never mind let them work a little their fond mother said to herself our necessities compel it now but when shadrach comes home they will be only seventeen and eighteen and they shall be removed from the port and their education thoroughly taken in hand by a tutor and with the money theyll have they will perhaps be as near to gentlemen as emmy lesters precious two with their algebra and their latin  the date for shadrachs return drew near and arrived and he did not appear  joanna was assured that there was no cause for anxiety sailing ships being so uncertain in their coming which assurance proved to be well grounded for late one wet evening about a month after the calculated time the ship was announced as at hand and presently the slipslop step of shadrach as the sailor sounded in the passage and he entered  the boys had gone out and had missed him and joanna was sitting alone  as soon as the first emotion of reunion between the couple had passed jolliffe explained the delay as owing to a small speculative contract which had produced good results  i was determined not to disappoint ee he said and i think youll own that i havent  with this he pulled out an enormous canvas bag full and rotund as the moneybag of the giant whom jack slew untied it and shook the contents out into her lap as she sat in her low chair by the fire  a mass of sovereigns and guineas there were guineas on the earth in those days fell into her lap with a sudden thud weighing down her gown to the floor  there said shadrach complacently  i told ee dear id do it and have i done it or no  somehow her face after the first excitement of possession did not retain its glory  it is a lot of gold indeed she said  andis this all  all  why dear joanna do you know you can count to three hundred in that heap  it is a fortune  yesyes  a fortunejudged by sea but judged by land  however she banished considerations of the money for the nonce  soon the boys came in and next sunday shadrach returned thanks to godthis time by the more ordinary channel of the italics in the general thanksgiving  but a few days after when the question of investing the money arose he remarked that she did not seem so satisfied as he had hoped  well you see shadrach she answered we count by hundreds they count by thousands nodding towards the other side of the street  they have set up a carriage and pair since you left  o have they  my dear shadrach you dont know how the world moves  however well do the best we can with it  but they are rich and we are poor still  the greater part of a year was desultorily spent  she moved sadly about the house and shop and the boys were still occupying themselves in and around the harbour  joanna he said one day i see by your movements that it is not enough  it is not enough said she  my boys will have to live by steering the ships that the lesters own and i was once above her  jolliffe was not an argumentative man and he only murmured that he thought he would make another voyage  he meditated for several days and coming home from the quay one afternoon said suddenly  i could do it for ee dear in one more trip for certain ifif  do what shadrach  enable ee to count by thousands instead of hundreds  if what  if i might take the boys  she turned pale  dont say that shadrach she answered hastily  why  i dont like to hear it  theres danger at sea  i want them to be something genteel and no danger to them  i couldnt let them risk their lives at sea  o i couldnt ever ever  very well dear it shant be done  next day after a silence she asked a question  if they were to go with you it would make a great deal of difference i suppose to the profit  twould treble what i should get from the venture singlehanded  under my eye they would be as good as two more of myself  later on she said tell me more about this  well the boys are almost as clever as mastermariners in handling a craft upon my life  there isnt a more cranky place in the northern seas than about the sandbanks of this harbour and theyve practised here from their infancy  and they are so steady  i couldnt get their steadiness and their trustworthiness in half a dozen men twice their age  and is it very dangerous at sea now too there are rumours of war she asked uneasily  o well there be risks  still      the idea grew and magnified and the mothers heart was crushed and stifled by it  emmy was growing too patronizing it could not be borne  shadrachs wife could not help nagging him about their comparative poverty  the young men amiable as their father when spoken to on the subject of a voyage of enterprise were quite willing to embark and though they like their father had no great love for the sea they became quite enthusiastic when the proposal was detailed  everything now hung upon their mothers assent  she withheld it long but at last gave the word the young men might accompany their father shadrach was unusually cheerful about it heaven had preserved him hitherto and he had uttered his thanks  god would not forsake those who were faithful to him  all that the jolliffes possessed in the world was put into the enterprise  the grocery stock was pared down to the least that possibly could afford a bare sustenance to joanna during the absence which was to last through the usual newfnland spell  how she would endure the weary time she hardly knew for the boys had been with her formerly but she nerved herself for the trial  the ship was laden with boots and shoes readymade clothing fishing tackle butter cheese cordage sailcloth and many other commodities and was to bring back oil furs skins fish cranberries and what else came to hand  but much trading to other ports was to be undertaken between the voyages out and homeward and thereby much money made    chapter iii   the brig sailed on a monday morning in spring but joanna did not witness its departure  she could not bear the sight that she had been the means of bringing about  knowing this her husband told her overnight that they were to sail some time before noon next day hence when awakening at five the next morning she heard them bustling about downstairs she did not hasten to descend but lay trying to nerve herself for the parting imagining they would leave about nine as her husband had done on his previous voyage  when she did descend she beheld words chalked upon the sloping face of the bureau but no husband or sons  in the hastilyscrawled lines shadrach said they had gone off thus not to pain her by a leavetaking and the sons had chalked under his words good bye mother  she rushed to the quay and looked down the harbour towards the blue rim of the sea but she could only see the masts and bulging sails of the joanna no human figures  tis i have sent them she said wildly and burst into tears  in the house the chalked goodbye nearly broke her heart  but when she had reentered the front room and looked across at emilys a gleam of triumph lit her thin face at her anticipated release from the thraldom of subservience  to do emily lester justice her assumption of superiority was mainly a figment of joannas brain  that the circumstances of the merchants wife were more luxurious than joannas the former could not conceal though whenever the two met which was not very often now emily endeavoured to subdue the difference by every means in her power  the first summer lapsed away and joanna meagrely maintained herself by the shop which now consisted of little more than a window and a counter emily was in truth her only large customer and mrs lesters kindly readiness to buy anything and everything without questioning the quality had a sting of bitterness in it for it was the uncritical attitude of a patron and almost of a donor  the long dreary winter moved on the face of the bureau had been turned to the wall to protect the chalked words of farewell for joanna could never bring herself to rub them out and she often glanced at them with wet eyes  emilys handsome boys came home for the christmas holidays the university was talked of for them and still joanna subsisted as it were with held breath like a person submerged only one summer more and the spell would end  towards the close of the time emily called on her quondam friend  she had heard that joanna began to feel anxious she had received no letter from husband or sons for some months  emilys silks rustled arrogantly when in response to joannas almost dumb invitation she squeezed through the opening of the counter and into the parlour behind the shop  you are all success and i am all the other way said joanna  but why do you think so said emily  they are to bring back a fortune i hear  ah will they come  the doubt is more than a woman can bear  all three in one shipthink of that  and i have not heard of them for months  but the time is not up  you should not meet misfortune halfway  nothing will repay me for the grief of their absence  then why did you let them go  you were doing fairly well  i made them go she said turning vehemently upon emily  and ill tell you why  i could not bear that we should be only muddling on and you so rich and thriving  now i have told you and you may hate me if you will  i shall never hate you joanna  and she proved the truth of her words afterwards  the end of autumn came and the brig should have been in port but nothing like the joanna appeared in the channel between the sands  it was now really time to be uneasy  joanna jolliffe sat by the fire and every gust of wind caused her a cold thrill  she had always feared and detested the sea to her it was a treacherous restless slimy creature glorying in the griefs of women  still she said they must come  she recalled to her mind that shadrach had said before starting that if they returned safe and sound with success crowning their enterprise he would go as he had gone after his shipwreck and kneel with his sons in the church and offer sincere thanks for their deliverance  she went to church regularly morning and afternoon and sat in the most forward pew nearest the chancelstep  her eyes were mostly fixed on that step where shadrach had knelt in the bloom of his young manhood she knew to an inch the spot which his knees had pressed twenty winters before his outline as he had knelt his hat on the step beside him  god was good  surely her husband must kneel there again a son on each side as he had said george just here jim just there  by long watching the spot as she worshipped it became as if she saw the three returned ones there kneeling the two slim outlines of her boys the more bulky form between them their hands clasped their heads shaped against the eastern wall the fancy grew almost to an hallucination she could never turn her worn eyes to the step without seeing them there  nevertheless they did not come  heaven was merciful but it was not yet pleased to relieve her soul  this was her purgation for the sin of making them the slaves of her ambition  but it became more than purgation soon and her mood approached despair  months had passed since the brig had been due but it had not returned  joanna was always hearing or seeing evidences of their arrival  when on the hill behind the port whence a view of the open channel could be obtained she felt sure that a little speck on the horizon breaking the eternally level waste of waters southward was the truck of the joanas mainmast  or when indoors a shout or excitement of any kind at the corner of the town cellar where the high street joined the quay caused her to spring to her feet and cry tis they  but it was not  the visionary forms knelt every sunday afternoon on the chancelstep but not the real  her shop had as it were eaten itself hollow  in the apathy which had resulted from her loneliness and grief she had ceased to take in the smallest supplies and thus had sent away her last customer  in this strait emily lester tried by every means in her power to aid the afflicted woman but she met with constant repulses  i dont like you  i cant bear to see you joanna would whisper hoarsely when emily came to her and made advances  but i want to help and soothe you joanna emily would say  you are a lady with a rich husband and fine sons  what can you want with a bereaved crone like me  joanna i want this i want you to come and live in my house and not stay alone in this dismal place any longer  and suppose they come and dont find me at home  you wish to separate me and mine  no ill stay here  i dont like you and i cant thank you whatever kindness you do me  however as time went on joanna could not afford to pay the rent of the shop and house without an income  she was assured that all hope of the return of shadrach and his sons was vain and she reluctantly consented to accept the asylum of the lesters house  here she was allotted a room of her own on the second floor and went and came as she chose without contact with the family  her hair greyed and whitened deep lines channeled her forehead and her form grew gaunt and stooping  but she still expected the lost ones and when she met emily on the staircase she would say morosely i know why youve got me here  theyll come and be disappointed at not finding me at home and perhaps go away again and then youll be revenged for my taking shadrach away from ee  emily lester bore these reproaches from the griefstricken soul  she was sureall the people of havenpool were surethat shadrach and his sons could not return  for years the vessel had been given up as lost  nevertheless when awakened at night by any noise joanna would rise from bed and glance at the shop opposite by the light from the flickering lamp to make sure it was not they  it was a damp and dark december night six years after the departure of the brig joanna  the wind was from the sea and brought up a fishy mist which mopped the face like moist flannel  joanna had prayed her usual prayer for the absent ones with more fervour and confidence than she had felt for months and had fallen asleep about eleven  it must have been between one and two when she suddenly started up  she had certainly heard steps in the street and the voices of shadrach and her sons calling at the door of the grocery shop  she sprang out of bed and hardly knowing what clothing she dragged on herself hastened down emilys large and carpeted staircase put the candle on the halltable unfastened the bolts and chain and stepped into the street  the mist blowing up the street from the quay hindered her seeing the shop although it was so near but she had crossed to it in a moment  how was it  nobody stood there  the wretched woman walked wildly up and down with her bare feetthere was not a soul  she returned and knocked with all her might at the door which had once been her ownthey might have been admitted for the night unwilling to disturb her till the morning  it was not till several minutes had elapsed that the young man who now kept the shop looked out of an upper window and saw the skeleton of something human standing below halfdressed  has anybody come asked the form  o mrs jolliffe i didnt know it was you said the young man kindly for he was aware how her baseless expectations moved her  no nobody has come  june 1891     the melancholy hussar of the german legion   chapter i   here stretch the downs high and breezy and green absolutely unchanged since those eventful days  a plough has never disturbed the turf and the sod that was uppermost then is uppermost now  here stood the camp here are distinct traces of the banks thrown up for the horses of the cavalry and spots where the middenheaps lay are still to be observed at night when i walk across the lonely place it is impossible to avoid hearing amid the scourings of the wind over the grassbents and thistles the old trumpet and bugle calls the rattle of the halters to help seeing rows of spectral tents and the impedimenta of the soldiery from within the canvases come guttural syllables of foreign tongues and broken songs of the fatherland for they were mainly regiments of the kings german legion that slept round the tentpoles hereabout at that time  it was nearly ninety years ago  the british uniform of the period with its immense epaulettes queer cockedhat breeches gaiters ponderous cartridgebox buckled shoes and what not would look strange and barbarous now  ideas have changed invention has followed invention soldiers were monumental objects then  a divinity still hedged kings here and there and war was considered a glorious thing  secluded old manorhouses and hamlets lie in the ravines and hollows among these hills where a stranger had hardly ever been seen till the king chose to take the baths yearly at the seaside wateringplace a few miles to the south as a consequence of which battalions descended in a cloud upon the open country around  is it necessary to add that the echoes of many characteristic tales dating from that picturesque time still linger about here in more or less fragmentary form to be caught by the attentive ear  some of them i have repeated most of them i have forgotten one i have never repeated and assuredly can never forget  phyllis told me the story with her own lips  she was then an old lady of seventyfive and her auditor a lad of fifteen  she enjoined silence as to her share in the incident till she should be dead buried and forgotten  her life was prolonged twelve years after the day of her narration and she has now been dead nearly twenty  the oblivion which in her modesty and humility she courted for herself has only partially fallen on her with the unfortunate result of inflicting an injustice upon her memory since such fragments of her story as got abroad at the time and have been kept alive ever since are precisely those which are most unfavourable to her character  it all began with the arrival of the york hussars one of the foreign regiments above alluded to  before that day scarcely a soul had been seen near her fathers house for weeks  when a noise like the brushing skirt of a visitor was heard on the doorstep it proved to be a scudding leaf when a carriage seemed to be nearing the door it was her father grinding his sickle on the stone in the garden for his favourite relaxation of trimming the boxtree borders to the plots  a sound like luggage thrown down from the coach was a gun far away at sea and what looked like a tall man by the gate at dusk was a yew bush cut into a quaint and attenuated shape  there is no such solitude in country places now as there was in those old days  yet all the while king george and his court were at his favourite sea side resort not more than five miles off  the daughters seclusion was great but beyond the seclusion of the girl lay the seclusion of the father  if her social condition was twilight his was darkness  yet he enjoyed his darkness while her twilight oppressed her  dr grove had been a professional man whose taste for lonely meditation over metaphysical questions had diminished his practice till it no longer paid him to keep it going after which he had relinquished it and hired at a nominal rent the small dilapidated half farm half manorhouse of this obscure inland nook to make a sufficiency of an income which in a town would have been inadequate for their maintenance  he stayed in his garden the greater part of the day growing more and more irritable with the lapse of time and the increasing perception that he had wasted his life in the pursuit of illusions  he saw his friends less and less frequently  phyllis became so shy that if she met a stranger anywhere in her short rambles she felt ashamed at his gaze walked awkwardly and blushed to her shoulders  yet phyllis was discovered even here by an admirer and her hand most unexpectedly asked in marriage  the king as aforesaid was at the neighbouring town where he had taken up his abode at gloucester lodge and his presence in the town naturally brought many county people thither  among these idlersmany of whom professed to have connections and interests with the courtwas one humphrey gould a bachelor a personage neither young nor old neither goodlooking nor positively plain  too steadygoing to be a buck as fast and unmarried men were then called he was an approximately fashionable man of a mild type  this bachelor of thirty found his way to the village on the down beheld phyllis made her fathers acquaintance in order to make hers and by some means or other she sufficiently inflamed his heart to lead him in that direction almost daily till he became engaged to marry her  as he was of an old local family some of whose members were held in respect in the county phyllis in bringing him to her feet had accomplished what was considered a brilliant move for one in her constrained position  how she had done it was not quite known to phyllis herself  in those days unequal marriages were regarded rather as a violation of the laws of nature than as a mere infringement of convention the more modern view and hence when phyllis of the watering place bourgeoisie was chosen by such a gentlemanly fellow it was as if she were going to be taken to heaven though perhaps the uninformed would have seen no great difference in the respective positions of the pair the said gould being as poor as a crow  this pecuniary condition was his excuseprobably a true onefor postponing their union and as the winter drew nearer and the king departed for the season mr humphrey gould set out for bath promising to return to phyllis in a few weeks  the winter arrived the date of his promise passed yet gould postponed his coming on the ground that he could not very easily leave his father in the city of their sojourn the elder having no other relative near him  phyllis though lonely in the extreme was content  the man who had asked her in marriage was a desirable husband for her in many ways her father highly approved of his suit but this neglect of her was awkward if not painful for phyllis love him in the true sense of the word she assured me she never did but she had a genuine regard for him admired a certain methodical and dogged way in which he sometimes took his pleasure valued his knowledge of what the court was doing had done or was about to do and she was not without a feeling of pride that he had chosen her when he might have exercised a more ambitious choice  but he did not come and the spring developed  his letters were regular though formal and it is not to be wondered that the uncertainty of her position linked with the fact that there was not much passion in her thoughts of humphrey bred an indescribable dreariness in the heart of phyllis grove  the spring was soon summer and the summer brought the king but still no humphrey gould  all this while the engagement by letter was maintained intact  at this point of time a golden radiance flashed in upon the lives of people here and charged all youthful thought with emotional interest this radiance was the aforesaid york hussars    chapter ii   the present generation has probably but a very dim notion of the celebrated york hussars of ninety years ago  they were one of the regiments of the kings german legion and though they somewhat degenerated later on their brilliant uniform their splendid horses and above all their foreign air and mustachios rare appendages then drew crowds of admirers of both sexes wherever they went  these with other regiments had come to encamp on the downs and pastures because of the presence of the king in the neighbouring town  the spot was high and airy and the view extensive commanding the isle of portland in front and reaching to st aldhelms head eastward and almost to the start on the west  phyllis though not precisely a girl of the village was as interested as any of them in this military investment  her fathers home stood somewhat apart and on the highest point of ground to which the lane ascended so that it was almost level with the top of the church tower in the lower part of the parish  immediately from the outside of the garden wall the grass spread away to a great distance and it was crossed by a path which came close to the wall  ever since her childhood it had been phylliss pleasure to clamber up this fence and sit on the topa feat not so difficult as it may seem the walls in this district being built of rubble without mortar so that there were plenty of crevices for small toes  she was sitting up here one day listlessly surveying the pasture without when her attention was arrested by a solitary figure walking along the path  it was one of the renowned german hussars and he moved onward with his eyes on the ground and with the manner of one who wished to escape company  his head would probably have been bent like his eyes but for his stiff neckgear  on nearer view she perceived that his face was marked with deep sadness  without observing her he advanced by the footpath till it brought him almost immediately under the wall  phyllis was much surprised to see a fine tall soldier in such a mood as this  her theory of the military and of the york hussars in particular derived entirely from hearsay for she had never talked to a soldier in her life was that their hearts were as gay as their accoutrements  at this moment the hussar lifted his eyes and noticed her on her perch the white muslin neckerchief which covered her shoulders and neck where left bare by her low gown and her white raiment in general showing conspicuously in the bright sunlight of this summer day  he blushed a little at the suddenness of the encounter and without halting a moment from his pace passed on  all that day the foreigners face haunted phyllis its aspect was so striking so handsome and his eyes were so blue and sad and abstracted  it was perhaps only natural that on some following day at the same hour she should look over that wall again and wait till he had passed a second time  on this occasion he was reading a letter and at the sight of her his manner was that of one who had half expected or hoped to discover her  he almost stopped smiled and made a courteous salute  the end of the meeting was that they exchanged a few words  she asked him what he was reading and he readily informed her that he was re perusing letters from his mother in germany he did not get them often he said and was forced to read the old ones a great many times  this was all that passed at the present interview but others of the same kind followed  phyllis used to say that his english though not good was quite intelligible to her so that their acquaintance was never hindered by difficulties of speech  whenever the subject became too delicate subtle or tender for such words of english as were at his command the eyes no doubt helped out the tongue andthough this was later onthe lips helped out the eyes  in short this acquaintance unguardedly made and rash enough on her part developed and ripened  like desdemona she pitied him and learnt his history  his name was matthaus tina and saarbruck his native town where his mother was still living  his age was twentytwo and he had already risen to the grade of corporal though he had not long been in the army phyllis used to assert that no such refined or welleducated young man could have been found in the ranks of the purely english regiments some of these foreign soldiers having rather the graceful manner and presence of our native officers than of our rank and file  she by degrees learnt from her foreign friend a circumstance about himself and his comrades which phyllis would least have expected of the york hussars  so far from being as gay as its uniform the regiment was pervaded by a dreadful melancholy a chronic homesickness which depressed many of the men to such an extent that they could hardly attend to their drill  the worst sufferers were the younger soldiers who had not been over here long  they hated england and english life they took no interest whatever in king george and his island kingdom and they only wished to be out of it and never to see it any more  their bodies were here but their hearts and minds were always far away in their dear fatherland of whichbrave men and stoical as they were in many waysthey would speak with tears in their eyes  one of the worst of the sufferers from this homewoe as he called it in his own tongue was matthaus tina whose dreamy musing nature felt the gloom of exile still more intensely from the fact that he had left a lonely mother at home with nobody to cheer her  though phyllis touched by all this and interested in his history did not disdain her soldiers acquaintance she declined according to her own account at least to permit the young man to overstep the line of mere friendship for a long whileas long indeed as she considered herself likely to become the possession of another though it is probable that she had lost her heart to matthaus before she was herself aware  the stone wall of necessity made anything like intimacy difficult and he had never ventured to come or to ask to come inside the garden so that all their conversation had been overtly conducted across this boundary    chapter iii   but news reached the village from a friend of phylliss father concerning mr humphrey gould her remarkably cool and patient betrothed  this gentleman had been heard to say in bath that he considered his overtures to miss phyllis grove to have reached only the stage of a halfunderstanding and in view of his enforced absence on his fathers account who was too great an invalid now to attend to his affairs he thought it best that there should be no definite promise as yet on either side  he was not sure indeed that he might not cast his eyes elsewhere  this accountthough only a piece of hearsay and as such entitled to no absolute credittallied so well with the infrequency of his letters and their lack of warmth that phyllis did not doubt its truth for one moment and from that hour she felt herself free to bestow her heart as she should choose  not so her father he declared the whole story to be a fabrication  he had known mr goulds family from his boyhood and if there was one proverb which expressed the matrimonial aspect of that family well it was love me little love me long  humphrey was an honourable man who would not think of treating his engagement so lightly  do you wait in patience he said all will be right enough in time  from these words phyllis at first imagined that her father was in correspondence with mr gould and her heart sank within her for in spite of her original intentions she had been relieved to hear that her engagement had come to nothing  but she presently learnt that her father had heard no more of humphrey gould than she herself had done while he would not write and address her affianced directly on the subject lest it should be deemed an imputation on that bachelors honour  you want an excuse for encouraging one or other of those foreign fellows to flatter you with his unmeaning attentions her father exclaimed his mood having of late been a very unkind one towards her  i see more than i say  dont you ever set foot outside that gardenfence without my permission  if you want to see the camp ill take you myself some sunday afternoon  phyllis had not the smallest intention of disobeying him in her actions but she assumed herself to be independent with respect to her feelings she no longer checked her fancy for the hussar though she was far from regarding him as her lover in the serious sense in which an englishman might have been regarded as such  the young foreign soldier was almost an ideal being to her with none of the appurtenances of an ordinary housedweller one who had descended she knew not whence and would disappear she knew not whither the subject of a fascinating dreamno more  they met continually nowmostly at duskduring the brief interval between the going down of the sun and the minute at which the last trumpetcall summoned him to his tent  perhaps her manner had become less restrained latterly at any rate that of the hussar was so he had grown more tender every day and at parting after these hurried interviews she reached down her hand from the top of the wall that he might press it  one evening he held it so long that she exclaimed the wall is white and somebody in the field may see your shape against it  he lingered so long that night that it was with the greatest difficulty that he could run across the intervening stretch of ground and enter the camp in time  on the next occasion of his awaiting her she did not appear in her usual place at the usual hour  his disappointment was unspeakably keen he remained staring blankly at the spot like a man in a trance  the trumpets and tattoo sounded and still he did not go  she had been delayed purely by an accident  when she arrived she was anxious because of the lateness of the hour having heard as well as he the sounds denoting the closing of the camp  she implored him to leave immediately  no he said gloomily  i shall not go in yetthe moment you comei have thought of your coming all day  but you may be disgraced at being after time  i dont mind that  i should have disappeared from the world some time ago if it had not been for two personsmy beloved here and my mother in saarbruck  i hate the army  i care more for a minute of your company than for all the promotion in the world  thus he stayed and talked to her and told her interesting details of his native place and incidents of his childhood till she was in a simmer of distress at his recklessness in remaining  it was only because she insisted on bidding him goodnight and leaving the wall that he returned to his quarters  the next time that she saw him he was without the stripes that had adorned his sleeve  he had been broken to the level of private for his lateness that night and as phyllis considered herself to be the cause of his disgrace her sorrow was great  but the position was now reversed it was his turn to cheer her  dont grieve meine liebliche he said  i have got a remedy for whatever comes  first even supposing i regain my stripes would your father allow you to marry a noncommissioned officer in the york hussars  she flushed  this practical step had not been in her mind in relation to such an unrealistic person as he was and a moments reflection was enough for it  my father would notcertainly would not she answered unflinchingly  it cannot be thought of  my dear friend please do forget me i fear i am ruining you and your prospects  not at all said he  you are giving this country of yours just sufficient interest to me to make me care to keep alive in it  if my dear land were here also and my old parent with you i could be happy as i am and would do my best as a soldier  but it is not so  and now listen  this is my plan  that you go with me to my own country and be my wife there and live there with my mother and me  i am not a hanoverian as you know though i entered the army as such my country is by the saar and is at peace with france and if i were once in it i should be free  but how get there she asked  phyllis had been rather amazed than shocked at his proposition  her position in her fathers house was growing irksome and painful in the extreme his parental affection seemed to be quite dried up  she was not a native of the village like all the joyous girls around her and in some way matthaus tina had infected her with his own passionate longing for his country and mother and home  but how she repeated finding that he did not answer  will you buy your discharge  ah no he said  thats impossible in these times  no i came here against my will why should i not escape  now is the time as we shall soon be striking camp and i might see you no more  this is my scheme  i will ask you to meet me on the highway two miles off on some calm night next week that may be appointed  there will be nothing unbecoming in it or to cause you shame you will not fly alone with me for i will bring with me my devoted young friend christoph an alsatian who has lately joined the regiment and who has agreed to assist in this enterprise  we shall have come from yonder harbour where we shall have examined the boats and found one suited to our purpose  christoph has already a chart of the channel and we will then go to the harbour and at midnight cut the boat from her moorings and row away round the point out of sight and by the next morning we are on the coast of france near cherbourg  the rest is easy for i have saved money for the land journey and can get a change of clothes  i will write to my mother who will meet us on the way  he added details in reply to her inquiries which left no doubt in phylliss mind of the feasibility of the undertaking  but its magnitude almost appalled her and it is questionable if she would ever have gone further in the wild adventure if on entering the house that night her father had not accosted her in the most significant terms  how about the york hussars he said  they are still at the camp but they are soon going away i believe  it is useless for you to attempt to cloak your actions in that way  you have been meeting one of those fellows you have been seen walking with himforeign barbarians not much better than the french themselves  i have made up my minddont speak a word till i have done pleasei have made up my mind that you shall stay here no longer while they are on the spot  you shall go to your aunts  it was useless for her to protest that she had never taken a walk with any soldier or man under the sun except himself  her protestations were feeble too for though he was not literally correct in his assertion he was virtually only half in error  the house of her fathers sister was a prison to phyllis  she had quite recently undergone experience of its gloom and when her father went on to direct her to pack what would be necessary for her to take her heart died within her  in after years she never attempted to excuse her conduct during this week of agitation but the result of her selfcommuning was that she decided to join in the scheme of her lover and his friend and fly to the country which he had coloured with such lovely hues in her imagination  she always said that the one feature in his proposal which overcame her hesitation was the obvious purity and straightforwardness of his intentions  he showed himself to be so virtuous and kind he treated her with a respect to which she had never before been accustomed and she was braced to the obvious risks of the voyage by her confidence in him    chapter iv   it was on a soft dark evening of the following week that they engaged in the adventure  tina was to meet her at a point in the highway at which the lane to the village branched off  christoph was to go ahead of them to the harbour where the boat lay row it round the notheor lookout as it was called in those daysand pick them up on the other side of the promontory which they were to reach by crossing the harbourbridge on foot and climbing over the lookout hill  as soon as her father had ascended to his room she left the house and bundle in hand proceeded at a trot along the lane  at such an hour not a soul was afoot anywhere in the village and she reached the junction of the lane with the highway unobserved  here she took up her position in the obscurity formed by the angle of a fence whence she could discern every one who approached along the turnpikeroad without being herself seen  she had not remained thus waiting for her lover longer than a minutethough from the tension of her nerves the lapse of even that short time was tryingwhen instead of the expected footsteps the stage coach could be heard descending the hill  she knew that tina would not show himself till the road was clear and waited impatiently for the coach to pass  nearing the corner where she was it slackened speed and instead of going by as usual drew up within a few yards of her  a passenger alighted and she heard his voice  it was humphrey goulds  he had brought a friend with him and luggage  the luggage was deposited on the grass and the coach went on its route to the royal wateringplace  i wonder where that young man is with the horse and trap said her former admirer to his companion  i hope we shant have to wait here long  i told him halfpast nine oclock precisely  have you got her present safe  phylliss  o yes  it is in this trunk  i hope it will please her  of course it will  what woman would not be pleased with such a handsome peaceoffering  wellshe deserves it  ive treated her rather badly  but she has been in my mind these last two days much more than i should care to confess to everybody  ah well ill say no more about that  it cannot be that she is so bad as they make out  i am quite sure that a girl of her good wit would know better than to get entangled with any of those hanoverian soldiers  i wont believe it of her and theres an end ont  more words in the same strain were casually dropped as the two men waited words which revealed to her as by a sudden illumination the enormity of her conduct  the conversation was at length cut off by the arrival of the man with the vehicle  the luggage was placed in it and they mounted and were driven on in the direction from which she had just come  phyllis was so consciencestricken that she was at first inclined to follow them but a moments reflection led her to feel that it would only be bare justice to matthaus to wait till he arrived and explain candidly that she had changed her minddifficult as the struggle would be when she stood face to face with him  she bitterly reproached herself for having believed reports which represented humphrey gould as false to his engagement when from what she now heard from his own lips she gathered that he had been living full of trust in her  but she knew well enough who had won her love  without him her life seemed a dreary prospect yet the more she looked at his proposal the more she feared to accept itso wild as it was so vague so venturesome  she had promised humphrey gould and it was only his assumed faithlessness which had led her to treat that promise as nought  his solicitude in bringing her these gifts touched her her promise must be kept and esteem must take the place of love  she would preserve her selfrespect  she would stay at home and marry him and suffer  phyllis had thus braced herself to an exceptional fortitude when a few minutes later the outline of matthaus tina appeared behind a fieldgate over which he lightly leapt as she stepped forward  there was no evading it he pressed her to his breast  it is the first and last time she wildly thought as she stood encircled by his arms  how phyllis got through the terrible ordeal of that night she could never clearly recollect  she always attributed her success in carrying out her resolve to her lovers honour for as soon as she declared to him in feeble words that she had changed her mind and felt that she could not dared not fly with him he forbore to urge her grieved as he was at her decision  unscrupulous pressure on his part seeing how romantically she had become attached to him would no doubt have turned the balance in his favour  but he did nothing to tempt her unduly or unfairly  on her side fearing for his safety she begged him to remain  this he declared could not be  i cannot break faith with my friend said he had he stood alone he would have abandoned his plan  but christoph with the boat and compass and chart was waiting on the shore the tide would soon turn his mother had been warned of his coming go he must  many precious minutes were lost while he tarried unable to tear himself away  phyllis held to her resolve though it cost her many a bitter pang  at last they parted and he went down the hill  before his footsteps had quite died away she felt a desire to behold at least his outline once more and running noiselessly after him regained view of his diminishing figure  for one moment she was sufficiently excited to be on the point of rushing forward and linking her fate with his  but she could not  the courage which at the critical instant failed cleopatra of egypt could scarcely be expected of phyllis grove  a dark shape similar to his own joined him in the highway  it was christoph his friend  she could see no more they had hastened on in the direction of the town and harbour four miles ahead  with a feeling akin to despair she turned and slowly pursued her way homeward  tattoo sounded in the camp but there was no camp for her now  it was as dead as the camp of the assyrians after the passage of the destroying angel  she noiselessly entered the house seeing nobody and went to bed  grief which kept her awake at first ultimately wrapped her in a heavy sleep the next morning her father met her at the foot of the stairs  mr gould is come he said triumphantly  humphrey was staying at the inn and had already called to inquire for her  he had brought her a present of a very handsome lookingglass in a frame of repousse silverwork which her father held in his hand  he had promised to call again in the course of an hour to ask phyllis to walk with him  pretty mirrors were rarer in countryhouses at that day than they are now and the one before her won phylliss admiration  she looked into it saw how heavy her eyes were and endeavoured to brighten them  she was in that wretched state of mind which leads a woman to move mechanically onward in what she conceives to be her allotted path  mr humphrey had in his undemonstrative way been adhering all along to the old understanding it was for her to do the same and to say not a word of her own lapse  she put on her bonnet and tippet and when he arrived at the hour named she was at the door awaiting him    chapter v   phyllis thanked him for his beautiful gift but the talking was soon entirely on humphreys side as they walked along  he told her of the latest movements of the world of fashiona subject which she willingly discussed to the exclusion of anything more personaland his measured language helped to still her disquieted heart and brain  had not her own sadness been what it was she must have observed his embarrassment  at last he abruptly changed the subject  i am glad you are pleased with my little present he said  the truth is that i brought it to propitiate ee and to get you to help me out of a mighty difficulty  it was inconceivable to phyllis that this independent bachelorwhom she admired in some respectscould have a difficulty  phyllisill tell you my secret at once for i have a monstrous secret to confide before i can ask your counsel  the case is then that i am married yes i have privately married a dear young belle and if you knew her and i hope you will you would say everything in her praise but she is not quite the one that my father would have chose for meyou know the paternal idea as well as iand i have kept it secret  there will be a terrible noise no doubt but i think that with your help i may get over it  if you would only do me this good turnwhen i have told my father i meansay that you never could have married me you know or something of that sortpon my life it will help to smooth the way vastly  i am so anxious to win him round to my point of view and not to cause any estrangement  what phyllis replied she scarcely knew or how she counselled him as to his unexpected situation  yet the relief that his announcement brought her was perceptible  to have confided her trouble in return was what her aching heart longed to do and had humphrey been a woman she would instantly have poured out her tale  but to him she feared to confess and there was a real reason for silence till a sufficient time had elapsed to allow her lover and his comrade to get out of harms way  as soon as she reached home again she sought a solitary place and spent the time in half regretting that she had not gone away and in dreaming over the meetings with matthaus tina from their beginning to their end in his own country amongst his own countrywomen he would possibly soon forget her even to her very name  her listlessness was such that she did not go out of the house for several days  there came a morning which broke in fog and mist behind which the dawn could be discerned in greenish grey and the outlines of the tents and the rows of horses at the ropes  the smoke from the canteen fires drooped heavily  the spot at the bottom of the garden where she had been accustomed to climb the wall to meet matthaus was the only inch of english ground in which she took any interest and in spite of the disagreeable haze prevailing she walked out there till she reached the wellknown corner every blade of grass was weighted with little liquid globes and slugs and snails had crept out upon the plots  she could hear the usual faint noises from the camp and in the other direction the trot of farmers on the road to the town for it was marketday  she observed that her frequent visits to this corner had quite trodden down the grass in the angle of the wall and left marks of garden soil on the steppingstones by which she had mounted to look over the top  seldom having gone there till dusk she had not considered that her traces might be visible by day  perhaps it was these which had revealed her trysts to her father  while she paused in melancholy regard she fancied that the customary sounds from the tents were changing their character  indifferent as phyllis was to camp doings now she mounted by the steps to the old place  what she beheld at first awed and perplexed her then she stood rigid her fingers hooked to the wall her eyes staring out of her head and her face as if hardened to stone  on the open green stretching before her all the regiments in the camp were drawn up in line in the midfront of which two empty coffins lay on the ground  the unwonted sounds which she had noticed came from an advancing procession  it consisted of the band of the york hussars playing a dead march next two soldiers of that regiment in a mourning coach guarded on each side and accompanied by two priests  behind came a crowd of rustics who had been attracted by the event  the melancholy procession marched along the front of the line returned to the centre and halted beside the coffins where the two condemned men were blindfolded and each placed kneeling on his coffin a few minutes pause was now given while they prayed  a firingparty of twentyfour men stood ready with levelled carbines  the commanding officer who had his sword drawn waved it through some cuts of the swordexercise till he reached the downward stroke whereat the firingparty discharged their volley  the two victims fell one upon his face across his coffin the other backwards  as the volley resounded there arose a shriek from the wall of dr groves garden and some one fell down inside but nobody among the spectators without noticed it at the time  the two executed hussars were matthaus tina and his friend christoph  the soldiers on guard placed the bodies in the coffins almost instantly but the colonel of the regiment an englishman rode up and exclaimed in a stern voice turn them outas an example to the men  the coffins were lifted endwise and the dead germans flung out upon their faces on the grass  then all the regiments wheeled in sections and marched past the spot in slow time  when the survey was over the corpses were again coffined and borne away  meanwhile dr grove attracted by the noise of the volley had rushed out into his garden where he saw his wretched daughter lying motionless against the wall  she was taken indoors but it was long before she recovered consciousness and for weeks they despaired of her reason  it transpired that the luckless deserters from the york hussars had cut the boat from her moorings in the adjacent harbour according to their plan and with two other comrades who were smarting under illtreatment from their colonel had sailed in safety across the channel  but mistaking their bearings they steered into jersey thinking that island the french coast  here they were perceived to be deserters and delivered up to the authorities  matthaus and christoph interceded for the other two at the courtmartial saying that it was entirely by the formers representations that these were induced to go  their sentence was accordingly commuted to flogging the death punishment being reserved for their leaders  the visitor to the wellknown old georgian wateringplace who may care to ramble to the neighbouring village under the hills and examine the register of burials will there find two entries in these words     matthtina corpl in his majestys regmt of york hussars and    shot for desertion was buried june 30th 1801 aged 22 years  born    in the town of sarrbruk germany     christoph bless belonging to his majestys regmt of york hussars    who was shot for desertion was buried june 30th 1801 aged 22 years    born at lothaargen alsatia  their graves were dug at the back of the little church near the wall there is no memorial to mark the spot but phyllis pointed it out to me while she lived she used to keep their mounds neat but now they are overgrown with nettles and sunk nearly flat  the older villagers however who know of the episode from their parents still recollect the place where the soldiers lie  phyllis lies near  october 1889     the fiddler of the reels   talking of exhibitions worlds fairs and what not said the old gentleman i would not go round the corner to see a dozen of them nowadays  the only exhibition that ever made or ever will make any impression upon my imagination was the first of the series the parent of them all and now a thing of old timesthe great exhibition of 1851 in hyde park london  none of the younger generation can realize the sense of novelty it produced in us who were then in our prime  a noun substantive went so far as to become an adjective in honour of the occasion  it was exhibition hat exhibition razorstrop exhibition watch nay even exhibition weather exhibition spirits sweethearts babies wivesfor the time  for south wessex the year formed in many ways an extraordinary chronological frontier or transitline at which there occurred what one might call a precipice in time  as in a geological fault we had presented to us a sudden bringing of ancient and modern into absolute contact such as probably in no other single year since the conquest was ever witnessed in this part of the country  these observations led us onward to talk of the different personages gentle and simple who lived and moved within our narrow and peaceful horizon at that time and of three people in particular whose queer little history was oddly touched at points by the exhibition more concerned with it than that of anybody else who dwelt in those outlying shades of the world stickleford mellstock and egdon  first in prominence among these three came wat ollamoorif that were his real namewhom the seniors in our party had known well  he was a womans man they saidsupremely soexternally little else to men be was not attractive perhaps a little repulsive at times musician dandy and companyman in practice veterinary surgeon in theory he lodged awhile in mellstock village coming from nobody knew where though some said his first appearance in this neighbourhood had been as fiddleplayer in a show at greenhill fair  many a worthy villager envied him his power over unsophisticated maidenhooda power which seemed sometimes to have a touch of the weird and wizardly in it  personally he was not illfavoured though rather un english his complexion being a rich olive his rank hair dark and rather clammymade still clammier by secret ointments which when he came fresh to a party caused him to smell like boyslove southernwood steeped in lampoil  on occasion he wore curlsa double rowrunning almost horizontally around his head  but as these were sometimes noticeably absent it was concluded that they were not altogether of natures making  by girls whose love for him had turned to hatred he had been nicknamed mop from this abundance of hair which was long enough to rest upon his shoulders as time passed the name more and more prevailed  his fiddling possibly had the most to do with the fascination he exercised for to speak fairly it could claim for itself a most peculiar and personal quality like that in a moving preacher  there were tones in it which bred the immediate conviction that indolence and averseness to systematic application were all that lay between mop and the career of a second paganini  while playing he invariably closed his eyes using no notes and as it were allowing the violin to wander on at will into the most plaintive passages ever heard by rustic man  there was a certain lingual character in the supplicatory expressions he produced which would well nigh have drawn an ache from the heart of a gatepost  he could make any child in the parish who was at all sensitive to music burst into tears in a few minutes by simply fiddling one of the old dancetunes he almost entirely affectedcountry jigs reels and favourite quick steps of the last centurysome mutilated remains of which even now reappear as nameless phantoms in new quadrilles and gallops where they are recognized only by the curious or by such oldfashioned and farbetween people as have been thrown with men like wat ollamoor in their early life  his date was a little later than that of the old mellstock quireband which comprised the dewys mail and the restin fact he did not rise above the horizon thereabout till those wellknown musicians were disbanded as ecclesiastical functionaries  in their honest love of thoroughness they despised the new mans style  theophilus dewy reuben the tranters younger brother used to say there was no plumness in itno bowing no solidityit was all fantastical  and probably this was true  anyhow mop had very obviously never bowed a note of church music from his birth he never once sat in the gallery of mellstock church where the others had tuned their venerable psalmody so many hundreds of times had never in all likelihood entered a church at all all were devils tunes in his repertory  he could no more play the wold hundredth to his true time than he could play the brazen serpent the tranter would say  the brazen serpent was supposed in mellstock to be a musical instrument particularly hard to blow  occasionally mop could produce the aforesaid moving effect upon the souls of grownup persons especially young women of fragile and responsive organization  such an one was carline aspent  though she was already engaged to be married before she met him carline of them all was the most influenced by mop ollamoors heartstealing melodies to her discomfort nay positive pain and ultimate injury  she was a pretty invocating weakmouthed girl whose chief defect as a companion with her sex was a tendency to peevishness now and then  at this time she was not a resident in mellstock parish where mop lodged but lived some miles off at stickleford farther down the river  how and where she first made acquaintance with him and his fiddling is not truly known but the story was that it either began or was developed on one spring evening when in passing through lower mellstock she chanced to pause on the bridge near his house to rest herself and languidly leaned over the parapet  mop was standing on his doorstep as was his custom spinning the insidious thread of semi and demisemiquavers from the e string of his fiddle for the benefit of passersby and laughing as the tears rolled down the cheeks of the little children hanging around him  carline pretended to be engrossed with the rippling of the stream under the arches but in reality she was listening as he knew  presently the aching of the heart seized her simultaneously with a wild desire to glide airily in the mazes of an infinite dance  to shake off the fascination she resolved to go on although it would be necessary to pass him as he played  on stealthily glancing ahead at the performer she found to her relief that his eyes were closed in abandonment to instrumentation and she strode on boldly but when closer her step grew timid her tread convulsed itself more and more accordantly with the time of the melody till she very nearly danced along  gaining another glance at him when immediately opposite she saw that one of his eyes was open quizzing her as he smiled at her emotional state  her gait could not divest itself of its compelled capers till she had gone a long way past the house and carline was unable to shake off the strange infatuation for hours  after that day whenever there was to be in the neighbourhood a dance to which she could get an invitation and where mop ollamoor was to be the musician carline contrived to be present though it sometimes involved a walk of several miles for he did not play so often in stickleford as elsewhere  the next evidences of his influence over her were singular enough and it would require a neurologist to fully explain them  she would be sitting quietly any evening after dark in the house of her father the parish clerk which stood in the middle of stickleford village street this being the highroad between lower mellstock and moreford five miles eastward  here without a moments warning and in the midst of a general conversation between her father sister and the young man before alluded to who devotedly wooed her in ignorance of her infatuation she would start from her seat in the chimneycorner as if she had received a galvanic shock and spring convulsively towards the ceiling then she would burst into tears and it was not till some halfhour had passed that she grew calm as usual  her father knowing her hysterical tendencies was always excessively anxious about this trait in his youngest girl and feared the attack to be a species of epileptic fit not so her sister julia  julia had found out what was the cause  at the moment before the jumping only an exceptionally sensitive ear situated in the chimneynook could have caught from down the flue the beat of a mans footstep along the highway without  but it was in that footfall for which she had been waiting that the origin of carlines involuntary springing lay  the pedestrian was mop ollamoor as the girl well knew but his business that way was not to visit her he sought another woman whom he spoke of as his intended and who lived at moreford two miles farther on  on one and only one occasion did it happen that carline could not control her utterance it was when her sister alone chanced to be present  ohohoh she cried  hes going to her and not coming to me  to do the fiddler justice he had not at first thought greatly of or spoken much to this girl of impressionable mould  but he had soon found out her secret and could not resist a little byplay with her too easily hurt heart as an interlude between his more serious performances at moreford  the two became well acquainted though only by stealth hardly a soul in stickleford except her sister and her lover ned hipcroft being aware of the attachment  her father disapproved of her coldness to ned her sister too hoped she might get over this nervous passion for a man of whom so little was known  the ultimate result was that carlines manly and simple wooer edward found his suit becoming practically hopeless  he was a respectable mechanic in a far sounder position than mop the nominal horsedoctor but when before leaving her ned put his flat and final question would she marry him then and there now or never it was with little expectation of obtaining more than the negative she gave him  though her father supported him and her sister supported him he could not play the fiddle so as to draw your soul out of your body like a spiders thread as mop did till you felt as limp as withy wind and yearned for something to cling to  indeed hipcroft had not the slightest ear for music could not sing two notes in tune much less play them  the no he had expected and got from her in spite of a preliminary encouragement gave ned a new start in life  it had been uttered in such a tone of sad entreaty that he resolved to persecute her no more she should not even be distressed by a sight of his form in the distant perspective of the street and lane  he left the place and his natural course was to london  the railway to south wessex was in process of construction but it was not as yet opened for traffic and hipcroft reached the capital by a six days trudge on foot as many a better man had done before him  he was one of the last of the artisan class who used that now extinct method of travel to the great centres of labour so customary then from time immemorial  in london he lived and worked regularly at his trade  more fortunate than many his disinterested willingness recommended him from the first during the ensuing four years he was never out of employment  he neither advanced nor receded in the modern sense he improved as a workman but he did not shift one jot in social position  about his love for carline he maintained a rigid silence  no doubt he often thought of her but being always occupied and having no relations at stickleford he held no communication with that part of the country and showed no desire to return  in his quiet lodging in lambeth he moved about after working hours with the facility of a woman doing his own cooking attending to his stockingheels and shaping himself by degrees to a lifelong bachelorhood  for this conduct one is bound to advance the canonical reason that time could not efface from his heart the image of little carline aspentand it may be in part true but there was also the inference that his was a nature not greatly dependent upon the ministrations of the other sex for its comforts  the fourth year of his residence as a mechanic in london was the year of the hydepark exhibition already mentioned and at the construction of this huge glasshouse then unexampled in the worlds history he worked daily  it was an era of great hope and activity among the nations and industries  though hipcroft was in his small way a central man in the movement he plodded on with his usual outward placidity  yet for him too the year was destined to have its surprises for when the bustle of getting the building ready for the opening day was past the ceremonies had been witnessed and people were flocking thither from all parts of the globe he received a letter from carline  till that day the silence of four years between himself and stickleford had never been broken  she informed her old lover in an uncertain penmanship which suggested a trembling hand of the trouble she had been put to in ascertaining his address and then broached the subject which had prompted her to write four years ago she said with the greatest delicacy of which she was capable she had been so foolish as to refuse him  her wilful wrongheadedness had since been a grief to her many times and of late particularly  as for mr ollamoor he had been absent almost as long as nedshe did not know where  she would gladly marry ned now if he were to ask her again and be a tender little wife to him till her lifes end  a tide of warm feeling must have surged through ned hipcrofts frame on receipt of this news if we may judge by the issue  unquestionably he loved her still even if not to the exclusion of every other happiness this from his carline she who had been dead to him these many years alive to him again as of old was in itself a pleasant gratifying thing ned had grown so resigned to or satisfied with his lonely lot that he probably would not have shown much jubilation at anything  still a certain ardour of preoccupation after his first surprise revealed how deeply her confession of faith in him had stirred him  measured and methodical in his ways he did not answer the letter that day nor the next nor the next  he was having a good think  when he did answer it there was a great deal of sound reasoning mixed in with the unmistakable tenderness of his reply but the tenderness itself was sufficient to reveal that he was pleased with her straightforward frankness that the anchorage she had once obtained in his heart was renewable if it had not been continuously firm  he told herand as he wrote his lips twitched humorously over the few gentle words of raillery he indited among the rest of his sentencesthat it was all very well for her to come round at this time of day  why wouldnt she have him when he wanted her  she had no doubt learned that he was not married but suppose his affections had since been fixed on another  she ought to beg his pardon  still he was not the man to forget her  but considering how he had been used and what he had suffered she could not quite expect him to go down to stickleford and fetch her  but if she would come to him and say she was sorry as was only fair why yes he would marry her knowing what a good little woman she was at the core  he added that the request for her to come to him was a less one to make than it would have been when he first left stickleford or even a few months ago for the new railway into south wessex was now open and there had just begun to be run wonderfully contrived special trains called excursiontrains on account of the great exhibition so that she could come up easily alone  she said in her reply how good it was of him to treat her so generously after her hot and cold treatment of him that though she felt frightened at the magnitude of the journey and was never as yet in a railwaytrain having only seen one pass at a distance she embraced his offer with all her heart and would indeed own to him how sorry she was and beg his pardon and try to be a good wife always and make up for lost time  the remaining details of when and where were soon settled carline informing him for her ready identification in the crowd that she would be wearing my new spriggedlaylock cotton gown and ned gaily responding that having married her the morning after her arrival he would make a day of it by taking her to the exhibition  one early summer afternoon accordingly he came from his place of work and hastened towards waterloo station to meet her  it was as wet and chilly as an english june day can occasionally be but as he waited on the platform in the drizzle he glowed inwardly and seemed to have something to live for again  the excursiontrainan absolutely new departure in the history of travelwas still a novelty on the wessex line and probably everywhere crowds of people had flocked to all the stations on the way up to witness the unwonted sight of so long a trains passage even where they did not take advantage of the opportunity it offered  the seats for the humbler class of travellers in these early experiments in steamlocomotion were open trucks without any protection whatever from the wind and rain and damp weather having set in with the afternoon the unfortunate occupants of these vehicles were on the train drawing up at the london terminus found to be in a pitiable condition from their long journey bluefaced stiffnecked sneezing rainbeaten chilled to the marrow many of the men being hatless in fact they resembled people who had been out all night in an open boat on a rough sea rather than inland excursionists for pleasure  the women had in some degree protected themselves by turning up the skirts of their gowns over their heads but as by this arrangement they were additionally exposed about the hips they were all more or less in a sorry plight  in the bustle and crush of alighting forms of both sexes which followed the entry of the huge concatenation into the station ned hipcroft soon discerned the slim little figure his eye was in search of in the sprigged lilac as described  she came up to him with a frightened smilestill pretty though so damp weatherbeaten and shivering from long exposure to the wind  o ned she sputtered ii  he clasped her in his arms and kissed her whereupon she burst into a flood of tears  you are wet my poor dear  i hope youll not get cold he said  and surveying her and her multifarious surrounding packages he noticed that by the hand she led a toddling childa little girl of three or sowhose hood was as clammy and tender face as blue as those of the other travellers  who is thissomebody you know asked ned curiously  yes ned  shes mine  yours  yesmy own  your own child  yes  wellas gods in  ned i didnt name it in my letter because you see it would have been so hard to explain  i thought that when we met i could tell you how she happened to be born so much better than in writing  i hope youll excuse it this once dear ned and not scold me now ive come so many many miles  this means mr mop ollamoor i reckon said hipcroft gazing palely at them from the distance of the yard or two to which he had withdrawn with a start  carline gasped  but hes been gone away for years she supplicated and i never had a young man before  and i was so onlucky to be catched the first time though some of the girls down there go on like anything  ned remained in silence pondering  youll forgive me dear ned she added beginning to sob outright  i havent taken ee in after all becausebecause you can pack us back again if you want to though tis hundreds o miles and so wet and night acoming on and i with no money  what the devil can i do hipcroft groaned  a more pitiable picture than the pair of helpless creatures presented was never seen on a rainy day as they stood on the great gaunt puddled platform a whiff of drizzle blowing under the roof upon them now and then the pretty attire in which they had started from stickleford in the early morning bemuddled and sodden weariness on their faces and fear of him in their eyes for the child began to look as if she thought she too had done some wrong remaining in an appalled silence till the tears rolled down her chubby cheeks  whats the matter my little maid said ned mechanically  i do want to go home she let out in tones that told of a bursting heart  and my totties be cold an i shant have no bread an butter no more  i dont know what to say to it all declared ned his own eye moist as he turned and walked a few steps with his head down then regarded them again point blank  from the child escaped troubled breaths and silently welling tears  want some bread and butter do ee he said with factitious hardness  yees  well i daresay i can get ee a bit  naturally you must want some  and you too for that matter carline  i do feel a little hungered  but i can keep it off she murmured  folk shouldnt do that he said gruffly    there come along he caught up the child as he added you must bide here tonight anyhow i spose  what can you do otherwise  ill get ee some tea and victuals and as for this job im sure i dont know what to say  this is the way out  they pursued their way without speaking to neds lodgings which were not far off  there he dried them and made them comfortable and prepared tea they thankfully sat down  the readymade household of which he suddenly found himself the head imparted a cosy aspect to his room and a paternal one to himself  presently he turned to the child and kissed her now blooming cheeks and looking wistfully at carline kissed her also  i dont see how i can send ee back all them miles he growled now youve come all the way o purpose to join me  but you must trust me carline and show youve real faith in me  well do you feel better now my little woman  the child nodded her mouth being otherwise occupied  i did trust you ned in coming and i shall always  thus without any definite agreement to forgive her he tacitly acquiesced in the fate that heaven had sent him and on the day of their marriage which was not quite so soon as he had expected it could be on account of the time necessary for banns he took her to the exhibition when they came back from church as he had promised  while standing near a large mirror in one of the courts devoted to furniture carline started for in the glass appeared the reflection of a form exactly resembling mop ollamoorsso exactly that it seemed impossible to believe anybody but that artist in person to be the original  on passing round the objects which hemmed in ned her and the child from a direct view no mop was to be seen  whether he were really in london or not at that time was never known and carline always stoutly denied that her readiness to go and meet ned in town arose from any rumour that mop had also gone thither which denial there was no reasonable ground for doubting  and then the year glided away and the exhibition folded itself up and became a thing of the past  the park trees that had been enclosed for six months were again exposed to the winds and storms and the sod grew green anew  ned found that carline resolved herself into a very good wife and companion though she had made herself what is called cheap to him but in that she was like another domestic article a cheap teapot which often brews better tea than a dear one  one autumn hipcroft found himself with but little work to do and a prospect of less for the winter  both being country born and bred they fancied they would like to live again in their natural atmosphere  it was accordingly decided between them that they should leave the pentup london lodging and that ned should seek out employment near his native place his wife and her daughter staying with carlines father during the search for occupation and an abode of their own  tinglings of pleasure pervaded carlines spasmodic little frame as she journeyed down with ned to the place she had left two or three years before in silence and under a cloud  to return to where she had once been despised a smiling london wife with a distinct london accent was a triumph which the world did not witness every day  the train did not stop at the petty roadside station that lay nearest to stickleford and the trio went on to casterbridge  ned thought it a good opportunity to make a few preliminary inquiries for employment at workshops in the borough where he had been known and feeling cold from her journey and it being dry underfoot and only dusk as yet with a moon on the point of rising carline and her little girl walked on toward stickleford leaving ned to follow at a quicker pace and pick her up at a certain halfway house widely known as an inn  the woman and child pursued the wellremembered way comfortably enough though they were both becoming wearied  in the course of three miles they had passed heedlesswilliams pond the familiar landmark by blooms end and were drawing near the quiet woman inn a lone roadside hostel on the lower verge of the egdon heath since and for many years abolished in stepping up towards it carline heard more voices within than had formerly been customary at such an hour and she learned that an auction of fat stock had been held near the spot that afternoon  the child would be the better for a rest as well as herself she thought and she entered  the guests and customers overflowed into the passage and carline had no sooner crossed the threshold than a man whom she remembered by sight came forward with glass and mug in his hands towards a friend leaning against the wall but seeing her very gallantly offered her a drink of the liquor which was ginandbeer hot pouring her out a tumblerful and saying in a moment or two surely tis little carline aspent that wasdown at stickleford  she assented and though she did not exactly want this beverage she drank it since it was offered and her entertainer begged her to come in farther and sit down  once within the room she found that all the persons present were seated close against the walls and there being a chair vacant she did the same  an explanation of their position occurred the next moment  in the opposite corner stood mop rosining his bow and looking just the same as ever  the company had cleared the middle of the room for dancing and they were about to dance again  as she wore a veil to keep off the wind she did not think he had recognized her or could possibly guess the identity of the child and to her satisfied surprise she found that she could confront him quite calmlymistress of herself in the dignity her london life had given her  before she had quite emptied her glass the dance was called the dancers formed in two lines the music sounded and the figure began  then matters changed for carline  a tremor quickened itself to life in her and her hand so shook that she could hardly set down her glass  it was not the dance nor the dancers but the notes of that old violin which thrilled the london wife these having still all the witchery that she had so well known of yore and under which she had used to lose her power of independent will  how it all came back  there was the fiddling figure against the wall the large oily moplike head of him and beneath the mop the face with closed eyes  after the first moments of paralyzed reverie the familiar tune in the familiar rendering made her laugh and shed tears simultaneously  then a man at the bottom of the dance whose partner had dropped away stretched out his hand and beckoned to her to take the place  she did not want to dance she entreated by signs to be left where she was but she was entreating of the tune and its player rather than of the dancing man  the saltatory tendency which the fiddler and his cunning instrument had ever been able to start in her was seizing carline just as it had done in earlier years possibly assisted by the ginandbeer hot  tired as she was she grasped her little girl by the hand and plunging in at the bottom of the figure whirled about with the rest  she found that her companions were mostly people of the neighbouring hamlets and farmsblooms end mellstock lewgate and elsewhere and by degrees she was recognized as she convulsively danced on wishing that mop would cease and let her heart rest from the aching he caused and her feet also  after long and many minutes the dance ended when she was urged to fortify herself with more ginandbeer which she did feeling very weak and overpowered with hysteric emotion  she refrained from unveiling to keep mop in ignorance of her presence if possible  several of the guests having left carline hastily wiped her lips and also turned to go but according to the account of some who remained at that very moment a fivehanded reel was proposed in which two or three begged her to join  she declined on the plea of being tired and having to walk to stickleford when mop began aggressively tweedling my fancylad in d major as the air to which the reel was to be footed  he must have recognized her though she did not know it for it was the strain of all seductive strains which she was least able to resistthe one he had played when she was leaning over the bridge at the date of their first acquaintance  carline stepped despairingly into the middle of the room with the other four  reels were resorted to hereabouts at this time by the more robust spirits for the reduction of superfluous energy which the ordinary figuredances were not powerful enough to exhaust  as everybody knows or does not know the five reelers stood in the form of a cross the reel being performed by each line of three alternately the persons who successively came to the middle place dancing in both directions carline soon found herself in this place the axis of the whole performance and could not get out of it the tune turning into the first part without giving her opportunity  and now she began to suspect that mop did know her and was doing this on purpose though whenever she stole a glance at him his closed eyes betokened obliviousness to everything outside his own brain  she continued to wend her way through the figure of 8 that was formed by her course the fiddler introducing into his notes the wild and agonizing sweetness of a living voice in one too highly wrought its pathos running high and running low in endless variation projecting through her nerves excruciating spasms a sort of blissful torture  the room swam the tune was endless and in about a quarter of an hour the only other woman in the figure dropped out exhausted and sank panting on a bench  the reel instantly resolved itself into a fourhanded one  carline would have given anything to leave off but she had or fancied she had no power while mop played such tunes and thus another ten minutes slipped by a haze of dust now clouding the candles the floor being of stone sanded  then another dancer fell outone of the menand went into the passage in a frantic search for liquor  to turn the figure into a threehanded reel was the work of a second mop modulating at the same time into the fairy dance as better suited to the contracted movement and no less one of those foods of love which as manufactured by his bow had always intoxicated her  in a reel for three there was no rest whatever and four or five minutes were enough to make her remaining two partners now thoroughly blown stamp their last bar and like their predecessors limp off into the next room to get something to drink  carline halfstifled inside her veil was left dancing alone the apartment now being empty of everybody save herself mop and their little girl  she flung up the veil and cast her eyes upon him as if imploring him to withdraw himself and his acoustic magnetism from the atmosphere  mop opened one of his own orbs as though for the first time fixed it peeringly upon her and smiling dreamily threw into his strains the reserve of expression which he could not afford to waste on a big and noisy dance  crowds of little chromatic subtleties capable of drawing tears from a statue proceeded straightway from the ancient fiddle as if it were dying of the emotion which had been pent up within it ever since its banishment from some italian city where it first took shape and sound  there was that in the look of mops one dark eye which said you cannot leave off dear whether you would or no and it bred in her a paroxysm of desperation that defied him to tire her down  she thus continued to dance alone defiantly as she thought but in truth slavishly and abjectly subject to every wave of the melody and probed by the gimletlike gaze of her fascinators open eye keeping up at the same time a feeble smile in his face as a feint to signify it was still her own pleasure which led her on  a terrified embarrassment as to what she could say to him if she were to leave off had its unrecognized share in keeping her going  the child who was beginning to be distressed by the strange situation came up and said stop mother stop and lets go home as she seized carlines hand  suddenly carline sank staggering to the floor and rolling over on her face prone she remained  mops fiddle thereupon emitted an elfin shriek of finality stepping quickly down from the ninegallon beercask which had formed his rostrum he went to the little girl who disconsolately bent over her mother  the guests who had gone into the backroom for liquor and change of air hearing something unusual trooped back hitherward where they endeavoured to revive poor weak carline by blowing her with the bellows and opening the window  ned her husband who had been detained in casterbridge as aforesaid came along the road at this juncture and hearing excited voices through the open casement and to his great surprise the mention of his wifes name he entered amid the rest upon the scene  carline was now in convulsions weeping violently and for a long time nothing could be done with her  while he was sending for a cart to take her onward to stickleford hipcroft anxiously inquired how it had all happened and then the assembly explained that a fiddler formerly known in the locality had lately revisited his old haunts and had taken upon himself without invitation to play that evening at the inn  ned demanded the fiddlers name and they said ollamoor  ah exclaimed ned looking round him  where is he and wherewheres my little girl  ollamoor had disappeared and so had the child  hipcroft was in ordinary a quiet and tractable fellow but a determination which was to be feared settled in his face now  blast him he cried  ill beat his skull in forn if i swing for it tomorrow  he had rushed to the poker which lay on the hearth and hastened down the passage the people following  outside the house on the other side of the highway a mass of dark heathland rose sullenly upward to its not easily accessible interior a ravined plateau whereon jutted into the sky at the distance of a couple of miles the firwoods of mistover backed by the yalbury coppicesa place of dantesque gloom at this hour which would have afforded secure hiding for a battery of artillery much less a man and a child  some other men plunged thitherward with him and more went along the road  they were gone about twenty minutes altogether returning without result to the inn  ned sat down in the settle and clasped his forehead with his hands  wellwhat a fool the man is and hev been all these years if he thinks the child his as a do seem to they whispered  and everybody else knowing otherwise  no i dont think tis mine cried ned hoarsely as he looked up from his hands  but she is mine all the same  hant i nussed her  hant i fed her and teached her  hant i played wi her  o little carrygone with that roguegone  you hant lost your misess anyhow they said to console him  shes throwed up the sperrits and she is feeling better and shes more to ee than a child that isnt yours  she isnt  shes not so particular much to me especially now shes lost the little maid  but carrys everything  well ver like youll find her tomorrow  ahbut shall i  yet he cant hurt hersurely he cant  wellhows carline now  i am ready  is the cart here  she was lifted into the vehicle and they sadly lumbered on toward stickleford  next day she was calmer but the fits were still upon her and her will seemed shattered  for the child she appeared to show singularly little anxiety though ned was nearly distracted  it was nevertheless quite expected that the impish mop would restore the lost one after a freak of a day or two but time went on and neither he nor she could be heard of and hipcroft murmured that perhaps he was exercising upon her some unholy musical charm as he had done upon carline herself  weeks passed and still they could obtain no clue either to the fiddlers whereabouts or the girls and how he could have induced her to go with him remained a mystery  then ned who had obtained only temporary employment in the neighbourhood took a sudden hatred toward his native district and a rumour reaching his ears through the police that a somewhat similar man and child had been seen at a fair near london he playing a violin she dancing on stilts a new interest in the capital took possession of hipcroft with an intensity which would scarcely allow him time to pack before returning thither  he did not however find the lost one though he made it the entire business of his overhours to stand about in bystreets in the hope of discovering her and would start up in the night saying that rascals torturing her to maintain him  to which his wife would answer peevishly dont ee raft yourself so ned  you prevent my getting a bit o rest  he wont hurt her and fall asleep again  that carry and her father had emigrated to america was the general opinion mop no doubt finding the girl a highly desirable companion when he had trained her to keep him by her earnings as a dancer  there for that matter they may be performing in some capacity now though he must be an old scamp verging on threescoreandten and she a woman of fourandforty  may 1893     a tradition of eighteen hundred and four   the widely discussed possibility of an invasion of england through a channel tunnel has more than once recalled old solomon selbys story to my mind  the occasion on which i numbered myself among his audience was one evening when he was sitting in the yawning chimneycorner of the innkitchen with some others who had gathered there and i entered for shelter from the rain  withdrawing the stem of his pipe from the dental notch in which it habitually rested he leaned back in the recess behind him and smiled into the fire  the smile was neither mirthful nor sad not precisely humorous nor altogether thoughtful  we who knew him recognized it in a moment it was his narrative smile  breaking off our few desultory remarks we drew up closer and he thus began  my father as you mid know was a shepherd all his life and lived out by the cove four miles yonder where i was born and lived likewise till i moved here shortly afore i was married  the cottage that first knew me stood on the top of the down near the sea there was no house within a mile and a half of it it was built o purpose for the farmshepherd and had no other use  they tell me that it is now pulled down but that you can see where it stood by the mounds of earth and a few broken bricks that are still lying about  it was a bleak and dreary place in winter time but in summer it was well enough though the garden never came to much because we could not get up a good shelter for the vegetables and currant bushes and where there is much wind they dont thrive  of all the years of my growing up the ones that bide clearest in my mind were eighteen hundred and three four and five  this was for two reasons i had just then grown to an age when a childs eyes and ears take in and note down everything about him and there was more at that date to bear in mind than there ever has been since with me  it was as i need hardly tell ye the time after the first peace when bonaparte was scheming his descent upon england  he had crossed the great alp mountains fought in egypt drubbed the turks the austrians and the proossians and now thought hed have a slap at us  on the other side of the channel scarce out of sight and hail of a man standing on our english shore the french army of a hundred and sixty thousand men and fifteen thousand horses had been brought together from all parts and were drilling every day  bonaparte had been three years amaking his preparations and to ferry these soldiers and cannon and horses across he had contrived a couple of thousand flatbottomed boats  these boats were small things but wonderfully built  a good few of em were so made as to have a little stable on board each for the two horses that were to haul the cannon carried at the stern  to get in order all these and other things required he had assembled there five or six thousand fellows that worked at tradescarpenters blacksmiths wheelwrights saddlers and what not  o twas a curious time  every morning neighbour boney would muster his multitude of soldiers on the beach draw em up in line practise em in the manoeuvre of embarking horses and all till they could do it without a single hitch my father drove a flock of ewes up into sussex that year and as he went along the drovers track over the high downs thereabout he could see this drilling actually going onthe accoutrements of the rank and file glittering in the sun like silver  it was thought and always said by my uncle job sergeant of foot who used to know all about these matters that bonaparte meant to cross with oars on a calm night  the grand query with us was where would my gentleman land  many of the common people thought it would be at dover others who knew how unlikely it was that any skilful general would make a business of landing just where he was expected said hed go either east into the river thames or westard to some convenient place most likely one of the little bays inside the isle of portland between the beal and st albans headand for choice the threequarterround cove screened from every mortal eye that seemed made o purpose out by where we lived and which ive climmed up with two tubs of brandy across my shoulders on scores o dark nights in my younger days  some had heard that a part o the french fleet would sail right round scotland and come up the channel to a suitable haven however there was much doubt upon the matter and no wonder for after years proved that bonaparte himself could hardly make up his mind upon that great and very particular point where to land  his uncertainty came about in this wise that he could get no news as to where and how our troops lay in waiting and that his knowledge of possible places where flatbottomed boats might be quietly run ashore and the men they brought marshalled in order was dim to the last degree  being flatbottomed they didnt require a harbour for unshipping their cargo of men but a good shelving beach away from sight and with a fair open road toward london  how the question posed that great corsican tyrant as we used to call him what pains he took to settle it and above all what a risk he ran on one particular night in trying to do so were known only to one man here and there and certainly to no maker of newspapers or printer of books or my account ot would not have had so many heads shaken over it as it has by gentry who only believe what they see in printed lines  the flocks my father had charge of fed all about the downs near our house overlooking the sea and shore each way for miles  in winter and early spring father was up a deal at nights watching and tending the lambing  often hed go to bed early and turn out at twelve or one and on the other hand hed sometimes stay up till twelve or one and then turn in to bed  as soon as i was old enough i used to help him mostly in the way of keeping an eye upon the ewes while he was gone home to rest  this is what i was doing in a particular month in either the year four or fivei cant certainly fix which but it was long before i was took away from the sheepkeeping to be bound prentice to a trade  every night at that time i was at the fold about half a mile or it may be a little more from our cottage and no living thing at all with me but the ewes and young lambs  afeard  no i was never afeard of being alone at these times for i had been reared in such an outstep place that the lack o human beings at night made me less fearful than the sight of em directly i saw a mans shape after dark in a lonely place i was frightened out of my senses  one day in that month we were surprised by a visit from my uncle job the sergeant in the sixtyfirst foot then in camp on the downs above king georges wateringplace several miles to the west yonder  uncle job dropped in about dusk and went up with my father to the fold for an hour or two  then he came home had a drop to drink from the tub of sperrits that the smugglers kept us in for housing their liquor when theyd made a run and for burning em off when there was danger  after that he stretched himself out on the settle to sleep  i went to bed at one oclock father came home and waking me to go and take his place according to custom went to bed himself  on my way out of the house i passed uncle job on the settle  he opened his eyes and upon my telling him where i was going he said it was a shame that such a youngster as i should go up there all alone and when he had fastened up his stock and waistbelt he set off along with me taking a drop from the sperrittub in a little flat bottle that stood in the cornercupboard  by and by we drew up to the fold saw that all was right and then to keep ourselves warm curled up in a heap of straw that lay inside the thatched hurdles we had set up to break the stroke of the wind when there was any  tonight however there was none  it was one of those very still nights when if you stand on the high hills anywhere within two or three miles of the sea you can hear the rise and fall of the tide along the shore coming and going every few moments like a sort of great snore of the sleeping world  over the lower ground there was a bit of a mist but on the hill where we lay the air was clear and the moon then in her last quarter flung a fairly good light on the grass and scattered straw  while we lay there uncle job amused me by telling me strange stories of the wars he had served in and the wownds he had got  he had already fought the french in the low countries and hoped to fight em again  his stories lasted so long that at last i was hardly sure that i was not a soldier myself and had seen such service as he told of  the wonders of his tales quite bewildered my mind till i fell asleep and dreamed of battle smoke and flying soldiers all of a kind with the doings he had been bringing up to me  how long my nap lasted i am not prepared to say  but some faint sounds over and above the rustle of the ewes in the straw the bleat of the lambs and the tinkle of the sheepbell brought me to my waking senses uncle job was still beside me but he too had fallen asleep  i looked out from the straw and saw what it was that had aroused me  two men in boatcloaks cocked hats and swords stood by the hurdles about twenty yards off  i turned my ear thitherward to catch what they were saying but though i heard every word ot not one did i understand  they spoke in a tongue that was not oursin french as i afterward found  but if i could not gain the meaning of a word i was shrewd boy enough to find out a deal of the talkers business  by the light o the moon i could see that one of em carried a roll of paper in his hand while every moment he spoke quick to his comrade and pointed right and left with the other hand to spots along the shore  there was no doubt that he was explaining to the second gentleman the shapes and features of the coast  what happened soon after made this still clearer to me  all this time i had not waked uncle job but now i began to be afeared that they might light upon us because uncle breathed so heavily throughs nose  i put my mouth to his ear and whispered uncle job  what is it my boy he said just as if he hadnt been asleep at all  hush says i  two french generals  french says he  yes says i  come to see where to land their army  i pointed em out but i could say no more for the pair were coming at that moment much nearer to where we lay  as soon as they got as near as eight or ten yards the officer with a roll in his hand stooped down to a slanting hurdle unfastened his roll upon it and spread it out  then suddenly he sprung a dark lantern open on the paper and showed it to be a map  what be they looking at i whispered to uncle job  a chart of the channel says the sergeant knowing about such things  the other french officer now stooped likewise and over the map they had a long consultation as they pointed here and there on the paper and then hither and thither at places along the shore beneath us  i noticed that the manner of one officer was very respectful toward the other who seemed much his superior the second in rank calling him by a sort of title that i did not know the sense of  the head one on the other hand was quite familiar with his friend and more than once clapped him on the shoulder  uncle job had watched as well as i but though the map had been in the lanternlight their faces had always been in shade  but when they rose from stooping over the chart the light flashed upward and fell smart upon one of ems features  no sooner had this happened than uncle job gasped and sank down as if hed been in a fit  what is itwhat is it uncle job said i  o good god says he under the straw  what says i  boney he groaned out  who says i  bonaparty he said  the corsican ogre  o that i had got but my new flinted firelock that there man should die  but i havent got my new flinted firelock and that there man must live  so lie low as you value your life  i did lie low as you mid suppose  but i couldnt help peeping  and then i too lad as i was knew that it was the face of bonaparte  not know boney  i should think i did know boney  i should have known him by half the light o that lantern  if i had seen a picture of his features once i had seen it a hundred times  there was his bullet head his short neck his round yaller cheeks and chin his gloomy face and his great glowing eyes  he took off his hat to blow himself a bit and there was the forelock in the middle of his forehead as in all the draughts of him  in moving his cloak fell a little open and i could see for a moment his whitefronted jacket and one of his epaulets  but none of this lasted long  in a minute he and his general had rolled up the map shut the lantern and turned to go down toward the shore  then uncle job came to himself a bit  slipped across in the nighttime to see how to put his men ashore he said  the like o that mans coolness eyes will never again see  nephew i must act in this and immediate or englands lost  when they were over the brow we crope out and went some little way to look after them  halfway down they were joined by two others and six or seven minutes brought them to the shore  then from behind a rock a boat came out into the weak moonlight of the cove and they jumped in it put off instantly and vanished in a few minutes between the two rocks that stand at the mouth of the cove as we all know  we climmed back to where we had been before and i could see a little way out a larger vessel though still not very large  the little boat drew up alongside was made fast at the stern as i suppose for the largest sailed away and we saw no more  my uncle job told his officers as soon as he got back to camp but what they thought of it i never heardneither did he  boneys army never came and a good job for me for the cove below my fathers house was where he meant to land as this secret visit showed  we coastfolk should have been cut down one and all and i should not have sat here to tell this tale  we who listened to old selby that night have been familiar with his simple gravestone for these ten years past  thanks to the incredulity of the age his tale has been seldom repeated  but if anything short of the direct testimony of his own eyes could persuade an auditor that bonaparte had examined these shores for himself with a view to a practicable landingplace it would have been solomon selbys manner of narrating the adventure which befell him on the down  christmas 1882     a few crusted characters   it is a saturday afternoon of blue and yellow autumn time and the scene is the high street of a wellknown markettown  a large carriers van stands in the quadrangular forecourt of the white hart inn upon the sides of its spacious tilt being painted in weatherbeaten letters burthen carrier to longpuddle  these vans so numerous hereabout are a respectable if somewhat lumbering class of conveyance much resorted to by decent travellers not overstocked with money the better among them roughly corresponding to the old french diligences  the present one is timed to leave the town at four in the afternoon precisely and it is now halfpast three by the clock in the turret at the top of the street  in a few seconds errandboys from the shops begin to arrive with packages which they fling into the vehicle and turn away whistling and care for the packages no more  at twenty minutes to four an elderly woman places her basket upon the shafts slowly mounts takes up a seat inside and folds her hands and her lips  she has secured her corner for the journey though there is as yet no sign of a horse being put in nor of a carrier  at the threequarters two other women arrive in whom the first recognizes the postmistress of upper longpuddle and the registrars wife they recognizing her as the aged groceress of the same village  at five minutes to the hour there approach mr profitt the schoolmaster in a soft felt hat and christopher twink the masterthatcher and as the hour strikes there rapidly drop in the parish clerk and his wife the seedsman and his aged father the registrar also mr day the worldignored local landscapepainter an elderly man who resides in his native place and has never sold a picture outside it though his pretensions to art have been nobly supported by his fellow villagers whose confidence in his genius has been as remarkable as the outer neglect of it leading them to buy his paintings so extensively at the price of a few shillings each it is true that every dwelling in the parish exhibits three or four of those admired productions on its walls  burthen the carrier is by this time seen bustling round the vehicle the horses are put in the proprietor arranges the reins and springs up into his seat as if he were used to itwhich he is  is everybody here he asks preparatorily over his shoulder to the passengers within  as those who were not there did not reply in the negative the muster was assumed to be complete and after a few hitches and hindrances the van with its human freight was got under way  it jogged on at an easy pace till it reached the bridge which formed the last outpost of the town  the carrier pulled up suddenly  bless my soul he said ive forgot the curate  all who could do so gazed from the little back window of the van but the curate was not in sight  now i wonder where that there man is continued the carrier  poor man he ought to have a living at his time of life  and he ought to be punctual said the carrier  four oclock sharp is my time for starting i said to en  and he said ill be there  now hes not here and as a serious old churchminister he ought to be as good as his word  perhaps mr flaxton knows being in the same line of life  he turned to the parish clerk  i was talking an immense deal with him thats true half an hour ago replied that ecclesiastic as one of whom it was no erroneous supposition that he should be on intimate terms with another of the cloth  but he didnt say he would be late  the discussion was cut off by the appearance round the corner of the van of rays from the curates spectacles followed hastily by his face and a few white whiskers and the swinging tails of his long gaunt coat  nobody reproached him seeing how he was reproaching himself and he entered breathlessly and took his seat  now be we all here said the carrier again  they started a second time and moved on till they were about three hundred yards out of the town and had nearly reached the second bridge behind which as every native remembers the road takes a turn and travellers by this highway disappear finally from the view of gazing burghers  well as im alive cried the postmistress from the interior of the conveyance peering through the little square backwindow along the road townward  what said the carrier  a man hailing us  another sudden stoppage  somebody else the carrier asked  ay sure  all waited silently while those who could gaze out did so  now who can that be burthen continued  i just put it to ye neighbours can any man keep time with such hindrances  baint we full aready  who in the world can the man be  hes a sort of gentleman said the schoolmaster his position commanding the road more comfortably than that of his comrades  the stranger who had been holding up his umbrella to attract their notice was walking forward leisurely enough now that he found by their stopping that it had been secured  his clothes were decidedly not of a local cut though it was difficult to point out any particular mark of difference  in his left hand he carried a small leather travelling bag as soon as he had overtaken the van he glanced at the inscription on its side as if to assure himself that he had hailed the right conveyance and asked if they had room  the carrier replied that though they were pretty well laden he supposed they could carry one more whereupon the stranger mounted and took the seat cleared for him within  and then the horses made another move this time for good and swung along with their burden of fourteen souls all told  you baint one of these parts sir said the carrier  i could tell that as far as i could see ee  yes i am one of these parts said the stranger  oh  hm  the silence which followed seemed to imply a doubt of the truth of the newcomers assertion  i was speaking of upper longpuddle more particular continued the carrier hardily and i think i know most faces of that valley  i was born at longpuddle and nursed at longpuddle and my father and grandfather before me said the passenger quietly  why to be sure said the aged groceress in the background it isnt john lacklands sonneverit cant behe who went to foreign parts fiveandthirty years ago with his wife and family  yetwhat do i hearthats his fathers voice  thats the man replied the stranger  john lackland was my father and i am john lacklands son  fiveandthirty years ago when i was a boy of eleven my parents emigrated across the seas taking me and my sister with them  kytess boy tony was the one who drove us and our belongings to casterbridge on the morning we left and his was the last longpuddle face i saw  we sailed the same week across the ocean and there weve been ever since and there ive left those i went withall three  alive or dead  dead he replied in a low voice  and i have come back to the old place having nourished a thoughtnot a definite intention but just a thoughtthat i should like to return here in a year or two to spend the remainder of my days  married man mr lackland  no  and have the world used ee well siror rather john knowing ee as a child  in these rich new countries that we hear of so much youve got rich with the rest  i am not very rich mr lackland said  even in new countries you know there are failures  the race is not always to the swift nor the battle to the strong and even if it sometimes is you may be neither swift nor strong  however thats enough about me  now having answered your inquiries you must answer mine for being in london i have come down here entirely to discover what longpuddle is looking like and who are living there  that was why i preferred a seat in your van to hiring a carriage for driving across  well as for longpuddle we rub on there much as usual  old figures have dropped out o their frames so to speak it and new ones have been put in their places  you mentioned tony kytes as having been the one to drive your family and your goods to casterbridge in his fathers waggon when you left  tony is i believe living still but not at longpuddle he went away and settled at lewgate near mellstock after his marriage ah tony was a sort o man  his character had hardly come out when i knew him  no  but twas well enough as far as that goesexcept as to women  i shall never forget his courtingnever  the returned villager waited silently and the carrier went on    tony kytes the archdeceiver   i shall never forget tonys face  twas a little round firm tight face with a seam here and there left by the smallpox but not enough to hurt his looks in a womans eye though hed had it badish when he was a boy  so very serious looking and unsmiling a was that young man that it really seemed as if he couldnt laugh at all without great pain to his conscience  he looked very hard at a small speck in your eye when talking to ee  and there was no more sign of a whisker or beard on tony kytess face than on the palm of my hand  he used to sing the tailors breeches with a religious manner as if it were a hymn     o the petticoats went off and the breeches they went on  and all the rest of the scandalous stuff  he was quite the womens favourite and in return for their likings he loved em in shoals  but in course of time tony got fixed down to one in particular milly richards a nice light small tender little thing and it was soon said that they were engaged to be married  one saturday he had been to market to do business for his father and was driving home the waggon in the afternoon  when he reached the foot of the very hill we shall be going over in ten minutes who should he see waiting for him at the top but unity sallet a handsome girl one of the young women hed been very tender toward before hed got engaged to milly  as soon as tony came up to her she said my dear tony will you give me a lift home  that i will darling said tony  you dont suppose i could refuse ee  she smiled a smile and up she hopped and on drove tony  tony she says in a sort of tender chide why did ye desert me for that other one  in what is she better than i  i should have made ee a finer wife and a more loving one too  tisnt girls that are so easily won at first that are the best  think how long weve known each otherever since we were children almostnow havent we tony  yes that we have says tony astruck with the truth ot  and youve never seen anything in me to complain of have ye tony  now tell the truth to me  i never have upon my life says tony  andcan you say im not pretty tony  now look at me  he let his eyes light upon her for a long while  i really cant says he  in fact i never knowed you was so pretty before  prettier than she  what tony would have said to that nobody knows for before he could speak what should he see ahead over the hedge past the turning but a feather he knew wellthe feather in millys hatshe to whom he had been thinking of putting the question as to giving out the banns that very week  unity says he as mild as he could heres milly coming  now i shall catch it mightily if she sees ee riding here with me and if you get down shell be turning the corner in a moment and seeing ee in the road shell know weve been coming on together  now dearest unity will ye to avoid all unpleasantness which i know ye cant bear any more than i will ye lie down in the back part of the waggon and let me cover you over with the tarpaulin till milly has passed  it will all be done in a minute  doand ill think over what weve said and perhaps i shall put a loving question to you after all instead of to milly tisnt true that it is all settled between her and me  well unity sallet agreed and lay down at the back end of the waggon and tony covered her over so that the waggon seemed to be empty but for the loose tarpaulin and then he drove on to meet milly  my dear tony cries milly looking up with a little pout at him as he came near  how long youve been coming home  just as if i didnt live at upper longpuddle at all  and ive come to meet you as you asked me to do and to ride back with you and talk over our future homesince you asked me and i promised  but i shouldnt have come else mr tony  ay my dear i did ask yeto be sure i did now i think of itbut i had quite forgot it  to ride back with me did you say dear milly  well of course  what can i do else  surely you dont want me to walk now ive come all this way  o no no  i was thinking you might be going on to town to meet your mother  i saw her thereand she looked as if she might be expecting ee  o no shes just home  she came across the fields and so got back before you  ah  i didnt know that says tony  and there was no help for it but to take her up beside him  they talked on very pleasantly and looked at the trees and beasts and birds and insects and at the ploughmen at work in the fields till presently who should they see looking out of the upper window of a house that stood beside the road they were following but hannah jolliver another young beauty of the place at that time and the very first woman that tony had fallen in love withbefore milly and before unity in factthe one that he had almost arranged to marry instead of milly  she was a much more dashing girl than milly richards though hed not thought much of her of late  the house hannah was looking from was her aunts  my dear millymy coming wife as i may call ee says tony in his modest way and not so loud that unity could overhear i see a young woman alooking out of window who i think may accost me  the fact is milly she had a notion that i was wishing to marry her and since shes discovered ive promised another and a prettier than she im rather afeard of her temper if she sees us together  now milly would you do me a favourmy coming wife as i may say  certainly dearest tony says she  then would ye creep under the empty sacks just here in the front of the waggon and hide there out of sight till weve passed the house  she hasnt seen us yet  you see we ought to live in peace and goodwill since tis almost christmas and twill prevent angry passions rising which we always should do  i dont mind to oblige you tony milly said and though she didnt care much about doing it she crept under and crouched down just behind the seat unity being snug at the other end  so they drove on till they got near the roadside cottage  hannah had soon seen him coming and waited at the window looking down upon him  she tossed her head a little disdainful and smiled offhand  well arent you going to be civil enough to ask me to ride home with you she says seeing that he was for driving past with a nod and a smile  ah to be sure  what was i thinking of said tony in a flutter  but you seem as if you was staying at your aunts  no i am not she said  dont you see i have my bonnet and jacket on  i have only called to see her on my way home  how can you be so stupid tony  in that caseahof course you must come along wi me says tony feeling a dim sort of sweat rising up inside his clothes  and he reined in the horse and waited till shed come downstairs and then helped her up beside him  he drove on again his face as long as a face that was a round one by nature well could be  hannah looked round sideways into his eyes  this is nice isnt it tony she says  i like riding with you  tony looked back into her eyes  and i with you he said after a while  in short having considered her he warmed up and the more he looked at her the more he liked her till he couldnt for the life of him think why he had ever said a word about marriage to milly or unity while hannah jolliver was in question  so they sat a little closer and closer their feet upon the footboard and their shoulders touching and tony thought over and over again how handsome hannah was  he spoke tenderer and tenderer and called her dear hannah in a whisper at last  youve settled it with milly by this time i suppose said she  nno not exactly  what  how low you talk tony  yesive a kind of hoarseness  i said not exactly  i suppose you mean to  well as to that  his eyes rested on her face and hers on his  he wondered how he could have been such a fool as not to follow up hannah my sweet hannah he bursts out taking her hand not being really able to help it and forgetting milly and unity and all the world besides settled it  i dont think i have  hark says hannah  what says tony letting go her hand  surely i heard a sort of little screaming squeak under those sacks why youve been carrying corn and theres mice in this waggon i declare  she began to haul up the tails of her gown  oh no tis the axle said tony in an assuring way  it do go like that sometimes in dry weather  perhaps it was    well now to be quite honest dear tony do you like her better than me  becausebecause although ive held off so independent ill own at last that i do like ee tony to tell the truth and i wouldnt say no if you asked meyou know what  tony was so won over by this pretty offering mood of a girl who had been quite the reverse hannah had a backward way with her at times if you can mind that he just glanced behind and then whispered very soft i havent quite promised her and i think i can get out of it and ask you that question you speak of  throw over millyall to marry me  how delightful broke out hannah quite loud clapping her hands  at this there was a real squeakan angry spiteful squeak and afterward a long moan as if something had broke its heart and a movement of the empty sacks  somethings there said hannah starting up  its nothing really says tony in a soothing voice and praying inwardly for a way out of this  i wouldnt tell ee at first because i wouldnt frighten ee  but hannah ive really a couple of ferrets in a bag under there for rabbiting and they quarrel sometimes  i dont wish it knowed as twould be called poaching  oh they cant get out bless yeyou are quite safe  andandwhat a fine day it is isnt it hannah for this time of year  be you going to market next saturday  how is your aunt now  and so on says tony to keep her from talking any more about love in millys hearing  but he found his work cut out for him and wondering again how he should get out of this ticklish business he looked about for a chance  nearing home he saw his father in a field not far off holding up his hand as if he wished to speak to tony  would you mind taking the reins a moment hannah he said much relieved while i go and find out what father wants  she consented and away he hastened into the field only too glad to get breathing time  he found that his father was looking at him with rather a stern eye  come come tony says old mr kytes as soon as his son was alongside him this wont do you know  what says tony  why if you mean to marry milly richards do it and theres an end ot  but dont go driving about the country with jollivers daughter and making a scandal  i wont have such things done  i only asked herthat is she asked me to ride home  she  why now if it had been milly twould have been quite proper but you and hannah jolliver going about by yourselves  millys there too father  milly  where  under the cornsacks  yes the truth is father ive got rather into a nunnywatch im afeard  unity sallet is there tooyes at the other end under the tarpaulin  all three are in that waggon and what to do with em i know no more than the dead  the best plan is as im thinking to speak out loud and plain to one of em before the rest and that will settle it not but what twill cause em to kick up a bit of a miff for certain  now which would you marry father if you was in my place  whichever of em did not ask to ride with thee  that was milly im bound to say as she only mounted by my invitation but milly  then stick to milly shes the best    but look at that  his father pointed toward the waggon  she cant hold that horse in you shouldnt have left the reins in her hands  run on and take the horses head or therell be some accident to them maids  tonys horse in fact in spite of hannahs tugging at the reins had started on his way at a brisk walking pace being very anxious to get back to the stable for he had had a long day out  without another word tony rushed away from his father to overtake the horse  now of all things that could have happened to wean him from milly there was nothing so powerful as his fathers recommending her  no it could not be milly after all  hannah must be the one since he could not marry all three  this he thought while running after the waggon  but queer things were happening inside it  it was of course milly who had screamed under the sackbags being obliged to let off her bitter rage and shame in that way at what tony was saying and never daring to show for very pride and dread o being laughed at that she was in hiding  she became more and more restless and in twisting herself about what did she see but another womans foot and white stocking close to her head  it quite frightened her not knowing that unity sallet was in the waggon likewise  but after the fright was over she determined to get to the bottom of all this and she crept arid crept along the bed of the waggon under the tarpaulin like a snake when lo and behold she came face to face with unity  well if this isnt disgraceful says milly in a raging whisper to unity  tis says unity to see you hiding in a young mans waggon like this and no great character belonging to either of ye  mind what you are saying replied milly getting louder  i am engaged to be married to him and havent i a right to be here  what right have you i should like to know  what has he been promising you  a pretty lot of nonsense i expect  but what tony says to other women is all mere wind and no concern to me  dont you be too sure says unity  hes going to have hannah and not you nor me either i could hear that  now at these strange voices sounding from under the cloth hannah was thunderstruck amost into a swound and it was just at this time that the horse moved on  hannah tugged away wildly not knowing what she was doing and as the quarrel rose louder and louder hannah got so horrified that she let go the reins altogether  the horse went on at his own pace and coming to the corner where we turn round to drop down the hill to lower longpuddle he turned too quick the off wheels went up the bank the waggon rose sideways till it was quite on edge upon the near axles and out rolled the three maidens into the road in a heap  when tony came up frightened and breathless he was relieved enough to see that neither of his darlings was hurt beyond a few scratches from the brambles of the hedge  but he was rather alarmed when he heard how they were going on at one another  dont ye quarrel my dearsdont ye says he taking off his hat out of respect to em  and then he would have kissed them all round as fair and square as a man could but they were in too much of a taking to let him and screeched and sobbed till they was quite spent  now ill speak out honest because i ought to says tony as soon as he could get heard  and this is the truth says he  ive asked hannah to be mine and she is willing and we are going to put up the banns next  tony had not noticed that hannahs father was coming up behind nor had he noticed that hannahs face was beginning to bleed from the scratch of a bramble  hannah had seen her father and had run to him crying worse than ever  my daughter is not willing sir says mr jolliver hot and strong be you willing hannah  i ask ye to have spirit enough to refuse him if yer virtue is left to ee and you run no risk  shes as sound as a bell for me that ill swear says tony flaring up  and sos the others come to that though you may think it an onusual thing in me  i have spirit and i do refuse him says hannah partly because her father was there and partly too in a tantrum because of the discovery and the scratch on her face  little did i think when i was so soft with him just now that i was talking to such a false deceiver  what you wont have me hannah says tony his jaw hanging down like a dead mans  neveri would sooner marry nonobody at all she gasped out though with her heart in her throat for she would not have refused tony if he had asked her quietly and her father had not been there and her face had not been scratched by the bramble  and having said that away she walked upon her fathers arm thinking and hoping he would ask her again  tony didnt know what to say next  milly was sobbing her heart out but as his father had strongly recommended her he couldnt feel inclined that way  so he turned to unity  well will you unity dear be mine he says  take her leavings  not i says unity  id scorn it  and away walks unity sallet likewise though she looked back when shed gone some way to see if he was following her  so there at last were left milly and tony by themselves she crying in watery streams and tony looking like a tree struck by lightning  well milly he says at last going up to her it do seem as if fate had ordained that it should be you and i or nobody  and what must be must be i suppose  hey milly  if you like tony  you didnt really mean what you said to them  not a word of it declares tony bringing down his fist upon his palm  and then he kissed her and put the waggon to rights and they mounted together and their banns were put up the very next sunday  i was not able to go to their wedding but it was a rare party they had by all account  everybody in longpuddle was there almost you among the rest i think mr flaxton  the speaker turned to the parish clerk  i was said mr flaxton  and that party was the cause of a very curious change in some other peoples affairs i mean in steve hardcomes and his cousin jamess  ah the hardcomes said the stranger  how familiar that name is to me  what of them  the clerk cleared his throat and began    the history of the hardcomes   yes tonys was the very best weddingrandy that ever i was at and ive been at a good many as you may supposeturning to the newlyarrived onehaving as a churchofficer the privilege to attend all christening wedding and funeral partiessuch being our wessex custom  twas on a frosty night in christmas week and among the folk invited were the said hardcomes o climmerstonsteve and jamesfirst cousins both of them small farmers just entering into business on their own account  with them came as a matter of course their intended wives two young women of the neighbourhood both very pretty and sprightly maidens and numbers of friends from abbotscernel and weatherbury and mellstock and i dont know wherea regular houseful  the kitchen was cleared of furniture for dancing and the old folk played at put and allfours in the parlour though at last they gave that up to join in the dance  the top of the figure was by the large front window of the room and there were so many couples that the lower part of the figure reached through the door at the back and into the darkness of the outhouse in fact you couldnt see the end of the row at all and twas never known exactly how long that dance was the lowest couples being lost among the faggots and brushwood in the outhouse  when we had danced a few hours and the crowns of we taller men were swelling into lumps with bumping the beams of the ceiling the first fiddler laid down his fiddlebow and said he should play no more for he wished to dance  and in another hour the second fiddler laid down his and said he wanted to dance too so there was only the third fiddler left and he was a old veteran man very weak in the wrist  however he managed to keep up a faltering tweedledee but there being no chair in the room and his knees being as weak as his wrists he was obliged to sit upon as much of the little cornertable as projected beyond the cornercupboard fixed over it which was not a very wide seat for a man advanced in years  among those who danced most continually were the two engaged couples as was natural to their situation  each pair was very well matched and very unlike the other  james hardcomes intended was called emily darth and both she and james were gentle niceminded indoor people fond of a quiet life  steve and his chosen named olive pawle were different they were of a more bustling nature fond of racketing about and seeing what was going on in the world  the two couples had arranged to get married on the same day and that not long thence tonys wedding being a sort of stimulant as is often the case ive noticed it professionally many times  they danced with such a will as only young people in that stage of courtship can dance and it happened that as the evening wore on james had for his partner stephens plighted one olive at the same time that stephen was dancing with jamess emily  it was noticed that in spite o the exchange the young men seemed to enjoy the dance no less than before by and by they were treading another tune in the same changed order as we had noticed earlier and though at first each one had held the others mistress strictly at halfarms length lest there should be shown any objection to too close quarters by the ladys proper man as time passed there was a little more closeness between em and presently a little more closeness still  the later it got the more did each of the two cousins dance with the wrong young girl and the tighter did he hold her to his side as he whirled her round and what was very remarkable neither seemed to mind what the other was doing  the party began to draw towards its end and i saw no more that night being one of the first to leave on account of my mornings business  but i learnt the rest of it from those that knew  after finishing a particularly warming dance with the changed partners as ive mentioned the two young men looked at one another and in a moment or two went out into the porch together  james says steve what were you thinking of when you were dancing with my olive  well said james perhaps what you were thinking of when you were dancing with my emily  i was thinking said steve with some hesitation that i wouldnt mind changing for good and all  it was what i was feeling likewise said james  i willingly agree to it if you think we could manage it  so do i  but what would the girls say  tis my belief said steve that they wouldnt particularly object your emily clung as close to me as if she already belonged to me dear girl  and your olive to me says james  i could feel her heart beating like a clock  well they agreed to put it to the girls when they were all four walking home together  and they did so  when they parted that night the exchange was decided onall having been done under the hot excitement of that evenings dancing  thus it happened that on the following sunday morning when the people were sitting in church with mouths wide open to hear the names published as they had expected there was no small amazement to hear them coupled the wrong way as it seemed  the congregation whispered and thought the parson had made a mistake till they discovered that his reading of the names was verily the true way  as they had decided so they were married each one to the others original property  well the two couples lived on for a year or two ordinarily enough till the time came when these young people began to grow a little less warm to their respective spouses as is the rule of married life and the two cousins wondered more and more in their hearts what had made em so mad at the last moment to marry crosswise as they did when they might have married straight as was planned by nature and as they had fallen in love  twas tonys party that had done it plain enough and they half wished they had never gone there  james being a quiet fireside perusing man felt at times a wide gap between himself and olive his wife who loved riding and driving and outdoor jaunts to a degree while steve who was always knocking about hither and thither had a very domestic wife who worked samplers and made hearthrugs scarcely ever wished to cross the threshold and only drove out with him to please him  however they said very little about this mismating to any of their acquaintances though sometimes steve would look at jamess wife and sigh and james would look at steves wife and do the same  indeed at last the two men were frank enough towards each other not to mind mentioning it quietly to themselves in a longfaced sorrysmiling whimsical sort of way and would shake their heads together over their foolishness in upsetting a wellconsidered choice on the strength of an hours fancy in the whirl and wildness of a dance  still they were sensible and honest young fellows enough and did their best to make shift with their lot as they had arranged it and not to repine at what could not now be altered or mended  so things remained till one fine summer day they went for their yearly little outing together as they had made it their custom to do for a long while past  this year they chose budmouthregis as the place to spend their holiday in and off they went in their best clothes at nine oclock in the morning  when they had reached budmouthregis they walked two and two along the shoretheir new boots going squeakitysquash upon the clammy velvet sands  i can seem to see em now  then they looked at the ships in the harbour and then went up to the lookout and then had dinner at an inn and then again walked two and two squeakitysquash upon the velvet sands  as evening drew on they sat on one of the public seats upon the esplanade and listened to the band and then they said what shall we do next  of all things said olive mrs james hardcome that is i should like to row in the bay  we could listen to the music from the water as well as from here and have the fun of rowing besides  the very thing so should i says stephen his tastes being always like hers  here the clerk turned to the curate  but you sir know the rest of the strange particulars of that strange evening of their lives better than anybody else having had much of it from their own lips which i had not and perhaps youll oblige the gentleman  certainly if it is wished said the curate  and he took up the clerks tale        stephens wife hated the sea except from land and couldnt bear the thought of going into a boat  james too disliked the water and said that for his part he would much sooner stay on and listen to the band in the seat they occupied though he did not wish to stand in his wifes way if she desired a row  the end of the discussion was that james and his cousins wife emily agreed to remain where they were sitting and enjoy the music while they watched the other two hire a boat just beneath and take their waterexcursion of half an hour or so till they should choose to come back and join the sitters on the esplanade when they would all start homeward together  nothing could have pleased the other two restless ones better than this arrangement and emily and james watched them go down to the boatman below and choose one of the little yellow skiffs and walk carefully out upon the little plank that was laid on trestles to enable them to get alongside the craft  they saw stephen hand olive in and take his seat facing her when they were settled they waved their hands to the couple watching them and then stephen took the pair of sculls and pulled off to the tune beat by the band she steering through the other boats skimming about for the sea was as smooth as glass that evening and pleasureseekers were rowing everywhere  how pretty they look moving on dont they said emily to james as ive been assured  they both enjoy it equally  in everything their likings are the same  thats true said james  they would have made a handsome pair if they had married said she  yes said he  tis a pity we should have parted em  dont talk of that james said she  for better or for worse we decided to do as we did and theres an end of it  they sat on after that without speaking side by side and the band played as before the people strolled up and down and stephen and olive shrank smaller and smaller as they shot straight out to sea  the two on shore used to relate how they saw stephen stop rowing a moment and take off his coat to get at his work better but jamess wife sat quite still in the stern holding the tillerropes by which she steered the boat when they had got very small indeed she turned her head to shore  she is waving her handkerchief to us said stephens wife who thereupon pulled out her own and waved it as a return signal  the boats course had been a little awry while mrs james neglected her steering to wave her handkerchief to her husband and mrs stephen but now the light skiff went straight onward again and they could soon see nothing more of the two figures it contained than olives light mantle and stephens white shirt sleeves behind  the two on the shore talked on  twas very curiousour changing partners at tony kytess wedding emily declared  tony was of a fickle nature by all account and it really seemed as if his character had infected us that night  which of you two was it that first proposed not to marry as we were engaged  hmi cant remember at this moment says james  we talked it over you know and no sooner said than done  twas the dancing said she  people get quite crazy sometimes in a dance  they do he owned  jamesdo you think they care for one another still asks mrs stephen  james hardcome mused and admitted that perhaps a little tender feeling might flicker up in their hearts for a moment now and then  still nothing of any account he said  i sometimes think that olive is in steves mind a good deal murmurs mrs stephen particularly when she pleases his fancy by riding past our window at a gallop on one of the draughthorses    i never could do anything of that sort i could never get over my fear of a horse  and i am no horseman though i pretend to be on her account murmured james hardcome  but isnt it almost time for them to turn and sweep round to the shore as the other boating folk have done  i wonder what olive means by steering away straight to the horizon like that  she has hardly swerved from a direct line seaward since they started  no doubt they are talking and dont think of where they are going suggests stephens wife  perhaps so said james  i didnt know steve could row like that  o yes says she  he often comes here on business and generally has a pull round the bay  i can hardly see the boat or them says james again and it is getting dark  the heedless pair afloat now formed a mere speck in the films of the coming night which thickened apace till it completely swallowed up their distant shapes  they had disappeared while still following the same straight course away from the world of landlivers as if they were intending to drop over the seaedge into space and never return to earth again  the two on the shore continued to sit on punctually abiding by their agreement to remain on the same spot till the others returned  the esplanade lamps were lit one by one the bandsmen folded up their stands and departed the yachts in the bay hung out their riding lights and the little boats came back to shore one after another their hirers walking on to the sands by the plank they had climbed to go afloat but among these stephen and olive did not appear  what a time they are said emily  i am getting quite chilly  i did not expect to have to sit so long in the evening air  thereupon james hardcome said that he did not require his overcoat and insisted on lending it to her  he wrapped it round emilys shoulders  thank you james she said  how cold olive must be in that thin jacket  he said he was thinking so too  well they are sure to be quite close at hand by this time though we cant see em  the boats are not all in yet  some of the rowers are fond of paddling along the shore to finish out their hour of hiring  shall we walk by the edge of the water said she to see if we can discover them  he assented reminding her that they must not lose sight of the seat lest the belated pair should return and miss them and be vexed that they had not kept the appointment  they walked a sentry beat up and down the sands immediately opposite the seat and still the others did not come  james hardcome at last went to the boatman thinking that after all his wife and cousin might have come in under shadow of the dusk without being perceived and might have forgotten the appointment at the bench  all in asked james  all but one boat said the lessor  i cant think where that couple is keeping to  they might run foul of something or other in the dark  again stephens wife and olives husband waited with more and more anxiety  but no little yellow boat returned  was it possible they could have landed further down the esplanade  it may have been done to escape paying said the boatowner  but they didnt look like people who would do that  james hardcome knew that he could found no hope on such a reason as that  but now remembering what had been casually discussed between steve and himself about their wives from time to time he admitted for the first time the possibility that their old tenderness had been revived by their facetoface position more strongly than either had anticipated at startingthe excursion having been so obviously undertaken for the pleasure of the performance onlyand that they had landed at some steps he knew of further down toward the pier to be longer alone together  still he disliked to harbour the thought and would not mention its existence to his companion  he merely said to her let us walk further on  they did so and lingered between the boatstage and the pier till stephen hardcomes wife was uneasy and was obliged to accept jamess offered arm  thus the night advanced  emily was presently so worn out by fatigue that james felt it necessary to conduct her home there was too a remote chance that the truants had landed in the harbour on the other side of the town or elsewhere and hastened home in some unexpected way in the belief that their consorts would not have waited so long  however he left a direction in the town that a lookout should be kept though this was arranged privately the bare possibility of an elopement being enough to make him reticent and full of misgivings the two remaining ones hastened to catch the last train out of budmouthregis and when they got to casterbridge drove back to upper longpuddle  along this very road as we do now remarked the parish clerk  to be surealong this very road said the curate  however stephen and olive were not at their homes neither had entered the village since leaving it in the morning  emily and james hardcome went to their respective dwellings to snatch a hasty nights rest and at daylight the next morning they drove again to casterbridge and entered the budmouth train the line being just opened  nothing had been heard of the couple there during this brief absence  in the course of a few hours some young men testified to having seen such a man and woman rowing in a frail hired craft the head of the boat kept straight to sea they had sat looking in each others faces as if they were in a dream with no consciousness of what they were doing or whither they were steering  it was not till late that day that more tidings reached jamess ears  the boat had been found drifting bottom upward a long way from land  in the evening the sea rose somewhat and a cry spread through the town that two bodies were cast ashore in lullstead bay several miles to the eastward  they were brought to budmouth and inspection revealed them to be the missing pair  it was said that they had been found tightly locked in each others arms his lips upon hers their features still wrapt in the same calm and dreamlike repose which had been observed in their demeanour as they had glided along  neither james nor emily questioned the original motives of the unfortunate man and woman in putting to sea  they were both above suspicion as to intention  whatever their mutual feelings might have led them on to underhand behaviour was foreign to the nature of either conjecture pictured that they might have fallen into tender reverie while gazing each into a pair of eyes that had formerly flashed for him and her alone and unwilling to avow what their mutual sentiments were they had continued thus oblivious of time and space till darkness suddenly overtook them far from land  but nothing was truly known  it had been their destiny to die thus  the two halves intended by nature to make the perfect whole had failed in that result during their lives though in their death they were not divided  their bodies were brought home and buried on one day  i remember that on looking round the churchyard while reading the service i observed nearly all the parish at their funeral  it was so sir said the clerk  the remaining two continued the curate whose voice had grown husky while relating the lovers sad fate were a more thoughtful and far seeing though less romantic couple than the first  they were now mutually bereft of a companion and found themselves by this accident in a position to fulfil their destiny according to natures plan and their own original and calmlyformed intention  james hardcome took emily to wife in the course of a year and a half and the marriage proved in every respect a happy one  i solemnized the service hardcome having told me when he came to give notice of the proposed wedding the story of his first wifes loss almost word for word as i have told it to you  and are they living in longpuddle still asked the newcomer  o no sir interposed the clerk  james has been dead these dozen years and his misess about six or seven  they had no children  william privett used to be their odd man till he died  ahwilliam privett  he dead toodear me said the other  all passed away  yes sir  william was much older than i  hed ha been over eighty if he had lived till now  there was something very strange about williams deathvery strange indeed sighed a melancholy man in the back of the van  it was the seedsmans father who had hitherto kept silence  and what might that have been asked mr lackland    the superstitious mans story   william as you may know was a curious silent man you could feel when he came near ee and if he was in the house or anywhere behind your back without your seeing him there seemed to be something clammy in the air as if a cellar door was opened close by your elbow  well one sunday at a time that william was in very good health to all appearance the bell that was ringing for church went very heavy all of a sudden the sexton who told me ot said hed not known the bell go so heavy in his hand for yearsit was just as if the gudgeons wanted oiling  that was on the sunday as i say  during the week after it chanced that williams wife was staying up late one night to finish her ironing she doing the washing for mr and mrs hardcome  her husband had finished his supper and gone to bed as usual some hour or two before  while she ironed she heard him coming down stairs he stopped to put on his boots at the stair foot where he always left them and then came on into the livingroom where she was ironing passing through it towards the door this being the only way from the staircase to the outside of the house  no word was said on either side william not being a man given to much speaking and his wife being occupied with her work  he went out and closed the door behind him  as her husband had now and then gone out in this way at night before when unwell or unable to sleep for want of a pipe she took no particular notice and continued at her ironing  this she finished shortly after and as he had not come in she waited awhile for him putting away the irons and things and preparing the table for his breakfast in the morning  still he did not return but supposing him not far off and wanting to get to bed herself tired as she was she left the door unbarred and went to the stairs after writing on the back of the door with chalk mind and do the door because he was a forgetful man  to her great surprise and i might say alarm on reaching the foot of the stairs his boots were standing there as they always stood when he had gone to rest going up to their chamber she found him in bed sleeping as sound as a rock  how he could have got back again without her seeing or hearing him was beyond her comprehension  it could only have been by passing behind her very quietly while she was bumping with the iron  but this notion did not satisfy her it was surely impossible that she should not have seen him come in through a room so small  she could not unravel the mystery and felt very queer and uncomfortable about it  however she would not disturb him to question him then and went to bed herself  he rose and left for his work very early the next morning before she was awake and she waited his return to breakfast with much anxiety for an explanation for thinking over the matter by daylight made it seem only the more startling  when he came in to the meal he said before she could put her question whats the meaning of them words chalked on the door  she told him and asked him about his going out the night before william declared that he had never left the bedroom after entering it having in fact undressed lain down and fallen asleep directly never once waking till the clock struck five and he rose up to go to his labour  betty privett was as certain in her own mind that he did go out as she was of her own existence and was little less certain that he did not return  she felt too disturbed to argue with him and let the subject drop as though she must have been mistaken  when she was walking down longpuddle street later in the day she met jim weedles daughter nancy and said well nancy you do look sleepy today  yes mrs privett says nancy  now dont tell anybody but i dont mind letting you know what the reason ot is  last night being old midsummer eve some of us went to church porch and didnt get home till near one  did ye says mrs privett  old midsummer yesterday was it  faith i didnt think wher twas midsummer or michaelmas id too much work to do  yes  and we were frightened enough i can tell ee by what we saw  what did ye see  you may not remember sir having gone off to foreign parts so young that on midsummer night it is believed hereabout that the faint shapes of all the folk in the parish who are going to be at deaths door within the year can be seen entering the church  those who get over their illness come out again after a while those that are doomed to die do not return  what did you see asked williams wife  well says nancy backwardlywe neednt tell what we saw or who we saw  you saw my husband says betty privett in a quiet way  well since you put it so says nancy hanging fire wethought we did see him but it was darkish and we was frightened and of course it might not have been he  nancy you neednt mind letting it out though tis kept back in kindness  and he didnt come out of church again i know it as well as you  nancy did not answer yes or no to that and no more was said  but three days after william privett was mowing with john chiles in mr hardcomes meadow and in the heat of the day they sat down to eat their bit o nunch under a tree and empty their flagon  afterwards both of em fell asleep as they sat  john chiles was the first to wake and as he looked towards his fellowmower he saw one of those great white millerssouls as we call emthat is to say a millermothcome from williams open mouth while he slept and fly straight away  john thought it odd enough as william had worked in a mill for several years when he was a boy  he then looked at the sun and found by the place ot that they had slept a long while and as william did not wake john called to him and said it was high time to begin work again  he took no notice and then john went up and shook him and found he was dead  now on that very day old philip hookhorn was down at longpuddle spring dipping up a pitcher of water and as he turned away who should he see coming down to the spring on the other side but william looking very pale and odd  this surprised philip hookhorn very much for years before that time williams little sonhis only childhad been drowned in that spring while at play there and this had so preyed upon williams mind that hed never been seen near the spring afterwards and had been known to go half a mile out of his way to avoid the place  on inquiry it was found that william in body could not have stood by the spring being in the mead two miles off and it also came out that the time at which he was seen at the spring was the very time when he died        a rather melancholy story observed the emigrant after a minutes silence  yes yes  well we must take ups and downs together said the seedsmans father  you dont know mr lackland i suppose what a rum start that was between andrey satchel and jane vallens and the pason and clerk o scrimpton said the masterthatcher a man with a spark of subdued liveliness in his eye who had hitherto kept his attention mainly upon small objects a long way ahead as he sat in front of the van with his feet outside  theirs was a queerer experience of a pason and clerk than some folks get and may cheer ee up a little after this dampness thats been flung over yer soul  the returned one replied that he knew nothing of the history and should be happy to hear it quite recollecting the personality of the man satchel  ah no this andrey satchel is the son of the satchel that you knew this one has not been married more than two or three years and twas at the time o the wedding that the accident happened that i could tell ee of or anybody else here for that matter  no no you must tell it neighbour if anybody said several a request in which mr lackland joined adding that the satchel family was one he had known well before leaving home  ill just mention as you be a stranger whispered the carrier to lackland that christophers stories will bear pruning  the emigrant nodded  well i can soon tell it said the masterthatcher schooling himself to a tone of actuality  though as it has more to do with the pason and clerk than with andrey himself it ought to be told by a better churchman than i    andrey satchel and the parson and clerk   it all arose you must know from andrey being fond of a drop of drink at that timethough hes a sober enough man now by all account so much the better for him  jane his bride you see was somewhat older than andrey how much older i dont pretend to say she was not one of our parish and the register alone may be able to tell that  but at any rate her being a little ahead of her young man in mortal years coupled with other bodily circumstances  ah poor thing sighed the women  made her very anxious to get the thing done before he changed his mind and twas with a joyful countenance they say that she with andrey and his brother and sisterinlaw marched off to church one november morning as soon as twas day amost to be made one with andrey for the rest of her life  he had left our place long before it was light and the folks that were up all waved their lanterns at him and flung up their hats as he went  the church of her parish was a mile and more from the houses and as it was a wonderful fine day for the time of year the plan was that as soon as they were married they would make out a holiday by driving straight off to port bredy to see the ships and the sea and the sojers instead of coming back to a meal at the house of the distant relation she lived wi and moping about there all the afternoon  well some folks noticed that andrey walked with rather wambling steps to church that morning the truth ot was that his nearest neighbours child had been christened the day before and andrey having stood godfather had stayed all night keeping up the christening for he had said to himself not if i live to be thousand shall i again be made a godfather one day and a husband the next and perhaps a father the next and therefore ill make the most of the blessing  so that when he started from home in the morning he had not been in bed at all  the result was as i say that when he and his bridetohe walked up the church to get married the pason who was a very strict man inside the church whatever he was outside looked hard at andrey and said very sharp  hows this my man  you are in liquor  and so early too  im ashamed of you  well thats true sir says andrey  but i can walk straight enough for practical purposes  i can walk a chalk line he says meaning no offence as well as some other folk and getting hotteri reckon that if you pason billy toogood had kept up a christening all night so thoroughly as i have done you wouldnt be able to stand at all d me if you would  this answer made pason billyas they used to call himrather spitish not to say hot for he was a warmtempered man if provoked and he said very decidedly well i cannot marry you in this state and i will not go home and get sober  and he slapped the book together like a rattrap  then the bride burst out crying as if her heart would break for very fear that she would lose andrey after all her hard work to get him and begged and implored the pason to go on with the ceremony  but no  i wont be a party to your solemnizing matrimony with a tipsy man says mr toogood  it is not right and decent  i am sorry for you my young woman but youd better go home again  i wonder how you could think of bringing him here drunk like this  but ifif he dont come drunk he wont come at all sir she says through her sobs  i cant help that says the pason and plead as she might it did not move him  then she tried him another way  well then if youll go home sir and leave us here and come back to the church in an hour or two ill undertake to say that he shall be as sober as a judge she cries  well bide here with your permission for if he once goes out of this here church unmarried all van amburghs horses wont drag him back again  very well says the parson  ill give you two hours and then ill return  and please sir lock the door so that we cant escape says she  yes says the parson  and let nobody know that we are here  the pason then took off his clane white surplice and went away and the others consulted upon the best means for keeping the matter a secret which it was not a very hard thing to do the place being so lonely and the hour so early  the witnesses andreys brother and brothers wife neither one o which cared about andreys marrying jane and had come rather against their will said they couldnt wait two hours in that hole of a place wishing to get home to longpuddle before dinnertime  they were altogether so crusty that the clerk said there was no difficulty in their doing as they wished  they could go home as if their brothers wedding had actually taken place and the married couple had gone onward for their days pleasure jaunt to port bredy as intended he the clerk and any casual passerby would act as witnesses when the pason came back  this was agreed to and away andreys relations went nothing loath and the clerk shut the church door and prepared to lock in the couple  the bride went up and whispered to him with her eyes astreaming still  my dear good clerk she says if we bide here in the church folk may see us through the winders and find out what has happened and twould cause such a talk and scandal that i never should get over it and perhaps too dear andrey might try to get out and leave me  will ye lock us up in the tower my dear good clerk she says  ill tole him in there if you will  the clerk had no objection to do this to oblige the poor young woman and they toled andrey into the tower and the clerk locked em both up straightway and then went home to return at the end of the two hours  pason toogood had not been long in his house after leaving the church when he saw a gentleman in pink and topboots ride past his windows and with a sudden flash of heat he called to mind that the hounds met that day just on the edge of his parish  the pason was one who dearly loved sport and much he longed to be there  in short except o sundays and at tidetimes in the week pason billy was the life o the hunt  tis true that he was poor and that he rode all of a heap and that his black mare was rattailed and old and his tops older and all over of one colour whiteybrown and full o cracks but hed been in at the death of three thousand foxes  andbeing a bachelor manevery time he went to bed in summer he used to open the bed at bottom and crawl up head foremost to mind en of the coming winter and the good sport hed have and the foxes going to earth  and whenever there was a christening at the squires and he had dinner there afterwards as he always did he never failed to christen the chiel over again in a bottle of port wine  now the clerk was the parsons groom and gardener and jineral manager and had just got back to his work in the garden when he too saw the hunting man pass and presently saw lots more of em noblemen and gentry and then he saw the hounds the huntsman jim treadhedge the whipperin and i dont know who besides  the clerk loved going to cover as frantical as the pason so much so that whenever he saw or heard the pack he could no more rule his feelings than if they were the winds of heaven  he might be bedding or he might be sowingall was forgot  so he throws down his spade and rushes in to the pason who was by this time as frantical to go as he  that there mare of yours sir do want exercise bad very bad this morning the clerk says all of a tremble  dont ye think id better trot her round the downs for an hour sir  to be sure she does want exercise badly  ill trot her round myself says the parson  ohyoull trot her yerself  well theres the cob sir  really that cob is getting oncontrollable through biding in a stable so long  if you wouldnt mind my putting on the saddle  very well  take him out certainly says the pason never caring what the clerk did so long as he himself could get off immediately  so scrambling into his ridingboots and breeches as quick as he could he rode off towards the meet intending to be back in an hour  no sooner was he gone than the clerk mounted the cob and was off after him  when the pason got to the meet he found a lot of friends and was as jolly as he could be the hounds found amost as soon as they threw off and there was great excitement  so forgetting that he had meant to go back at once away rides the pason with the rest o the hunt all across the fallow ground that lies between lippet wood and greens copse and as he galloped he looked behind for a moment and there was the clerk close to his heels  ha ha clerkyou here he says  yes sir here be i says tother  fine exercise for the horses  ay sirhee hee says the clerk  so they went on and on into greens copse then across to higher jirton then on across this very turnpikeroad to climmerston ridge then away towards yalbury wood up hill and down dale like the very wind the clerk close to the pason and the pason not far from the hounds  never was there a finer run knowed with that pack than they had that day and neither pason nor clerk thought one word about the unmarried couple locked up in the church tower waiting to get jined  these hosses of yours sir will be much improved by this says the clerk as he rode along just a neck behind the pason  twas a happy thought of your reverent mind to bring em out today  why it may be frosty in a day or two and then the poor things mid not be able to leave the stable for weeks  they may not they may not it is true  a merciful man is merciful to his beast says the pason  hee hee says the clerk glancing sly into the pasons eye  ha ha says the pason aglancing back into the clerks  halloo he shouts as he sees the fox break cover at that moment  halloo cries the clerk  there he goes  why dammy theres two foxes  hush clerk hush  dont let me hear that word again  remember our calling  true sir true  but really good sport do carry away a man so that hes apt to forget his high persuasion  and the next minute the corner of the clerks eye shot again into the corner of the pasons and the pasons back again to the clerks  hee hee said the clerk  ha ha said pason toogood  ah sir says the clerk again this is better than crying amen to your everandever on a winters morning  yes indeed clerk  to everything theres a season says pason toogood quite pat for he was a learned christian man when he liked and had chapter and vese at his tongues end as a pason should  at last late in the day the hunting came to an end by the fox running into a old womans cottage under her table and up the clockcase  the pason and clerk were among the first in at the death their faces astaring in at the old womans winder and the clock striking as hed never been heard to strik before  then came the question of finding their way home  neither the pason nor the clerk knowed how they were going to do this for their beasts were wellnigh tired down to the ground  but they started backalong as well as they could though they were so done up that they could only drag along at a amble and not much of that at a time  we shall never never get there groaned mr toogood quite bowed down  never groans the clerk  tis a judgment upon us for our iniquities  i fear it is murmurs the pason  well twas quite dark afore they entered the pasonage gate having crept into the parish as quiet as if theyd stole a hammer little wishing their congregation to know what theyd been up to all day long and as they were so dogtired and so anxious about the horses never once did they think of the unmarried couple  as soon as ever the horses had been stabled and fed and the pason and clerk had had a bit and a sup theirselves they went to bed  next morning when pason toogood was at breakfast thinking of the glorious sport hed had the day before the clerk came in a hurry to the door and asked to see him  it has just come into my mind sir that weve forgot all about the couple that we was to have married yesterday  the halfchawed victuals dropped from the pasons mouth as if hed been shot  bless my soul says he so we have  how very awkward  it is sir very  perhaps weve ruined the ooman  ahto be surei remember  she ought to have been married before  if anything has happened to her up in that there tower and no doctor or nuss  ahpoor thing sighed the women  twill be a quartersessions matter for us not to speak of the disgrace to the church  good god clerk dont drive me wild says the pason  why the hell didnt i marry em drunk or sober  pasons used to cuss in them days like plain honest men  have you been to the church to see what happened to them or inquired in the village  not i sir  it only came into my head a moment ago and i always like to be second to you in church matters  you could have knocked me down with a sparrers feather when i thought ot sir i assure ee you could  well the parson jumped up from his breakfast and together they went off to the church  it is not at all likely that they are there now says mr toogood as they went and indeed i hope they are not  they be pretty sure to have scaped and gone home  however they opened the churchhatch entered the churchyard and looking up at the tower there they seed a little small white face at the belfrywinder and a little small hand waving  twas the bride  god my life clerk says mr toogood i dont know how to face em and he sank down upon a tombstone  how i wish i hadnt been so cussed particular  yestwas a pity we didnt finish it when wed begun the clerk said still since the feelings of your holy priestcraft wouldnt let ye the couple must put up with it  true clerk true  does she look as if anything premature had took place  i cant see her no lower down than her armpits sir  wellhow do her face look  it do look mighty white  well we must know the worst  dear me how the small of my back do ache from that ride yesterday    but to more godly business  they went on into the church and unlocked the tower stairs and immediately poor jane and andrey busted out like starved mice from a cupboard andrey limp and sober enough now and his bride pale and cold but otherwise as usual  what says the pason with a great breath of relief you havent been here ever since  yes we have sir says the bride sinking down upon a seat in her weakness  not a morsel wet or dry have we had since  it was impossible to get out without help and here weve stayed  but why didnt you shout good souls said the pason  she wouldnt let me says andrey  because we were so ashamed at what had led to it sobs jane  we felt that if it were noised abroad it would cling to us all our lives  once or twice andrey had a good mind to toll the bell but then he said no ill starve first  i wont bring disgrace on my name and yours my dear  and so we waited and waited and walked round and round but never did you come till now  to my regret says the parson  now then we will soon get it over  ii should like some victuals said andrey twould gie me courage if it is only a crust o bread and a onion for i am that leery that i can feel my stomach rubbing against my backbone  i think we had better get it done said the bride a bit anxious in manner since we are all here convenient too  andrey gave way about the victuals and the clerk called in a second witness who wouldnt be likely to gossip about it and soon the knot was tied and the bride looked smiling and calm forthwith and andrey limper than ever  now said pason toogood you two must come to my house and have a good lining put to your insides before you go a step further  they were very glad of the offer and went out of the churchyard by one path while the pason and clerk went out by the other and so did not attract notice it being still early  they entered the rectory as if theyd just come back from their trip to port bredy and then they knocked in the victuals and drink till they could hold no more  it was a long while before the story of what they had gone through was known but it was talked of in time and they themselves laugh over it now though what jane got for her pains was no great bargain after all tis true she saved her name        was that the same andrey who went to the squires house as one of the christmas fiddlers asked the seedsman  no no replied mr profitt the schoolmaster  it was his father did that  ay it was all owing to his being such a man for eating and drinking  finding that he had the ear of the audience the schoolmaster continued without delay    old andreys experience as a musician   i was one of the choirboys at that time and we and the players were to appear at the manorhouse as usual that christmas week to play and sing in the hall to the squires people and visitors among em being the archdeacon lord and lady baxby and i dont know who afterwards going as we always did to have a good supper in the servants hall  andrew knew this was the custom and meeting us when we were starting to go he said to us lord how i should like to join in that meal of beef and turkey and plumpudding and ale that you happy ones be going to just now  one more or less will make no difference to the squire  i am too old to pass as a singing boy and too bearded to pass as a singing girl can ye lend me a fiddle neighbours that i may come with ye as a bandsman  well we didnt like to be hard upon him and lent him an old one though andrew knew no more of music than the cerne giant and armed with the instrument he walked up to the squires house with the others of us at the time appointed and went in boldly his fiddle under his arm  he made himself as natural as he could in opening the musicbooks and moving the candles to the best points for throwing light upon the notes and all went well till we had played and sung while shepherds watch and star arise and hark the glad sound  then the squires mother a tall gruff old lady who was much interested in churchmusic said quite unexpectedly to andrew my man i see you dont play your instrument with the rest  how is that  every one of the choir was ready to sink into the earth with concern at the fix andrew was in  we could see that he had fallen into a cold sweat and how he would get out of it we did not know  ive had a misfortune mem he says bowing as meek as a child coming along the road i fell down and broke my bow  oh i am sorry to hear that says she  cant it be mended  oh no mem says andrew  twas broke all to splinters  ill see what i can do for you says she  and then it seemed all over and we played rejoice ye drowsy mortals all in d and two sharps  but no sooner had we got through it than she says to andrew  ive sent up into the attic where we have some old musical instruments and found a bow for you  and she hands the bow to poor wretched andrew who didnt even know which end to take hold of  now we shall have the full accompaniment says she  andrews face looked as if it were made of rotten apple as he stood in the circle of players in front of his book for if there was one person in the parish that everybody was afraid of twas this hooknosed old lady  however by keeping a little behind the next man he managed to make pretence of beginning sawing away with his bow without letting it touch the strings so that it looked as if he were driving into the tune with heart and soul  tis a question if he wouldnt have got through all right if one of the squires visitors no other than the archdeacon hadnt noticed that he held the fiddle upside down the nut under his chin and the tailpiece in his hand and they began to crowd round him thinking twas some new way of performing  this revealed everything the squires mother had andrew turned out of the house as a vile impostor and there was great interruption to the harmony of the proceedings the squire declaring he should have notice to leave his cottage that day fortnight  however when we got to the servants hall there sat andrew who had been let in at the back door by the orders of the squires wife after being turned out at the front by the orders of the squire and nothing more was heard about his leaving his cottage  but andrew never performed in public as a musician after that night and now hes dead and gone poor man as we all shall be        i had quite forgotten the old choir with their fiddles and bassviols said the homecomer musingly  are they still going on the same as of old  bless the man said christopher twink the masterthatcher why theyve been done away with these twenty year  a young teetotaler plays the organ in church now and plays it very well though tis not quite such good music as in old times because the organ is one of them that go with a winch and the young teetotaler says he cant always throw the proper feeling into the tune without wellnigh working his arms off  why did they make the change then  well partly because of fashion partly because the old musicians got into a sort of scrape  a terrible scrape twas toowasnt it john  i shall never forget itnever  they lost their character as officers of the church as complete as if theyd never had any character at all  that was very bad for them  yes  the masterthatcher attentively regarded past times as if they lay about a mile off and went on    absentmindedness in a parish choir   it happened on sunday after christmasthe last sunday ever they played in longpuddle church gallery as it turned out though they didnt know it then  as you may know sir the players formed a very good bandalmost as good as the mellstock parish players that were led by the dewys and thats saying a great deal  there was nicholas puddingcome the leader with the first fiddle there was timothy thomas the bass viol man john biles the tenor fiddler danl hornhead with the serpent robert dowdle with the clarionet and mr nicks with the oboeall sound and powerful musicians and strongwinded menthey that blowed  for that reason they were very much in demand christmas week for little reels and dancing parties for they could turn a jig or a hornpipe out of hand as well as ever they could turn out a psalm and perhaps better not to speak irreverent  in short one halfhour they could be playing a christmas carol in the squires hall to the ladies and gentlemen and drinking tay and coffee with em as modest as saints and the next at the tinkers arms blazing away like wild horses with the dashing white sergeant to nine couple of dancers and more and swallowing rumandcider hot as flame  well this christmas theyd been out to one rattling randy after another every night and had got next to no sleep at all  then came the sunday after christmas their fatal day  twas so mortal cold that year that they could hardly sit in the gallery for though the congregation down in the body of the church had a stove to keep off the frost the players in the gallery had nothing at all  so nicholas said at morning service when twas freezing an inch an hour please the lord i wont stand this numbing weather no longer this afternoon well have something in our insides to make us warm if it cost a kings ransom  so he brought a gallon of hot brandy and beer ready mixed to church with him in the afternoon and by keeping the jar well wrapped up in timothy thomass bassviol bag it kept drinkably warm till they wanted it which was just a thimbleful in the absolution and another after the creed and the remainder at the beginning o the sermon  when theyd had the last pull they felt quite comfortable and warm and as the sermon went onmost unfortunately for em it was a long one that afternoonthey fell asleep every man jack of em and there they slept on as sound as rocks  twas a very dark afternoon and by the end of the sermon all you could see of the inside of the church were the pasons two candles alongside of him in the pulpit and his spaking face behind em  the sermon being ended at last the pason gied out the evening hymn  but no choir set about sounding up the tune and the people began to turn their heads to learn the reason why and then levi limpet a boy who sat in the gallery nudged timothy and nicholas and said begin begin  hey what says nicholas starting up and the church being so dark and his head so muddled he thought he was at the party they had played at all the night before and away he went bow and fiddle at the devil among the tailors the favourite jig of our neighbourhood at that time the rest of the band being in the same state of mind and nothing doubting followed their leader with all their strength according to custom  they poured out that there tune till the lower bass notes of the devil among the tailors made the cobwebs in the roof shiver like ghosts then nicholas seeing nobody moved shouted out as he scraped in his usual commanding way at dances when the folk didnt know the figures top couples cross hands  and when i make the fiddle squeak at the end every man kiss his pardner under the mistletoe  the boy levi was so frightened that he bolted down the gallery stairs and out homeward like lightning  the pasons hair fairly stood on end when he heard the evil tune raging through the church and thinking the choir had gone crazy he held up his hand and said stop stop stop stop stop  whats this  but they didnt hearn for the noise of their own playing and the more he called the louder they played  then the folks came out of their pews wondering down to the ground and saying what do they mean by such wickedness  we shall be consumed like sodom and gomorrah  then the squire came out of his pew lined wi green baize where lots of lords and ladies visiting at the house were worshipping along with him and went and stood in front of the gallery and shook his fist in the musicians faces saying what  in this reverent edifice  what  and at last they heardn through their playing and stopped  never such an insulting disgraceful thingnever says the squire who couldnt rule his passion  never says the pason who had come down and stood beside him  not if the angels of heaven says the squire he was a wickedish man the squire was though now for once he happened to be on the lords sidenot if the angels of heaven come down he says shall one of you villanous players ever sound a note in this church again for the insult to me and my family and my visitors and god almighty that youve aperpetrated this afternoon  then the unfortunate church band came to their senses and remembered where they were and twas a sight to see nicholas pudding come and timothy thomas and john biles creep down the gallery stairs with their fiddles under their arms and poor danl hornhead with his serpent and robert dowdle with his clarionet all looking as little as ninepins and out they went  the pason might have forgied em when he learned the truth ot but the squire would not  that very week he sent for a barrel organ that would play twoandtwenty new psalmtunes so exact and particular that however sinful inclined you was you could play nothing but psalmtunes whatsomever  he had a really respectable man to turn the winch as i said and the old players played no more        and of course my old acquaintance the annuitant mrs winter who always seemed to have something on her mind is dead and gone said the homecomer after a long silence  nobody in the van seemed to recollect the name  o yes she must be dead long since she was seventy when i as a child knew her he added  i can recollect mrs winter very well if nobody else can said the aged groceress  yes shes been dead these fiveandtwenty year at least  you knew what it was upon her mind sir that gave her that holloweyed look i suppose  it had something to do with a son of hers i think i once was told  but i was too young to know particulars  the groceress sighed as she conjured up a vision of days long past yes she murmured it had all to do with a son  finding that the van was still in a listening mood she spoke on    the winters and the palmleys   to go back to the beginningif one mustthere were two women in the parish when i was a child who were to a certain extent rivals in good looks  never mind particulars but in consequence of this they were at daggersdrawn and they did not love each other any better when one of them tempted the others lover away from her and married him  he was a young man of the name of winter and in due time they had a son  the other woman did not marry for many years but when she was about thirty a quiet man named palmley asked her to be his wife and she accepted him  you dont mind when the palmleys were longpuddle folk but i do well  she had a son also who was of course nine or ten years younger than the son of the first  the child proved to be of rather weak intellect though his mother loved him as the apple of her eye  this womans husband died when the child was eight years old and left his widow and boy in poverty  her former rival also a widow now but fairly well provided for offered for pitys sake to take the child as errandboy small as he was her own son jack being hard upon seventeen  her poor neighbour could do no better than let the child go there  and to the richer womans house little palmley straightway went  well in some way or otherhow it was never exactly knownthe thriving woman mrs winter sent the little boy with a message to the next village one december day much against his will  it was getting dark and the child prayed to be allowed not to go because he would be afraid coming home  but the mistress insisted more out of thoughtlessness than cruelty and the child went  on his way back he had to pass through yalbury wood and something came out from behind a tree and frightened him into fits  the child was quite ruined by it he became quite a drivelling idiot and soon afterward died  then the other woman had nothing left to live for and vowed vengeance against that rival who had first won away her lover and now had been the cause of her bereavement  this last affliction was certainly not intended by her thriving acquaintance though it must be owned that when it was done she seemed but little concerned  whatever vengeance poor mrs palmley felt she had no opportunity of carrying it out and time might have softened her feelings into forgetfulness of her supposed wrongs as she dragged on her lonely life  so matters stood when a year after the death of the child mrs palmleys niece who had been born and bred in the city of exonbury came to live with her  this young womanmiss harriet palmleywas a proud and handsome girl very well brought up and more stylish and genteel than the people of our village as was natural considering where she came from  she regarded herself as much above mrs winter and her son in position as mrs winter and her son considered themselves above poor mrs palmley  but love is an unceremonious thing and what in the world should happen but that young jack winter must fall wofully and wildly in love with harriet palmley almost as soon as he saw her  she being better educated than he and caring nothing for the village notion of his mothers superiority to her aunt did not give him much encouragement  but longpuddle being no very large world the two could not help seeing a good deal of each other while she was staying there and disdainful young woman as she was she did seem to take a little pleasure in his attentions and advances  one day when they were picking apples together he asked her to marry him  she had not expected anything so practical as that at so early a time and was led by her surprise into a halfpromise at any rate she did not absolutely refuse him and accepted some little presents that he made her  but he saw that her view of him was rather as a simple village lad than as a young man to look up to and he felt that he must do something bold to secure her  so he said one day i am going away to try to get into a better position than i can get here  in two or three weeks he wished her goodbye and went away to monksbury to superintend a farm with a view to start as a farmer himself and from there he wrote regularly to her as if their marriage were an understood thing  now harriet liked the young mans presents and the admiration of his eyes but on paper he was less attractive to her  her mother had been a schoolmistress and harriet had besides a natural aptitude for penand ink work in days when to be a ready writer was not such a common thing as it is now and when actual handwriting was valued as an accomplishment in itself  jack winters performances in the shape of loveletters quite jarred her city nerves and her finer taste and when she answered one of them in the lovely running hand that she took such pride in she very strictly and loftily bade him to practise with a pen and spellingbook if he wished to please her  whether he listened to her request or not nobody knows but his letters did not improve  he ventured to tell her in his clumsy way that if her heart were more warm towards him she would not be so nice about his handwriting and spelling which indeed was true enough  well in jacks absence the weak flame that had been set alight in harriets heart soon sank low and at last went out altogether  he wrote and wrote and begged and prayed her to give a reason for her coldness and then she told him plainly that she was town born and he was not sufficiently well educated to please her  jack winters want of penandink training did not make him less thin skinned than others in fact he was terribly tender and touchy about anything  this reason that she gave for finally throwing him over grieved him shamed him and mortified him more than can be told in these times the pride of that day in being able to write with beautiful flourishes and the sorrow at not being able to do so raging so high jack replied to her with an angry note and then she hit back with smart little stings telling him how many words he had misspelt in his last letter and declaring again that this alone was sufficient justification for any woman to put an end to an understanding with him  her husband must be a better scholar  he bore her rejection of him in silence but his suffering was sharpall the sharper in being untold  she communicated with jack no more and as his reason for going out into the world had been only to provide a home worthy of her he had no further object in planning such a home now that she was lost to him  he therefore gave up the farming occupation by which he had hoped to make himself a masterfarmer and left the spot to return to his mother  as soon as he got back to longpuddle he found that harriet had already looked wi favour upon another lover  he was a young roadcontractor and jack could not but admit that his rival was both in manners and scholarship much ahead of him  indeed a more sensible match for the beauty who had been dropped into the village by fate could hardly have been found than this man who could offer her so much better a chance than jack could have done with his uncertain future and narrow abilities for grappling with the world  the fact was so clear to him that he could hardly blame her  one day by accident jack saw on a scrap of paper the handwriting of harriets new beloved  it was flowing like a stream well spelt the work of a man accustomed to the inkbottle and the dictionary of a man already called in the parish a good scholar  and then it struck all of a sudden into jacks mind what a contrast the letters of this young man must make to his own miserable old letters and how ridiculous they must make his lines appear  he groaned and wished he had never written to her and wondered if she had ever kept his poor performances  possibly she had kept them for women are in the habit of doing that he thought and whilst they were in her hands there was always a chance of his honest stupid loveassurances to her being joked over by harriet with her present lover or by anybody who should accidentally uncover them  the nervous moody young man could not bear the thought of it and at length decided to ask her to return them as was proper when engagements were broken off  he was some hours in framing copying and recopying the short note in which he made his request and having finished it he sent it to her house  his messenger came back with the answer by word of mouth that miss palmley bade him say she should not part with what was hers and wondered at his boldness in troubling her  jack was much affronted at this and determined to go for his letters himself  he chose a time when he knew she was at home and knocked and went in without much ceremony for though harriet was so high and mighty jack had small respect for her aunt mrs palmley whose little child had been his bootcleaner in earlier days  harriet was in the room this being the first time they had met since she had jilted him  he asked for his letters with a stern and bitter look at her  at first she said he might have them for all that she cared and took them out of the bureau where she kept them  then she glanced over the outside one of the packet and suddenly altering her mind she told him shortly that his request was a silly one and slipped the letters into her aunts workbox which stood open on the table locking it and saying with a bantering laugh that of course she thought it best to keep em since they might be useful to produce as evidence that she had good cause for declining to marry him  he blazed up hot  give me those letters he said  they are mine  no they are not she replied they are mine  whosever they are i want them back says he  i dont want to be made sport of for my penmanship youve another young man now he has your confidence and you pour all your tales into his ear  youll be showing them to him  perhaps said my lady harriet with calm coolness like the heartless woman that she was  her manner so maddened him that he made a step towards the workbox but she snatched it up locked it in the bureau and turned upon him triumphant  for a moment he seemed to be going to wrench the key of the bureau out of her hand but he stopped himself and swung round upon his heel and went away  when he was outofdoors alone and it got night he walked about restless and stinging with the sense of being beaten at all points by her  he could not help fancying her telling her new lover or her acquaintances of this scene with himself and laughing with them over those poor blotted crooked lines of his that he had been so anxious to obtain  as the evening passed on he worked himself into a dogged resolution to have them back at any price come what might  at the dead of night he came out of his mothers house by the back door and creeping through the garden hedge went along the field adjoining till he reached the back of her aunts dwelling  the moon struck bright and flat upon the walls twas said and every shiny leaf of the creepers was like a little lookingglass in the rays  from long acquaintance jack knew the arrangement and position of everything in mrs palmleys house as well as in his own mothers  the back window close to him was a casement with little leaded squares as it is to this day and was as now one of two lighting the sittingroom  the other being in front was closed up with shutters but this back one had not even a blind and the moonlight as it streamed in showed every article of the furniture to him outside  to the right of the room is the fireplace as you may remember to the left was the bureau at that time inside the bureau was harriets workbox as he supposed though it was really her aunts and inside the workbox were his letters  well he took out his pocketknife and without noise lifted the leading of one of the panes so that he could take out the glass and putting his hand through the hole he unfastened the casement and climbed in through the opening  all the householdthat is to say mrs palmley harriet and the little maid servantwere asleep  jack went straight to the bureau so he said hoping it might have been unfastened againit not being kept locked in ordinarybut harriet had never unfastened it since she secured her letters there the day before  jack told afterward how he thought of her asleep upstairs caring nothing for him and of the way she had made sport of him and of his letters and having advanced so far he was not to be hindered now  by forcing the large blade of his knife under the flap of the bureau he burst the weak lock within was the rosewood work box just as she had placed it in her hurry to keep it from him  there being no time to spare for getting the letters out of it then he took it under his arm shut the bureau and made the best of his way out of the house latching the casement behind him and refixing the pane of glass in its place  winter found his way back to his mothers as he had come and being dog tired crept upstairs to bed hiding the box till he could destroy its contents  the next morning early he set about doing this and carried it to the linhay at the back of his mothers dwelling  here by the hearth he opened the box and began burning one by one the letters that had cost him so much labour to write and shame to think of meaning to return the box to harriet after repairing the slight damage he had caused it by opening it without a key with a notethe last she would ever receive from himtelling her triumphantly that in refusing to return what he had asked for she had calculated too surely upon his submission to her whims  but on removing the last letter from the box he received a shock for underneath it at the very bottom lay moneyseveral golden guineasdoubtless harriets pocketmoney he said to himself though it was not but mrs palmleys  before he had got over his qualms at this discovery he heard footsteps coming through the housepassage to where he was  in haste he pushed the box and what was in it under some brushwood which lay in the linhay but jack had been already seen  two constables entered the outhouse and seized him as he knelt before the fireplace securing the workbox and all it contained at the same moment they had come to apprehend him on a charge of breaking into the dwelling house of mrs palmley on the night preceding and almost before the lad knew what had happened to him they were leading him along the lane that connects that end of the village with this turnpikeroad and along they marched him between em all the way to casterbridge jail  jacks act amounted to night burglarythough he had never thought of itand burglary was felony and a capital offence in those days  his figure had been seen by some one against the bright wall as he came away from mrs palmleys back window and the box and money were found in his possession while the evidence of the broken bureaulock and tinkered windowpane was more than enough for circumstantial detail  whether his protestation that he went only for his letters which he believed to be wrongfully kept from him would have availed him anything if supported by other evidence i do not know but the one person who could have borne it out was harriet and she acted entirely under the sway of her aunt  that aunt was deadly towards jack winter  mrs palmleys time had come  here was her revenge upon the woman who had first won away her lover and next ruined and deprived her of her hearts treasureher little son  when the assize week drew on and jack had to stand his trial harriet did not appear in the case at all which was allowed to take its course mrs palmley testifying to the general facts of the burglary  whether harriet would have come forward if jack had appealed to her is not known possibly she would have done it for pitys sake but jack was too proud to ask a single favour of a girl who had jilted him and he let her alone  the trial was a short one and the death sentence was passed  the day o young jacks execution was a cold dusty saturday in march  he was so boyish and slim that they were obliged in mercy to hang him in the heaviest fetters kept in the jail lest his heft should not break his neck and they weighed so upon him that he could hardly drag himself up to the drop  at that time the goverment was not strict about burying the body of an executed person within the precincts of the prison and at the earnest prayer of his poor mother his body was allowed to be brought home  all the parish waited at their cottage doors in the evening for its arrival i remember how as a very little girl i stood by my mothers side  about eight oclock as we hearkened on our doorstones in the cold bright starlight we could hear the faint crackle of a waggon from the direction of the turnpikeroad  the noise was lost as the waggon dropped into a hollow then it was plain again as it lumbered down the next long incline and presently it entered longpuddle  the coffin was laid in the belfry for the night and the next day sunday between the services we buried him  a funeral sermon was preached the same afternoon the text chosen being he was the only son of his mother and she was a widow    yes they were cruel times  as for harriet she and her lover were married in due time but by all account her life was no jocund one  she and her goodman found that they could not live comfortably at longpuddle by reason of her connection with jacks misfortunes and they settled in a distant town and were no more heard of by us mrs palmley too found it advisable to join em shortly after  the darkeyed gaunt old mrs winter remembered by the emigrant gentleman here was as you will have foreseen the mrs winter of this story and i can well call to mind how lonely she was how afraid the children were of her and how she kept herself as a stranger among us though she lived so long        longpuddle has had her sad experiences as well as her sunny ones said mr lackland  yes yes  but i am thankful to say not many like that though good and bad have lived among us  there was georgy crookhillhe was one of the shady sort as i have reason to know observed the registrar with the manner of a man who would like to have his say also  i used to hear what he was as a boy at school  well as he began so he went on  it never got so far as a hanging matter with him to be sure but he had some narrow escapes of penal servitude and once it was a case of the biter bit    incident in the life of mr george crookhill   one day the registrar continued georgy was ambling out of melchester on a miserable screw the fair being just over when he saw in front of him a finelooking young farmer riding out of the town in the same direction  he was mounted on a good strong handsome animal worth fifty guineas if worth a crown  when they were going up bissett hill georgy made it his business to overtake the young farmer  they passed the time o day to one another georgy spoke of the state of the roads and jogged alongside the wellmounted stranger in very friendly conversation  the farmer had not been inclined to say much to georgy at first but by degrees he grew quite affable tooas friendly as georgy was toward him he told crookhill that he had been doing business at melchester fair and was going on as far as shottsfordforum that night so as to reach casterbridge market the next day  when they came to woodyates inn they stopped to bait their horses and agreed to drink together with this they got more friendly than ever and on they went again  before they had nearly reached shottsford it came on to rain and as they were now passing through the village of trantridge and it was quite dark georgy persuaded the young farmer to go no further that night the rain would most likely give them a chill  for his part he had heard that the little inn here was comfortable and he meant to stay  at last the young farmer agreed to put up there also and they dismounted and entered and had a good supper together and talked over their affairs like men who had known and proved each other a long time  when it was the hour for retiring they went upstairs to a doublebedded room which georgy crookhill had asked the landlord to let them share so sociable were they  before they fell asleep they talked across the room about one thing and another running from this to that till the conversation turned upon disguises and changing clothes for particular ends  the farmer told georgy that he had often heard tales of people doing it but crookhill professed to be very ignorant of all such tricks and soon the young farmer sank into slumber  early in the morning while the tall young farmer was still asleep i tell the story as twas told me honest georgy crept out of his bed by stealth and dressed himself in the farmers clothes in the pockets of the said clothes being the farmers money  now though georgy particularly wanted the farmers nice clothes and nice horse owing to a little transaction at the fair which made it desirable that he should not be too easily recognized his desires had their bounds he did not wish to take his young friends money at any rate more of it than was necessary for paying his bill  this he abstracted and leaving the farmers purse containing the rest on the bedroom table went downstairs the inn folks had not particularly noticed the faces of their customers and the one or two who were up at this hour had no thought but that georgy was the farmer so when he had paid the bill very liberally and said he must be off no objection was made to his getting the farmers horse saddled for himself and he rode away upon it as if it were his own  about half an hour after the young farmer awoke and looking across the room saw that his friend georgy had gone away in clothes which didnt belong to him and had kindly left for himself the seedy ones worn by georgy  at this he sat up in a deep thought for some time instead of hastening to give an alarm  the money the money is gone he said to himself and thats bad  but so are the clothes  he then looked upon the table and saw that the money or most of it had been left behind  ha ha ha he cried and began to dance about the room  ha ha ha he said again and made beautiful smiles to himself in the shaving glass and in the brass candlestick and then swung about his arms for all the world as if he were going through the sword exercise  when he had dressed himself in georgys clothes and gone downstairs he did not seem to mind at all that they took him for the other and even when he saw that he had been left a bad horse for a good one he was not inclined to cry out  they told him his friend had paid the bill at which he seemed much pleased and without waiting for breakfast he mounted georgys horse and rode away likewise choosing the nearest by lane in preference to the highroad without knowing that georgy had chosen that bylane also  he had not trotted more than two miles in the personal character of georgy crookhill when suddenly rounding a bend that the lane made thereabout he came upon a man struggling in the hands of two village constables  it was his friend georgy the borrower of his clothes and horse  but so far was the young farmer from showing any alacrity in rushing forward to claim his property that he would have turned the poor beast he rode into the wood adjoining if he had not been already perceived  help help help cried the constables  assistance in the name of the crown  the young farmer could do nothing but ride forward  whats the matter he inquired as coolly as he could  a desertera deserter said they  one whos to be tried by court martial and shot without parley  he deserted from the dragoons at cheltenham some days ago and was tracked but the searchparty cant find him anywhere and we told em if we met him wed hand him on to em forthwith  the day after he left the barracks the rascal met a respectable farmer and made him drunk at an inn and told him what a fine soldier he would make and coaxed him to change clothes to see how well a military uniform would become him  this the simple farmer did when our deserter said that for a joke he would leave the room and go to the landlady to see if she would know him in that dress  he never came back and farmer jollice found himself in soldiers clothes the money in his pockets gone and when he got to the stable his horse gone too  a scoundrel says the young man in georgys clothes  and is this the wretched caitiff pointing to georgy  no no cries georgy as innocent as a babe of this matter of the soldiers desertion  hes the man  he was wearing farmer jollices suit o clothes and he slept in the same room wi me and brought up the subject of changing clothes which put it into my head to dress myself in his suit before he was awake  hes got on mine  dye hear the villain groans the tall young man to the constables trying to get out of his crime by charging the first innocent man with it that he sees  no master soldierthat wont do  no no  that wont do the constables chimed in  to have the impudence to say such as that when we caught him in the act almost  but thank god weve got the handcuffs on him at last  we have thank god said the tall young man  well i must move on good luck to ye with your prisoner  and off he went as fast as his poor jade would carry him  the constables then with georgy handcuffed between em and leading the horse marched off in the other direction toward the village where they had been accosted by the escort of soldiers sent to bring the deserter back georgy groaning i shall be shot i shall be shot  they had not gone more than a mile before they met them  hoi there says the head constable  hoi yerself says the corporal in charge  weve got your man says the constable  where says the corporal  here between us said the constable  only you dont recognize him out o uniform  the corporal looked at georgy hard enough then shook his head and said he was not the absconder  but the absconder changed clothes with farmer jollice and took his horse and this man has em dye see  tis not our man said the soldiers  hes a tall young fellow with a mole on his right cheek and a military bearing which this man decidedly has not  i told the two officers of justice that twas the other pleaded georgy  but they wouldnt believe me  and so it became clear that the missing dragoon was the tall young farmer and not georgy crookhilla fact which farmer jollice himself corroborated when he arrived on the scene  as georgy had only robbed the robber his sentence was comparatively light  the deserter from the dragoons was never traced his double shift of clothing having been of the greatest advantage to him in getting off though he left georgys horse behind him a few miles ahead having found the poor creature more hindrance than aid        the man from abroad seemed to be less interested in the questionable characters of longpuddle and their strange adventures than in the ordinary inhabitants and the ordinary events though his local fellow travellers preferred the former as subjects of discussion  he now for the first time asked concerning young persons of the opposite sexor rather those who had been young when he left his native land  his informants adhering to their own opinion that the remarkable was better worth telling than the ordinary would not allow him to dwell upon the simple chronicles of those who had merely come and gone  they asked him if he remembered netty sargent  netty sargenti do just remember her  she was a young woman living with her uncle when i left if my childish recollection may be trusted  that was the maid  she was a oneyer if you like sir  not any harm in her you know but up to everything  you ought to hear how she got the copyhold of her house extended  oughtnt he mr day  he ought replied the worldignored old painter  tell him mr day  nobody can do it better than you and you know the legal part better than some of us  day apologized and began    netty sargents copyhold   she continued to live with her uncle in the lonely house by the copse just as at the time you knew her a tall spry young woman  ah how well one can remember her black hair and dancing eyes at that time and her sly way of screwing up her mouth when she meant to tease ye  well she was hardly out of short frocks before the chaps were after her and by long and by late she was courted by a young man whom perhaps you did not knowjasper cliff was his nameand though she might have had many a better fellow he so greatly took her fancy that twas jasper or nobody for her  he was a selfish customer always thinking less of what he was going to do than of what he was going to gain by his doings  jaspers eyes might have been fixed upon netty but his mind was upon her uncles house though he was fond of her in his wayi admit that  this house built by her greatgreatgrandfather with its garden and little field was copyholdgranted upon lives in the old way and had been so granted for generations  her uncles was the last life upon the property so that at his death if there was no admittance of new lives it would all fall into the hands of the lord of the manor  but twas easy to admita slight fine as twas called of a few pounds was enough to entitle him to a new deed o grant by the custom of the manor and the lord could not hinder it  now there could be no better provision for his niece and only relative than a sure house over her head and nettys uncle should have seen to the renewal in time owing to the peculiar custom of forfeiture by the dropping of the last life before the new fine was paid for the squire was very anxious to get hold of the house and land and every sunday when the old man came into the church and passed the squires pew the squire would say a little weaker in his knees a little crookeder in his backand the readmittance not applied for ha ha  i shall be able to make a complete clearing of that corner of the manor some day  twas extraordinary now we look back upon it that old sargent should have been so dilatory yet some people are like it and he put off calling at the squires agents office with the fine week after week saying to himself i shall have more time next marketday than i have now  one unfortunate hindrance was that he didnt very well like jasper cliff and as jasper kept urging netty and netty on that account kept urging her uncle the old man was inclined to postpone the reliveing as long as he could to spite the selfish young lover  at last old mr sargent fell ill and then jasper could bear it no longer he produced the finemoney himself and handed it to netty and spoke to her plainly  you and your uncle ought to know better  you should press him more theres the money  if you let the house and ground slip between ye i wont marry hang me if i will  for folks wont deserve a husband that can do such things  the worried girl took the money and went home and told her uncle that it was no house no husband for her  old mr sargent poohpoohed the money for the amount was not worth consideration but he did now bestir himself for he saw she was bent upon marrying jasper and he did not wish to make her unhappy since she was so determined  it was much to the squires annoyance that he found sargent had moved in the matter at last but he could not gainsay it and the documents were prepared for on this manor the copyholders had writings with their holdings though on some manors they had none  old sargent being now too feeble to go to the agents house the deed was to be brought to his house signed and handed over as a receipt for the money the counterpart to be signed by sargent and sent back to the squire  the agent had promised to call on old sargent for this purpose at five oclock and netty put the money into her desk to have it close at hand while doing this she heard a slight cry from her uncle and turning round saw that he had fallen forward in his chair  she went and lifted him but he was unconscious and unconscious he remained  neither medicine nor stimulants would bring him to himself  she had been told that he might possibly go off in that way and it seemed as if the end had come  before she had started for a doctor his face and extremities grew quite cold and white and she saw that help would be useless  he was stonedead  nettys situation rose upon her distracted mind in all its seriousness the house garden and field were lostby a few hoursand with them a home for herself and her lover  she would not think so meanly of jasper as to suppose that he would adhere to the resolution declared in a moment of impatience but she trembled nevertheless  why could not her uncle have lived a couple of hours longer since he had lived so long  it was now past three oclock at five the agent was to call and if all had gone well by ten minutes past five the house and holding would have been securely hers for her own and jaspers lives these being two of the three proposed to be added by paying the fine  how that wretched old squire would rejoice at getting the little tenancy into his hands  he did not really require it but constitutionally hated these tiny copyholds and leaseholds and freeholds which made islands of independence in the fair smooth ocean of his estates  then an idea struck into the head of netty how to accomplish her object in spite of her uncles negligence  it was a dull december afternoon and the first step in her schemeso the story goes and i see no reason to doubt it  tis true as the light affirmed christopher twink  i was just passing by  the first step in her scheme was to fasten the outer door to make sure of not being interrupted  then she set to work by placing her uncles small heavy oak table before the fire then she went to her uncles corpse sitting in the chair as he had dieda stuffed armchair on casters and rather high in the seat so it was told meand wheeled the chair uncle and all to the table placing him with his back toward the window in the attitude of bending over the said oak table which i knew as a boy as well as i know any piece of furniture in my own house  on the table she laid the large family bible open before him and placed his forefinger on the page and then she opened his eyelids a bit and put on him his spectacles so that from behind he appeared for all the world as if he were reading the scriptures  then she unfastened the door and sat down and when it grew dark she lit a candle and put it on the table beside her uncles book  folk may well guess how the time passed with her till the agent came and how when his knock sounded upon the door she nearly started out of her skinat least thats as it was told me  netty promptly went to the door  i am sorry sir she says under her breath my uncle is not so well tonight and im afraid he cant see you  hmthats a pretty tale says the steward  so ive come all this way about this trumpery little job for nothing  o no siri hope not says netty  i suppose the business of granting the new deed can be done just the same  done  certainly not  he must pay the renewal money and sign the parchment in my presence  she looked dubious  uncle is so dreadful nervous about law business says she that as you know hes put it off and put it off for years and now today really ive feared it would verily drive him out of his mind  his poor three teeth quite chattered when i said to him that you would be here soon with the parchment writing  he always was afraid of agents and folks that come for rent and suchlike  poor old fellowim sorry for him  well the thing cant be done unless i see him and witness his signature  suppose sir that you see him sign and he dont see you looking at him  id soothe his nerves by saying you werent strict about the form of witnessing and didnt wish to come in  so that it was done in your bare presence it would be sufficient would it not  as hes such an old shrinking shivering man it would be a great considerateness on your part if that would do  in my bare presence would do of coursethats all i come for  but how can i be a witness without his seeing me  why in this way sir if youll oblige me by just stepping here  she conducted him a few yards to the left till they were opposite the parlour window  the blind had been left up purposely and the candle light shone out upon the garden bushes  within the agent could see at the other end of the room the back and side of the old mans head and his shoulders and arm sitting with the book and candle before him and his spectacles on his nose as she had placed him  hes reading his bible as you see sir she says quite in her meekest way  yes  i thought he was a careless sort of man in matters of religion  he always was fond of his bible netty assured him  though i think hes nodding over it just at this moment however thats natural in an old man and unwell  now you could stand here and see him sign couldnt you sir as hes such an invalid  very well said the agent lighting a cigar  you have ready by you the merely nominal sum youll have to pay for the admittance of course  yes said netty  ill bring it out  she fetched the cash wrapped in paper and handed it to him and when he had counted it the steward took from his breast pocket the precious parchments and gave one to her to be signed  uncles hand is a little paralyzed she said  and what with his being half asleep too really i dont know what sort of a signature hell be able to make  doesnt matter so that he signs  might i hold his hand  ay hold his hand my young womanthat will be near enough  netty reentered the house and the agent continued smoking outside the window  now came the ticklish part of nettys performance  the steward saw her put the inkhornhorn says i in my oldfashioned waythe inkstand before her uncle and touch his elbow as to arouse him and speak to him and spread out the deed when she had pointed to show him where to sign she dipped the pen and put it into his hand  to hold his hand she artfully stepped behind him so that the agent could only see a little bit of his head and the hand she held but he saw the old mans hand trace his name on the document  as soon as twas done she came out to the steward with the parchment in her hand and the steward signed as witness by the light from the parlour window  then he gave her the deed signed by the squire and left and next morning netty told the neighbours that her uncle was dead in his bed  she must have undressed him and put him there  she must  oh that girl had a nerve i can tell ye  well to cut a long story short thats how she got back the house and field that were strictly speaking gone from her and by getting them got her a husband  every virtue has its reward they say  netty had hers for her ingenious contrivance to gain jasper  two years after they were married he took to beating hernot hard you know just a smack or two enough to set her in a temper and let out to the neighbours what she had done to win him and how she repented of her pains  when the old squire was dead and his son came into the property this confession of hers began to be whispered about  but netty was a pretty young woman and the squires son was a pretty young man at that time and widerminded than his father having no objection to little holdings and he never took any proceedings against her  there was now a lull in the discourse and soon the van descended the hill leading into the long straggling village  when the houses were reached the passengers dropped off one by one each at his or her own door  arrived at the inn the returned emigrant secured a bed and having eaten a light meal sallied forth upon the scene he had known so well in his early days  though flooded with the light of the rising moon none of the objects wore the attractiveness in this their real presentation that had ever accompanied their images in the field of his imagination when he was more than two thousand miles removed from them the peculiar charm attaching to an old village in an old country as seen by the eyes of an absolute foreigner was lowered in his case by magnified expectations from infantine memories  he walked on looking at this chimney and that old wall till he came to the churchyard which he entered  the headstones whitened by the moon were easily decipherable and now for the first time lackland began to feel himself amid the village community that he had left behind him fiveandthirty years before  here besides the sallets the darths the pawles the privetts the sargents and others of whom he had just heard were names he remembered even better than those the jickses and the crosses and the knights and the olds  doubtless representatives of these families or some of them were yet among the living but to him they would all be as strangers  far from finding his heart readysupplied with roots and tendrils here he perceived that in returning to this spot it would be incumbent upon him to reestablish himself from the beginning precisely as though he had never known the place nor it him  time had not condescended to wait his pleasure nor local life his greeting  the figure of mr lackland was seen at the inn and in the village street and in the fields and lanes about upper longpuddle for a few days after his arrival and then ghostlike it silently disappeared  he had told some of the villagers that his immediate purpose in coming had been fulfilled by a sight of the place and by conversation with its inhabitants but that his ulterior purposeof coming to spend his latter days among themwould probably never be carried out  it is now a dozen or fifteen years since his visit was paid and his face has not again been seen  march 1891
