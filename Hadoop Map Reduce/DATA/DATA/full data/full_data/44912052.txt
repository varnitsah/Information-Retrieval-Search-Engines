44912052	coniston  by winston churchill     we have been compelled to see what was weak in democracy as well as    what was strong we have begun obscurely to recognize that things    do not go of themselves and that popular government is not in    itself a panacea is no better than any other form except as the    virtue and wisdom of the people make it so and that when men    undertake to do their own kingship they enter upon the dangers and    responsibilities as well as the privileges of the function above    all it looks as if we were on the way to be persuaded that no    government can be carried on by declamation                   james russell lowell     coniston     book i     chapter i  first i am to write a lovestory of long ago of a time some little while after general jackson had got into the white house and had shown the world what a real democracy was the era of the first six presidents had closed and a new era had begun i am speaking of political eras certain gentlemen with a pious belief in democracy but with a firmer determination to get on top aroseand got in top so many of these gentlemen arose in the different states and they were so clever and they found so many chinks in the constitution to crawl through and steal the peoples chestnuts that the era may be called the bossera after the boss came along certain things without souls but of many minds and found more chinks in the constitution bigger chinks for the things were bigger and they stole more chestnuts but i am getting far ahead of my lovestoryand of my book  the reader is warned that this first lovestory will in a few chapters come to an end and not to a happy endotherwise there would be no book lest he should throw the book away when he arrives at this page it is only fair to tell him that there is another and a much longer love story later on if he will only continue to read in which it is hoped he may not be disappointed  the hills seem to leap up against the sky as i describe that region where cynthia ware was born and the very old country names help to summon up the picture coniston mountain called by some the blue mountain clad in hercynian forests ten good miles in length north and south with its notch road that winds over the saddle behind the withers of it coniston water that oozes out from under the loam in a hundred places on the eastern slope gathers into a rushing stream to cleave the very granite flows southward around the south end of coniston mountain and having turned the mills at brampton idles through meadows westward in its own green valley until it comes to harwich where it works again and tumbles into a river brampton and harwich are rivals but coniston water gives of its power impartially to each from the little farm clearings on the western slope of coniston mountain you can sweep the broad valley of a certain broad river where grew and grow still the giant pines that gave many a mast to king georges navy as tribute for the land and beyond that river rises beautiful farewell mountain of many colors now sapphire now amethyst its crest rimmed about at evening with saffron flame and beyond farewell the emerald billows of the western peaks catching the level light a dozen little brooks are born high among the western spruces on coniston to score deep cool valleys in their way through clovelly township to the broad music of the water and fresh rivervalleys full of the music of the water and fresh with the odor of the ferns  to this day the railroad has not reached coniston villagenay nor coniston flat four miles nearer brampton the village lies on its own little shelf under the forestclad slope of the mountain and in the midst of its dozen houses is the green triangle where the militia used to drill on june days at one end of the triangle is the great pine mast that graced no frigate of georges but flew the stars and stripes on many a liberty day across the road is jonah winchs store with a platform so high that a man may step off his horse directly on to it with its checkerpaned windows with its dark interior smelling of coffee and apples and molasses yes and of endea rumfor this was before the days of the revivals  how those checkerpaned windows bring back the picture of that village green the meetinghouse has them lanternlike wide and high in three sasheswhite meetinghouse seat alike of government and religion with its terraced steeple with its classic porches north and south behind it is the long shed and in front rising out of the milkweed and the flowering thistle the horse block of the first meetinghouse where many a pillion has left its burden in times bygone honest jock hallowell built that second meetinghousewas indeed still building it at the time of which we write he had hewn every beam and king post in it and set every plate and slip and jock hallowell is the man who unwittingly starts this chronicle  at noon on one of those madcap april days of that coniston country jock descended from his work on the steeple to perceive the ungainly figure of jethro bass coming toward him across the green jethro was about thirty years of age and he wore a coonskin cap even in those days and trousers tacked into his boots he carried his big head bent forward a little to one aide and was not at first sight a prepossessinglooking person as our story largely concerns him and we must get started somehow it may as well be to fix a little attention on him  heigho said jock rubbing his hands on his leather apron  hhow be you jock said jethro stopping  heigho cried jock whats this game of fox and geese youre aplayin among the farmers  ccallate to git the steeple done before frost inquired jethro without so much as a smile bbuild it tight jockbbuild it tight  guess hell build hisn tight whatever it is said jock looking after him as jethro made his way to the little tannery near by  let it be known that there was such a thing as social rank in coniston and something which for the sake of an advantageous parallel we may call an established church coniston was a congregational town still and the deacons and dignitaries of that church were likewise the pillars of the state not many years before the time of which we write actual disestablishment had occurred when the town ceasedas a townto pay the salary of priest ware as the minister was called the father of jethro bass nathan the currier had once in a youthful lapse permitted a baptist preacher to immerse him in coniston water this had been the extent of nathans religion jethro had none at all and was for this and other reasons somewhere near the bottom of the social scale  fox and geese repeated jock with his eyes still on jethros retreating back the builder of the meetinghouse rubbed a great brown arm scratched his head and turned and came face to face with cynthia ware in a poke bonnet  contrast is a favorite trick of authors and no greater contrast is to be had in coniston than that between cynthia ware and jethro bass in the first place cynthia was the ministers daughter and twentyone i can summon her now under the great maples of the village street a virginal figure gray eyes that kindled the face shaded by the poke bonnet and up you went above the clouds  what about fox and geese jock said cynthia  jethro bass said jock who by reason of his ability was a privileged character mark my words cynthy jethro bass is an allfired sight smarter that folks in this town think he be they dont take notice of him because he dont say much and stutters he haint ben eddicated a great deal but i wouldnt be afeard to warrant hed make a racket in the world some of these days  jock hallowell cried cynthia the gray beginning to dance i suppose you think jethros going to be president  all right said jock you can laugh ever talked with jethro  ive hardly spoken two words to him in my life she replied and it was true although the little white parsonage was scarce two hundred yards from the tannery house  jethros never ailed much jock remarked having reference to cynthias proclivities for visiting the sick ive seed a good many different men in my time and i tell you cynthia ware that jethros got a kind of power you dont often come acrost folks dont suspicion it  in spite of herself cynthia was impressed by the ring of sincerity in the builders voice now that she thought of it there was rugged power in jethros face especially when he took off the coonskin cap she always nodded a greeting when she saw him in the tannery yard or on the road and sometimes he nodded back but oftener he had not appeared to see her she had thought this failure to nod stupidity but it might after all be abstraction  what makes you think he has ability she asked picking flowers from a bunch of arbutus she held  hes rich for one thing said jock he had not intended a dissertation on jethro bass but he felt bound to defend his statements  rich  wal he haint poor hes got as many as thirty mortgages round among the farmerssome on land and some on cattle  how did he make the money demanded cynthia in surprise  hides an wool an barkturned em over an swep in gits a load and lyman hull drives him down to boston with that sixhoss team lyman gits drunk jethro keeps sober and saves  jock began to fashion some wooden pegs with his adze for nails were scarce in those days still cynthia lingered picking flowers from the bunch  what did you mean by fox and geese jock she said presently  jock laughed he did not belong to the establishment but was a universalist politically he admired general jackson whatd you say if jethro was chairman of the next board of selectmen he demanded  no wonder cynthia gasped jethro bass chairman of the board in the honored seat of deacon moses hatch the perquisite of the church in coniston the idea was heresy as a matter of fact jock himself uttered it as a playful exaggeration certain nonconformist farmers of whom there were not a few in the town had come into jonah winchs store that morning and jabez miller who lived on the north slope had taken away the breath of the orthodox by suggesting that jethro bass be nominated for town office jock hallowell had paused once or twice on his work on the steeple to look across the treetops at coniston shouldering the sky he had been putting two and two together and now he was merely making five out of it instead of four he remembered that jethro bass had for some years been journeying through the town baying his hides and wool and collecting the interest on his mortgages  cynthia would have liked to reprove jock hallowell and tell him there were some subjects which should not be joked about jethro bass chairman of the board of selectmen  well here comes young moses i do believe said jock gathering his pegs into his apron and preparing to ascend once more callated hed spring up pretty soon  jock you do talk foolishly for a man who is able to build a church said cynthia as she walked away the young moses referred to was moses hatch junior son of the pillar of the church and state and it was an open secret that he was madly in love with cynthia let it be said of him that he was a steadygoing young man and that he sighed for the moon  moses said the girl when they came in sight of the elms that shaded the gable of the parsonage what do you think of jethro bass  jethro bass exclaimed honest moses whatever put him into your head cynthy had she mentioned perhaps any other young man in coniston moses would have been eaten with jealousy  oh jock was joking about him what do you think of him  never thought one way or tother he answered jethro never had much to do with the boys hes always in that tannery or out buyin of hides he does make a sharp bargain when he buys a hide we always goes shares on ourn  cynthia was not only the ministers daughterdistinction enoughher reputation for learning was spread through the country roundabout and at the age of twenty she had had an offer to teach school in harwich once a week in summer she went to brampton to the social library there and sat at the feet of that miss lucretia penniman of whom brampton has ever been so proudlucretia penniman one of the first to sound the clarion note for the intellectual independence of american women who wrote the hymn to coniston who to the awe of her townspeople went out into the great world and became editress of a famous womans journal and knew longfellow and hawthorne and bryant miss lucretia it was who started the brampton social library and filled it with such books as both sexes might read with profit never was there a stricter index than hers cynthia miss lucretia loved and the training of that mind was the pleasantest task of her life  curiosity as a factor has never perhaps been given its proper weight by philosophers besides being fatal to a certain domestic animal as an instigating force it has brought joy and sorrow into the lives of men and women and made and marred careers and curiosity now laid hold of cynthia ware why in the world she should ever have been curious about jethro bass is a mystery to many for the two of them were as far apart as the poles cynthia of all people took to watching the tanners son and listening to the brief colloquies he had with other men at jonah winchs store when she went there to buy things for the parsonage and it seemed to her that jock had not been altogether wrong and that there was in the man an indefinable but very compelling force and when a woman begins to admit that a man has force her curiosity usually increases on one or two of these occasions cynthia had been startled to find his eyes fixed upon her and though the feeling she had was closely akin to fear she found something distinctly pleasurable in it  may came and the pools dried up the orchards were pink and white the birches and the maples were all yellowgreen on the mountain sides against the dark pines and cynthia was driving the ministers gig to brampton ahead of her in the canon made by the road between the great woods strode an uncouth but powerful figurecoonskin cap homespun breeches tucked into boots and all the gig slowed down and cynthia began to tremble with that same delightful fear she knew it must be wicked because she liked it so much unaccountable thing she felt all akin to the nature about her and her blood was coursing as the sap rushes through a tree she would not speak to him of that she was sure and equally sure that he would not speak to her the horse was walking now and suddenly jethro bass faced around and her heart stood still  hhow be you cynthy he asked  how do you do jethro  a thrush in the woods began to sing a hymn and they listened after that a silence save for the notes of answering birds quickened by the song the ministers horse nibbling at the bushes cynthia herself could not have explained why she lingered suddenly he shot a question at her  where be you goin  to brampton to get miss lucretia to change this book and she held it up from her lap it was a very large book  whwhats it about he demanded  napoleon bonaparte  who was be  he was a very strong man he began life poor and unknown and fought his way upward until he conquered the world  cconquered the world did you say conquered the world  yes  jethro pondered  guess theres somethin wrong about that booksomethin wrong conquer the united states  cynthia smiled she herself did not realize that we were not a part of the world then  he conquered europe where all the kings and queens are and became a king himselfan emperor  i want toknow said jethro you said he was a poor boy  why dont you read the book jethro cynthia answered i am sure i can get miss lucretia to let you have it  dont know as id understand it he demurred  ill try to explain what you dont understand said cynthia and her heart gave a bound at the very idea  will you he said looking at her eagerly will you you mean it  certainly she answered and blushed not knowing why ii must be going and she gathered up the reins  when will you give it to me  ill stop at the tannery when i come back from brampton she said and drove on once she gave a fleeting glance over her shoulder and he was still standing where she had left him  when she returned in the yellow afternoon light that flowed over wood and pasture he came out of the tannery door jake wheeler or speedy bates the journeyman tailoress from whom little escaped could not have said it was by designthought nothing indeed of that part of it  as i live cried speedy from the window to aunt lucy prescott in the bed if cynthy aint givin him a book as big as the bible  aunt lucy hoped first that it was the bible and second that jethro would read it aunt lucy and established church coniston in general believed in snatching brands from the burning and who so deft as cynthia at this kind of snatching so cynthia herself was a hypocrite for once and did not know it at that time jethros sins were mostly of omission as far as rum was concerned he was a creature after aunt lucys own heart for he never touched it true gaunt deacon ira perkins tithingman had once chided him for breaking the sabbathshooting at a fox  to return to the book as long as he lived jethro looked back to the joy of the monumental task of mastering its contents in his mind napoleon became a rough yankee general of the cities villages and fortress he formed as accurate a picture as a resident of venice from marco polos account of tartary jethro had learned to read after a fashion to write add multiply and divide he knew that george washington and certain barefooted companions had forced a proud britain to her knees and much of the warring in the book took color from captain timothy prescotts stories of general stark and his campaigns heard at jonah winchs store what paris looked like or berlin or the hospice of st bernardthough imaged by a winter conistontroubled jethro not at all the thing that stuck in his mind was that napoleonfor a considerable time at leastcompelled men to do his bidding constitutions crumble before the strong not that jethro philosophized about constitutions existing conditions presented themselves and it occurred to him that there were crevices in the town system and ways into power through the crevices for men clever enough to find them  a week later and in these same great woods on the way to brampton cynthia overtook him once more it was characteristic of him that he plunged at once into the subject uppermost in his mind  not a very big place this corsicanot a very big place  a little island in the mediterranean said cynthia  hum country folks the bonapartescountry folks  cynthia laughed  i suppose you might call them so she said they were poor and lived out of the world  he was a smart man but he found things goin his way didnt have to move em  not at first she admitted but he had to move mountains later how far have you read  one thing that helped him said jethro in indirect answer to this question he got a smart woman for his wifea smart woman  cynthia looked down at the reins in her lap and she felt again that wicked stirring within herincredible stirring of ministers daughter for tanners son coniston believes and always will believe that the social bars are strong enough so cynthia looked down at the reins  poor josephine she said i always wish he had not cast her off  ccast her off said jethro cast her off why did he do that  after a while when he got to be emperor he needed a wife who would be more useful to him josephine had become a drag he cared more about getting on in the world than he did about his wife  jethro looked away contemplatively  wawahnt the woman to blame any he said  read the book and youll see retorted cynthia flicking her horse which started at all gaits down the road jethro stood in his tracks staring but this time he did not see her face above the hood of the gig presently he trudged on head downward pondering upon another problem than napoleons cynthia at length arrived in brampton street in a humor that puzzled the good miss lucretia sorely     chapter ii  the sun had dropped behind the mountain leaving coniston in amethystine shadow and the last bee had flown homeward from the apple blossoms in front of aunt lucy prescotts window before cynthia returned aunt lucy was cynthias grandmother and eightynine years of age still she sat in her window beside the lilac bush lost in memories of a stout rosy lass who had followed a stalwart husband up a broad river into the wilderness some seventy years agone in indian daysweathersfield massacre days that lass was aunt lucy herself and in just such a may had timothys axe rung through the coniston forest and reared the log cabin where six of her children were born likewise in review passed the lonely months when timothy was fighting behind his rugged general stark for that privilege more desirable to his kind than lifeself government timothy prescott would pull the forelock to no man would have such godfearing persons as he chose make his laws for him  honest captain timothy and his stark heroes aunt lucy and her memories have long gone to rest little did they dream of the nation we have lived to see straining at her constitution like a great ship at anchor in a gale with funnels belching forth smoke and a new race of men thronging her decks for the mastery coniston is there still behind its mountain with its rusty firelocks and its hillside graves  cynthia driving back from brampton in the gig smiled at aunt lucy in the window but she did not so much as glance at the tannery house farther on the tannery house be it known was the cottage where jethro dwelt and which had belonged to nathan his father and the tannery sheds were at some distance behind it nearer coniston water cynthia did not glance at the tannery house for a wave of orthodox indignation had swept over her at any rate we may call it so in other words she was angry with herself pitied and scorned herself if the truth be told for her actionsan inevitable mood  in front of the ministers barn under the elms on the hill cynthia pulled the harness from the tired horse with an energy that betokened activity of mind she was not one who shrank from selfknowledge and the question put itself to her whither was this matter tending the fire that is in strong men has ever been a lure to women and many meaning to play with it have been burnt thereby since the world began but to turn the fire to some use to make the world better for it or stranger for it that were an achievement indeed the horse munching his hay cynthia lingered as the light fainted above the ridge with the thought that this might be womans province and miss lucretia penniman might go on leading her women regiments to no avail nevertheless she was angry with jethro not because of what he had said but because of what he was  the next day is sunday and there is mild excitement in coniston for jethro bass still with the coonskin cap but in a brassbuttoned coat secretly purchased in brampton appeared at meeting it made no difference that he entered quietly and sat in the rear slip orthodox coniston knew that he was behind them good mr ware knew it and changed a little his prayers and sermon cynthia knew it grew hot and cold by turns under her poke bonnet was he not her brand and would she not get the credit of snatching him how willingly then would she have given up that credit to the many who coveted itif it were a credit was jethro at meeting for any religious purpose  jethros importance to coniston lay in his soul and that soul was numbered at present ninety and ninth when the meeting was over aunt lucy prescott hobbled out at an amazing pace to advise him to read chapter seven of matthew but he had vanished via the horse sheds if she had known it and along coniston water to the house by the tannery where he drew breath in a state of mind not to be depicted he had gazed at the back of cynthias poke bonnet for two hours but he had an uneasy feeling that he would have to pay a price  the price was paid in part during the next six days to do jethros importance absolute justice he did inspire fear among his contemporaries and young men and women did not say much to his face what they did say gave them little satisfaction grim deacon ira stopped him as he was going to buy hides and would have prayed over him if jethro had waited dear aunt lucy did pray but in private in six days orthodox coniston came to the conclusion that this ninety and ninth soul were better left to her who had snatched it cynthia ware  as for cynthia nothing was farther from her mind unchristian as was the thought if this thing she had awakened could only have been put back to sleep again she would have thought herself happy but would she have been happy when moses hatch congratulated her with more humor than sincerity he received the greatest scare of his life yet in those days she welcomed mosess society as she never had before and coniston including moses himself began thinking of a wedding  another saturday came and no cynthia went to brampton jethro may or may not have been on the road sunday and there was jethro on the back seat in the meetinghouse sunday noon over his frugal dinner the minister mildly remonstrates with cynthia for neglecting one who has shown signs of grace citing certain failures of others of his congregation cynthia turns scarlet leaving the minister puzzled and a little uneasy monday miss lucretia penniman alarmed comes to coniston to inquire after cynthias health cynthia drives back with her as far as four corners talking literature and the advancement of woman returns on foot thinking of something else when she discerns a figure seated on a log by the roadside bent as in meditation there was no going back the thing to do was to come on as unconcernedly as possible not noticing anythingwhich cynthia did not without a little inward palpitating and curiosity for which she hated herself and looked the sterner the figure unfolded itself like a jack from a box  you say the woman wahnt any to blamewahnt any to blame  the poke bonnet turned away the shoulders under it began to shake and presently the astonished jethro heard what seemed to be faint peals of laughter suddenly she turned around to him all trace of laughter gone  why dont you read the book  so i am said jethro so i am haint come to this castingoff yet  and you didnt look ahead to find out this with scorn  never heard of readin a book in that fashion ill come to it in timegguess it wont run away  cynthia stared at him perhaps with a new interest at this plodding determination she was not quite sure that she ought to stand talking to him a third time in these woods especially if the subject of conversation were not as coniston thought the salvation of his soul but she stayed here was a woman who could be dealt with by no known rules who did not even deign to notice a week of marked coldness  jethro she said with a terrifying sternness i am going to ask you a question and you must answer me truthfully  gguess i wont find any trouble about that said jethro apparently not in the least terrified  i want you to tell me why you are going to meeting  to see you said jethro promptly to see you  dont you know that that is wrong  hhadnt thought much about it answered jethro  well you should think about it people dont go to meeting toto look at other people  thought they did said jethro wwhy do they wear their best clotheswhy do they wear their best clothes  to honor god said cynthia with a shade lacking in the conviction for she added hurriedly it isnt right for you to go to church to seeanybody you go there to hear the scriptures expounded and to have your sins forgiven because i lent you that book and you come to meeting people think im converting you  so you be replied jethro and this time it was he who smiled so you be  cynthia turned away her lips pressed together how to deal with such a man wondrous notes broke on the stillness the thrush was singing his hymn again only now it seemed a paean high in the azure a hawk wheeled and floated  couldnt you see i was very angry with you  ssaw you was goin with moses hatch more than common  cynthia drew breath sharply this was audacityand yet she liked it  i am very fond of moses she said quickly  you always was charitable cynthy said he  havent i been charitable to you she retorted  gguess it has ben charity said jethro he looked down at her solemnly thoughtfully no trace of anger in his face turned and without another word strode off in the direction of coniston flat  he left a tumultuous cynthia amazement and repentance struggling with anger which forbade her calling him back pride in her answering to pride in him and she rejoicing fiercely that he had pride had he but known it every step he took away from her that evening was a step in advance and she gloried in the fact that he did not once look back as she walked toward coniston the thought came to her that she was rid of the thing she had stirred up perhaps forever and the thrush burst into his song once more  that night after cynthias candle had gone out when the minister sat on his doorsteps looking at the glory of the moon on the mountain forest he was startled by the sight of a figure slowly climbing toward him up the slope a second glance told him that it was jethros vaguely troubled he watched his approach for good priest ware while able to obey onehalf the scriptural injunction had not the wisdom of the serpent and women as typified by cynthia were a continual puzzle to him that very evening moses hatch had called had been received with more favor than usual and suddenly packed off about his business seated in the moonlight the minister wondered vaguely whether jethro bass were troubling the girl and now jethro stood before him holding out a book rising mr ware bade him good evening mildly and cordially  ccome to leave this book for cynthy said jethro  mr ware took it mechanically  have you finished it he asked kindly  all i want replied jethro all i want  he turned and went down the slope twice the words rose to the ministers lips to call him back and were suppressed yet what to say to him if he came mr ware sat down again sadly wondering why jethro bass should be so difficult to talk to  the parsonage was of only one story with a steep sloping roof on the left of the doorway was cynthias room and the minister imagined he heard a faint rustling noise at her window presently he arose barred the door could be heard moving around in his room for a while and after that all was silence save for the mournful crying of a whippoorwill in the woods then a door opened softly a white vision stole into the little entry lighted by the fanwindow above seized the book and stole back had the minister been a prying man about his household he would have noticed next day that cynthias candle was burned down to the socket he saw nothing of the kind he saw in fact that his daughter flitted about the house singing and he went out into the sun to drop potatoes  no sooner had he reached the barn than this singing ceased but how was mr ware to know that  twice cynthia during the week that followed got halfway down the slope of the parsonage hill the book under her arm on her way to the tannery twice went back tears of humiliation and selfpity in her eyes at the thought that she should make advances to a man and that man the tanners son her household work done a longing for further motion seized her and she walked out under the maples of the village street let it be understood that coniston was a village by courtesy and its shaded road a street suddenly there was the tannery jethro standing in front of it contemplative did he see her would he come to her cynthia seized by a panic of shame flew into aunt lucy prescotts sat through half an hour of torture while aunt lucy talked of redemption of sinners during ten minutes of which jethro stood still contemplative what tumult was in his breast or whether there was any tumult cynthia knew not he went into the tannery again and though she saw him twice later in the week he gave no sign of seeing her  on saturday cynthia bought a new bonnet in brampton sunday morning put it on suddenly remembered that one went to church to honor god and wore her old one walked to meeting in a flutter of expectancy not to be denied and would have looked around had that not been a cardinal sin in coniston no jethro general opinion had she waited to hear it among the horse sheds or on the green that jethros soul had slid back into the murky regions from which it were folly for even cynthia to try to drag it     chapter iii  to prove that jethros soul had not slid back into the murky regions and that it was still indulging in flights it is necessary to follow him for a very short space to boston jethro himself went in lyman hulls sixhorse team with a load of his own merchandisehides that he had tanned and other country produce and they did not go by the way of truro pass to the capital but took the state turnpike over the ranges where you can see for miles and miles and miles on a clear summer day across the trembling floors of the forest tops to lonely sentinel mountains fourscore miles away  no one takes the state turnpike nowadays except crazy tourists who are willing to risk their necks and their horses legs for the sake of scenery the tough little morgans of that time which kept their feet like cats have all but disappeared but there were places on that road where lyman hull put the shoes under his wheels for four miles at a stretch he was not a companion many people would have chosen with whom to enjoy the beauties of such a trip and nearly everybody in coniston was afraid of him jethro bass would sit silent on the seat for hours andit is a fact to be noted that when he told lyman to do a thing lyman did it not perhaps without cursing and grumbling lyman was a profane and wicked mandrover farmer trader anything he had a cider mill on his farm on the south slopes of coniston which mr ware had mentioned in his sermons and which was the resort of the ungodly the cider was not so good as squire northcutts but cheaper jethro was not afraid of lyman and he had a mortgage on the sixhorse team and on the farm and the cider mill  after six days jethro and lyman drove over charlestown bridge and into the crooked streets of boston and at length arrived at a drovers hotel or lodginghouse that did not we may be sure front on mount vernon street or face the mall lyman proceeded to get drunk and jethro to sell the hides and other merchandise which lyman had hauled for him  there was a young man in boston when jethro arrived in lyman hulls team named william wetherell by extraordinary circumstances he and another connected with him are to take no small part in this story which is a sufficient excuse for his introduction his father had been a prosperous portsmouth merchant in the west india trade a man of many attainments who had failed and died of a broken heart and william at two and twenty was a clerk in the little jewellery shop of mr judson in cornhill  william wetherell had literary aspirations and sat from morning till night behind the counter reading and dreaming dreaming that he was to be an irving or a walter scott and yet the sum total of his works in after years consisted of some letters to the newcastle guardian and a beginning of the town history of coniston  william had a contempt for the awkward young countryman who suddenly loomed up before him that summers morning across the counter but a moment before the clerk had been in a place where he would fain have lingereda city where blue waters flow swiftly between white palaces toward the sunrise       and i have fitted up some chambers there      looking toward the golden eastern air      and level with the living winds which flow      like waves above the living waves below  little did william wetherell guess when he glanced up at the intruder that he was looking upon one of the forces of his own life the countryman wore a blue swallow tail coat fashioned by the hand of speedy bates a neckcloth a coonskin cap and his trousers were tucked into rawhide boots he did not seem a promising customer for expensive jewellery and the literary clerk did not rise but merely closed his book with his thumb in it  ssell things here asked the countryman ssell things here  occasionally when folks have money to buy them  my names jethro bass said the countryman jethro bass from coniston ever hear of coniston  young mr wetherell never had but many years afterward he remembered his name heaven knows why jethro bass perhaps it had a strange ring to it  ffolks told me to be careful was jethros next remark he did not look at the clerk but kept his eyes fixed on the things within the counter  somebody ought to have come with you said the clerk with a smile of superiority  ddont know much about city ways  well said the clerk beginning to be amused a man has to keep his wits about him  even then jethro spared him a look but continued to study the contents of the case  what can i do for you mr bass we have some really good things here for example this swiss watch which i will sell you cheap for one hundred and fifty dollars  one hundred and fifty dollarserone hundred and fifty  wetherell nodded still the countryman did not look up  ffolks told me to be careful he repeated without a smile he was looking at the lockets and finally pointed a large finger at one of themthe most expensive by the way wwhat dye get for that he asked  twenty dollars the clerk promptly replied thirty was nearer the price but what did it matter  hhow much for that he said pointing to another the clerk told him he inquired about them all deliberately repeating the sums considering with so wellfeigned an air of a purchaser that mr wetherell began to take a real joy in the situation for trade was slack in august and diversion scarce finally he commanded that the case be put on the top of the counter and wetherell humored him whereupon he picked up the locket he had first chosen it looked very delicate in his huge rough hand and wetherell was surprised that the eyes of mr bass had been caught by the most expensive for it was far from being the showiest  ttwenty dollars he asked  we may as well call it that laughed wetherell  its not too good for cynthy he said  nothings too good for cynthy answered mr wetherell mockingly little knowing how he might come to mean it  jethro bass paid no attention to this speech pulling a great cowhide wallet from his pocket still holding the locket in his hand to the amazement of the clerk he counted out twenty dollars and laid them down  gguess ill take that one gguess ill take that one he said  then he looked at mr wetherell for the first time  hold cried the clerk more alarmed than he cared to show thats not the price did you think i could sell it for that price  wwahnt that the price you fixed  you simpleton retorted wetherell with a conviction now that he was calling him the wrong name give me back the locket and you shall have your money again  wwahnt that the price you fixed  yes but  gguess ill keep the locketgguess ill keep the locket  wetherell looked at him aghast and there was no doubt about his determination with a sinking heart the clerk realized that he should have to make good to mr judson the seven odd dollars of difference and then he lost his head slipping round the counter to the door of the shop he turned the key thrust it in his pocket and faced mr bass againfrom behind the counter  you dont leave this shop cried the clerk until you give me back that locket  jethro bass turned a bench ran along the farther wall and there he planted himself without a word while the clerk stared at himwith what feelings of uneasiness i shall not attempt to describefor the customer was plainly determined to wait until hunger should drive one of them forth the minutes passed and wetherell began to hate him then some one tried the door peered in through the glass perceived jethro shook the knob knocked violently all to no purpose jethro seemed lost in a reverie  this has gone far enough said the clerk trying to keep his voice from shaking it is beyond a joke give me back the locket and he tendered jethro the money again  wwahnt that the price you fixed asked jethro innocently  wetherell choked the man outside shook the door again and people on the sidewalk stopped and presently against the window panes a sea of curious faces gazed in upon them mr basss thoughts apparently were fixed on eternityhe looked neither at the people nor at wetherell and then the crowd parting as for one in authority as in a bad dream the clerk saw his employer mr judson courteously pushing away the customer at the door who would not be denied another moment and mr judson had gained admittance with his private key and stood on the threshold staring at clerk and customer jethro gave no sign that the situation had changed  william said mr judson in a dangerously quiet voice perhaps you can explain this extraordinary state of affairs  i can sir william cried this gentleman the word stuck in his throat this gentleman came in here to examine lockets which i had no reason to believe he would buy i admit my fault sir he asked the price of the most expensive and i told him twenty dollars merely for a jest sir william hesitated  well said mr judson  after pricing every locket in the case he seized the first one handed me twenty dollars and now refuses to give it up although he knows the price is twentyseven  then  then i locked the door sir he sat down there and hasnt moved since  mr judson looked again at mr bass this time with unmistakable interest the other customer began to laugh and the crowd was pressing in and mr judson turned and shut the door in their faces all this time mr bass had not moved not so much as to lift his head or shift one of his great cowhide boots  well sir demanded mr judson what have you to say  nnothin gguess ill keep the locket ive paid for itive paid for it  and you are aware my friend said mr judson that my clerk has given you the wrong price  guess thats his lookout he still sat there doggedly unconcerned  a bull would have seemed more at home in a china shop than jethro bass in a jewellery store but mr judson himself was a man out of the ordinary and instead of getting angry he began to be more interested  took you for a greenhorn did he he remarked  ffolks told me to be carefulto be careful said mr bass  then mr judson laughed it was all the more disconcerting to william wetherell because his employer laughed rarely he laid his hand on jethros shoulder  he might have spared himself the trouble my young friend he said you didnt expect to find a greenhorn behind a jewellery counter did you  ssurprised me some said jethro  mr judson laughed again all the while looking at him  i am going to let you keep the locket he said because it will teach my greenhorn a lesson william do you hear that  yes sir william said and his face was very red  mr bass rose solemnly apparently unmoved by his triumph in a somewhat remarkable transaction and william long remembered how he towered over all of them he held the locket out to mr judson who stared at it astonished  whats this said that gentleman you dont want it  guess ill have it marked said jethro ef it dont cost extry  marked gasped mr judson marked  ef it dont cost extry jethro repeated  well ill exclaimed mr judson and suddenly recalled the fact that he was a church member what inscription do you wish put into it he asked recovering himself with an effort  jethro thrust his hand into his pocket and again the cowhide wallet came out he tendered mr judson a somewhat soiled piece of paper and mr judson read          cynthy from jethro  cynthy mr judson repeated in a tremulous voice cynthy not cynthia  hhow is it written said jethro leaning over it hhow is it written  cynthy answered mr judson involuntarily  then make it cynthymake it cynthy  cynthy it shall be said mr judson with conviction  whenll you have it done  tonight replied mr judson with a twinkle in his eye tonight as a special favor  what timewwhat time  seven oclock sir may i send it to your hotel the tremont house i suppose  iill call said jethro so solemnly that mr judson kept his laughter until he was gone  from the door they watched him silently as he strode across the street and turned the corner then mr judson turned that man will make his mark william he said and added thoughtfully but whether for good or evil i know not     chapter iv  what cynthia may have thought or felt during jethros absence in boston and for some months thereafter she kept to herself honest moses hatch pursued his courting untroubled and never knew that he had a rival moses would as soon have questioned the seasons or the weather as cynthias changes of moodswhich were indeed the weather for him and when storms came he sat with his back to them waiting for the sunshine he had long ceased proposing marriage in the firm belief that cynthia would set the day in her own good time thereby he was saved much suffering  the summer flew on apace for coniston fragrant hay was cut on hillsides won from rock and forest and coniston water sang a gentler melodysave when the clouds floated among the spruces on the mountain and the rain beat on the shingles during the still days before the turn of the yeardays of bending fruit boughs crabapples glistening red in the soft sunlightrumor came from brampton to wrinkle the forehead of moses hatch as he worked among his fathers orchards  the rumor was of a mr isaac dudley worthington a name destined to make much rumor before it was to be carved on the marble isaac d worthington indeed might by a stretch of the imagination be called the pioneer of all the genus to be known in the future as city folks who were two generations later to invade the country like a devouring army of locusts  at that time a stranger in brampton was enough to set the town agog but a young man of three and twenty with an independent income of four hundred dollars a yearor any income at all not derived from his own laborwas unheard of it is said that when the stage from over truro gap arrived in brampton street a hundred eyes gazed at him unseen from various ambushes and followed him up the walk to silas wheelocks where he was to board in half an hour brampton knew the essentials of isaac worthingtons story and sam price was on his way with it to coniston for distribution at jonah winchs store  young mr worthington was from bostonno less slim pale medium height but with an alert look and a highbridged nose but his clothes sam prices vocabulary was insufficient here they were cut in such a way and mr worthington was downright distinguishedlooking under his gray beaver why had he come to brampton demanded deacon ira perkins sam had saved this for the last young mr worthington was threatened with consumption and had been sent to live with his distant relative silas wheelock  the presence of a gentleman of leisurealthough threatened with consumptionbecame an allabsorbing topic in two villages and three hamlets and more than one swain hitherto successful felt the wind blow colder but in a fortnight it was known that a petticoat did not make isaac worthington even turn his head curiosity centred on silas wheelocks barn where mr worthington had fitted up a shop and presently various strange models of contrivances began to take shape there what these were silas himself knew not and the gentleman of leisure was alas closemouthed when he was not sawing and hammering and planing he took long walks up and down coniston water and was surprised deep in thought at several places  nathan basss storyandahalf house devoid of paint faced the road and behind it was the shed or barn that served as the tannery and between the tannery and coniston water were the vats the rain flew in silvery spray and the drops shone like jewels on the coat of a young man who stood looking in at the tannery door young jake wheeler son of the village spendthrift was driving a lean white horse round in a ring to the horse was attached a beam and on the beam a huge round stone rolled on a circular oak platform jethro bass who was engaged in pushing hemlock bark under the stone to be crushed straightened of the three the horse had seen the visitor first and stopped in his tracks  jethro whispered jake tingling with an excitement that was but natural jethro had begun to sweep the finer pieces of bark toward the centre its the city man walked up here from brampton  it was indeed mr worthington slightly more sunburned and less citifiedlooking than on his arrival and he wore a woollen cap of brampton make even then despite his wavy hair and delicate appearance isaac worthington had the hawklike look which became famous in later years and at length he approached jethro and fixed his eye upon him  kind of slow work isnt it remarked mr worthington  the white horse was the only one to break the silence that followed by sneezing with all his might  how is the tannery business in these parts essayed mr worthington again  thinkin of it said jethro tthinkin of it be you  no answered mr worthington hastily if i were he added id put in new machinery that horse and stone is primitive  what kind of machinery would you put in asked jethro  ah answered worthington that will interest you all new englanders are naturally progressive i take it  wwhat was it you took  i was merely remarking on the enterprise of new englanders said worthington flushing on my journey up here beside the merrimac i had the opportunity to inspect the new steamboiler the fallingmill the splitting machine and other remarkable improvements in fact these suggested one or two little things to me which might be of interest to you  well said jethro they might and then again they mightnt guess it depends  depends exclaimed the man of leisure depends on what  hhow much you know about it  young mr worthington instead of being justly indignant laughed and settled himself comfortably on a pile of bark he thought jethro a character and he was not mistaken on the other hand mr worthington displayed a knowledge of the fallingmill and splittingmachine and the process of tanneries in general that was surprising jethro had mr worthington but known it was more interested in animate machines more interested in mr worthington than the fallingmill or indeed the tannery business  at length the visitor fell silent his sense of superiority suddenly gone others had had this same feeling with jethro even the minister but the man of leisure who was nothing of the sort merely felt a kind of bewilderment  callatin to live in bramptonbe you asked jethro  i am living there now  ccallatin to set up a mill some day  mr worthington fairly leaped off the bark pile  what makes you say that he demanded  gguesswork said jethro starting to shovel again gguesswork  to take a walk in the wild to come upon a bumpkin in cowhide boots crushing bark to have him read within twenty minutes a cherished and wellhidden ambition which brampton had not discovered in a month and did not discover for many years was sufficiently startling well might mr worthington tremble for his other ambitions and they were many  jethro stepped out passing mr worthington as though he had already forgotten that gentlemans existence and seized an armful of bark that lay under cover of a leanto just then heralded by a brightening of the western sky a girl appeared down the road her head bent a little as in thought and if she saw the group by the tannery house she gave no sign two of them stared at herjake wheeler and mr worthington suddenly jake implike turned and stared at worthington  cynthy ware the ministers daughter he said  havent i seen her in brampton inquired mr worthington little thinking of the consequences of the question  guess you have answered jake cynthy goes to the social library to git books she knows moren the minister himself a sight more  where does the minister live asked mr worthington  jake pulled him by the sleeve toward the road and pointed to the low gable of the little parsonage under the elms on the hill beyond the meetinghouse the visitor gave a short glance at it swung around and gave a longer glance at the figure disappearing in the other direction he did not suspect that jake was what is now called a news agency then mr worthington turned to jethro who was stooping over the bark  if you come to brampton call and see me he said youll find me at silas wheelocks  he got no answer but apparently expected none and he started off down the brampton road in the direction cynthia had taken  that makes another said jake significantly and speedy bates says he never looks at wimmen godfrey i wish i could see moses now  mr worthington had not been quite ingenuous with jake to tell the truth he had made the acquaintance of the social library and miss lucretia and that lady had sung the praises of her favorite once out of sight of jethro mr worthington quickened his steps passed the store where he was remarked by two of jonahs customers and his blood leaped when he saw the girl in front of him walking faster now yes it is a fact that isaac worthingtons blood once leaped he kept on but when near her had a spasm of fright to make his teeth fairly chatter and than another spasm followed for cynthia had turned around  how do you do mr worthington she said dropping him a little courtesy mr worthington stopped in his tracks and it was some time before he remembered to take off his woollen cap and sweep the mud with it  you know my name he exclaimed  it is known from tarleton four corners to harwich said cynthia all that distance to tell the truth she added those are the boundaries of my world and mr worthington being still silent how do you like being a big frog in a little pond  if it were your pond miss cynthia he responded gallantly i should be content to be a little frog  would you she said i dont believe you  this was not subtle flattery but the truthmr worthington would never be content to be a little anything so he had been judged twice in an afternoon once by jethro and again by cynthia  why dont you believe me he asked ecstatically  a womans instinct mr worthington has very little reason in it  i hear miss cynthia he said gallantly that your instinct is fortified by learning since miss penniman tells me that you are quite capable of taking a school in boston  then i should be doubly sure of your character she retorted with a twinkle  will you tell my fortune he said gayly  not on such a slight acquaintance she replied goodby mr worthington  i shall see you in brampton he cried ii have seen you in brampton  she did not answer this confession but left him and presently disappeared beyond the triangle of the green while mr worthington pursued his way to brampton by the roadhis thoughts that evening not on waterfalls or machinery as for cynthias conduct i do not defend or explain it for i have found out that the best and wisest of women can at times be coquettish  it was that meeting which shook the serenity of poor moses and he learned of it when he went to jonah winchs store an hour later an hour later indeed coniston was discussing the man of leisure in a new light it was possible that cynthia might take him and deacon ira perkins made a note the next time he went to brampton to question silas wheelock on mr worthingtons origin habits and orthodoxy  cynthia troubled herself very little about any of these scarcely any purpose in the world is single but she had had a purpose in talking to mr worthington besides the pleasure it gave her and the next saturday when she rode off to brampton some one looked through the cracks in the tannery shed and saw that she wore her new bonnet  there is scarcely a pleasanter place in the world than brampton street on a summers day down the length of it runs a wide green shaded by spreading trees and on either side treeshaded too and each in its own little plot gabled houses of that simple graceful architecture of our forefathers some of these had fluted pilasters and cornices the envy of many a modern architect and fanshaped windows in dormer and doorway and there was the church then new that still stands to the glory of its builders with terraced steeple and pillared porch and the widest of checkerpaned sashes to let in the light on highbacked pews and gallery  the celebrated social library halfway up the street occupied part of miss lucretias little house or it might better be said miss lucretia boarded with the social library there cynthia hitched her horse gave greeting to mr ezra graves and others who paused and before she was fairly in the door was clasped in miss lucretias arms there were new books to be discussed arrived by the stage the day before but scarce half an hour had passed before cynthia started guiltily at a timid knock and miss lucretia rose briskly  it must be ezra graves come for the gibbon she said hes early and she went to the door cynthia thought it was not ezra then came miss lucretias voice from the entry  why mr worthington have you read the last of the mohicans already  there he stood indeed the man of leisure and today he wore his beaver hat no he had not yet read the last of the mohicans there were things in it that mr worthington would like to discuss with miss penniman was it not a social library at this juncture there came a giggle from within that made him turn scarlet and he scarcely heard miss lucretia offering to discuss the whole range of letters enter mr worthington bows profoundly to miss lucretias guest his beaver in his hand and the discussion begins cynthia taking no part in it strangely enough mr worthingtons remarks on american indians are not only intelligent but interesting the clock strikes four miss lucretia starts up suddenly remembering that she has promised to read to an invalid and with many regrets from mr worthington she departs then he sits down again twirling his beaver while cynthia looks at him in quiet amusement  i shall walk to coniston again next week he announced  what an energetic man said cynthia  i want to have my fortune told  i hear that you walk a great deal she remarked up and down coniston water i shall begin to think you romantic mr worthingtonperhaps a poet  i dont walk up and down coniston water for that reason he answered earnestly  might i be so bold as to ask the reason she ventured  great men have their weaknesses and many closemouthed with their own sex will tell their cherished hopes to a woman if their interests are engaged with a basrelief of isaac worthington in the town library today his own library and a fulllength portrait of him in the capitol of the state who shall deny this title to greatness  he leaned a little toward her his face illumined by his subject which was himself  i will confide in you he said that some day i shall build here in brampton a woollen mill which will be the best of its kind if i gain money it will not be to hoard it or to waste it i shall try to make the town better for it and the state and i shall try to elevate my neighbors  cynthia could not deny that these were laudable ambitions  something tells me he continued that i shall succeed and that is why i walk on coniston waterto choose the best site for a dam  i am honored by your secret but i feel that the responsibility you repose in me is too great she said  i can think of none in whom i would rather confide said he  and am i the only one in all brampton harwich and coniston who knows this she asked  mr worthington laughed  the only one of importance he answered this week when i went to coniston i had a strange experience i left the brook at a tannery and a most singular fellow was in the shed shovelling bark i tried to get him to talk and told him about some new tanning machinery i had seen suddenly he turned on me and asked me if i was callatin to set up a mill he gave me a queer feeling do you have many such odd characters in coniston miss cynthia youre not going  cynthia had risen and all of the laugher was gone from her eyes what had happened to make her grow suddenly grave isaac worthington never knew  i have to get my fathers supper she said  he too rose puzzled and disconcerted at this change in her  and may i not come to coniston he asked  my father and i should be glad to see you mr worthington she answered  he untied her horse and essayed one more topic  you are taking a very big book he said may i look at the title  she showed it to him in silence it was the life of napoleon bonaparte     chapter v  isaac worthington came to coniston not once but many times before the snow fell and afterward too in silas wheelocks yellow sleigh through the great drifts under the pines the chestnut morgan trotting to one side in the tracks on one of these excursions he fell in with that singular character of a bumpkin who had interested him on his first visit in coonskin cap and overcoat and mittens jethro bass was plodding in the same direction and isaac worthington out of the goodness of his heart invited him into the sleigh he was scarcely prepared for the bumpkins curt refusal but put it down to native boorishness and thought no more about it then  what troubled mr worthington infinitely more was the progress of his suit for it had become a snit though progress is a wrong word to use in connection with it so far had he gotnot a great distanceand then came to what he at length discovered was a wall and apparently impenetrable he was not even allowed to look over it cynthia was kind engaging even mirthful at times save when he approached it and he became convinced that a certain sorrow lay in the forbidden ground the nearest he had come to it was when he mentioned again by accident that life of napoleon  that cynthia would accept him nobody doubted for an instant it would be madness not to he was orthodox so deacon ira had discovered of good habits and there was the princely four hundred a yearalmost a ministers salary little people guessed that there was no lovemakingonly endless discussions of books beside the great centre chimney and discussions of isaac worthingtons career  it is a factfor future considerationthat isaac worthington proposed to cynthia ware although neither speedy bates nor deacon ira perkins heard him do so it had been very carefully prepared that speech and was a model of proposals for the rising young men of all time mr worthington preferred to offer himself for what he was going to benot for what he was he tendered to cynthia a note for a large amount payable in some twenty years with interest the astonishing thing to record is that in twenty years he could have more than paid the note although he could not have foreseen at that time the worthington free library and the truro railroad and the stainedglass window in the church and the great marble monument on the hillto another woman all of these things and more cynthia might have had if she had only accepted that promise to pay but she did not accept it he was a trifle more robust than when he came to brampton in the summer but perhaps she doubted his promise to pay  it may have been guessed although the language we have used has been purposely delicate that cynthia was already in love withsomebody else shame of shames and horror of horrorswith jethro bass with strength in the crudest form in which it is created perhaps but yet with strength the strength might gradually and eventually be refined such was her hope when she had any it is hard looking back upon that virginal and cultured cynthia to be convinced that she could have loved passionately and such a man but love she did and passionately too and hated herself for it and prayed and struggled to cast out what she believed at times to be a devil  the ancient allegory of cupid and the arrows has never been improved upon of cupid who should never in the world have been trusted with a weapon who defies all game laws who shoots people in the bushes and innocent bystanders generally the weak and the helpless and the strong and selfconfident there is no more reason in it than that he shot cynthia ware and what she suffered in secret coniston never guessed what parallels in history shall i quote to bring home the enormity of such a mesalliance orthodox coniston would have gone into sackcloth and asheswas soon to go into these anyway  i am not trying to keep the lovers apart for any mere purposes of fictionthis is a true chronicle and they stayed apart most of that winter jethro went about his daily tasks which were now become manifold and he wore the locket on its little chain himself he did not think that cynthia loved himyet but he had the effrontery to believe that she might some day and he was content to wait he saw that she avoided him and he was too proud to go to the parsonage and so incur ridicule and contempt  jethro was content to wait that is a clew to his character throughout his life he would wait for his love he would wait for his hate he had waited ten years before putting into practice the first step of a little scheme which he had been gradually developing during that time for which he had been amassing money and the life of napoleon bonaparte by the way had given him some valuable ideas jethro as well as isaac d worthington had ambitions although no one in coniston had hitherto guessed them except jock hallowelland cynthia ware after her curiosity had been aroused  even as isaac d worthington did not dream of the truro railroad and of an era in the haze of futurity it did not occur to jethro bass that his ambitions tended to the making of another era that was at hand makers of eras are too busy thinking about themselves and like immediate matters to worry about history jethro never heard the expression about cracks in the constitution and would not have known what it meanthe merely had the desire to get on top but with established church coniston tight in the saddle in the person of moses hatch senior how was he to do it  as the winter wore on and march town meeting approached strange rumors of a democratic ticket began to drift into jonah winchs storea democratic ticket headed by fletcher bartlett of all men as chairman of the board moses laughed when he first heard of it for fletcher was an easygoing farmer of the methodist persuasion who was always in debt and the other members of the ticket so far as moses could learn of itwere remarkable neither for orthodoxy or solidity the rumors persisted and still moses laughed for the senior selectman was a big man with flesh on him who could laugh with dignity  moses said deacon lysander richardson as they stood on the platform of the store one sunny saturday in february somebodys put fletcher up to this he haint got sense enough to act that independent all by himself  you be always croakin lysander answered moses  cynthia ware who had come to the store for buttons for speedy bates who was making a new coat for the minister heard these remarks and stood thoughtfully staring at the blue coattails of the elders a brass button was gone from deacon lysanders and she wanted to sew it on suddenly she looked up and saw jock hallowell standing beside her jock winkedand cynthia blushed and hurried homeward without a word she remembered vividly enough what jack had told her the spring before and several times during the week that followed she thought of waylaying him and asking what he knew but she could not summon the courage as a matter of fact jock knew nothing but he had a theory he was a strange man jock who whistled all day on roof and steeple and meddled with nobodys business as a rule what had impelled him to talk to cynthia in the way he had must remain a mystery  meanwhile the disquieting rumors continued to come in jabez miller on the north slope had told samuel todd who told ephraim williams that he was going to vote for fletcher moses hatch hitched up his team and went out to see jabez spent an hour in general conversation and then plumped the question taking as he said that means of finding out jabez hemmed and hawed said his farm was mortgaged spoke at some length about the american citizen however humble having a right to vote as he chose a most unusual line for jabez and the whole matter very mysterious and not a little ominous moses drove homeward that sparkling day shutting his eyes to the glare of the ice crystals on the pines and thinking profoundly he made other excursions enough to satisfy himself that this disease so new and unheard of the right of the unfit to hold office actually existed where the germ began that caused it moses knew no better than the deacon since those who were suspected of leanings toward fletcher bartlett were strangely secretive the practical result of moses profound thought was a meeting in his own house without respect to party democrats and whigs alike opened by a prayer from the minister himself the meeting after a futile session broke up dismally sedition and conspiracy existed a chief offender and master mind there was somewhere but who was he  good mr ware went home troubled in spirit shaking his head he had a cold and was not so strong as he used to be and should not have gone to the meeting at all at supper cynthia listened with her eyes on her plate while he told her of the affair  somebodys behind this cynthia he said its the most astonishing thing in my experience that we cannot discover who has incited them all the unattached people in the town seem to have been organized mr ware was wont to speak with moderation even at his own table he said unattachednot ungodly  cynthia kept her eyes on her plate but she felt as though her body were afire little did the minister imagine as he went off to write his sermon that his daughter might have given him the clew to the mystery yes cynthia guessed and she could not read that evening because of the tumult of her thoughts what was her duty in the matter to tell her father her suspicions they were only suspicions after all and she could make no accusations and jethro although she condemned him there was something in the situation that appealed to a most reprehensible sense of humor cynthia caught herself smiling once or twice and knew that it was wicked she excused jethro and told herself that with his lack of training he could know no better then an idea came to her and the very boldness of it made her grow hot again she would appeal to him tell him that that power he had over other men could be put to better and finer uses she would appeal to him and he would abandon the matter that the man loved her with the whole of his rude strength she was sure and that knowledge had been the only salve to her shame  so far we have only suspicions ourselves and strange to relate if we go around coniston with jethro behind his little red morgan we shall come back with nothing butsuspicions they will amount to convictions yet we cannot prove them the reader very naturally demands some specific informationhow did jethro do it i confess that i can only indicate in a very general way i can prove nothing nobody ever could prove anything against jethro bass bring the following evidence before any grand jury in the country and see if they dont throw it out of court  jethro in the course of his weekly round of strictly business visits throughout the town drives into samuel todds farmyard and hitches on the sunny side of the red barns the town of coniston it must be explained for the benefit of those who do not understand the word town in the new england senses was a tract of country about ten miles by ten the most thickly settled portion of which was the village of coniston consisting of twelve houses jethro drives into the barnyard and samuel todd comes out he is a little man and has a habit of rubbing the sharp ridge of his nose  how be you jethro says samuel killed the brindle thursday finest hide you ever seed  ggoin to town meetin tuesdayggoin to town meetin tuesdaysaml says jethro  i was callatin to jethro  democrathaint yedemocrat  callate to be  how much store do ye set by that hide  samuel rubs his nose then he names a price that the hide might fetch under favorable circumstances in bostonjethro does not wince  who dye callate to vote for saml  samuel rubs his nose  heerd they was agoin to put up fletcher and amos cuthbert an sam price for moderator what a convenient word is they when used politically haint made up my mind clear says samuel  ccomin by the tannery after town

samuel into court but you cant even moses hatch can get nothing out of samuel who then talks jacksonian principles and the nights of an american citizen  let us pursue this matter a little farther and form a committee of investigation where did mr todd learn anything about jacksonian principles from mr samuel price whom they have spoken of for moderator and where did mr price learn of these principles any one in coniston will tell you that mr price makes a specialty of orators and oratory and will hold forth at the drop of a hat in jonah winchs store or anywhere else who is mr price he is a tall sallow young man of eight and twenty with a wedgeshaped face a bachelor and a methodist who farms in a small way on the southern slope and saves his money he has become almost insupportable since they have named him for moderator  get mr sam price into court here is a man who assuredly knows who they are if we are not much mistaken he is their mouthpiece get an eel into court there is only one man in town who can hold an eel and he isnt on the jury mr price will talk plentifully in his nasal way but he wont tell you anything  mr price has been nominated to fill deacon lysander richardsons shoes in the following manner one day in the late autumn a man in a coonskin cap stops beside mr prices woodpile where mr price has been chopping wood pausing occasionally to stare off through the purple haze at the south shoulder of coniston mountain  how be you jethro says mr price nasally  ddemocrats are talkin some of namin you moderator next meetin says the man in the coonskin cap  want to know ejaculates mr price dropping the axe and straightening up in amazement for mr prices ambition soared no higher and he had made no secret of it wal whard you hear that jethro  hheerd it roundsome ddemocrathaint youdemocrat  always callate to be  jjacksonian democrat  guess i be  silence for a while that mr price may feel the gavel in his hand which he does  know somewhat about jacksonian principles dont yeknow somewhat  callate to says mr price proudly  ttalk em up samttalk em up ccanvass sam  with these words of brotherly advice mr bass went off down the road and mr price chopped no more wood that night but repeated to himself many times in his nasal voice i want to know in the course of the next few weeks various gentlemen mentioned to mr price that he had been spoken of for moderator and he became acquainted with the names of the other candidates on the same mysterious ticket who were mentioned whereupon he girded up his loins and went forth and preached the word of jacksonian democracy in all the farmhouses roundabout with such effect that samuel todd and others were able to talk with some fluency about the rights of american citizens  question before the committee undisposed of who nominated samuel price for moderator samuel price gives the evidence tells the court he does not know and is duly cautioned and excused  let us call next mr eben williams if we can moses hatch senior has already interrogated him with all the authority of the law and the church for mr williams is orthodox though the deacons have to remind him of his duty once in a while eben is timid and replies to us as to moses that he has heard of the democratic ticket and callates that fletcher bartlett who has always been the leader of the democratic party has named the ticket he did not mention jethro bass to deacon hatch why should he what has jethro bass got to do with politics  eben lives on a southern spur next to amos cuthbert where you can look off for forty miles across the billowy mountains of the west from no spot in coniston town is the sunset so fine on distant farewell mountain and ebens sheep feed on pastures where only mountainbred sheep can cling and thrive coniston be it known at this time is one of the famous wool towns of new england before the industry went west with other industries but eben williamss sheep do not wholly belong to him they are mortgagedand ebens farm is mortgaged  jethro basseben testifies to usis in the habit of visiting him once a month perhaps when he goes to amos cuthberts just friendly calls is it not a fact that jethro bass holds his mortgage yes for eight hundred dollars how long has he held that mortgage about a year and a half has the interest been paid promptly well the fact is that eben hasnt paid any interest yet  now let us take the concrete incident before that hypocritical thaw early in february jethro called upon amos cuthbertnot so surly then as he has since becomeand talked about buying his wool when it should be duly cut and permitted amos to talk about the position of second selectman for which some person or persons unknown to the jury had nominated him on his way down to the four corners jethro had merely pulled up his sleigh before eben williamss house which stood behind a huge snow bank and practically on the road eben appeared at the door a little dishevelled in hair and beard for he had been sleeping  how be you jethro he said nervously jethro nodded  weather looks a mite soft  no answer  about that interest said eben plunging into the dread subject dont know as im ready this month after all  ggoin to town meetin eben  wahnt callatin to answered eben  ggoin to town meetin eben  eben puzzled and dismayed ran his hand through his hair  wahnt callatin tobut i kini kin  ddemocrathaint yeddemocrat  i kin be said eben then he looked at jethro and added in a startled voice dont know but what i beyes i guess i be  hheerd the ticket  yes eben had heard the ticket what man had not some one has been most industrious and most disinterested in distributing that ticket  haint a mite of hurry about the interest right nowright now said jethro mmay be along the third week in marchmay beccan t tell  and jethro clucked to his horse and drove away eben williams went back into his house and sat down with his head in his hands in about two hours when his wife called him to fetch water he set down the pail on the snow and stared across the next ridge at the eastern horizon whitening after the sunset  the third week in march was the week after town meeting  mmay beccant tell repeated eben to himself unconsciously imitating jethros stutter godfrey ill hev to git that ticket straight from amos  yes we may have our suspicions but how can we get a bill on this evidence there are some thirty other individuals in coniston whose mortgages jethro holds from a horse to a house and farm it is not likely that they will tell beacon hatch or us that they are going to town meeting and vote for that fatherless ticket because jethro bass wishes them to do so and jethro has never said that he wishes them to if so where are your witnesses have we not come back to our startingpoint even as moses hatch drove around in a circle and we have the advantage over moses for we suspect somebody and he did not know whom to suspect certainly not jethro bass the man that lived under his nose and never said anythingand had no right to jethro bass had never taken any active part in politics though some folks had heard in his rounds on business that he had discussed them and had spread the news of the infamous ticket without a parent so much was spoken of at the meeting over which priest ware prayed it was even declared that being a democrat jethro might have influenced some of those under obligations to him sam price was at last fixed upon as the malefactor though people agreed that they had not given him credit for so much sense and jacksonian principles became as much abhorred by the orthodox as the spotted fever  we can call a host of other witnesses if we like among them cranky happygolucky fletcher bartlett who has led forlorn hopes in former years court proceedings make tiresome reading and if those who have been over ours have not arrived at some notion of the simple and innocent method of the new era of politics note dawningthey never will nothing proved but here is part of the ticket which nobody started       for       senior selectman fletcher bartlett       farm and buildings on thousand acre hill mortgaged to jethro      bass       second selectman amos cuthbert       farm and buildings on towns end ridge mortgaged to jethro      bass       third selectman chester perkins       sop of some kind to the established church party horse and      cow mortgaged to jethro bass though his father the tithingman doesnt know it       moderator samuel price       natural ambitiondove of oratory and jacksonian principles       etc etc  the notes are mine not mosess strange that they didnt occur to moses what a wealthy man has our hero become at thirtyone jethro bass was rich beyond the dreams of avaricefor coniston truth compels me to admit that the sum total of all his mortgages did not amount to nine thousand dollars but that was a large sum of money for coniston in those days and even now nathan bass had been a saving man and had left to his son onehalf of this fortune if thrift and the ability to gain wealth be qualities for a hero jethro had themin those days  the sunday before march meeting it blew bitter cold and priest ware preaching in mittens denounced sedition in general underneath him on the first landing of the high pulpit the deacons sat with knitted brows and the keynote from isaiah prescotts pitch pipe sounded like mournful echo of the mournful wind without  monday was ushered in with that sleet storm to which the almanacs still refer and another scarcely less important event occurred that day which we shall have to pass by for the present on tuesday the sleet still raging came the historic town meeting deacon moses hatch his chores done and his breakfast and prayers completed fought his way with his head down through a white waste to the meetinghouse door and unlocked it and shivered as he made the fire it was certainly not good election weather thought moses and others of the orthodox persuasion high in office were of the same opinion as they stood with parted coat tails before the stove whoever had stirred up and organized the hordes whoever was the author of that ticket of the discontented had not counted upon the sleet heavensent sleet said deacon ira perkins and would not speak to his son chester who sat down just then in one of the rear slips chester had become an agitator a jacksonian democrat and an outcast to be prayed for but not spoken to  we shall leave them their peace of mind for half an hour more those stanch old deacons and selectmen who did their duty by their fellowcitizens as they saw it and took no mans bidding they could not see the trackless roads over the hills now becoming tracked and the bent figures driving doggedly against the storm each impelled by a motive each motive strengthened by a master mind until it had become imperative some like eben williams behind his rickety horse came through fear others through ambition others were actuated by both and still others were stung by the pain of the sleet to a still greater jealousy and envy and the remembrance of those who had been in power i must not omit the conscientious jacksonians who were misguided enough to believe in such a ticket  the sheds were not large enough to hold the teams that day jethros barn and tannery were full and many other barns in the village and now the peace of mind of the orthodox is a thing of the past deacon lysander richardson the moderator sits aghast in his high place as they come trooping in men who have not been to town meeting for ten years deacon lysander with his white band of whiskers that goes around his neck like a sixteenthcentury ruff under his chin will soon be a memory now enters one if deacon lysander had known it symbolic of the new era one who though his large head is bent towers over most of the men who make way for him in the aisle nodding but not speaking and takes his place in the chair under the platform on the right of the meetingpause under one of the high threepart windows that chair was always his in future years and there he sat afterward silent apparently taking no part but not a man dropped a ballot into the box whom jethro bass did not see and mark  and now when the meetinghouse is crowded as it has never been before when jonah winch has arranged his dinner booth in the corner deacon lysander raps for order and the minister prays they proceed first to elect a representative to the general court the jacksonians do not contest that seatthis yearand isaiah prescott fourteenth child of timothy the stark hero father of a young ephraim whom we shall hear from later is elected and now now for a sensation now for disorder and misrule  gentlemen says deacon lysander you will prepare your ballots for the choice of the first selectman  the whigs have theirs written out deacon moses hatch but who has written out these others that are being so assiduously passed around sam price perhaps for he is passing them most assiduously and what name is written on them fletcher bartlett of course that was on the ticket somebody is tricked again that is not the name on the ticket look over sara prices shoulder and you will see the namejethro bass  it bursts from the lips of fletcher bartlett himselfof fletcher inflammable as gunpowder  gentlemen i withdraw as your candidate and nominate a better and an abler manjethro bass  jethro bass for chairman of the selectmen  the cry is taken up all over the meetinghouse and rises high above the hiss of the sleet on the great windows somebodys got on the stove to add to the confusion and horror the only man in the whole place who is not excited is jethro bass himself who sits in his chair regardless of those pressing around him many years afterward he confessed to some one that he was surprisedand this is true fletcher bartlett had surprised and tricked him but was forgiven forty men are howling at the moderator who is pounding on the table with a blacksmiths blows squire asa northcutt with his arms fanning like a windmill from the edge of the platform at length shouts down everybody elsedown to a hum some listen to him hear the words infamous outrageif jethro bass is elected selectman coniston will never be able to hold up her head among her sister towns for very shame momentary blank for somebody has got on the stove again a scuffle going on there i see it all now says the squiremarvel of perspicacity jethro bass has debased and debauched this town blank again and the squire points a finger of rage and scorn at the unmoved offender in the chair he has bought and intimidated men to do his bidding he has sinned against heaven and against the spirit of that most immortal of documents blank again most unfortunate blank for this is becoming oratory but somebody from below has seized the squire by the leg squire northcutt is too dignified and elderly a person to descend to rough and tumble but he did get his leg liberated and kicked fletcher bartlett in the face oh coniston that such scenes should take place in your town meeting by this time another is orating mr sam price jackson democrat there was no shorthand reporter in coniston in those days and it is just as well perhaps that the accusations and recriminations should sink into oblivion  at last by mighty efforts of the peace loving in both parties something like order is restored the ballots are in the box and deacon lysander is counting them not like another moderator i have heard of who spilled the votes on the floor until his own man was elected no had they registered his own death sentence the deacon would have counted them straight and needed no town clerk to verify his figures but when he came to pronounce the vote shame and sorrow and mortification overcame him coniston his native town which he had served and revered was dishonored and it was for him lysander richardson to proclaim her disgrace the deacon choked and tears of bitterness stood in his eyes and there came a silence only broken by the surging of the sleet as he rapped on the table  seventyfive votes have been cast for jethro basssixtythree for moses hatch necessary for a choice seventyand jethro bass is elected senior selectman  the deacon sat down and men say that a great sob shook him while jacksonian democracy went wildnot looking into future years to see what they were going wild about jethro bass chairman of the board of selectmen in the honored place of deacon moses hatch bourbon royalists never looked with greater abhorrence on the corsican adventurer and usurper of the throne than did the orthodox in coniston on this tanner who had earned no right to aspire to any distinction and who by his wiles had acquired the highest office in the town government fletcher bartlett in as a leader of the irresponsible opposition would have been calamity enough but jethro bass  this man whom they had despised was the master mind who had organized and marshalled the loose vote was the author of that ticket who sat in his corner unmoved alike by the congratulations of his friends and the maledictions of his enemies who rose to take his oath of office as unconcerned as though the house were empty albeit deacon lysander could scarcely get the words out and then jethro sat down again in his chairnot to leave it for six and thirty years from this time forth that chair became a seat of power and of dominion over a state  thus it was that jock hallowells prophecy so lightly uttered came to pass  how the remainder of that jacksonian ticket was elected down to the very hogreeves and amid what turmoil of the democracy and bitterness of spirit of the orthodox i need not recount there is no moral to the story alasit was one of those things which inscrutable heaven permitted to be done after that dark townmeeting day some of those stern old fathers became broken men and it is said in coniston that this calamity to righteous government and not the storm gave to priest ware his deathstroke     chapter vi  and now we must go back for a chaptera very short chapterto the day before that town meeting which had so momentous an influence upon the history of coniston and of the state that monday too it will be remembered dawned in storm the sleet hissing in the wide throats of the centrechimneys and bearing down great boughs of trees until they broke in agony dusk came early and howling darkness that hid a muffled figure on the icebound road staring at the yellow cracks in the tannery door presently the figure crossed the yard the door flying open released a shaft of light that shot across the white ground revealed a face beneath a hood to him who stood within  jethro  she darted swiftly past him seizing the door and drawing it closed after her a lantern hung on the central post and flung its rays upon his face her own mercifully was in the shadow and burning now with a shame that was insupportable now that she was there beside him her strength failed her and her couragecourage that she had been storing for this dread undertaking throughout the whole of that dreadful day now that she was there she would have given her life to have been able to retrace her steps to lose herself in the wild dark places of the mountain  cynthy his voice betrayed the passion which her presence had quickened  the words she would have spoken would not come she could think of nothing but that she was alone with him and in bodily terror of him she turned to the door again to grasp the wooden latch but he barred the way and she fell back  let me go she cried i did not mean to come do you hearlet me go  to her amazement he stepped asidea most unaccountable action for him more unaccountable still she did not move now that she was free but stood poised for flight held by she knew not what  ggo if youve a mind to cynthyif youve a mind to  ive come to say something to you she faltered it was not at all the way she had pictured herself as saying it  hhavent took moseshave you  oh she cried do you think i came here to speak of such a thing as that  hhavent tookmoses have you  she was trembling and yet she could almost have smiled at this wellremembered trick of pertinacity  no she said and immediately hated herself for answering him  hhavent took that worthington cuss  he was jealous  i didnt come to discuss mr worthington she replied  folks say its only a matter of time said he made up your mind to take him cynthy mmade up your mind  youve no right to talk to me in this way she said and added the words seeming to slip of themselves from her lips why do you do it  because iminterested he said  you havent shown it she flashed back forgetting the place and the storm and her errand even forgetting that jake wheeler or any one in coniston might come and surprise her there  he took a step toward her and she retreated the light struck her face and he bent over her as though searching it for a sign the cape on her shoulders rose and fell as she breathed  twahnt charity cynthywas it twahnt charity  it was you who called it such she answered in a low voice  a sleetcharged gust hurled itself against the door and the lantern flickered  wahnt it charity  it was friendship jethro you ought to have known that and you should not have brought back the book  friendship he repeated yyou said friendship  yes  mmeant friendship  yes said cynthia but more faintly and yet with a certain delicious fright as she glanced at him shyly surely there had never been a stranger man now he was apparently in a revery  gguess its because im not good enough to be anything more he remarked suddenly is that it  you have not tried even to be a friend she said  hhow about worthington he persisted just friends with him  i wont talk about mr worthington cried cynthia desperately and retreated toward the lantern again  jjust friends with worthington  why she asked her words barely heard above the gust why do you want to know  he came after her it was as if she had summoned some unseen uncontrollable power only to be appalled by it and the mountainstorm without seemed the symbol of it his very voice seemed to partake of its strength  cynthy he said if youd took him id have killed him cynthy i love youi want you to be my woman  your woman  he caught her struggling wildly terrorstricken in his arms beat down her hands flung back her hood and kissed her foreheadher hair blown by the windher lips in that moment she felt the mystery of heaven and hell of all kinds of power in that moment she was like a seed flying in the storm above the mountain spruces whither she knew not cared not there was one thought that drifted across the chaos like a blue light of the spirit could she control the storm could she say whither the winds might blow where the seed might be planted then she found herself listening struggling no longer for he held her powerless strangest of all most hopeful of all his own mind was working though his soul rocked with passion  cynthyever since we stopped that day on the road in northcutts woods ive thought of nothin but to marry yoummarry you then you give me that booki haint had much education but it come across me if you was to help me that wayand when i seed you with worthington i could have killed him easy as breakin bark  hush jethro  she struggled free and leaped away from him panting while he tore open his coat and drew forth something which gleamed in the lanterns raysa silver locket cynthia scarcely saw it her blood was throbbing in her temples she could not reason but she knew that the appeal for the sake of which she had stooped must be delivered now  jethro she said do you know why i came herewhy i came to you  no he said no wwanted me didnt you wanted mei wanted you cynthy  i would never have come to you for that she cried never  llove me cynthylove me dont you  how could he ask seeing that she had been in his arms and had not fled and yet she must go through with what she had come to do at any cost  jethro i have come to speak to you about the town meeting tomorrow  he halted as though he had been struck his hand tightening over the locket  ttown meetin  yes all this new organization is your doing she cried do you think that i am foolish enough to believe that fletcher bartlett or sam price planned this thing no jethro i know who has done it and i could have told them if they had asked me  he looked at her and the light of a new admiration was in his eye  knowed itdid you  yes she answered a little defiantly i did  hhowd you know ithowd you know it cynthy how did she know it indeed  i guessed it said cynthia desperately knowing you i guessed it  aalways thought you was smart cynthy  tell me did you do this thing  ththought you knowed itththought you knowed  i believe that these men are doing your bidding  haint you guessin a little mite too much cynthy  jethro she said you told me just now thatthat you loved me dont touch me she cried when he would have taken her in his arms again if you love me you will tell me why you have done such a thing  what instinct there was in the man which forbade him speaking out to her i know not i do believe that he would have confessed if he could isaac worthington had been impelled to reveal his plans and aspirations but jethro bass was as powerless in this supreme moment of his life as was coniston mountain to move the granite on which it stood cynthias heart sank and a note of passionate appeal came into her voice  oh jethro she cried this is not the way to use your power to compel men like eben williams and samuel todd andand lyman hull who is a drunkard and a vagabond to come in and vote for those who are not fit to hold office she was using the ministers own arguments we have always had clean men and honorable and good men  he did not speak but dropped his hands to his sides his thoughts were not to be fathomed yet cynthia took the movement for silent confessionwhich it was not and stood appalled at the very magnitude of his accomplishment astonished at the secrecy he had maintained she had heard that his name had been mentioned in the meeting at the house of moses hatch as having taken part in the matter and she guessed something of certain of his methods but she had felt his force and knew that this was not the only secret of his power  what might he not aspire to if properly guided no she did not believe him to be unscrupulousbut merely ignorant a man who was capable of such love as she felt was in him a man whom she could love could not mean to be unscrupulous defence of him leaped to her own lips  you did not know what you were doing she said i was sure of it or i would not have come to you oh jethro you must stop ityou must prevent this election  her eyes met his her own pleading and the very wind without seemed to pause for his answer but what she asked was impossible that wind which he himself had loosed which was to topple over institutions was rising and he could no more have stopped it then than he could have hushed the storm  you will not do what i asknow she said very slowly then her voice failed her she drew her hands together and it was as if her heart had ceased to beat sorrow and anger and fierce shame overwhelmed her and she turned from him in silence and went to the door  cynthy he cried hoarsely cynthy  you must never speak to me again she said and was gone into the storm  yes she had failed but she did not know that she had left something behind which he treasured as long as he lived  in the spring when the new leaves were green on the slopes of coniston priest ware ended a life of faithful service the high pulpit taken from the old meeting house and the cricket on which he used to stand and the bible from which he used to preach have remained objects of veneration in coniston to this day a fortnight later many tearful faces gazed after the truro coach as it galloped out of brampton in a cloud of dust and one there was watching unseen from the spruces on the hill who saw within it a girl dressed in black dryeyed staring from the window     chapter vii  out of the stump of a blasted tree in the coniston woods a flower will sometimes grow and even so the story which i have now to tell springs from the love of cynthia ware and jethro bass the flower when it came to bloom was fair in life and i hope that in these pages it will not lose too much of its beauty and sweetness  for a little while we are going to gallop through the years as before we have ambled through the days although the readers breath may be taken away in the process how cynthia ware went over the truro pass to boston and how she became a teacher in a high school therelargely through the kindness of that miss lucretia penniman of whom we have spoken who wrote in cynthias behalf to certain friends she had in that city how she met one william wetherell no longer a clerk in mr judsons jewellery shop but a newspaper man with i know not what ambitionsand limitations in strength of body and will how many many years afterward she nursed him tenderly through a sickness andmarried him is all told in a paragraph marry him she did to take care of him and told him so she made no secret of the maternal in this love  one evening the summer after their marriage they were walking in the mall under the great elms that border the common on the tremont street side they often used to wander there talking of the books he was to write when strength should come and a little leisure and sometimes their glances would linger longingly on colonnade row that bulfinch built across the way where dwelt the rich and powerful of the cityand yet he would not have exchanged their lot for his could he have earned with his own hands such a house and sit cynthia there in glory what happiness but i stray  they were walking in the twilight for the sun had sunk all red in the marshes of the charles when there chanced along a certain mr judson a jeweller taking the air likewise so there came into wetherells mind that amusing adventure with the country lad and the locket his name by reason of some strange quality in it he had never forgotten and suddenly he recalled that the place the countryman had come from was coniston  cynthia said her husband when mr judson was gone did you know any one in coniston named jethro bass  she did not answer him and thinking she had not heard he spoke again  why do you ask she said in a low tone without looking at him  he told her the story not until the end of it did the significance of the name engraved come to himcynthy  cynthy from jethro  why it might have been you he said jestingly was he an admirer of yours cynthia that strange uncouth countryman did he give you the locket  no she answered he never did  wetherell glanced at her in surprise and saw that her lip was quivering that tears were on her lashes she laid her hand on his arm  william she said drawing him to a bench come let us sit down and i will tell you the story of jethro bass we have been happy together you and i for i have found peace with you i have tried to be honest with you william and i will always be so i told you before we were married that i loved another man i have tried to forget him but as god is my judge i cannot i believe i shall love him until i die  they sat in the summer twilight until darkness fell and the lights gleamed through the leaves and a deep cool breath coming up from the sea stirred the leaves above their heads that she should have loved jethro seemed as strange to her as to him and yet wetherell was to feel the irresistible force of him hers was not a love that she chose or would have chosen but something elemental that cried out from the man to her and drew her something that had in it now as of yore much of pain and even terror but drew her strangest of all was that william wetherell understood and was not jealous of this thing which leads us to believe that some essence of virility was lacking in him some substance that makes the fighters and conquerors in this world in such mood he listened to the story of jethro bass  my dear husband said cynthia when she had finished her hand tightening over his i have never told you this for fear that it might trouble you as it has troubled me i have found in your love sanctuary and all that remains of myself i have given to you  you have found a weakling to protect and an invalid to nurse he answered to have your compassion cynthia is all i crave  so they lived through the happiest and swiftest years of his life working side by side sharing this strange secret between them and after that night cynthia talked to him often of coniston until he came to know the mountain that lay along the western sky and the sweet hillsides by coniston water under the blue haze of autumn aye and clothed in the colors of spring the bright blossoms of thorn and apple against the tender green of the woods and fields so he grew to love the simple people there but little did he foresee that he was to end his life among them  but so it came to pass she was taken from him who had been the one joy and inspiration of his weary days and he was driven wandering into unfrequented streets that he might not recall the places where she had once trod and through the wakeful nights her voice haunted himits laughter its sweet notes of seriousness little ways and manners of her look came to twist his heart and he prayed god to take him too until it seemed that cynthia frowned upon him for his weakness one mild sunday afternoon he took little cynthia by the hand and led her toddling out into the sunny common where he used to walk with her mother and the infant prattle seemed to bringat last a strange peace to his stormtossed soul  for many years these sunday walks in the common were wetherells greatest pleasure and solace and it seemed as though little cynthia had come into the world with an instinct as it were of her mission that lent to her infant words a sweet gravity and weight many people used to stop and speak to the child among them a great physician whom they grew to know he was there every sunday and at length it came to be a habit with him to sit down on the bench and take cynthia on his knee and his stern face would soften as he talked to her  one sunday when cynthia was eight years old he missed them and the next and at dusk he strode into their little lodging behind the hill and up to the bedside he glanced at wetherell patting cynthia on the head the while and bade her cheerily to go out of the room but she held tight hold of her fathers hand and looked up at the doctor bravely  i am taking care of my father she said  so you shall little woman he answered i would that we had such nurses as you at the hospital why didnt you send for me at once  i wanted to said cynthia  bless her good sense said the doctor she has more than you wetherell why didnt you take her advice if your father does not do as i tell him he will be a very sick man indeed he must go into the country and stay there  but i must live doctor said william wetherell  the doctor looked at cynthia  you will not live if you stay here he replied  then he will go said cynthia so quietly that he gave her another look strange and tender and comprehending he sat and talked of many things of the great war that was agonizing the nation of the strong man who harassed and suffering himself was striving to guide it likening lincoln unto a physician so the doctor was wont to take the minds of patients from themselves and before he left he gave poor wetherell a fortnight to decide  as he lay on his back in that room among the chimney tops trying vainly to solve the problem of how he was to earn his salt in the country a visitor was climbing the last steep flight of stairs that visitor was none other than sergeant ephraim prescott son of isaiah of the pitchpipe and own cousin of cynthia wares sergeant ephraim was just home from the war and still clad in blue and he walked with a slight limp by reason of a bullet he had got in the wilderness and he had such an honest genial face that little cynthia was on his knee in a moment  how be you will kind of poorly i callate so cynthys ben took he said sadly always thought a sight of cynthy little cynthy favors her some yes thought id drop in and see how you be on my way home  sergeant ephraim had much to say about the great war and about coniston true to the instincts of the blood of the stark hero he had left the plough and the furrow at the first call forty years of age though he was but it had been otherwise with many in coniston and brampton and harwich some of these when the drafting came had fled in bands to the mountain and defied capture mr dudley worthington now a mill owner had found a substitute heth sutton of clovelly had been drafted and had driven over the mountain to implore jethro bass abjectly to get him out of it in short many funny things had happenedfunny things to sergeant ephraim but not at all to william wetherell who sympathized with heth in his panic  so jethro bass has become a great man said wetherell  great ephraim ejaculated guess hes the biggest man in the state today queer how he got his power began twentyfour years ago when i wahnt but twenty i call that town meetin to mind as if twas yesterday never was such an upset jethros ben first selectman ever sense though he turned republican in 60 old folks dont fancy jethros kind of politics much but times change jethro saved my life i guess  saved your life exclaimed wetherell  got me a furlough said ephraim guess i would have died in the hospital if he hadnt got it so allfired quick and he druv down to brampton to fetch me back youd have thought i was general grant the way folks treated me  you went back to the war after your leg healed wetherell asked in wondering admiration of the mans courage  well said ephraim simply the other boys was gettin full of bullets and dysentery and it didnt seem just right the leg troubles me some on wet days but not to amount to much you haint thinkin of dyin yourself be ye william  william was thinking very seriously of it but it was cynthia who spoke and startled them both  the doctor says he will die if he doesnt go to the country  somethin like consumption william asked ephraim  so the doctor said  so i callated said ephraim come back to coniston with me there haint a healthier place in new england  how could i support myself in coniston wetherell asked  ephraim ruminated suddenly he stuck his hand into the bosom of his blue coat and his face lighted and even gushed as he drew out a crumpled letter  it dont take much gumption to run a store does it william guess you could run a store couldnt you  i would try anything said wetherell  well said ephraim theres the store at coniston with folks goin west and all that nobody seems to want it much he looked at the letter lem hallowell says there haint nobody to take it  jonah winchs exclaimed wetherell  jonah made it go but that was before all this hullabaloo about temperance cadets and what not jonah sold good rum but now you cant get nothin in coniston but hard cider and potato whiskey still its the place for somebody without much getup and he eyed his cousin by marriage better come and try it william  so much for dreams instead of a successor to irving and emerson william wetherell became a successor to jonah winch  that journey to coniston was full of wonder to cynthia and of wonder and sadness to wetherell for it was the way his other cynthia had come to boston from the state capital the railroad followed the same deep valley as the old coach road but ended at truro and then they took stage over truro pass for brampton where honest ephraim awaited them and their slender luggage with a team brampton with its wideshadowed green and terracesteepled church home once of the social library and lucretia penniman now famous home now of isaac dudley worthington whose great mills the stage driver had pointed out to them on coniston water as they entered the town  then came a drive through the cool evening to coniston ephraim showing them landmarks there was deacon lysanders house where little rias richardson lived now and on that slope and hidden in its forest nook among the birches and briers the little schoolhouse where cynthia had learned to spell here where the road made an aisle in the woods she had met jethro the choir of the birds was singing an evening anthem now as then to the lower notes of coniston water and the moist hothouse fragrance of the ferns rose from the deep places  at last they came suddenly upon the little hamlet of coniston itself there was the flagpole and the triangular green scene of many a muster jonah winchs store with its horse block and checkerpaned windows just as jonah had left it nathan basss tannery shed now weatherstained and neglected for jethro lived on thousand acre hill now the prescott house home of the stark hero where ephraim lived innocent of paint as one of conistons sons has put it innocent of paint as a coniston maidens face the white meetinghouse where priest ware had preachedand the parsonage cynthia and wetherell loitered in front of it while the blue shadow of the mountain deepened into night until mr satterlee the minister found them there and they went in and stood reverently in the little chamber on the right of the door which had been cynthias  long wetherell lay awake that night in his room at the gableend over the store listening to the rustling of the great oak beside the windows to the whippoorwills calling across coniston water but at last a peace descended upon him and he slept yes and awoke with the same sense of peace at little cynthias touch to go out into the cool morning when the mountain side was in myriad sheens of green under the rising sun behind the store was an oldfashioned garden set about by a neat stone wall hidden here and there by the masses of lilac and currant bushes and at the south of it was a great rosecovered boulder of granite and beyond through the foliage of the willows and the low apple trees which jonah winch had set out coniston water gleamed and tumbled under an arching elm near the house was the well stonerimmed with its long pole and crotch and bucket all green with the damp moss which clung to it  ephraim prescott had been right when he had declared that it did not take much gumption to keep store in coniston william wetherell merely assumed certain obligations at the brampton bank and lem hallowell jocks son who now drove the brampton stage brought the goods to the door little rias richardson was willing to come in and help move the barrels and on such occasions wore carpet slippers to save his shoes william still had time for his books in that coniston air he began to feel stronger and to wonder whether he might not be a washington irving yet and yet he had one worry and one fear and both of these concerned one manjethro bass him by her own confession cynthia ware had loved to her dying day hating herself for it and he william wetherell had married this woman whom jethro had loved so violently and must always loveso wetherell thought that was the worry how would jethro treat him that was the fear william wetherell was not the most courageous man in the world  jethro bass had not been in coniston since williams arrival no need to ask where he was jake wheeler jethros lieutenant in coniston gave william a glowing account of that throne room in the pelican hotel at the capital from whence jethro ruled the state during the sessions of the general court this legislature sat to him as a sort of advisory committee of three hundred and fifty an expensive advisory committee to the people relic of an obsolete form of government many stories of the now allpowerful jethro william heard from the little coterie which made their headquarters in his storestories of how those methods of which we have read were gradually spread over other towns and other counties not that jethro held mortgages in these towns and counties but the local lieutenants did and bowed to him as an overlord there were funny stories and grim stories of vengeance which william wetherell heard and trembled at might not jethro wish to take vengeance upon him  one story he did not hear because no one in coniston knew it no one knew that cynthia ware and jethro bass had ever loved each other  at last toward the end of june it was noised about that the great man was coming home for a few days one beautiful afternoon william wetherell stood on the platform of the store looking off at coniston talking to moses hatchyoung moses who is father of six children now and has forgotten cynthia ware old moses sleeps on the hillside let us hope in the peace of the orthodox and the righteous a cloud of dust arose above the road to the southward and out of it came a country wagon drawn by a fat horse and in the wagon the strangest couple wetherell had ever seen the little woman who sat retiringly at one end of the seat was all in brilliant colors from bonnet to flounce like a paroquet red and green predominating the man big in build largeheaded wore an oldfashioned blue swallowtailed coat with brass buttons a stock and coonskin hat though it was summer and the thumping of william wetherells heart told him that this was jethro bass he nodded briefly at moses hatch who greeted him with genial obsequiousness  legislatur through shouted moses  the great man shook his head and drove on  has jethro bass ever been a member of the legislature asked the storekeeper for the sake of something to say  never would take any office but chairman of the selectmen answered moses who apparently bore no ill will for his fathers sake jethro kind of fathers the legislatur i guess though i dont take much stock in politics goes down sessions to see that they dont get too gumptious and kick off the swaddlin clothes  andwas that his wife wetherell asked hesitatingly  aunt listy they call her nobody ever knew how he come to marry her jethro went up to wisdom once in the centre of the state and come back with her funny place to bring a wife fromwisdom funnier place to bring listy from he loads her down with them ribbons and gewgawsall the shades of the rainbow says he wants her to be the bestdressed woman in the state callate she is added moses with conviction listys a fine woman but all she knows is enough to say yes jethro and no jethroguess thats all jethro wants in a wife but he certainly is good to her  and why has he come back before the legislatures over said wetherell  cuttin of his farms always comes back hayin time thats the way jethro spends the money he makes in politics and he haint no more of a farmer than moses looked at wetherell  than im a storekeeper said the latter smiling  than im a lawyer said moses politely  they were interrupted at this moment by the appearance of jake wheeler and sam price who came gaping out of the darkness of the store  was that jethro mose demanded jake guess well go along up and see if theres any orders  i suppose the humblest of gods critturs has their uses moses remarked contemplatively as he watched the retreating figures of sam and jake leastwise thats jethros philosophy when you come to know him youll notice how much those fellers walk like him never seed a man who had so many imitators some ofems took to talkie like him even to stutterin bijah bixby over to clovelly comes pretty nigh it too  moses loaded his sugar and beans into his wagon and drove off  an air of suppressed excitement seemed to pervade those who came that afternoon to the store to trade and talkmostly to talk after such purchases as they could remember were made they lingered on the barrels and on the stoop in the hope of seeing jethro whose habit it was apparently to come down and dispense such news as he thought fit for circulation that wetherell shared this excitement too he could not deny but for a different cause at last when the shadows of the big trees had crept across the green he came the customers flocking to the porch to greet him wetherell standing curiously behind them in the door heedless of the dust he strode down the road with the awkward gait that was all his own kicking up his heels behind and behind him heels kicking up likewise followed jake and sam jethro apparently oblivious of their presence a modest silence was maintained from the stoop broken at length by lem hallowell who men said was an exact reproduction of jock the meetinghouse builder lem alone was not abashed in the presence of greatness  how be you jethro he said heartily air the legislatur behavin themselves  bbout as common said jethro  surely nothing very profound in this remark but received as though it were solomons  be prepared for a change in jethro after the galloping years he is now fiftyseven but he might be any age he is still smoothshaven his skin is clear and his eye is bright for he lives largely on bread and milk and eschews stimulants but the lines in his face have deepened and his big features seem to have grown bigger  who be you thinkin of for next governor jethro queries rias richardson timidly  they say alvy hopkins of gosport is willin to pay for it said chester perkins sarcastically chester we fear is a born agitator fated to remain always in opposition he is still a democrat and jethro as is well known has extended the mortgage so as to include chesters farm  wouldnt give a red brook seedling for alvy ejaculated the nasal mr price  ddont like red brook seedlings sam ddont like em said jethro he had parted his blue coat tails and seated himself on the stoop his long legs hanging over it  never seed a man who had a good word to say for em said mr price with less conviction  done well on mine said jethro ddone well i was satisfied with my red brook seedlings  mr prices sallow face looked as if he would have contradicted another man  how was that jethro piped up jake wheeler voicing the general desire  jethro looked off into the blue space beyond the mountain line  ggot mine when they first come roundseed cost me considerable raised more than a hundred bushels llisty put some of em on the tabletthen gave some to my old hoss tom tom said haint i always been a good beast jethro haint i carried you faithful summer and winter for a good many years and now you give me red brook seedlings  here everybody laughed and stopped abruptly for jethro still looked contemplative  give some of em to the hogs wwouldnt touch em hhad over a hundred bushels on handnnew variety wwhats that fellers name down to ayer massachusetts deals in all kinds of seeds ellettthats it wrote to ellet said i had a hundred bushels of red brooks to sell as fine a lookin potato as i had in my cellar made up my mind to take what he offered if it was only five cents he wrote back a dollar a bushel ii was always satisfied with my red brook seedlings sam but i never raised any morennever raised any more  uproarious laughter greeted the end of this story and continued in fits as some humorous point recurred to one or the other of the listeners william wetherell perceived that the conversation for the moment at least was safely away from politics and in that dubious state where it was difficult to reopen this was perhaps what jethro wanted even jake wheeler was tonguetied and jethro appeared to be lost in reflection  at this instant a diversion occurreda trifling diversion so it seemed at the time around the corner of the store her cheeks flushed and her dark hair flying ran little cynthia her hands browned already by the coniston sun filled with wild strawberries  see what ive found daddy she cried see what ive found  jethro bass started and flung back his head like a man who has heard a voice from another world and then he looked at the child with a kind of stupefaction the cry died on cynthias lips and she stopped gazing up at him with wonder in her eyes  ffound strawberries said jethro at last  yes she answered she was very grave and serious now as was her manner in dealing with people  sshow em to me said jethro  cynthia went to him without embarrassment and put her hand on his knee not once had he taken his eyes from her face he put out his own hand with an awkward shy movement picked a strawberry from her fingers and thrust it in his mouth  mm said jethro gravely erwhats your name little galwhats your name  cynthia  there was a long pause  erercynthia he said at length cynthia  cynthia  erer cynthianot cynthy  cynthia she said again  he bent over her and lowered his voice  mmay i call you cynthycynthy he asked  yyes answered cynthia looking up to her father and then glancing shyly at jethro  his eyes were on the mountain and he seemed to have forgotten her until she reached out to him timidly another strawberry he seized her little hand instead and held it between his ownmuch to the astonishment of his friends  whose little gal be you he asked  dads  shes will wetherells daughter said lem hallowell hes took on the store will he added turning to wetherell let me make you acquainted with jethro bass  jethro rose slowly and towered above wetherell on the stoop there was an inscrutable look in his black eyes as of one who sees without being seen did he know who william wetherell was if so he gave no sign and took wetherells hand limply  wills kinder hipped on booklarnin lemuel continued kindly come here to keep store for his health guess you may have heerd jethro that will married cynthy ware you call cynthy to mind dont ye  jethro bass dropped wetherells hand but answered nothing     chapter viii  a week passed and jethro did not appear in the village report having it that he was cutting his farms on thousand acre hill when jethro was farmingso it was saidhe would not stop to talk politics even with the president of the united states were that dignitary to lean over his pasture fence and beckon to him on a sultry friday morning when william wetherell was seated at jonah winchs desk in the cool recesses of the store slowly and painfully going over certain troublesome accounts which seemed hopeless he was thrown into a panic by the sight of one staring at him from the far side of a counter history sometimes reverses itself  what can i do for youmr bass asked the storekeeper rather weakly  just stepped instepped in he answered wwheres cynthy  she was in the gardenshall i get her  no he said parting his coat tails and seating himself on the counter go on figurin dont mind me  the thing was manifestly impossible perhaps wetherell indicated as much by his answer  like storekeepin jethro asked presently perceiving that he did not continue his work  a man must live mr bass said wetherell i had to leave the city for my health i began life keeping store he added but i little thought i should end it so  given to booklarnin then wahnt you jethro remarked he did not smile but stared at the square of light that was the doorway judsons jewellery store wahnt it judsons  yes judsons wetherell answered as soon as he recovered from his amazement there was no telling from jethros manner whether he were enemy or friend whether he bore the storekeeper a grudge for having attained to a happiness that had not been his  haint made a great deal out of life hev you nnot a great deal jethro observed at last  wetherell flushed although jethro had merely stated a truth which had often occurred to the storekeeper himself  it isnt given to all of us to find rome in brick and leave it in marble he replied a little sadly  jethro bass looked at him quickly  erwhats that he demanded ffound rome in brick left it in marble fine thought he ruminated a little never writ anythingdid younever writ anything  nothing worth publishing answered poor william wetherell  jjust dreameddreamed and kept store ssomething to have dreamedehsomething to have dreamed  wetherell forgot his uneasiness in the unexpected turn the conversation had taken it seemed very strange to him that he was at last face to face again wish the man whom cynthia ware had never been able to drive from her heart would he mention her had he continued to love her in spite of the woman he had married and adorned wetherell asked himself these questions before he spoke  it is more to have accomplished he said  ssomething to have dreamed repeated jethro rising slowly from the counter he went toward the doorway that led into the garden and there he halted and stood listening  ccynthy he said ccynthy  wetherell dropped his pen at the sound of the name on jethros lips but it was little cynthia he was calling little cynthia in the garden the child came at his voice and stood looking up at him silently  hhow old be you cynthy  nine answered cynthia promptly  llike the country cynthylike the country better than the city  oh yes said cynthia  and country folks llike country folks better than city folks  i didnt know many city folks said cynthia i liked the old doctor who sent daddy up here ever so much and i liked mrs darwin  mis darwin  she kept the house we lived in she used to give me cookies said cynthia and bread to feed the pigeons  pigeons ffolks keep pigeons in the city  oh no said cynthia laughing at such an idea the pigeons came on the roof under our window and they used to fly right up on the windowsill and feed out of my hand they kept me company while daddy was away working on sundays we used to go into the common and feed them before daddy got sick the common was something like the country only not half as nice  ccouldnt pick flowers in the common and go barefootecouldnt go barefoot cynthy  oh no said cynthia laughing again at his sober face  ccouldnt dig up the common and plant flowerscould you  of course you couldnt  pplant em out there asked jethro  oh yes cried cynthia ill show you she hesitated a moment and then thrust her hand into his do you want to see  guess i do said he energetically and she led him into the garden pointing out with pride the rows of sweet peas and pansies which she had made herself impelled by a strange curiosity william wetherell went to the door and watched them there was a look on the face of jethro bass that was new to it as he listened to the child talk of the wondrous things around them that summers daythe flowers and the bees and the brook they must go down and stand on the brink of it and the songs of the vireo and the hermit thrush  haint lonely here cynthyhaint lonely here he said  not in the country said cynthia suddenly she lifted her eyes to his with a questioning look are you lonely sometimes  he did not answer at once  not with you cynthynot with you  by all of which it will be seen that the acquaintance was progressing they sat down for a while on the old millstone that formed the step and there discussed cynthias tastes she was too old for dolls jethro supposed yes cynthia was too old for dolls she did not say so but the only doll she had ever owned had become insipid when the delight of such a reality as taking care of a helpless father had been thrust upon her books suggested jethro books she had known from her earliest infancy they had been piled around that bedroom over the roof books and book lore and the command of the english tongue were william wetherells only legacies to his daughter and many an evening that spring she had read him to sleep from classic volumes of prose and poetry i hesitate to name for fear you will think her precocious they went across the green to cousin ephraim prescotts harness shop where jethro had tied his horse and it was settled that cynthia liked books  on the morning following this extraordinary conversation jethro bass and his wife departed for the state capital listy was bedecked in amazing greens and yellows and jethro drove looking neither to the right nor left his coat tails hanging down behind the seat the reins lying slack across the plump quarters of his horsethe same fat tom who by the way had so indignantly spurned the iced brook seedlings and jake wheeler went along to bring back the team from brampton to such base uses are political lieutenants sometimes put although fate would have told you it was an honor and he came back to the store that evening fairly bristling with political secrets which he could not be induced to impart  one evening a fortnight later while the lieutenant was holding forth in commendably general terms on the politics of the state to a speechless if not wholly admiring audience a bomb burst in their midst william wetherell did not know that it was a periodical bomb like those flung at regular intervals from the union mortars into vicksburg these bombs at any rate never failed to cause consternation and fright in coniston although they never did any harm one thing noticeable they were always fired in jethros absence and the bombardier was always chester perkins son of the most unbending and rigorous of tithingmen but chester resembled his father in no particular save that he too was a deacon and a pillar of the church deacon ira had been tall and gaunt and sunken and uncommunicative chester was stout and said to perspire even in winter apoplectic irascible talkative and still as has been said a democrat he drove up to the store this evening to the not inappropriate rumble of distant thunder and he stood up in his wagon in front of the gathering and shook his fist in jake wheelers face  this towns tired of puttin up with a king he cried yes kingi said it and i dont care who hears me its time to stop this oneman rule you kin go and tell him i said it jake wheeler if youve a mind to i guess theres plenty wholl do that  an uneasy silence followedthe silence which cries treason louder than any voice some shifted uneasily and spat and jake wheeler thrust his hands in his pockets and walked away as much as to say that it was treason even to listen to such talk lem hallowell seemed unperturbed  on the rampage agin chet he remarked  youd ought to know better lem cried the enraged chester haint the hull road by the four corners ready to drop into the brook what be you agoin to do about it  ill show you when i git to it answered lem quietly and show them he did  git to it shouted chester scornfully ill git to it ill tell you right now im a candidate for the chairman of the selectmen if town meetin is eight months away an sam price ill expect the democrats to git into line  with this ultimatum chester drove away as rapidly as he had come  i want to know said sam price an exclamation peculiarly suited to his voice but nevertheless sam might be counted on in each of these little rebellions he too had remained steadfast to jacksonian principles and he had never forgiven jethro about a little matter of a state office which he sam had failed to obtain  before he went to bed jake wheeler had written a letter which he sent off to the state capital by the stage the next morning in it he indicted no less than twenty of his fellowtownsmen for treason and he also thought it wise to send over to clovelly for bijah bixby a lieutenant in that section to come and look over the ground and ascertain by his wellknown methods how far the treason had eaten into the body politic such was jakes ordinary procedure when the bombs were fired for mr wheeler was nothing if not cautious  three mornings later a little after seven oclock when the storekeeper and his small daughter were preparing to go to brampton upon a very troublesome errand chester perkins appeared again it is always easy to stir up dissatisfaction among the neerdowells jethro had once done it himself and during the three days which had elapsed since chester had flung down the gauntlet there had been more or less of downright treason heard in the store william wetherell who had perplexities of his own had done his best to keep out of the discussions that had raged on his cracker boxes and barrels for his head was a jumble of figures which would not come right and now as he stood there in the freshness of the early summer morning waiting for lem hallowells stage poor wetherells heart was very heavy  will wetherell said chester you be a gentleman and a student haint you read history haint you  i have read some said william wetherell  i callate that a man of parts said chester such as you be will help us agin corruption and a dictator im acountin on you will wetherell youve got the store and you kin tell the boys the difference between right and wrong theyll listen to you because youre eddicated  i dont know anything about politics answered wetherell with an appealing glance at the silent groupgroup that was always there rias richardson who had donned the carpet slippers preparatory to tending store for the day shuffled inside deacon lysander his father would not have done so  you know somethin about history and the constitootion dont ye demanded chester truculently njethro bass dont hold your mortgage does he bank in brampton holds ithaint that so you haint afeard of jethro like the rest on em be you  i dont know what right you have to talk to me that way mr perkins said wetherell  what right jethro holds my mortgagethe hull town knows itand he kin close me out tomorrow if hes a mind to  see here chester perkins lem hallowell interposed as he drove up with the stage what kind of free principles be you preachin youd ought to know bettern coerce  what be you agoin to do about that four corners road chester cried to the stage driver  i give em till tomorrow night to fix it said lem git in will cynthys over to the harness shop with eph well stop as we go long  give em till tomorrow night chester shouted after them what you goin to do then  but lem did not answer this inquiry he stopped at the harness shop where ephraim came limping out and lifted cynthia to the seat beside her father and they joggled off to brampton the dew still lay in myriad drops on the red herdsgrass turning it to lavender in the morning sun and the heavy scent of the wet ferns hung in the forest lem whistled and joked with little cynthia and gave her the reins to drive and of last they came in sight of brampton street with its terracesteepled church and line of wagons hitched to the common rail for it was market day father and daughter walked up and down hand in hand under the great trees and then they went to the bank  it was a brick building on a corner opposite the common imposing for brampton and very imposing to wetherell it seemed like a tomb as he entered its door cynthia clutching his fingers and never but once in his life had he been so near to leaving all hope behind he waited patiently by the barred windows until the clerk who was counting bills chose to look up at him  want to draw money he demanded  the words seemed charged with irony william wetherell told him falteringly his name and business and he thought the man looked at him compassionately  youll have to see mr worthington he said he hasnt gone to the mills yet  dudley worthington exclaimed wetherell  the teller smiled  yes hes the president of this bank  he opened a door in the partition and leaving cynthia dangling her feet from a chair wetherell was ushered not without trepidation into the great mans office and found himself at last in the presence of mr isaac d worthington who used to wander up and down coniston water searching for a mill site  he sat behind a table covered with green leather on which papers were laid with elaborate neatness and he wore a doublebreasted skirted coat of black with braided lapels a dark purple blanket cravat with a large red cameo pin and mr worthingtons features harmonized perfectly with this costumethose of a successful ambitious man who followed custom and convention blindly cleanshaven save for reddish chops blue eyes of extreme keenness and thinupped mouth which had been tightening year by year as the output of the worthington minx increased  well sir he said sharply what can i do for you  i am william wetherell the storekeeper at coniston  not the wetherell who married cynthia ware  no mr worthington did not say that he did not know that cynthia ware was married or alive or dead andlet it be confessed at oncehe did not care  this is what he did say  wetherellwetherell oh yes youve come about that notethe mortgage on the store at coniston he stared at william wetherell drummed with his fingers on the table and smiled slightly i am happy to say that the brampton bank does not own this note any longer if we didmerely as a matter of business you understand he coughedwe should have had to foreclose  dont own the note exclaimed wetherell who does own it  we sold it a little while agosince you asked for the extensionto jethro bass  jethro bass wetherells feet seemed to give way under him and he sat down  mr bass is a little quixoticthat is a charitable way to put itquixotic he doesstrange things like this once in awhile  the storekeeper found no words to answer but sat mutely staring at him mr worthington coughed again  you appear to be an educated man havent i heard some story of your giving up other pursuits in boston to come up here for your health certainly i place you now i confess to a little interest in literature myselfin libraries  in spite of his stupefaction at the news he had just received wetherell thought of mr worthingtons beaver hat and of that gentlemans first interest in libraries for cynthia had told the story to her husband  it is perhaps an open secret continued mr worthington that in the near future i intend to establish a free library in brampton i feel it my duty to do all i can for the town where i have made my success and there is nothing which induces more to the popular welfare than a good library whereupon he shot at wetherell another of his keen looks i do not talk this way ordinarily to my customers mr wetherell he began but you interest me and i am going to tell you something in confidence i am sure it will not be betrayed  oh no said the bewildered storekeeper who was in no condition to listen to confidences  he went quietly to the door opened it looked out and closed it softly then he looked out of the window  have a care of this man bass he said in a lower voice he began many years ago by debauching the liberties of that little town of coniston and since then he has gradually debauched the whole state judges and all if i have a case to try he spoke now with more intensity and bitterness concerning my mills or my bank before i get through i find that rascal mixed up in it somewhere and unless i arrange matters with him i  he paused abruptly his eyes going out of the window pointing with a long finger at a grizzled man crossing the street with a yellow and red horse blanket thrown over his shoulders  that man judge baker holding court in this town now bass owns body and soul  and the horse blanket wetherell queried irresistibly  dudley worthington did not smile  take my advice mr wetherell and pay off that note somehow an odor of the stable pervaded the room and a great unkempt grizzled head and shoulders horse blanket and all were stuck into it  mornin dudley said the head busy  come right in judge answered mr worthington never too busy to see you the head disappeared  take my advice mr wetherell  and then the storekeeper went into the bank  for some moments he stood dazed by what he had heard the query ringing in his head why had jethro bass bought that note did he think that the storekeeper at coniston would be of use to him politically the words chester perkins had spoken that morning came back to wetherell as he stood in the door and how was he to meet jethro bass again with no money to pay even the interest on the note then suddenly he missed cynthia hurried out and spied her under the trees on the common so deep in conversation with a boy that she did not perceive him until he spoke to her the boy looked up smiling frankly at something cynthia had said to him he had honest humorous eyes and a browned freckled face and was perhaps two years older than cynthia  whats the matter said wetherell  cynthias face was flushed and she was plainly vexed about something  i gave her a whistle said the boy with a little laugh of vexation and now she says she wont take it because i owned up i made it for another girl  cynthia held it out to him not deigning to appeal her ease  you must take it back she said  but i want you to have it said the boy  it wouldnt be right for me to take it when you made it for somebody else  after all people with consciences are born not made but this was a finer distinction that the boy had ever met with in his experience  i didnt know you when i made the whistle he objected puzzled and downcast  that doesnt make any difference  i like you better than the other girl  you have no right to retorted the casuist youve known her longer  that doesnt make any difference said the boy there are lots of people i dont like i have always known this girl doesnt live in brampton anyway  where does she live demanded cynthiawhich was a step backward  at the state capital her names janet duncan there do you believe me now  william wetherell had heard of janet duncans father alexander duncan who had the reputation of being the richest man in the state and he began to wonder who the boy could be  i believe you said cynthia but as long as you made it for her its hers will you take it  no said he determinedly  very well answered cynthia she laid down the whistle beside him on the rail and went off a little distance and seated herself on a bench the boy laughed  i like that girl he remarked the rest of em take everything i give em and ask for more shes prettiern any of em too  what is your name wetherell asked him curiously forgetting his own troubles  bob worthington  are you the son of dudley worthington  everybody asks me that he said im tired of it when i grow up theyll have to stop it  but you should be proud of your father  i am proud of him everybodys proud of him bramptons proud of himhes proud of himself thats enough aint it he eyed wetherell somewhat defiantly then his glance wandered to cynthia and he walked over to her he threw himself down on the grass in front of her and lay looking up at her solemnly for a while she continued to stare inflexibly at the line of market wagons and then she burst into a laugh  thought you wouldnt hold out forever he remarked  its because youre so foolish said cynthia thats why i laughed then she grew sober again and held out her hand to him goodby  where are you going  i must go back to my father ii think he doesnt feel very well  next time ill make a whistle for you he called after her  and give it to somebody else said cynthia  she had hold of her fathers hand by that but he caught up with her very red in the face  you know that isnt true he cried angrily and taking his way across brampton street turned and stood staring after them until they were out of sight  do you like him daddy asked cynthia  william wetherell did not answer he had other things to think about  daddy  yes  does your trouble feel any better  some cynthia but you mustnt think about it  daddy why dont you ask uncle jethro to help you  at the name wetherell started as if he had had a shock  what put him into your head cynthia he asked sharply why do you call him uncle jethro  because he asked me to because he likes me and i like him  the whole thing was a riddle he could not solveone that was best left alone they had agreed to walk back the ten miles to coniston to save the money that dinner at the hotel would cost and so they started cynthia flitting hither and thither along the roadside picking the stately purple iris flowers in the marshy places while wetherell pondered     book 2     chapter ix  when william wetherell and cynthia had reached the last turn in the road in northcutts woods quarter of a mile from coniston they met the nasal mr samuel price driving silently in the other direction the word silently is used deliberately because to mr price appertained a certain ghostlike quality of flitting and to mr prices horse and wagon likewise he drew up for a brief moment when he saw wetherell  wouldnt hurry back if i was you will  why not  mr price leaned out of the wagon  bije has come over from clovelly to spy around a little mite  it was evident from mr prices manner that he regarded the storekeeper as a member of the reform party  what did he say daddy asked cynthia as wetherell stood staring after the flitting buggy in bewilderment  i havent the faintest idea cynthia answered her father and they walked on  dont you know who bije is  no said her father and i dont care  it was almost criminal ignorance for a man who lived in that part of the country not to know bijah bixby of clovelly who was paying a little social visit to coniston that day on his way home from the state capitaltending as it were jethros flock still wetherell must be excused because he was an impractical literary man with troubles of his own but how shall we chronicle bijahs rank and precedence in the jethro army in which there are neither shoulderstraps nor annual registers to designate him as the chamberlain of that hill rajah the honorable heth sutton would not be far out of the way the honorable heth whom we all know and whom we shall see presently is the man of substance and of broad acres in clovelly bijah merely owns certain mortgages in that town but he had created the honorable heth politically as surely as certain prime ministers we could name have created their sovereigns the honorable heth was bijahs creation and a grand creation he was as no one will doubt when they see him  bijahas he will not hesitate to tell youtook heth down in his pocket to the legislature and has more than once delivered him in certain blocks of five and ten and four and twenty for certain considerations the ancient song of sixpence applies to bijah but his pocket was generally full of proxies instead of rye and the honorable heth was frequently one of the four and twenty blackbirds in short bijah was the working bee and the honorable heth the ornamental drone  i do not know why i have dwelt so long on such a minor character as bijah except that the man fascinates me of all the lieutenants in the state his manners bore the closest resemblance to those of jethro bass when he walked behind jethro in the corridors of the pelican kicking up his heels behind he might have been taken for jethros shadow he was of a good height and size smoothshaven with little eyes that kindled and his mouth moved not at all when he spoke unlike jethro he used tobacco  when bijah had driven into coniston village and hitched his wagon to the rail he went direct to the store chester perkins and others were watching him with various emotions from the stoop and bijah took a seat in the midst of them characteristically engaging in conversation without the usual conventional forms of greeting as if he had been there all day  hhow much did you git for your wool chesterhhow much  guess you haint here to talk about wool bije said chester red with anger  kind of neglectin the farm lately i hear observed bijah  jethro bass sent you up to find out how much i was neglectin it retorted chester throwing all caution to the winds  thinkin of upsettin jethro be you thinkin of upsettin jethro remarked bije in a genial tone  folks in clovelly haint got nothin to do with it if i am said chester  leetle early for campaignin chester leetle early  we do our campaignin when were a mind to  bijah looked around  well thats funny i could have took oath i seed rias richardson here  there was a deep silence  and sam price continued bijah in pretended astonishment wahnt he settin on the edge of the stoop when i drove up  another silence broken only by the enraged breathing of chester who was unable to retort moses hatch laughed the discreet departure of these gentlemen certainly had its comical side  rias as indoostrious as ever mose inquired bijah  he has his busy times said mose grinning broadly  see youve got the boys with their backs up chester said bijah  some of us are sick of tyranny cried chester you kin tell that to jethro bass when you go back if hes got time to listen to you buyin and sellin out of railroads  hear jethros got the grand gulf road in his pocket to do as hes a mind to with said moses with a view to drawing bijah out but the remark had exactly the opposite effect bijah screwing up his face into an expression of extraordinary secrecy and cunning  how much did you git out of it bije demanded chester  haint looked through my clothes yet said bijah his face screwed up tighter than ever nnever look through my clothes till i git home chester it haint safe  it has become painfully evident that mr bixby is that rare type of man who can sit down under the enemys ramparts and smoke him out it was a rule of jethros code either to make an effective departure or else to remain and compel the other man to make an ineffective departure lem hallowell might have coped with him but the stage was late and after some scratching of heads and delving for effectual banter through which mr bixby sat genial and unconcerned chesters followers took their leave each choosing his own pretext  in the meantime william wetherell had entered the store by the back doorunperceived as he hoped he had a vehement desire to be left in peace and to avoid politics and political discussions forevervain desire for the storekeeper of coniston mr wetherell entered the store and to take his mind from his troubles he picked up a copy of byron gradually the conversation on the stoop died away and just as he was beginning to congratulate himself and enjoy the book he had an unpleasant sensation of some one approaching him measuredly wetherell did not move indeed he felt that he could nothe was as though charmed to the spot he could have cried aloud but the store was empty and there was no one to hear him mr bixby did not speak until he was within a foot of his victims ear his voice was very nasal too  wetherell haint it  the victim nodded helplessly  want to see you a minute  what is it  where can we talk private asked mr bixby looking around  theres no one here wetherell answered what do you wish to say  if the boys was to see me speakin to you they might git suspiciousyou understand he confided his manner conveying a hint that they shared some common policy  i dont meddle with politics said wetherell desperately  exactly answered bijah coming even closer i knowed you was a levelheaded man moment i set eyes on you made up my mind id have a little talk in private with youyou understand the boys haint got no reason to suspicion you care anything about politics have they  none whatever  you dont pay no attention to what they say  none  you hear it  sometimes i cant help it  exactly you hear it  i told you i couldnt help it  want you should vote right when the time comes said bijah ddont want to see such an intelligent man go wrong an be sorry for ityou understand chester perkins is harebrained jethro bass runs things in this state  mr bixby  you understand said bijah screwing up his face guess your watch is acomin out he tucked it back caressingly and started for the doorthe back door involuntarily wetherell put his hand to his pocket felt something crackle under it and drew the something out to his amazement it was a tendollar bill  here he cried so sharply in his fright that mr bixby turned around wetherell ran after him take this back  guess you got me said bijah wwhat is it  this money is yours cried wetherell so loudly that bijah started and glanced at the front of the store  guess you made some mistake he said staring at the storekeeper with such amazing innocence that he began to doubt his senses and clutched the bill to see if it was real  but i had no money in my pocket said wetherell perplexedly and then gaining indignation take this to the man who sent you and give it back to him  but bijah merely whispered caressingly in his ear nobody sent meyou understandnobody sent me and was gone wetherell stood for a moment dazed by the mans audacity and then hurrying to the front stoop the money still in his hand he perceived mr bixby in the sunlit road walking jethrofashion toward ephraim prescotts harness shop  why daddy said cynthia coming in from the garden where did you get all that money your troubles must feel better  it is not mine said wetherell starting and then quivering with anger and mortification he sank down on the stoop to debate what he should do  is it somebody elses asked the child presently  yes  then why dont you give it back to them daddy  how was wetherell to know in his fright that mr bixby had for once indulged in an overabundance of zeal in jethros behalf he went to the door laughter came to him across the green from the harness shop and his eye following the sound fastened on bijah seated comfortably in the midst of the group there bitterly the storekeeper comprehended that had he possessed courage he would have marched straight after mr bixby and confronted him before them all with the charge of bribery the blood throbbed in his temples and yet he sat there trembling despising himself repeating that he might have had the courage if jethro bass had not bought the mortgage the fear of the man had entered the storekeepers soul  does it belong to that man over there asked cynthia  yes  ill take it to him daddy and she held out her hand  not now wetherell answered nervously glancing at the group he went into the store addressed an envelope to mr bijah bixby of clovelly and gave it to cynthia when he comes back for his wagon hand it to him he said feeling that he would rather at that moment face the devil himself than mr bixby  half an hour later cynthia gave mr bixby the envelope as he unhitched his horse and so deftly did bijah slip it into his pocket that he must certainly have misjudged its contents none of the loungers at ephraims remarked the transaction  if jethro had indeed instructed bijah to look after his flock at coniston it was an illconditioned move and some of the flock resented it when they were quite sure that bijah was climbing the notch road toward clovelly the discussion from which the storekeeper was providentially omitted was in full swing when the stage arrived and lem hallowells voice silenced the uproar it was lems boast that he never had been and never would be a politician  why dont you folks quit railin against jethro and do somethin he said bije turns up here and you all scatter like a flock of crows im tired of makin complaints about that brampton road and today the hull side of it give way and put me in the ditch sure as the sun rises tomorrow im goin to make trouble for jethro  what be you agoin to do lem  indict the town replied lem vigorously who is the town jethro haint he who has charge of the highways jethro bass chairman of the selectmen ive spoke to him time and agin about that piece and he haint done nothin tonight i go to harwich and git the court to appint an agent to repair that road and the townll hev to pay the bill  the boldness of lems intention for the moment took away their breaths and then the awestricken hush which followed his declaration was broken by the sound of chesters fist hammering on the counter  thats the sperrit he cried ill go along with you lem  no you wont said lem youll stay right whar you be  chester wants to git credit for the move suggested sam price slyly  its a lie sam price shouted chester what made you sneak off when bije bixby come  didnt sneak off retorted sam indignantly through his nose forgot them eggs i left to home  sam said lem with a wink at moses hatch you hitch up your hoss and fetch me over to harwich to git that indictment might git a chance to see that lady  wal now i wish i could lem but my hoss is stun lame  there was a roar of laughter during which sam tried to look unconcerned  mebbe riasll take me over said lem soberly you hitch up rias  hes gone said joe northcutt slid out the door when you was speakin to sam  haint none of you folks got spunk enough to carry me over to see the jedge demanded lem my horses aint fit to travel tonight another silence followed and lem laughed contemptuously but goodnaturedly and turned on his heel guess ill walk then he said  you kin have my white hoss lem said moses hatch  all right said lem ill come round and hitch up soons i git my supper  an hour later when cynthia and her father and millicent skinnerwho condescended to assist in the work and cooking of mr wetherells householdwere seated at supper in the little kitchen behind the store the head and shoulders of the stagedriver were thrust in at the window his face shining from its evening application of soap and water he was making eyes at cynthia  want to go to harwich will he asked  william set his cup down quickly  you haint afeard be you he continued most folks that hasnt went west or died is afeard of jethro bass  daddy isnt afraid of him and im not said cynthia  thats right cynthy said lem leaning over and giving a tug to the pigtail that hung down her back there haint nothin to be afeard of  i like him said cynthia hes very good to me  you stick to him cynthy said the stage driver  ready will  it may readily be surmised that mr wetherell did not particularly wish to make this excursion the avowed object of which was to get mr bass into trouble but he went and presently he found himself jogging along on the mountain road to harwich from the crest of towns end ridge they looked upon the western peaks tossing beneath a golden sky the spell of the evenings beauty seemed to have fallen on them both and for a long time lem spoke not a word and nodded smilingly but absently to the greetings that came from the farm doorways  will he said at last you acted sensible theres no mite of use of your gettin mixed up in politics youre too good for em  too good exclaimed the storekeeper  youre eddicated lem replied with a tactful attempt to cover up a deficiency youre a gentleman ef you do keep store  lemuel apparently thought that gentlemen and politics were contradictions he began to whistle while wetherell sat and wondered that any one could be so carefree on such a mission the day faded and went out and the lights of harwich twinkled in the valley wetherell was almost tempted to mention his trouble to this man as he had been to ephraim the fear that each might think he wished to borrow money held him back  jethros all right lem remarked but if he neglects the road hes got to stand for it sames any other i writ him twice to the capital and give him fair warning afore he went he knows i haint doin of it for politics ive often thought lem continued that ef some smart good woman could have got hold of him when he was young it would have made a big difference whats the matter  have you room enough  i guess ive got the hull seat said lem as i was sayin if some able woman had married jethro and made him look at things a little mite different he would have ben a big man he has all the earmarks why when he comes back to coniston them fellersll hunt their holes like rabbits mark my words  you dont think  dont think what  i understand he holds the mortgages of some of them said wetherell  shouldnt blame him a great deal ef he did git tired and sell chester out soon this thing happens regular as leap year  jethro bass doesnt seem to frighten you said the storekeeper  well said lem i haint afeard of him thats so for the life of me i cant help likin him though he does things that i wouldnt do for all the power in christendom heres jedge parkinsons house  wetherell remained in the wagon while lemuel went in to transact his business the judges house outlined in the starlight was a modest dwelling with a little porch and clambering vines set back in its own garden behind a picket fence presently from the direction of the lines of light in the shutters came the sound of voices lems deep and insistent and another pitched in a high nasal key deprecatory and protesting there was still another a harsh one that growled something unintelligible and wetherell guessed from the fragments which he heard that the judge before sitting down to his duty was trying to dissuade the stage driver from a step that was foolhardy he guessed likewise that lem was not to be dissuaded at length a silence followed then the door swung open and three figures came down the illuminated path  like to make you acquainted with jedge abner parkinson mr wetherell and jim irving jims the sheriff of truro county and i guess the jedge dont need any recommendation as a lawyer from me you wont mind stayin awhile with the jedge while jim and i go down town with the team youre both literary folks  wetherell followed the judge into the house he was sallow tall and spare and stooping cleanshaven with a hooked nose and bright eyesthe face of an able and adroit man and he wore the long black coat of the politicianlawyer the room was filled with books and from these judge parkinson immediately took his cue probably through a fear that wetherell might begin on the subject of lemuels errand however it instantly became plain that the judge was a true book lover and despite the fact that lems visit had disturbed him not a little he soon grew animated in a discussion on the merits of sir walter scott paced the room pitched his nasal voice higher and higher covered his table with volumes of that author to illustrate his meaning neither of them heard a knock and they both stared dumfounded at the man who filled the doorway  it was jethro bass  he entered the room with characteristic unconcern as if he had just left it on a trivial errand and without a how do you do or a good evening parted his coat tails and sat down in the judges armchair the judge dropped the volume of scott on the desk and as for wetherell he realized for once the full meaning of the biblical expression of a mans tongue cleaving to the roof of his mouth the gleam of one of jethros brass buttons caught his eye and held it fascinated  literary talk judge said jethro ddont mind mego on  thought you were at the capital said the judge reclaiming some of his selfpossession  good many folks thought so answered jethro ggood many folks  there was no conceivable answer to this so the judge sat down with an affectation of ease he was a man on whom dignity lay heavily and was not a little ruffled because wetherell had been a witness of his discomfiture he leaned back in his chair then leaned forward stretching his neck and clearing his throat a position in which he bore a ludicrous resemblance to a turkey gobbler  most through the legislature inquired the judge  bout as common said jethro  there was a long silence and forgetful for the moment of his own predicament wetherell found a fearful fascination in watching the contortions of the victim whose punishment was to precede his it had been one of the delights of louis xi to contemplate the movements of a certain churchman whom he had had put in a cage and some inkling of the pleasure to be derived from this pastime of tyrants dawned on wetherell perhaps the judge too thought of this as he looked at quentin durward on the table  i was just sayin to lem hallowell began the judge at last that i thought he was a little mite hasty  erindicted us judge said jethro  the judge and wetherell heard the question with different emotions mr parkinson did not seem astonished at the miracle which had put jethro in possession of this information but heaved a long sigh of relief as a man will when the worst has at length arrived  i had to jethrocouldnt help it i tried to get hallowell to wait till you come back and talk it over friendly but he wouldnt listen said the road was dangerous and that hed spoken about it too often he said he hadnt anything against you  didnt come in to complain said jethro didnt come in to complain road is out of repair wwhats the next move  im sorry jethroi swan im sorry he cleared his throat well he continued in his judicial manner the court has got to appoint an agent to repair that road the agent will present the bill and the town will have to pay the billwhatever it is its too bad jethro that you have allowed this to be done  you say youve got to appint an agent  yesim sorry  have you appinted one  no  ggot any candidates  the judge scratched his head  well i dont know as i have  well have you  no said the judge  aany legal objection to my bein appinted asked jethro  the judge looked at him and gasped but the look was an involuntary tribute of admiration  well he said hesitatingly i dont know as there is jethro no theres no legal objection to it  aany other kind of objection said jethro  the judge appeared to reflect  well no he said at last i dont know as there is  well is there said jethro again  no said the judge with the finality of a decision a smile seemed to be pulling at the corners of his mouth  well im a candidate said jethro  do you tell me jethro that you want me to appoint you agent to fix that road  iim a candidate  well said the judge rising ill do it  when said jethro sitting still  ill send the papers over to you within two or three days  oought to be done right away judge roads in bad shape  well ill send the papers over to you tomorrow  how longwould it take to make out that appintmenthow long  it wouldnt take but a little while  ill wait said jethro  do you want to take the appointment along with you tonight asked the judge in surprise  gguess thats about it  without a word the judge went over to his table and for a while the silence was broken only by the scratching of his pen  erinterested in roadswillinterested in roads  the judge stopped writing to listen since it was now the turn of the other victim  not particularly answered mr wetherell whose throat was dry  ccome over for the driveccome over for the drive  yes replied the storekeeper rather faintly  hhows cynthy said jethro  the storekeeper was too astonished to answer at that moment there was a heavy step in the doorway and lem hallowell entered the room he took one long look at jethro and bent over and slapped his hand on his knee and burst out laughing  so here you be he cried by godfrey ef you dont beat all outdoors jethro wal i got ahead of ye for once but you cant say i didnt warn ye come purty nigh bustin the stage on that road today and now im agoin to hev an agent appinted  wwhos the agent said jethro  well git one might appint will there only he dont seem to want to get mixed up in it  theres the agent cried the judge holding out the appointment to jethro  whwhat ejaculated lem  jethro took the appointment and put it in his cowhide wallet  be you the agent demanded the amazed stage driver  ccallate to be said jethro and without a smile or another word to any one he walked out into the night and after various exclamations of astonishment and admiration the stage driver followed  no one indeed could have enjoyed this unexpected coup of jethros more than lem himself and many times on their drive homeward he burst into loud and unexpected fits of laughter at the sublime conception of the chairman of the selectmen being himself appointed road agent  will said he dont you tell this to a soul well have some fun out of some of the boys tomorrow  the storekeeper promised but he had an unpleasant presentiment that he himself might be one of the boys in question  how do you suppose jethro bass knew you were going to indict the town he asked of the stage driver  lem burst into fresh peals of laughter but this was something which he did not attempt to answer     chapter x  it so happened that there was a certain spinster whom sam price had been trying to make up his mind to marry for ten years or more and it was that gentlemans habit to spend at least one day in the month in harwich for the purpose of paying his respects in spite of the fact that his horse had been stun lame the night before mr price was able to start for harwich via brampton very early the next morning he was driving along through northcutts woods with one leg hanging over the wheel humming through his nose what we may suppose to have been a loveditty and letting his imagination run riot about the lady in question when he nearly fell out of his wagon the cause of this was the sight of fat tom coming around a corner with jethro bass behind him lem hallowell and the storekeeper had kept their secret so well that sam if he was thinking about jethro at all believed him at that moment to be seated in the throne room at the pelican house in the capital  mr price however was one of an adaptable nature and by the time he had pulled up beside jethro he had recovered sufficiently to make a few remarks on farming subjects and finally to express a polite surprise at jethros return  but you come a little mite late haint you jethro he asked finally with all of the indifference he could assume  hhows that samhows that  its too badi swan it isbut lem hallowell rode over to harwich last night and indicted the town for that piece of road by the four corners took will wetherell along with him  ddont say so said jethro  i callate he done it responded sam pulling a long face the courtll hev to send an agent to do the job and i guess youll hev to foot the bill jethro  ccourtll hev to appint an agent  i callate  eryou a candidatesamyou a candidate  dont know but what i be answered the usually wary mr price  ggoin to harwichhaint you  mebbe i be and mebbe i haint said sam not able to repress a selfconscious snicker  mmight as well be you as anybody sam said jethro as he drove on  it was not strange that the idea thus planted should grow in mr prices favor as he proceeded he had been surprised at jethros complaisance and he wondered whether after all he had done well to help chester stir people up at this time when he reached harwich instead of presenting himself promptly at the spinsters house he went first to the office of judge parkinson as became a prudent man of affairs  perhaps there is no need to go into the details of mr prices discomfiture on the occasion of this interview the judge was by nature of a sour disposition but he hawhawed so loudly as he explained to mr price the identity of the road agent that the judge of probate in the next office thought his colleague had gone mad afterward mr price stood for some time in the entry where no one could see him scratching his head and repeating his favorite exclamation i want to know it has been ascertained that he omitted to pay his respects to the spinster on that day  cyamon johnson carried the story back to coniston where it had the effect of eliminating mr price from local politics for some time to come  that same morning chester perkins was seen by many driving wildly about from farm to farm supposedly haranguing his supporters to make a final stand against the tyrant but by noon it was observed by those naturalists who were watching him that his activity had ceased chester arrived at dinner time at joe northcutts whose land bordered on the piece of road which had caused so much trouble and joe and half a dozen others had been at work there all morning under the road agent whom judge parkinson had appointed now mrs northcutt was chesters sister a woman who in addition to other qualities possessed the only sense of humor in the family she ushered the unsuspecting chester into the kitchen and there seated beside joe and sipping a saucer of very hot coffee was jethro bass himself chester halted in the doorway his face brickred words utterly failing him while joe sat horrorstricken holding aloft on his fork a smoking potato jethro continued to sip his coffee  bbusy times chester he said bbusy times  chester choked where were the burning words of denunciation which came so easily to his tongue on other occasions it is difficult to denounce a man who insists upon drinking coffee  set right down chester said mrs northcutt behind him  chester sat down and to this day he cannot account for that action once seated habit asserted itself and he attacked the boiled dinner with a ferocity which should have been exercised against jethro  i suppose the stores down to the capital is finer than ever mr bass remarked mrs northcutt  soso mis northcutt soso  i was there ten years ago remarked mrs northcutt with a sigh of reminiscence and i never see such fine silks and bonnets in my life now ive often wanted to ask you did you buy that bonnet with the trembly jet things for mis bass  that bonnet come out full bettern i expected answered jethro modestly  you have got taste in wimmins fixins mr bass strange now i wouldnt let joe choose my things for worlds  so the dinner progressed joe with his eyes on his plate chester silent but bursting with anger and resentment until at last jethro pushed back his chair and said good day to mrs northcutt and walked out chester got up instantly and went after him and joe full of forebodings followed his brotherinlaw jethro was standing calmly on the grass plot whittling a toothpick chester stared at him a moment and then strode off toward the barn unhitched his horse and jumped in his wagon something prompted him to take another look at jethro who was still whittling  ccarry me down to the road chesterccarry me down to the road said jethro  joe northcutts knees gave way under him and he sat down on a sugar kettle chester tightened up his reins so suddenly that his horse reared while jethro calmly climbed into the seat beside him and they drove off it was some time before joe had recovered sufficiently to arise and repair to the scene of operations on the road  it was joe who brought the astounding news to the store that evening chester was jethros own candidate for senior selectman jethro himself had said so that he would be happy to abdicate in chesters favor and make it unanimouschester having been a candidate so many times and disappointed  whars chester said lem hallowell  joe pulled a long face  just come from his house and he haint done a lick of work sence noon time jest sets in a cornerwont talk wont eatjest sets thar  lem sat down on the counter and laughed until he was forced to brush the tears from his cheeks at the idea of chester perkins being jethros candidate where was reform now if chester were elected it would be in the eyes of the world as jethros man no wonder he sat in a corner and refused to eat  guess youll ketch it next will for goin over to harwich with lem joe remarked playfully to the storekeeper as he departed  these various occurrences certainly did not tend to allay the uneasiness of mr wetherell the next afternoon at a time when a slack trade was slackest he had taken his chair out under the apple tree and was sitting with that same volume of byron in his lapbut he was not reading the humorous aspects of the doings of mr bass did not particularly appeal to him now and he was in truth beginning to hate this man whom the fates had so persistently intruded into his life william wetherell was not it may have been gathered what may be called vindictive he was a sensitive conscientious person whose life should have been in the vale and yet at that moment he had a fierce desire to confront jethro bass andand destroy him yes he felt equal to that  shocks are not very beneficial to sensitive natures william wetherell looked up and there was jethro bass on the doorstep  ggreat resourcereadingreat resource he remarked  in this manner jethro snuffed out utterly that passion to destroy and another sensation took its placea sensation which made it very difficult for william wetherell to speak but he managed to reply that reading had been a great resource to him jethro had a parcel in his hand and he laid it down on the step beside him and he seemed for once in his life to be in a mood for conversation  its hard for me to read a book he observed i own to itits a little mite hard hhev to kind of spell it out in places haint had much time for readin but its kind of pleasant to larn what other folks has done in the world by pickin up a book ttakes your mind off thingsdont it  wetherell felt like saying that his reading had not been able to do that lately then he made the plunge and shuddered as he made it  mr bassii have been waiting to speak to you about that mortgage  eryes he answered without moving his head erabout the mortgage  mr worthington told me that you had bought it  yes i didyes i did  im afraid you will have to foreclose said wetherell i cannot reasonably ask you to defer the payments any longer  if i foreclose it what will you do he demanded abruptly  there was but one answerwetherell would have to go back to the city and face the consequences he had not the strength to earn his bread on a farm  if id a ben in any hurry for the moneygguess id a notified you said jethro  i think you had better foreclose mr bass wetherell answered i cant hold out any hopes to you that it will ever be possible for me to pay it off its only fair to tell you that  well he said with what seemed a suspicion of a smile i dont know but what thats about as honest an answer as i ever got  why did you do it wetherell cried suddenly goaded by another fear why did you buy that mortgage  but this did not shake his composure  hhave a little habit of collectin em he answered same as you do books gguess some of em haint as valuable  william wetherell was beginning to think that jethro knew something also of such refinements of cruelty as were practised by caligula he drew forth his cowhide wallet and produced from it a folded piece of newspaper which must wetherell felt sure contain the mortgage in question  theres one power i always wished i had he observed the power to make folks see some things as i see em i was acrost the water tonight on my hill farm when the sun set and the sky up thar above the mountain was all golden bars and the river all aflamin purple just as if it had been dyed by some of them greek gods youre readin about now if i could put them things on paper i wouldnt care a haycock to be president no sir  the storekeepers amazement as he listened to this speech may be imagined was this jethro bass if so here was a side of him the existence of which no one suspected wetherell forgot the matter in hand  why dont you put that on paper he exclaimed  jethro smiled and made a deprecating motion with his thumb  sometimes when i haint busy i drop into the state library at the capital and enjoy myself its like goin to another world without any folks to bother you erertheres books id like to talk to you aboutsometime  but i thought you told me you didnt read much mr bass  he made no direct reply but unfolded the newspaper in his hand and then wetherell saw that it was only a clipping  hhappened to run across this in a newspaperif this haint this county i wahnt born and raised here if it haint coniston mountain about seven oclock of a june evening i never saw coniston mountain erlisten to this  whereupon he read with a feeling which wetherell had not supposed he possessed an extract and as the storekeeper listened his blood began to run wildly at length jethro put down the paper without glancing at his companion  theres somethin about that that fetches you spinnin through the air he said slowly shshowed it to jim willard editor of the newcastle guardian erwhat do you think he said  i dont know said wetherell in a low voice  willard said bass wwish youd find me that man ill give him five dollars every week for a letter like thaterfive dollars a week  he paused folded up the paper again and put it in his pocket took out a card and handed it to wetherell          james g willard editor          newcastle guardian  thats his address said jethro erguess youll know what to do with it erfive dollars a weekfive dollars a week  how did you know i wrote this article said wetherell as the card trembled between his fingers  kknowed the place was coniston seen from the east knowed there wahnt any one is brampton or harwich could have done itgguessed the restguessed the rest  wetherell could only stare at him like a man who with the halter about his neck has been suddenly reprieved but jethro bass did not appear to be waiting for thanks he cleared his throat and had wetherell not been in such a condition himself he would actually have suspected him of embarrassment  erwetherell  yes  wwont say nothin about the mortgageppay it when you can  this roused the storekeeper to a burst of protest but he stemmed it  haint got the money have you  nobut  if i needed money dye suppose id bought the mortgage  no answered the still bewildered wetherell of course not there he stuck that other suspicion of political coercion suddenly rising uppermost could this be what the man meant wetherell put his hand to his head but he did not dare to ask the question then jethro bass fixed his eyes upon him  haint never mixed any in politicshev you nnever mixed any  wetherells heart sank  no he answered  ddonttake my adviceddont  what cried the storekeeper so loudly that he frightened himself  ddont repeated jethro imperturbably  there was a short silence the storekeeper being unable to speak coniston water at the foot of the garden sang the same song but it seemed to wetherell to have changed its note from sorrow to joy  hhear things dont youhear things in the store  yes  dont hear em keep out of politics will sstick to storekeepin andand literature  jethro got to his feet and turned his back on the storekeeper and picked up the parcel he had brought  ccynthy well he inquired  iill call her said wetherell huskily sheshe was down by the brook when you came  but jethro bass did not wait he took his parcel and strode down to coniston water and there he found cynthia seated on a rock with her toes in a pool  how be you cynthy said he looking down at her  im well uncle jethro said cynthia  rremembered what i told you to call me hev you said jethro plainly pleased ththats right cynthy  cynthia looked up at him inquiringly  ssaid you liked booksdidnt you ssaid you liked books  yes i do she replied simply very much  he undid the wrapping of the parcel and there lay disclosed a book with a very gorgeous cover he thrust it into the childs lap  its robinson crusoe she exclaimed and gave a little shiver of delight that made ripples in the pool then she opened itnot without awe for william wetherells hooks were not clothed in this magnificent manner its full of pictures cried cynthia see there he is making a ship  yyou read it cynthy asked jethro a little anxiously  no cynthia hadnt  llike it cynthyllike it said he not quite so anxiously  cynthia looked up at him with a puzzled expression  ffetched it up from the capital for you cynthyfor you  for me  a strange thrill ran through jethro bass as he gazed upon the wonder and delight in the face of the child  ffetched it for you cynthy  for a moment cynthia sat very still and then she slowly closed the book and stared at the cover again jethro looking down at her the while to tell the truth she found it difficult to express the emotions which the event had summoned up  thank youuncle jethro she said  jethro however understood he had indeed never failed to understand her from the beginning he parted his coat tails and sat down on the rock beside her and very gently opened the book again to the first chapter  ggoin to read it cynthy  oh yes she said and trembled again  erread it to me  so cynthia read robinson crusoe to him while the summer afternoon wore away and the shadows across the pool grew longer and longer     chapter xi  thus william wetherell became established in coniston and was started at lastpoor manupon a life that was fairly tranquil lem hallowell had once covered him with blushes by unfolding a newspaper in the store and reading an editorial beginning we publish today a new and attractive feature of the guardian a weekly contribution from a correspondent whose modesty is to be compared only with his genius as a writer we are confident that the readers of our raper will appreciate the letter in another column signed w w and from that day william was accorded much of the deference due to a litterateur which the fates had hitherto denied him indeed during the six years which we are about to skip over so lightly he became a marked man in coniston and it was voted in towns meeting that he be intrusted with that most important of literary labors the town history of coniston  during this period too there sprang up the strangest of intimacies between him and jethro bass surely no more dissimilar men than these have ever been friends and that the friendship was sometimes misjudged was one of the clouds on william wetherells horizon as the years went on he was still unable to pay off the mortgage and sometimes indeed he could not even meet the interest in spite of the princely sum he received from mr willard of the guardian this was one of the clouds on jethros horizon too if men had but known it and he took such moneys as wetherell insisted upon giving him grudgingly enough it is needless to say that he refrained from making use of mr wetherell politically although no poorer vessel for political purposes was ever constructed it is quite as needless to say perhaps that chester perkins never got to be chairman of the board of selectmen  after aunt listy died jethro was more than ever to be found when in coniston in the garden or the kitchen behind the store yes aunt listy is dead she has flitted through these pages as she flitted through life itself arrayed by jethro like the rainbow and quite as shadowy and unreal there is no politician of a certain age in the state who does not remember her walking clad in dragonfly colors through the streets of the capital on jethros arm or descending the stairs of the pelican house to supper none of jethros detractors may say that he ever failed in kindness to her and he loved her as much as was in his heart to love any woman after cynthia ware as for aunt listy she never seemed to feel any resentment against the child jethro brought so frequently to thousand acre hill poor aunt listy some people used to wonder whether she ever felt any emotion at all but i believe that she did in her own way  it is a wellknown fact that mr bijah bixby came over from clovelly to request the place of superintendent of the funeral a position which had already been filled a special office too was created on this occasion for an old supporter of jethros senator peleg hartington of brampton he was made chairman of the bearers of whom ephraim prescott was one  after this as we have said jethro was more than ever at the storeor rather in that domestic domain behind it which wetherell and cynthia shared with miss millicent skinner moses hatch was wont to ask cynthia how her daddies were it was he who used to clear out the road to the little schoolhouse among the birches when the snow almost buried the little village and on sparkling mornings after the storms his oxen would stop to breathe in front of the store a cluster of laughing children clinging to the snowplough and tumbling over goodnatured moses in their frolics cynthia became a country girl and grew long and lithe of limb and weatherburnt and acquired an endurance that spoke wonders for the lifegiving air of coniston but she was a serious child and wetherell and jethro sometimes wondered whether she was ever a child at all when eben hatch fell from the lumber pile on the ice it was she who bound the cut in his head and when tom richardson unexpectedly embraced the schoolhouse stove cynthia not miss rebecca northcutt took charge of the situation  it was perhaps inevitable with such a helpless father that the girl should grow up with a sense of responsibility being what she was did william wetherell go to brampton cynthia examined his apparel and he was marched shamefacedly back to his room to change did he read too late at night some unseen messenger summoned her out of her sleep and he was packed off to bed miss millicent skinner too was in a like mysterious way compelled to abdicate her high place in favor of cynthia and wetherell was utterly unable to explain how this miracle was accomplished not only did millicent learn to cook but cynthia at the age of fourteen had taught her some wit once suggested that the national arms of the united states should contain the emblem of crossed fryingpans and millicent was in this respect a true american when wetherell began to suffer from her pies and doughnuts the revolution took placewithout stampeding or recriminations or trouble of any kind one evening he discovered cynthia decked in an apron bending over the stove and millicent looking on with an expression that was for millicent benign  this was to some extent explained a few days later when wetherell found himself gazing across the counter at the motherly figure of mrs moses hatch who held the welldeserved honor of being the best cook in coniston  haint had so much stomach trouble lately will she remarked  no he answered surprised cynthia is learning to cook  guess she is said mrs moses that gal is worth any seven grownup women in town and she was four nights settin in my kitchen before i knowed what she was up to  so you taught her amanda  i taught her some she callated that milly was killin you and i guess she was  during her school days jethro used frequently to find himself in front of the schoolhouse when the children came trooping outquite by accident of course winter or summer when he went away on his periodical trips he never came back without a little remembrance in his carpet bag usually a book on the subject of which he had spent hours in conference with the librarian at the state library at the capital but in june of the year when cynthia was fifteen jethro yielded to that passion which was one of the mans strangest characteristics and appeared one evening in the garden behind the store with a bundle which certainly did not contain a book with all the gravity of a ceremony he took off the paper and held up in relief against the astonished cynthia a length of cardinal cloth william wetherell who was looking out of the window drew his breath and even jethro drew back with an exclamation at the change wrought in her but cynthia snatched the roll from his hand and wound it up with a feminine deftness  whwhats the matter cynthy  oh i cant wear that uncle jethro she said  ccant wear it why not  cynthia sat down on the grassy mound under the apple tree and clasped her hands across her knees she looked up at him and shook her head  dont you see that i couldnt wear it uncle jethro  why not he demanded chchange it if youve a mind to hev green  she shook her head and smiled at him a little sadly  ttook me a full hour to choose that cynthy said he hhad to go to boston so i got it there  he was indeed grievously disappointed at this reception of his gift and he stood eying the cardinal cloth very mournfully as it lay on the paper cynthia remorseful reached up and seized his hand  sit down here uncle jethro he sat down on the mound beside her very much perplexed she still held his hand in hers uncle jethro she said slowly you mustnt think im not grateful  nno he answered i dont think that cynthy i know you be  i am gratefulim very grateful for everything you give me although i should love you just as much if you didnt give me anything  she was striving very hard not to offend him for in some ways he was as sensitive as wetherell himself even coniston folk had laughed at the idiosyncrasy which jethro had of dressing his wife in brilliant colors and the girl knew this  ggot it for you to wear to brampton on the fourth of july cynthy he said  uncle jethro i couldnt wear that to brampton  youd look like a queen said he  but im not a queen objected cynthia  rather hev somethin else  yes she said looking at him suddenly with the gleam of laughter in her eyes although she was on the verge of tears  whwhat jethro demanded  well said cynthia demurely gazing down at her ankles shoes and stockings the barefooted days had long gone by  jethro laughed perhaps some inkling of her reasons came to him for he had a strange and intuitive understanding of her at any rate he accepted her decision with a meekness which would have astonished many people who knew only that side of him which he showed to the world gently she released her hand and folded up the bundle again and gave it to him  bbetter keep ithadnt you  no you keep it and i will wear it for you when i am rich uncle jethro  jethro did keep it and in due time the cardinal cloth had its uses but cynthia did not wear it on the fourth of july  that was a great day for brampton being not only the nations birthday but the hundredth year since the adventurous little band of settlers from connecticut had first gazed upon coniston water at that place early in the morning wagon loads began to pour into brampton street from harwich from coniston from tarleton four corners and even from distant clovelly and brampton was bannerhung for the occasionflags across the stores across the dwellings and draped along the whole breadth of the meetinghouse but for sheer splendor the newly built mansion of isaac d worthington outshone them all although its owner was a professed believer in republican simplicity no such edifice ornamented any town to the west of the state capital small wonder that the way in front of it was blocked by a crowd lost in admiration of its gothic proportions it stands today one of many monuments to its builder with its windows of one pane unheardof magnificence its tower of stone its porch with pointed arches and scrollwork no fence divides its grounds from the public walk and on the smoothshaven lawn between the ornamental flower beds and the walk stand two stern mastiffs of iron emblematic of the solidity and power of their owner it was as much to see this house as to hear the oratory that the countryside flocked to brampton that day  all the day before cynthia and milly and many another housewife had been making wonderful things for the dinners they were to bring and stowing them in the great basket ready for the early morning start at six oclock jethros threeseated farm wagon was in front of the store cousin ephraim prescott in a blue suit and an army felt hat with a cord got up behind a little stiffly by reason of that wilderness bullet and there were also william wetherell and lem hallowell his honest face shining and sue his wife and young sue and jock and lilian all aquiver with excitement in their sunday best  and as they drove away there trotted up behind them moses and amandy hatch with their farm team and all the little hatcheseben and george and judy and liza as they jogged along they drank in the fragrance of the dewwashed meadows and the pines and a great blue heron stood kneedeep on the far side of deacon lysanders old millpond watching them philosophically as they passed  it was eight oclock when they got into the press of brampton street and there was a hush as they made their way slowly through the throng and many a stare at the curious figure in the oldfashioned blue swallowtail and brass buttons and tall hat driving the farm wagon husbands pointed him out to their wives young men to sisters and sweethearts some openly some discreetly there goes jethro bass and some were bold enough to say howdy jethro jake wheeler was to be observed in the crowd ahead of them hurried for once out of his jethro step actually running toward the tavern lest such a one arrive unheralded commotion is perceived on the tavern porchmr sherman the proprietor bustling out jake wheeler beside him a chorus of how be you jethros from the more courageous therebut the farm team jogs on leaving a discomfited gathering into the side street up an alley and into the cool ammoniareeking sheds of lank jim sanborns livery stable no obsequiousness from lank jim who has the traces slipped and the reins festooned from the bits almost before jethro has lifted cynthia to the floor jethro walking between cynthia and her father led the way ephraim lem and sue hallowell following the children in unwonted shoes and stockings bringing up the rear the people parted and presently they found themselves opposite the newscrolled band stand among the trees where the harwich band in glittering gold and red had just been installed the leader catching sight of jethros party and of ephraims corded army hat made a bow waved his baton and they struck up marching through georgia it was of course not dignified to cheer but i think that the blood of every man and woman and child ran faster with the music and so many of them looked at cousin ephraim that he slipped away behind the line of wagons so the day began  jest to think of bein that rich will exclaimed amanda hatch to the storekeeper as they stood in the little group which had gathered in front of the first citizens new mansion i own it scares me think how much that house must hev cost and even them dogs said amanda staring at the mastiffs with awe they tell me he has a grand piano from new york and guests from boston railroad presidents i call isaac worthington to mind when he wahnt but a slip of a boy with a cough runnin after cynthy ware she glanced down at cynthia with something of compassion just to think child he might have ben your father  im glad he isnt said cynthia hotly  of course of course replied the goodnatured and wellintentioned amanda id sooner have your father than isaac worthington but i was only thinkin how nice it would be to be rich  just then one of the glasspanelled doors of this house opened and a goodlooking lad of seventeen came out  thats bob worthington said amanda determined that they should miss nothing my it wahnt but the other day when he put on long pants it wont be a great while before hell go into the mills and git all that money guess hell marry some city person hed ought to take you cynthy  i dont want him said cynthia the color flaming into her cheeks and she went off across the green in search of jethro  there was a laugh from the honest country folk who had listened bob worthington came to the edge of the porch and stood there frankly scanning the crowd with an entire lack of selfconsciousness some of them shifted nervously with the new englanders dislike of being caught in the act of sightseeing  what in the world is he starin at me for said amanda backing behind the bulkier form of her husband as i live i believe hes comin here  young mr worthington was indeed descending the steps and walking across the lawn toward them nodding and smiling to acquaintances as he passed to wetherells astonishment he made directly for the place where he was standing and held out his hand  how do you do mr wetherell he said perhaps you dont remember mebob worthington  i cant say that i should have known you answered the storekeeper they were all absurdly silent thinking of nothing to say and admiring the boy because he was at ease  i hope you have a good seat at the exercises he said pressing wetherells hand again and before he could thank him bob was off in the direction of the band stand  one thing remarked amanda he aint much like his dad youd never catch isaac worthington bein that common  just then there came another interruption for william wetherell who was startled by the sound of a voice in his eara nasal voice that awoke unpleasant recollections he turned to confront within the distance of eight inches the face of mr bijah bixby of clovelly screwed up into a greeting the storekeeper had met mr bixby several times since that first memorable meeting and on each occasion as now his hand had made an involuntary movement to his watch pocket  haint seed you for some time will remarked mr bixby goin over to the exercises well move along that way and he thrust his hand under mr wetherells elbow whars jethro  hes here somewhere answered the storekeeper helplessly moving along in spite of himself  keepin out of sight you understand said bijah with a knowing wink as much as to say that mr wetherell was by this time a past master in jethro tactics mr bixby could never disabuse his mind of a certain interpretation which he put on the storekeepers intimacy with jethro you done well to git in with him will didnt think you had it in you when i first looked you over  mr wetherell wished to make an indignant denial but he didnt know exactly how to begin  smartest man in the united states of americaguess you know that mr bixby continued amiably they cant git at him unless he wants em to theres a railroad president at isaac worthingtons whod like to git at him todayguess you know thatsteve merrill  mr wetherell didnt know but he was given no time to say so  steve merrill of the grand gulf and northern he haint here to see worthington hes here to see jethro when jethros a mind to guess you understand  i know nothing about it answered wetherell shortly mr bixby gave him a look of infinite admiration as though he could not have pursued any more admirable line  i know steve merrill bettern i know you said mr bixby and he knows me whenever he sees me at the state capital he says how be you bije just as natural as if i was a railroad president and slaps me on the back when be you goin to the capital will youd ought to come down and be thar with the boys on this truro bill you could reach some on em the rest of us couldnt git at  william wetherell avoided a reply to this very pointed inquiry by escaping into the meetinghouse where he found jethro and cynthia and ephraim already seated halfway up the aisle  on the platform behind a bank of flowers are the velvet covered chairs which contain the dignitaries of the occasion the chief of these is of course mr isaac worthington the one with the hawklike look sitting next to the rev mr sweet who is rather pudgy by contrast on the other side of mr sweet next to the parlor organ and the quartette is the genial little railroad president mr merrill batting the flies which assail the unprotected crown of his head and smiling benignly on the audience  suddenly his eye becomes fixed and he waves a fat hand vigorously at jethro who answers the salute with a nod of unwonted cordiality for him then comes a hush and the exercises begin  there is a prayer of course by the rev mr sweet and a rendering of my country and i would not change my lot and other choice selections by the quartette and an original poem recited with much feeling by a lady admirer of miss lucretia penniman and the hymn to coniston declaimed by mr gamaliel ives president of the brampton literary club but the crowning event is of course the oration by mr isaac d worthington the first citizen who is introduced under that title by the chairman of the day and as the benefactor of brampton who has bestowed upon the town the magnificent gift which was dedicated such a short time ago the worthington free library  mr isaac d worthington stood erect beside the table his hand thrust into the opening of his coat and spoke at the rate of one hundred and eight words a minute for exactly one hour he sketched with much skill the creed of the men who had fought their way through the forests to build their homes by coniston water who had left their clearings to risk their lives behind stark and ethan allen for that creed he paid a graceful tribute to the veterans of the civil war scattered among his hearersa tribute by the way which for some reason made ephraim very indignant mr worthington went on to outline the duty of citizens of the present day as he conceived it and in this connection referred with becoming modesty to the worthington free library he had made his money in brampton and it was but right that he should spend it for the benefit of the people of brampton the library continued mr worthington when the applause was over had been the dream of a certain delicate youth who had come many years ago to brampton for his health it is a curious fact by the way that mr worthington seldom recalled the delicate youth now except upon public occasions  yes the dream of that youth had been to benefit in some way that community in which circumstances had decreed that he should live and in this connection it might not be out of place to mention a bill then before the legislature of the state now in session if the bill became a law the greatest modern factor of prosperity the railroad would come to brampton the speaker was interrupted here by more applause mr worthington did not deem it dignified or necessary to state that the railroad to which he referred was the truro railroad and that he as the largest stockholder might indirectly share that prosperity with brampton that would be wandering too far from his subject which it will be recalled was civic duties he took a glass of water and went on to declare that he fearedsadly fearedthat the ballot was not held as sacred as it had once been he asked the people of brampton and of the state to stop and consider who in these days made the laws and granted the franchises whereupon he shook his head very slowly and sadly as much as to imply that if the truro bill did not pass the corruption of the ballot was to blame no mr worthington could think of no better subject on this birthday of independence than a recapitulation of the creed of our forefathers from which we had so far wandered  in short the first citizen as became him had delivered the first reform speech ever heard in brampton and the sensation which it created was quite commensurate to the occasion the presence in the audience of jethro bass at whom many believed the remarks to have been aimed added no little poignancy to that sensation although jethro gave no outward signs of the terror and remorse by which he must have been struck while listening to mr worthingtons ruminations of the corruption of the ballot apparently unconscious of the eyes upon him he walked out of the meetinghouse with cynthia by his side and they stood waiting for wetherell and ephraim under the maple tree there  the beribboned members of the independence day committee were now on the steps and behind them came isaac worthington and mr merrill the people scenting a dramatic situation lingered would the mill owner speak to the boss the mill owner with a glance at the boss did nothing of the kind but immediately began to talk rapidly to mr merrill that gentleman however would not be talked to but came running over to jethro and seized his hand leaving mr worthington to walk on by himself  jethro cried the little railroad president upon my word well well and miss jethro he took off his hat to cynthia well well didnt know you had a girl jethro  wwish she was mine steve said jethro shes a good deal to me as it is haint you cynthy  yes said cynthia  well well said mr merrill staring at her youll have to look out for her some daykeep the boys away from hereh upon my word well jethro said he with a twinkle in his eye are you goin to reform ill bet youve got an annual over my road in your pocket right now  enjoy the speechmakin steve inquired mr bass solemnly  mr merrill winked at jethro and laughed heartily  keep the boys away from her jethro he repeated laying his hand on the shoulder of the lad who stood beside him its a good thing bobs going off to harvard this fall seems to me i heard about some cutting up at andovereh bob  bob grinned showing a line of very white teeth  mr merrill took jethro by the arm and led him off a little distance having a message of some importance to give him the purport of which will appear later and cynthia and bob were left face to face of course bob could have gone on if he had wished it  dont remember me do you he said  i do now said cynthia looking at him rather timidly through her lashes her face was hot and she had been very uncomfortable during mr merrills remarks furthermore bob had not taken his eyes off her  i remembered you right away he said reproachfully i saw you in front of the house this morning and you ran away  i didnt runaway replied cynthia indignantly  it looked like it to me said bob i suppose you were afraid i was going to give you anther whistle  cynthia bit her lip and then she laughed then she looked around to see where jethro was and discovered that they were alone in front of the meetinghouse ephraim and her father had passed on while mr merrill was talking  whats the matter asked bob  im afraid theyve gone said cynthia i ought to be going after them theyll miss me  oh no they wont said bob easily lets sit down under the tree theyll come back  whereupon he sat down under the maple but cynthia remained standing ready to fly she had an idea that it was wrong to staywhich made it all the more delightful  sit downcynthia said he  she glanced down at him startled he was sitting with his legs crossed looking up at her intently  i like that name he observed i like it better than any girls name i know do be goodnatured and sit down and he patted the ground close beside him  shy laughed again the laugh had in it an exquisite note of shyness which he liked  why do you want me to sit down she asked suddenly  because i want to talk to you  cant you talk to me standing up  i suppose i could said bob buti shouldnt be able to say such nice things to you  the corners of her mouth trembled a little  and whose loss would that be she asked  bob worthington was surprised at this retort and correspondingly delighted he had not expected it in a country storekeepers daughter and he stared at cynthia so frankly that she blushed again and turned away he was a young man who it may be surmised had had some experience with the other sex at andover and elsewhere he had not spent all of his life in brampton  ive often thought of you since that day when you wouldnt take the whistle he declared what are you laughing at  im laughing at you said cynthia leaning against the tree with her hands behind her  youve been laughing at me ever since youve stood there he said aggrieved that his declarations should not betaken more seriously  what have you thought about me she demanded she was really beginning to enjoy this episode  well he began and hesitatedand broke down and laughedcynthia laughed with him  i can tell you what i didnt think said bob  what asked cynthia falling into the trap  i didnt think youd be soso goodlooking said he quite boldly  and i didnt think youd be so rude responded cynthia but though she blushed again she was not exactly displeased  what are you going to do this afternoon he asked lets go for a walk  im going back to coniston  lets go for a walk now said he springing to his feet come on  cynthia looked at him and shook her head smilingly  heres uncle jethro  uncle jethro exclaimed bob is he your uncle  oh no not really but hes just the same hes very good to me  i wonder whether hed mind if i called him uncle jethro too said bob and cynthia laughed at the notion this young man was certainly very comical and very frank goodby he said ill come to see you some day in coniston     chapter xii  that evening after cynthia had gone to bed william wetherell sat down at jonah winchs desk in the rear of the store to gaze at a blank sheet of paper until the muses chose to send him subject matter for his weekly letter to the guardian the window was open and the cool airs from the mountain spruces mingled with the odors of corn meal and kerosene and calico print jethro bass who had supped with the storekeeper sat in the wooden armchair silent with his head bent sometimes he would sit there by the hour while wetherell wrote or read and take his departure when he was so moved without saying good night presently jethro lifted his chin and dropped it again there was a sound of wheels without and after an interval a knock at the door  william wetherell dropped his pen with a start of surprise as it was late for a visitor in coniston he glanced at jethro who did not move and then he went to the door and shot back the great forged bolt of it and stared out on the edge of the porch stood a tallish man in a doublebreasted frock coat  mr worthington exclaimed the storekeeper  mr worthington coughed and pulled at one of his muttonchop whiskers and seemed about to step off the porch again it was indeed the first citizen and reformer of brampton no wonder william wetherell was mystified  can i do anything for you he asked have you missed your way  wetherell thought he heard him muttering no no and then he was startled by another voice in his ear it was jethro who was standing beside him  gguess he haint missed his way a great deal ercome income in  mr worthington took a couple of steps forward  i understood that you were to be alone he remarked addressing jethro with an attempted severity of manner  didnt say soddidnt say so did i answered jethro  very well said mr worthington any other time will do for this little matter  ergood night said jethro shortly and there was the suspicion of a gleam in his eye as mr worthington turned away the millowner in fact did not get any farther than the edge of the porch before he wheeled again  the affair which i have to discuss with you is of a private nature mr bass he said  so i callated said jethro  you may have the place to yourselves gentlemen wetherell put in uneasily and then mr worthington came as far as the door where he stood looking at the storekeeper with scant friendliness jethro turned to wetherell  you a politician will he demanded  no said wetherell  you a business man  no he said again  you ever tell folks what you hear other people say  certainly not the storekeeper answered im not interested in other peoples business  exactly said jethro guess youd better stay  but i dont care to stay wetherell objected  stay to oblige mestay to oblige me he asked  well yes if you put it that way wetherell said beginning to get some amusement out of the situation  he did not know what jethros object was in this matter perhaps others may guess  mr worthington who had stood by with illdisguised impatience during this colloquy note broke in  it is most unusual mr bass to have a third person present at a conference in which he has no manner of concern i think on the whole since you have insisted upon my coming to you  hhaint insisted that i know of said jethro  well said mr worthington never mind that  perhaps it would be better for me to come to you some other time when you are alone  in the meantime wetherell had shut the door and they had gradually walked to the rear of the store jethro parted his coat tails and sat down again in the armchair wetherell not wishing to be intrusive went to his desk again leaving the first citizen standing among the barrels  wwhat other time jethro asked  any other time said mr worthington  what other time  tomorrow night suggested mr worthington striving to hide his annoyance  bbusy tomorrow night said jethro  you know that what i have to talk to you about is of the utmost importance said worthington let us say saturday night  bbusy saturday night said jethro meet you tomorrow  what time  noon said jethro noon  where asked mr worthington dubiously  band stand in brampton street said jethro and the storekeeper was fain to bend over his desk to conceal his laughter busying himself with his books mr worthington sat down with as much dignity as he could muster on one of jonahs old chairs and jonah winchs clock ticked and ticked and wetherells pen scratched and scratched on his weekly letter to mr willard although he knew that he was writing the sheerest nonsense as a matter of fact he tore up the sheets the next morning without reading them mr worthington unbuttoned his coat fumbled in his pocket and pulled out two cigars one of which he pushed toward jethro who shook his head mr worthington lighted his cigar and cleared his throat  perhaps you have observed mr bass he said that this is a rapidly growing section of the statethat the people hereabouts are every day demanding modern and efficient means of communication with the outside world  struck you as a mill owner has it said jethro  i do not care to emphasize my private interests answered mr worthington at last appearing to get into his stride again i wish to put the matter on broader grounds men like you and me ought not to be so much concerned with our own affairs as with those of the population amongst whom we live and i think i am justified in putting it to you on these grounds  hhave to be justified do youhave to be justified jethro inquired erwhy  this was a poser and for a moment he stared at jethro blankly until he decided how to take it then he crossed his legs and blew smoke toward the ceiling  it is certainly fairer to everybody to take the broadest view of a situation he remarked i am trying to regard this from the aspect of a citizen and i am quite sure that it will appeal to you in the same light if the spirit which imbued the founders of this nation means anything mr bass it means that the able men who are given a chance to rise by their own efforts must still retain the duties and responsibilities of the humblest citizens that i take it is our position mr bassyours and mine  mr worthington had uncrossed his legs and was now by the inspiration of his words impelled to an upright position suddenly he glanced at jethro and started for jethro had sunk down on the small of his back his chin on his chest in an attitude of lassitude if not of oblivion there was a silence perhaps a little disconcerting for mr worthington who chose the opportunity to relight his cigar  ggot through said jethro without moving ggot through  through echoed mr worthington through what  tthrough sundayschool said jethro  worthington dropped his match and stamped on it and wetherell began to wonder how much the man would stand it suddenly came over the storekeeper that the predicament in which mr worthington found himself whatever it wasmust be a very desperate one he half rose in his chair sat down again and lighted another match  erdirector in the truro road haint you mr worthington asked jethro without looking at him  yes  erprincipal stockholderaint you  yesbut that is neither here nor there sir  road dont payrroad dont pay does it  it certainly does not  wwould pay if it went to brampton and harwich  mr bass the company consider that they are pledged to the people of this section to get the road through i am not prepared to say whether the road would pay but it is quite likely that it would not  chcharitable organization said jethro from the depths of his chair  the pioneers in such matters take enormous risks for the benefit of the community sir we believe that we are entitled to a franchise and in my opinion the general court are behaving disgracefully in refusing us one i will not say all i think about that affair mr bass i am convinced that influences are at work he broke off with a catch in his throat  ttried to get a franchise did you  i am not here to quibble with you mr bass we tried to get it by every legitimate means and failed and you know it as well as i do  erheth sutton didnt sign his receipterdid he  the storekeeper not being a politician was not aware that the somewhat obscure reference of jethros to the speaker of the house concerned an application which mr worthington was supposed to have made to that gentleman who had at length acknowledged his inability to oblige and had advised mr worthington to go to headquarters and mr stephen merrill who had come to brampton out of the kindness of his heart had only arranged this meeting in a conversation with jethro that day after the reform speech  mr worthington sprang to his feet and flung out a hand toward jethro  prove your insinuations air he cried i defy you to prove your insinuations  but jethro still sat unmoved  hheth in the charitable organization too he asked  people told me i was a fool to believe in honesty but i thought better of the lawmakers of my state ill tell you plainly what they said to me sir they said go to jethro bass  well so you have haint you so you have  yes i have ive come to appeal to you in behalf of the people of your section to allow that franchise to go through the present legislature  ercome to appeal have youcome to appeal  yes said mr worthington sitting down again i have come tonight to appeal to you in the name of the farmers and merchants of this regionyour neighborsto use your influence to get that franchise i have come to you with the conviction that i shall not have appealed in vain  erappealed to heth in the name of the farmers and merchants  mr sutton is speaker of the house  ffarmers and merchants elected him remarked jethro as though stating a fact  worthington coughed  it is probable that i made a mistake in going to sutton he admitted  if i wwanted to catch a pike wwouldnt use a pinhook  i might have known remarked worthington after a pause that sutton could not have been elected speaker without your influence  jethro did not answer that but still remained sunk in his chair to all appearances he might have been asleep  wworth somethin to the farmers and merchants to get that road throughwworth somethin aint it  wetherell held his breath for a moment mr worthington sat very still his face drawn and then he wet his lips and rose slowly  we may as well end this conversation mr bass he said and though he tried to speak firmly his voice shook it seems to be useless good night  he picked up his hat and walked slowly toward the door but jethro did not move or speak mr worthington reached the door opened it and the night breeze started the lamp to smoking wetherell got up and turned it down and the first citizen was still standing in the doorway his back was toward them but the fingers of his left handworking convulsively caught wetherells eye and held it save for the ticking of the clock and the chirping of the crickets in the grass there was silence then mr worthington closed the door softly hesitated turned and came back and stood before jethro  mr bass he said weve got to have that franchise  william wetherell glanced at the countryman who without moving in his chair without raising his voice had brought the first citizen of brampton to his knees the thing frightened the storekeeper revolted him and yet its drama held him fascinated by some subtle process which he had actually beheld but could not fathom this cold mr worthington this bank president who had given him sage advice this preacher of political purity had been reduced to a frenzied supplicant he stood bending over jethro  whats your price name it for gods sake  bbetter wait till you get the billhadnt you bbetter wait till you get the bill  will you put the franchise through  goin down to the capital soon jethro inquired  im going down on thursday  bbetter come in and see me said jethro  very well answered mr worthington ill be in at two oclock on thursday and then without another word to either of them he swung on his heel and strode quickly out of the store jethro did not move  william wetherells hand was trembling so that he could not write and he could not trust his voice to speak although jethro had never mentioned isaac worthingtons name to him wetherell knew that jethro hated the first citizen of brampton  at length when the sound of the wheels had died away jethro broke the silence  erdidnt laughdid he will didnt laugh oncedid he  laugh echoed the storekeeper who himself had never been further from laughter in his life  mmight have let him off easier if hed laughed said jethro if hed laughed just once mmight have let him off easier  and with this remark he went out of the store and left wetherell alone     chapter xiii  the weekly letter to the newcastle guardian was not finished that night but coniston slept peacefully unaware of mr worthingtons visit and never indeed discovered it since the historian for various reasons of his own did not see fit to insert the event in his plan of the town history before another sun had set jethro bass had departed for the state capital not choosing to remain to superintend the haying of the many farms which had fallen into his handa most unusual omission for him  presently rumors of a mighty issue about the truro railroad began to be discussed by the politicians at the coniston store and jake wheeler held himself in instant readiness to answer a summons to the capitalwhich never came  delegations from brampton and harwich went to petition the legislature for the franchise and the brampton clarion and harwich sentinel declared that the people of truro county recognized in isaac worthington a great and publicspirited man who ought by all means to be the next governorif the franchise went through  one evening lem hallowell after depositing a box of trimmings at ephraim prescotts harness shop drove up to the platform of the store with the remark that things were gittin pretty hot down to the capital in that franchise fight  haint you ben sent for yet jake he cried throwing his reins over the backs of his sweating morgans well thats strange guess the fight haint as hot as we hear about jethro haint had to call out his best men  im agoin down if theres trouble declared jake who consistently ignored banter  better git up and git said lem theres three out of the five railroads against truro and steve merrill layin low bije bixbys down there and heth sutton and abner parkinson and all the big bugs better get aboard jake  at this moment the discussion was interrupted by the sight of cynthia wetherell coming across the green with an open letter in her hand  its a message from uncle jethro she said  the announcement was sufficient to warrant the sensation it produced on all sides  taint a letter from jethro is it exclaimed sam price overcome by a pardonable curiosity for it was well known that one of jethros fixed principles in life was embodied in his own motto dont writesend  its very funny answered cynthia looking down at the paper with a puzzled expression dear cynthia judge bass wished me to say to you that he would be pleased if you and will would come to the capital and spend a week with him at the pelican house and see the sights the judge says rias richardson will tend store yours truly p hartington thats all said cynthia looking up  for a moment you could have heard a pine needle drop on the stoop then rias thrust his hands in his pockets and voiced the general sentiment  well ill begoldurned said he  didnt say nothin about jake queried lem  no answered cynthia thats allexcept two pieces of cardboard with something about the truro railroad and our names i dont know what they are and she took them from the envelope  guess i could tell you if i was pressed said lem amid a shout of merriment from the group  air you goin will said sam price pausing with his foot on the step of his buggy that he might have the complete news before he left  godfrey will exclaimed rigs breathlessly you haint agoin to throw up a chance to stay a hull week at the pelican be you the mere possibility of refusal overpowered rias  those who are familiar with that delightful french song which treats of the leavetaking of one monsieur dumollet will appreciate perhaps the attentions which were showered upon william wetherell and cynthia upon their departure for the capital next morning although mr wetherell had at one time been actually a resident of boston he received quite as many cautions from his neighbors as monsieur dumollet billets doux and pistols were of course not mentioned but it certainly behooved him when he should have arrived at that place of intrigues to be on the lookout for cabals  they took the stagecoach from brampton over the pass picturesque stagecoach with its applegreen body and leather springs soon to be laid away forever if the coveted truro franchise bill becomes a law stagecoach which pulls up defiantly beside its own rival at truro station where our passengers take the train down the pleasant waterways and past the little white villages among the fruit trees to the capital the thrill of anticipation was in cynthias blood and the flush of pleasure on her cheeks when they stopped at last under the sheds the conductor snapped his fingers and cried this way judge and there was jethro in his swallowtailed coat and stovepipe hat awaiting them he seized wetherells carpetbag with one hand and cynthias arm with the other and shouldered his way through the people who parted when they saw who it was  uncle jethro cried cynthia breathlessly i didnt know you were a judge what are you judge of  jjudge of clothes cynthy ddont you wish you had the red cloth to wear here  no i dont said cynthia im glad enough to be here without it  gglad to hev you in any fixins cynthy he said giving her arm a little squeeze and by that time they were up the hill and william wetherell quite winded for jethro was strong as an ox and cynthias muscles were like an indians  they were among the glories of main street now the capital was then and still remains a typically beautiful new england city with wide streets shaded by shapely maples and elms with substantial homes set back amidst lawns and gardens here on main street were neat brick business buildings and banks and shops with the parklike grounds of the capitol farther on and everywhere from curb to doorway were knots of men talking politics broadfaced sunburned farmers in store clothes with beards that hid their shirt fronts keenfeatured sallow country lawyers in long black coats crumpled from much sitting on the small of the back country storekeepers with shrewd eyes and local proprietors and manufacturers  uncle jethro i didnt know you were such a great man she said  hhow did ye find out cynthy  the way people treat you here i knew you were great of course she hastened to add  hhow do they treat me he asked looking down at her  you know she answered they all stop talking when you come along and stare at you but why dont you speak to them  jethro smiled and squeezed her arm again and then they were in the corridor of the famous pelican hotel hazy with cigar smoke and filled with politicians some were standing hanging on to pillars gesticulating some were ranged in benches along the wall and a chosen few were in chairs grouped around the spittoons upon the appearance of jethros party the talk was hushed the groups gave way and they accomplished a kind of triumphal march to the desk the clerk descrying them desisted abruptly from a conversation across the cigar counter and with all the form of a ceremony dipped the pen with a flourish into the ink and handed it to jethro  your rooms are ready judge he said  as they started for the stairs jethro and cynthia leading the way wetherell felt a touch on his elbow and turned to confront mr bijah bixbyat very close range as usual  ccome down at last will he said thought ye would need everybody this timeyou understand  i came on pleasure retorted mr wetherell somewhat angrily  mr bixby appeared hugely to enjoy the joke  so i callated he cried still holding wetherells hand in a mild but persuasive grip so i callated guess i done you an injustice will  hows that  youre a leetle mite smarter than i thought you was so long got a leetle business nowyou understand a leetle business  was it possible indeed for the simpleminded to come to the capital and not become involved in cabals with some misgivings william wetherell watched mr bixby disappear among the throng kicking up his heels behind and then went upstairs on the first floor cynthia was standing by an open door  dad she cried come and see the rooms uncle jethros got for us she took wetherells hand and led him in see the lace curtains and the chandelier and the big bureau with the marble top  jethro had parted his coat tails and seated himself enjoyably on the bed  ddont come often he said mmight as well have the best  jethro said wetherell coughing nervously and fumbling in the pocket of his coat youve been very kind to us and we hardly know how to thank you ii didnt have any use for these  he held out the pieces of cardboard which had come in cynthias letter he dared not look at jethro and his eye was fixed instead upon the somewhat grandiose signature of isaac d worthington which they bore jethro took them and tore them up and slowly tossed the pieces into a cuspidor conveniently situated near the foot of the bed he rose and thrust his hands into his pockets  erwhen you get freshened up come into number 7 he said  number 7 but we shall come to that later supper first in a great pillared dining room filled with notables if we only had the key jethro sits silent at the head of the table eating his crackers and milk with cynthia on his left and william wetherell on his right poor william greatly embarrassed by his sudden projection into the limelight is helpless in the clutches of a ladywaitress who is demanding somewhat fiercely that he make an immediate choice from a list of dishes which she is shooting at him with astonishing rapidity but who is this sitting beside him who comes to williams rescue and demands that the lady repeat the bill of fare surely a notable for he has a generous presence and jetblack whiskers which catch the light which give the gentleman as mr bixby remarked quite a settin yes we have met him at last it is none other than the honorable heth sutton rajah of clovelly speaker of the house who has condescended to help mr wetherell  his chamberlain mr bijah bixby sits on the other side of the honorable heth and performs the presentation of mr wetherell but mr sutton as becomes a man of high position says little after he has rebuked the waitress and presently departs with a carefully chosen toothpick whereupon mr bixby moves into the vacant seatnot to mr wetherells unqualified delight  ive knowed him ever sense we was boys said mr bixby you saw how intimate we was when he wants a thing done he says bije you go out and get em never counts the cost he was nice to youwahnt he will and then mr bixby leaned over and whispered in mr wetherells ear he knowsyou understandhe knows  knows what demanded mr wetherell  mr bixby gave him another admiring look  knows you didnt come down here with jethro jest to see the sights  at this instant the talk in the dining room fell flat and looking up william wetherell perceived a portly rubicund man of middle age being shown to his seat by the headwaiter the gentleman wore a great glittering diamond in his shirt and a watch chain that contained much fine gold but the real cause of the silence was plainly in the young woman who walked beside him and whose effective entrance argued no little practice and experience she was of a type that catches the eye involuntarily and holds ittall wellrounded freshcomplexioned with heavy coils of shimmering gold hair her pawn which was far from unbecoming was in keeping with those gifts with which nature had endowed her she carried her head high and bestowed swift and evidently fatal glances to right and left during her progress through the room mr bixbys voice roused the storekeeper from this contemplation of the beauty  thats alvy hopkins of gosport and his daughter fine gal haint she ever sense she come down here tother day shes stirred up more turmoil than any railroad bill i ever seed she was most suffocated at the governors ball with fellers tryin to get dancessome of em old fellers too and you understand about alvy  what about him  alvy says hes agoin to be the next governor or fail up mr bixbys voice sank to a whisper and he spoke into mr wetherells ear alvy says he has twentyfive thousand dollars to put in if necessary ill introduce you to him will he added meaningly guess you can help him someyou understand  mr bixby cried mr wetherell putting down his knife and fork  there said mr bixby reassuringly twont be no bother i know him as well as i do youcall each other by our given names guess i was the first man he sent for last spring he knows i go through all them river towns he says bije you get em i understood  william wetherell began to realize the futility of trying to convince mr bixby of his innocence in political matters and glanced at jethro  you wouldnt think he was listenin would you will mr bixby remarked  listening  ears are sharp as a dogs callate he kin hear as far as the governors table and he dont look as if he knows anything one way he built up his powerlistenin when theyre talkin sly out there in the rotunda theyre almighty surprised when they larn he knows what theyre up to guess you understand how to go along by quiet and listen when theyre talkin sly  i never did such a thing in my life cried william wetherell indignantly aghast  but mr bixby winked  so long will he said see you in number 7  never since the days of pompadour and du barry until modern american politics were invented has a state been ruled from such a place as number 7 in the pelican housefamiliarly known as the throne room in this historic cabinet there were five chairs a marbletopped table a pitcher of iced water a bureau a box of cigars and a bible a chandelier with all the gas jets burning and a bed whereon sat such dignitaries as obtained an audiencerailroad presidents governors and exgovernors and prospective governors the speaker the president of the senate bijah bixby peleg hartington mighty chiefs from the north country and lieutenants from other parts of the state these sat on the bed by preference jethro sat in a chair by the window and never took any part in the discussions that raged but listened generally there was some one seated beside him who talked persistently in his ear as at present for instance mr chauncey weed chairman of the committee on corporations of the house who took the additional precaution of putting his hand to his mouth when he spoke  mr stephen merrill was in the throne room that evening and confidentially explained to the bewildered william wetherell the exact situation in the truro franchise fight inasmuch as it has become our duty to describe this celebrated conflictin a popular and engaging manner if possiblewe shall have to do so through mr wetherells eyes and on his responsibility the biographies of some of the gentlemen concerned have since been published and for some unaccountable reason contain no mention of the truro franchise  all gaul said mr merrillhe was speaking to a literary manall gaul is divided into five railroads i am one the grand gulf and northern the impecunious one that is the reason im so nice to everybody mr wetherell the other day a conductor on my road had a shock of paralysis when a man paid his fare then theres batch president of the down east road as we call it batch and i are out of this fightwe dont care whether isaac d worthington gets his franchise or not or i wouldnt be telling you this the two railroads which dont want him to get it because the truro would eventually become a competitor with them are the central and the northwestern alexander duncan is president of the central  alexander duncan exclaimed wetherell hes the richest man in the state isnt he  yes said mr merrill and he lives in a big square house right here in the capital he aint a bad fellow duncan youd like him he loves books i wish you could see his library  im afraid theres not much chance of that answered wetherell  well as i say theres duncan of the central and the other is lovejoy of the northwestern lovejoys a bachelor and a skinflint those two duncan and lovejoy are using every means in their power to prevent worthington from getting that franchise have i made myself clear  do you think mr worthington will get it asked wetherell who had in mind a certain nocturnal visit at his store  mr merrill almost leaped out of his chair at the question then he mopped his face and winked very deliberately at the storekeeper then mr merrill laughed  well well he said for a man who comes down here to stay with jethro bass to ask me that whereupon mr wetherell flushed and began to perspire himself didnt you hear isaac d worthingtons virtuous appeal to the people at brampton said mr merrill  yes replied wetherell getting redder  i like you will said mr merrill unexpectedly darned if i dont ill tell you what i know about it and you can have a little fun while youre here lookin on only it wont do to write about it to the newcastle guardian guess willard wouldnt publish it anyhow i suppose you know that jethro pulls the strings end we little railroad presidents dance were the puppets now but after a while when im crowded out all these little railroads will get together and therell be a row worth looking at or im mistaken but to go back to worthington continued mr merrill he made a little mistake with his bill in the beginning instead of going to jethro he went to heth sutton and heth got the bill as far as the committee on corporations and there shes been ever since with our friend chauncey weed whos whispering over there  mr sutton couldnt even get it out of the committee exclaimed wetherell  not an inch jethro saw this thing coming about a year ago and he took the precaution to have chauncey weed and the rest of the committee in his pocketand of course heth suttons always been there  william wetherell thought of that imposing and manly personage the honorable heth sutton being in jethros pocket and marvelled mr chauncey weed seemed of a species better able to thrive in the atmosphere of pockets  well as i say there was the truro franchise bill sound asleep in the committee and when isaac d worthington saw that his little arrangement with heth sutton wasnt any good and that the people of the state didnt have anything more to say about it than the crow indians and that the end of the session was getting nearer and nearer he got desperate and went to jethro i suppose you know as well as i do that jethro has agreed to put the bill through  then why doesnt he get the committee to report it and put it through asked wetherell  bless your simple literary nature exclaimed mr merrill jethros got more power than any man in the state but that isnt saying that he doesnt have to fight occasionally he has to fight now he has seven of the twelve senators hitched and the governor but duncan and lovejoy have bought up all the loose blocks of representatives and it is supposed that the franchise forces only control a quorum the end of the session is a week off and never in all my experience have i seen a more praiseworthy attendance on the part of members  do you mean that they are being paid to remain in their seats cried the amazed mr wetherell  well answered mr merrill with a twinkle in his eye that is a little bald andand unparliamentary perhaps but fairly accurate our friend jethro is confronted with a problem to tax even his faculties and to look at him a man wouldnt suspect he had a care in the world  jethro was apparently quite as free from anxiety the next morning when he offered after breakfast to show wetherell and cynthia the sights of the town though wetherell could not but think that the throne room and the truro franchise bill were left at a very crucial moment to take care of themselves jethro talked to cynthiaor rather cynthia talked to jethro upon innumerable subjects they looked upon the statue of a great statesman in the park and cynthia read aloud the quotation graven on the rock of the pedestal the peoples government made for the people made by the people and answerable to the people after that they went into the state library where wetherell was introduced to the librarian mr storrow they did not go into the state house because as everybody knows jethro bass never went there mr bijah bixby and other lieutenants might be seen in the lobbies and the governor might sign bills in his own apartment there but the real seat of government was that throne room into which we have been permitted to enter  they walked out beyond the outskirts of the town where there was a grove or picnic ground which was also used as a park by some of the inhabitants jethro liked the spot and was in the habit sometimes of taking refuge there when the atmosphere of the pelican house became too thick the three of them had sat down on one of the board benches to rest when presently two people were seen at a little distance walking among the trees and the sight of them for some reason seemed to give jethro infinite pleasure  why exclaimed cynthia one of them is that horrid girl everybody was looking at in the dining room last night  ddont like her cynthy said jethro  no said cynthia i dont  prettyhaint shepretty  shes brazen declared cynthia  it was indeed miss cassandra hopkins daughter of that honorable alva whoaccording to mr bixby was all ready with a certain sum of money to be the next governor miss cassandra was arrayed fluffily in cool pink lawn and she carried a fringed parasol and she was gazing upward with telling effect into the face of the gentleman by her side this would have all been very romantic if the gentleman had been young and handsome but he was certainly not a man to sweep a young girl off her feet he was tall angular though broadshouldered with a long scrawny neck that rose out of a very low collar and a large head scantily covered with haira head that gave a physical as well as a mental effect of hardness his smoothshaven face seemed to bear witness that its owner was one who had pushed frugality to the borders of a vice it was not a pleasant face but now it wore an almost benign expression under the influence of miss cassandras eyes so intent apparently were both of them upon each other that they did not notice the group on the bench at the other side of the grove william wetherell ventured to ask jethro who the man was  nnames lovejoy said jethro  lovejoy ejaculated the storekeeper thinking of what mr merrill had told him of the opponents of the truro franchise bill president of the northwestern railroad  jethro gave his friend a shrewd look  ggettin postedhaint you will he said  is she going to marry that old man asked cynthia  jethro smiled a little gguess not said he gguess not if the old man can help it nobodys married him yet and haint likely to  jethro was unusually silent on the way back to the hotel but he did not seem to be worried or displeased he only broke his silence once in fact when cynthia called his attention to a large poster of some bloodhounds on a fence announcing the fact in red letters that uncle toms cabin would be given by a certain travelling company at the opera house the next evening  llike to go cynthy  oh uncle jethro do you think we can go  never ben to a showhev younever ben to a show  never in my life said cynthia  well all go said jethro and he repeated it once or twice as they came to main street seemingly greatly tickled at the prospect and there was the truro franchise bill hanging over him with only a week left of the session and lovejoys and duncans men sitting so tight in their seats william wetherell could not understand it     chapter xiv  half an hour later when mr wetherell knocked timidly at number 7drawn thither by an irresistible curiositythe door was opened by a portly person who wore a shining silk hat and ample gold watch chain the gentleman had in fact just arrived but he seemed perfectly at home as he laid down his hat on the marbletopped bureau mopped his face took a glass of iced water at a gulp chose a cigar and sank down gradually on the bed mr wetherell recognized him instantly as the father of the celebrated cassandra  well jethro said the gentleman ive got to come into the throne room once a day anyhow just to make sure you dont forget meeh  aalvy said jethro i want you to shake hands with a particular friend of mine mr will wetherell of coniston erwill the honorable alvy hopkins of gosport  mr hopkins rose from the bed as gradually as he had sunk down upon it and seized mr wetherells hand impressively his own was very moist  heard you was in town mr wetherell he said heartily if jethro calls you a particular friend it means something i guess it means something to me anyhow  will haint a politician said jethro eralvy  hello said mr hopkins  erwill dont talk  if jethro had been real tactful said the honorable alvy sinking down again hed have introduced me as the next governor of the state everybody knows i want to be governor everybody knows ive got twenty thousand dollars in the bank to pay for that privilege everybody knows im going to be governor if jethro says so  william wetherell was a little taken aback at this ingenuous statement of the gentleman from gosport he looked out of the window through the foliage of the park and his eye was caught by the monument there in front of the state house and he thought of the inscription on the base of it the peoples government the honorable alva had not mentioned the peopleundoubtedly  yes mr wetherell twenty thousand dollars he sighed time was when a man could be governor for ten those were the good old dayseh jethro  aalvy uncle toms cabins comin to town tomorrowtomorrow  you dont tell me said the honorable alva acquiescing cheerfully in the change of subject well go pleased to have you too mr wetherell  alvy said jethro again uncle toms cabin comes to town tomorrow  mr hopkins stopped fanning himself and glanced at jethro questioningly  aalvy that give you an idea said jethro mildly  mr wetherell looked blank it gave him no idea whatsoever except of little eva and the bloodhounds for a few moments the honorable alva appeared to be groping too and then his face began to crease into a smile of comprehension  by godfrey jethro but you are smart he exclaimed with involuntary tribute you mean buy up the theatre  ccallate youll find its bought up  you mean pay for it said mr hopkins  youve guessed it alvy youve guessed it  mr hopkins gazed at him in admiration leaned out of the perpendicular and promptly drew from his trousers pocket a roll of stupendous proportions wetting his thumb he began to push aside the top bills  how much is it he demanded  but jethro put up his hand  no hurry alvynno hurry hhonorable alvy hopkins of gosportppatron of the theatre haint the first time youve ben a patron alvy  jethro said mr hopkins solemnly putting up his money im much obliged to you im free to say id never have thought of it if you aint the allfiredest smartest man in america todayi dont except any even general grantthen i aint the next governor of this state  whereupon he lapsed into an even more expressive silence his face still glowing  eralvy said jethro presently whats the name of your gal  well said mr hopkins i guess youve got me we did christen her lily but she didnt turn out exactly lily she aint the type said mr hopkins slowly not without a note of regret and lapsed into silence  wwhat did you say her name was alvy  i guess her names cassandra said the honorable alva  ccassandry  well you see he explained a trifle apologetically shes kind of taken some matters in her own hands my gal didnt like lily and it didnt seem to fit her anyway so she called herself cassandra read it in a book it means inspirer of love or some such poetry but i dont deny that it goes with her better than lily would  shshes a good deal of a gal alvyfineappearin gal alvy  upon my word jethro i didnt know you ever looked at a woman but i suppose you couldnt help lookin at my galshe does seem to draw mens eyes as if she was magnetized some way mr hopkins did not speak as though this quality of his daughter gave him unmixed delight but shes a goodhearted gal cassy is highspirited and i wont deny shes handsome and smart  shell kind of grace my position when im governor but to tell you the truth jethro one old friend to another durned if i dont wish she was married its a terrible thing for a father to say i know but id feel easier about her if she was married to some good man who could hold her theres young joe turner in gosport hed give his soul to have her and hed do cassy says shes after bigger game than joe shes youngthats her only excuse funny thing happened night before last continued mr hopkins laughing lovejoy saw her and hes ben out of his head ever since al must be pretty near my age aint he well theres no fool like an old fool  aalvy introduce me to cassandry sometime will you  why certainly answered mr hopkins heartily ill bring her in here and now how about gettin an adjournment tomorrow night for uncle toms cabin these night sessions kind of interfere  half an hour later when the representatives were pouring into the rotunda for dinner a crowd was pressing thickly around the desk to read a placard pinned on the wall above it the placard announced the coming of mr glovers company for the following night and that the honorable alva hopkins of gosport exspeaker of the house had bought three hundred and twelve seats for the benefit of the members and the honorable alva himself very red in the face and almost smothered could be dimly discerned at the foot of the stairs trying to fight his way out of a group of overenthusiastic friends and admirers alvaso it was said on all sideswas doing the right thing  so it was that one sensation followed another at the capital and the politicians for the moment stopped buzzing over the truro franchise bill to discuss mr hopkins and his masterstroke the afternoon chronicle waxed enthusiastic on the subject of mr hopkinss generosity and predicted that when senator hartington made the motion in the upper house and mr jameson in the lower the general court would unanimously agree that there would be no evening session on the following day the honorable alva was the hero of the hour  that afternoon cynthia and her father walked through the green park to make their first visit to the state house they stood hand in hand on the cool marblepaved floor of the corridor gazing silently at the stained and battered battleflags behind the glass and wetherell seemed to be listening again to the appeal of a great president to a great country in the time of her dire needthe soul calling on the body to fight for itself wetherell seemed to feel again the thrill he felt when he saw the blueclad men of this state crowded in the train at boston and to hear again the cheers and the sobs and the prayers as he looked upon the blood that stained stars and stripes alike with a holy stain with that blood the country had been consecrated and the stateyes and the building where they stood so they went on up the stairs reverently nor heeded the noise of those in groups about them and through a door into the great hall of the representatives of the state  life is a mixture of emotions a jumble of joy and sorrow and reverence and mirth and flippancy of right feeling and heresy in the morning william wetherell had laughed at mr hopkins and the twenty thousand dollars he had put in the bank to defraud the people but now he could have wept over it and as he looked down upon the three hundred members of that house he wondered how many of them represented their neighbors who supposedly had sent them hereand how many mr lovejoys railroad mr worthingtons railroad or another mans railroad  but gradually he forgot the battleflags and his mood changed perhaps the sight of mr speaker sutton towering above the house the very essence and bulk of authority brought this about he aroused in wetherell unwilling admiration and envy when he arose to put a question in his deep voice or rapped sternly with his gavel to silence the tumult of voices that arose from time to time or while some member was speaking or the clerk was reading a bill at breathless speed he turned with wonderful nonchalance to listen to the conversation of the gentlemen on the bench beside him smiled nodded pulled his whiskers at once conscious and unconscious of his high position and most remarkable of all to the storekeeper not a man of the three hundred however obscure could rise that the speaker did not instantly call him by name  william wetherell was occupied by such reflections as these when suddenly there fell a hush through the house the clerk had stopped reading the speaker had stopped conversing and seizing his gavel looked expectantly over the heads of the members and nodded a sleek comfortably dressed mail arose smilingly in the middle of the house and subdued laughter rippled from seat to seat as he addressed the chair  mr jameson of wantage  mr jameson cleared his throat impressively and looked smilingly about him  mr speaker and gentlemen of the house he said if i desired to arouse the enthusiasmthe just enthusiasmof any gathering in this house or in this city or in this state i should mention the name of the honorable alva hopkins of gosport i think i am right  mr jameson was interrupted as he no doubt expected by applause from floor and gallery he stood rubbing his hands together and it seemed to william wetherell that the speaker did not rap as sharply with his gavel as he had upon other occasions  gentlemen of the house continued mr jameson presently the honorable alva hopkins whom we all know and love has with unparalleled generosityunparalleled i saybought up three hundred and twelve seats in fosters opera house for tomorrow night renewed applause in order that every member of this august body may have the opportunity to witness that most classic of histrionic productions uncle toms cabin loud applause causing the speaker to rap sharply that we may show a proper appreciation of this complimenti move you mr speaker that the house adjourn not later than six oclock tomorrow wednesday evening not to meet again until thursday morning  mr jameson of wantage handed the resolution to a page and sat down amidst renewed applause mr wetherell noticed that many members turned in their seats as they clapped and glancing along the gallery he caught a flash of red and perceived the radiant miss cassandra herself leaning over the rail her hands clasped in ecstasy mr lovejoy was not with herhe evidently preferred to pay his attentions in private  there she is again whispered cynthia who had taken an instinctive and extraordinary dislike to miss cassandra then mr sutton rose majestically to put the question  gentlemen are you ready for the question he cried all those in favor of the resolution of the gentleman from wantage mr jameson the speaker stopped abruptly the legislators in the front seats swung around and people in the gallery craned forward to see a member standing at his seat in the extreme rear of the hall he was a little man in an illfitting coat his wizened face cleanshaven save for the broomshaped beard under his chin which he now held in his hand his thin nasal voice was somehow absurdly penetrating as he addressed the chair mr sutton was apparently for once taken by surprise and stared a moment as though racking his brain for the name  the gentleman from suffolk mr heath he said and smiling a little sat down  the gentleman from suffolk still holding on to his beard pitched in without preamble  we farmers on the back seats dont often get a chance to be heard mr speaker said he amidst a general tittering from the front seats we come down here without any larnin of parlimentry law and before we know whats happened the sessions over and we haint said nothin more laughter theres ben a good many times when i wanted to say somethin and this time i made up my mind i was agoin tolaw or no law  applause and a general show of interest in the gentleman from suffolk naow mr speaker i haint agin uncle toms cabin its a good play and its done an almighty lot of good and i haint sayin nothin agin alvy hopkins nor his munificence but i do know theres a sight of little bills on that desk that wont be passed if we dont set tomorrow nightlittle bills that are big bills for us farmers that thar woodchuck bill for one laughter my constituents want i should have that bill passed we dont need a quorum for them bills but we need time naow mr speaker i say let all them that wants to go and see uncle toms cabin go and see it but let a few of us fellers that has woodchuck bills and other things that weve got to get through come down here and pass em you kin put em on the docket and i guess if anything comes along that haint jest right for everybody somebody can challenge a quorum and bust up the session thats all  the gentleman from suffolk sat down amidst thunderous applause and before it died away mr jameson was on his feet smiling and rubbing his hands together and was recognized  mr speaker he said as soon as he could be heard if the gentleman from suffolk desires to pass woodchuck bills renewed laughter he can do so as far as im concerned i guess i know where most of the members of this house will be tomorrow night cries of youre right and sharp rapping of the gavel mr speaker i withdraw my resolution  the gentleman from wantage said the speaker smiling broadly now withdraws his resolution  as william wetherell was returning to the pelican house pondering over this incident he almost ran into a distinguishedlooking man walking briskly across main street  it was mr worthington said cynthia looking after him  but mr worthington had a worried look on his face and was probably too much engrossed in his own thoughts to notice his acquaintances he had in fact just come from the throne room where he had been to remind jethro that the session was almost over and to ask him what he meant to do about the truro bill jethro had given him no satisfaction  duncan and lovejoy have their people paid to sit there night and day mr worthington had said weve got a bare majority on a full house but you dont seem to dare to risk it what are you going to do about it mr bass  wwant the bill to passdont you  certainly mr worthington had cried on the edge of losing his temper  lleft it to medidnt you  yes but im entitled to know whats being done im paying for it  hhaint paid for it yethev you  no i most assuredly havent  bbetter wait till you do  there was very little satisfaction in this and mr worthington had at length been compelled to depart fuming to the house of his friend the enemy mr duncan there to attempt for the twentieth time to persuade mr duncan to call off his dogs who were sitting with such praiseworthy pertinacity in their seats as the two friends walked on the lawn mr worthington tried to explain likewise for the twentieth time that the extension of the truro railroad could in no way lessen the canadian traffic of the central mr duncans road but mr duncan could not see it that way and stuck to his present ally mr lovejoy and refused pointblank to call off his dogs business was business  it is an apparently inexplicable fact however that mr worthington and his son bob were guests at the duncan mansion at the capital two countries may not be allies but their sovereigns may be friends in the present instance mr duncan and mr worthingtons railroads were opposed diplomatically but another year might see the truro railroad and the central acting as one and mr worthington had no intention whatever of sacrificing mr duncans friendship the first citizen of brampton possessed one quality so essential to greatnessthat of looking into the future and he believed that the time would come when an event of some importance might create a perpetual alliance between himself and mr duncan in short mr duncan had a daughter janet and mr worthington as we know had a son and mr duncan in addition to his own fortune had married one of the richest heiresses in new england prudens futuri that was mr worthingtons motto  the next morning cynthia who was walking about the town alone found herself gazing over a picket fence at a great square house with a very wide cornice that stood by itself in the centre of a shadeflecked lawn there were masses of shrubbery here and there and a greenhouse and a latticed summerhouse and cynthia was wondering what it would be like to live in a great place like that when a barouche with two shining horses in silver harness drove past her and stopped before the gate four or five girls and boys came laughing out on the porch and one of them who held a fishingrod in his hand cynthia recognized startled and ashamed she began to walk on as fast as she could in the opposite direction when she heard the sound of footsteps on the lawn behind her and her own name called in a familiar voice at that she hurried the faster but she could not run and the picket fence was half a block long and bob worthington had an advantage over her of course it was bob and he did not scruple to run and in a few seconds he was leaning over the fence in front of her now cynthia was as red as a peony by this time and she almost hated him  well of all people cynthia wetherell he cried didnt you hear me calling after you  yes said cynthia  why didnt you stop  i didnt want to said cynthia glancing at the distant group on the porch who were watching them suddenly she turned to him defiantly i didnt know you were in that house or in the capital she said  and i didnt know you were said bob upon whose masculine intelligence the meaning of her words was entirely lost if i had known it you can bet i would have looked you up where are you staying  at the pelican house  what said bob with all the politicians how did you happen to go there  mr bass asked my father and me to come down for a few days answered cynthia her color heightening again life is full of contrasts and cynthia was becoming aware of some of them  uncle jethro said bob  yes uncle jethro said cynthia smiling in spite of herself he always made her smile  uncle jethro owns the pelican house said bob  does he i knew he was a great man but i didnt know how great he was until i came down here  cynthia said this so innocently that bob repented his flippancy on the spot he had heard occasional remarks of his elders about jethro  i didnt mean quite that he said growing red in his turn uncle jethromr bassis a great man of course thats what i meant  and hes a very good man said cynthia who understood now that he had spoken a little lightly of jethro and resented it  im sure of it said bob eagerly then cynthia began to walk on slowly and he followed her on the other side of the fence hold on he cried i havent said half the things i want to sayyet  what do you want to say asked cynthia still walking i have to go  oh no you dont wait just a minutewont you  cynthia halted with apparent unwillingness and put out her toe between the pickets then she saw that there was a little patch on that toe and drew it in again  what do you want to say she repeated i dont believe you have anything to say at all and suddenly she flashed a look at him that made his heart thump  i doi swear i do he protested im coming down to the pelican tomorrow morning to get you to go for a walk  cynthia could not but think that the remoteness of the time he set was scarce in keeping with his ardent tone  i have something else to do tomorrow morning she answered  then ill come tomorrow afternoon said bob instantly  who lives here she asked irrelevantly  mr duncan im visiting the duncans  at this moment a carryall joined the carriage at the gate cynthia glanced at the porch again the group there had gown larger and they were still staring she began to feel uncomfortable again and moved on slowly  maynt i come asked bob going after her and scraping the butt of the rod along the palings  arent there enough girls here to satisfy you asked cynthia  theyre enoughyes he said but none of em could hold a candle to you  cynthia laughed outright  i believe you tell them all something like that she said  i dont do any such thing he retorted and then he laughed himself and cynthia laughed again  i like you because you dont swallow everything whole said bob andwell for a good many other reams and he looked into her face with such frank admiration that cynthia blushed and turned away  i dont believe a word you say she answered and started to walk off this time in earnest  hold on cried bob they were almost at the end of the fence by this and the pickets were sharp and rather high or he would have climbed them  cynthia paused hesitatingly  ill come at two oclock tomorrow said he were going on a picnic today to daltons bend on the river i wish i could get out of it  just then there came a voice from the gateway  bob bob worthington  they both turned involuntarily a slender girl with light brown hair was standing there waving at him  whos that asked cynthia  that said bob in some confusion oh thats janet duncan  goodby said cynthia  im coming tomorrow he called after her but she did not turn in a little while she heard the carryall behind her clattering down the street its passengers laughing and joking merrily her face burned for she thought that they were laughing at her she wished with all her heart that she had not stopped to talk with him at the palings the girls indeed were giggling as the carryall passed and she heard somebody call out his name but nevertheless he leaned out of the seat and waved his hat at her amid a shout of laughter poor cynthia she did not look at him tears of vexation were in her eyes and the light of her joy at this visit to the capital flickered and she wished she were back in coniston she thought it would be very nice to be rich and to live in a great house in a city and to go on picnics  the light flickered but it did not wholly go out if it has not been shown that cynthia was endowed with a fair amount of sense many of these pages have been written in vain she sat down for a while in the park and thought of the many things she had to be thankful fornot the least of which was jethros kindness and she remembered that she was to see uncle toms cabin that evening  such are the joys and sorrows of fifteen     chapter xv  mr amos cuthbert named it soour old friend amos who lives high up in the ether of towns end ridge and who now represents coniston in the legislature he is the same silent sallow person as when jethro first took a mortgage on his farm only his skin is beginning to resemble dried parchment and he is a trifle more cantankerous on the morning of that memorable day when uncle toms cabin came to the capital amos had entered the throne room and given vent to his feelings in regard to the gentleman in the back seat who had demanded an evening sitting on behalf of the farmers  dont that beat all cried amos let them have their darned woodchuck session there wont nobody go to it for cussed crisscross contrariness give me a mossback democrat from a oneboss oneman town like suffolk im agoin to see the show  ggoin to the show be you amos said jethro  yes i be answered amos bitterly i haint agoin nigh the house tonight and with this declaration he departed  i wonder if he really is going queried mr merrill looking at the ceiling and then he laughed  why shouldnt he go asked william wetherell  mr merrills answer to this question was a wink whereupon he too departed and while wetherell was pondering over the possible meaning of these words the honorable alva hopkins entered wreathed in smiles and closed the door behind him  its all fixed he said taking a seat near jethro in the window  sseen your galalvyseen your gal  mr hopkins gave a glance at wetherell  will dont talk said jethro and resumed his inspection through the lace curtains of what was going on in the street  cassandrys got him to go said mr hopkins its all fixed as sure as sunday if it misses fire then ill never mention the governorship again but if it dont miss fire and the honorable alva leaned over and put his hand on jethros knee if it dont miss fire i get the nomination is that right  yyouve guessed it alvy  thats all i want to know declared the honorable alva when you say that much you never go back on it and you can go ahead and give the orders jethro i have to see that the boys get the tickets cassandrys got a head on her shoulders and she kind of wants to be governor too he got as far as the door when he turned and bestowed upon jethro a glance of undoubted tribute youve done a good many smart things said he but i guess you never beat this and never will  hhaint done it yet alvy answered jethro still looking out through the window curtains at the ever ganging groups of gentlemen in the street these groups had a never ceasing interest for jethro bass  mr wetherell didnt talk but had he been the most incurable of gossips he felt that he could have done no damage to this mysterious affair whatever it was in a certain event mr hopkins was promised the governorship so much was plain and it was also evident that miss cassandra hopkins was in some way to be instrumental william wetherell did not like to ask jethro but he thought a little of sounding mr merrill and then he came to the conclusion that it would be wiser for him not to know  erwill said jethro presently you know heth suttonspeaker heth sutton  yes  erwouldnt mind askin him to step in and see me before the sessionif he was comin bywould you  certainly not  erif he was comin by said jethro  mr wetherell found mr speaker sutton glued to a pillar in the rotunda below he had some difficulty in breaking through the throng that pressed around him and still more in attracting his attention as mr sutton took no manner of notice of the customary form of placing ones hand under his elbow and pressing gently up summoning up his courage mr wetherell tried the second method of seizing him by the buttonhole he paused in his harangue one hand uplifted and turned and glanced at the storekeeper abstractedly  mr bass asked me to tell you to drop into number 7 said wetherell and added remembering express instructions if you were going by  wetherell had not anticipated the magical effect this usual message would have on mr sutton nor had he thought that so large and dignified a body would move so rapidly before the astonished gentlemen who had penned him could draw a breath mr sutton had reached the stairway and was mounting it with an agility that did him credit five minutes later wetherell saw the speaker descending again the usually impressive quality of his face slightly modified by the twitching of a smile  thus the day passed and the gentlemen of the lovejoy and duncan factions sat as tight as ever in their seats and the truro franchise bill still slumbered undisturbed in mr chauncey weeds committee  at supper there was a decided festal air about the dining room of the pelican house the little band of agricultural gentlemen who wished to have a session not being patrons of that exclusive hotel many of the solons had sent home for their wives that they might do the utmost justice to the honorable alvas hospitality even jethro as he ate his crackers and milk had a new coat with bright brass buttons and cynthia who wore a fresh gingham which miss sukey kittredge of coniston had helped to design so far relented in deference to jethros taste as to tie a red bow at her throat  the middle table under the chandelier was the immediate firmament of miss cassandra hopkins and there beside the future governor sat the president of the northwestern railroad mr lovejoy as the chief of the revolving satellites people began to say that mr lovejoy was hooked at last now that he had lost his head in such an unaccountable fashion as to pay his court in public and it was very generally known that he was to make one of the honorable alvas immediate party at the performance of uncle tams cabin  mr speaker sutton of course would have to forego the pleasure of the theatre as a penalty of his high position mr merrill who sat at jethros table next to cynthia that evening did a great deal of joking with the honorable heth about having to preside aver a woodchuck session which the speaker so mr wetherell thought took in astonishingly good part and seemed very willing to make the great sacrifice which his duty required of him  after supper mr wetherell took a seat in the rotunda as an observer of human nature he had begun to find a fascination in watching the group of politicians there first of all he encountered mr amos cuthbert his little coalblack eyes burning brightly and he was looking very irritable indeed  so youre going to the show amos remarked the storekeeper with an attempt at cordiality  to his bewilderment amos turned upon him fiercely  who said i was going to the show he snapped  you yourself told me  youd ought to know whether im agoin or not said amos and walked away  while mr wetherell sat meditating upon this inexplicable retort a retired scholarly looking gentleman with a white beard who wore spectacles came out of the door leading from the barber shop and quietly took a seat beside him the storekeepers attention was next distracted by the sight of one who wandered slowly but ceaselessly from group to group kicking up his heels behind and halting always in the rear of the speakers needless to say that this was our friend mr bijah bixby who was following out his celebrated tactics of going along by when they were talkin sly suddenly mr bixbys eye alighted on mr wetherell who by a stretch of imagination conceived that it expressed both astonishment and approval although he was wholly at a loss to understand these sentiments mr bixby winkedmr wetherell was sure of that but to his surprise bijah did not pause in his rounds to greet him  mr wetherell was beginning to be decidedly uneasy and was about to go upstairs when mr merrill came down the rotunda whistling with his hands in his pockets he stopped whistling when he spied the storekeeper and approached him in his usual hearty manner  well well this is fortunate said mr merrill how are you duncan i want you to know mr wetherell wetherell writes that weekly letter for the guardian you were speaking to me about last year will this is mr alexander duncan president of the central  how do you do mr wetherell said the scholarly gentleman with the spectacles putting out his hand im glad to meet you very glad indeed i read your letters with the greatest pleasure  mr wetherell as he took mr duncans hand had a variety of emotions which may be imagined and need not be set down in particular  funny thing mr merrill continued i was looking for you duncan it occurred to me that you would like to meet mr wetherell i was afraid you were in boston  i have just got back said mr duncan  i wanted wetherell to see your library i was telling him about it  i should be delighted to show it to him answered mr duncan that library as is well known was a special weakness of mr duncans  poor william wetherell who was quite overwhelmed by the fact that the great mr duncan had actually read his letters and liked them could scarcely utter a sensible word almost before he realized what had happened he was following mr duncan out of the pelican house when the storekeeper was mystified once more by a nudge and another wink from mr bixby conveying unbounded admiration  why dont you write a book mr wetherell inquired the railroad president when they were crossing the park  i dont think i could do it said mr wetherell modestly such incense was overpowering and he immediately forgot mr bixby  yes you can said mr duncan only you dont know it take your letters for a beginning you can draw people well enough when you try there was your description of the lonely hillfarm on the spuri shall always remember that the gaunt farmer toiling every minute between sun and sun the thin patient woman bending to a task that never charged or lightened the children growing up and leaving one by one some to the cities some to the west until the old people are left alone in the evening of lifeto the sunsets and the storms of course you must write a book  mr duncan quoted other letters and william wetherell thrilled poor man he had had little enough incense in his time and none at all from the great they came to the big square house with the cornice which cynthia had seen the day before and walked across the lawn through the open door william wetherell had a glimpse of a great drawingroom with high windows out of which was wafted the sound of a piano and of youthful voice and laughter and then he was in the library the thought of one man owning all those books overpowered him there they were in stately rows from the floor to the high ceiling and a portable ladder with which to reach them  mr duncan understanding perhaps something of the storekeepers embarrassment proceeded to take down his treasures first editions from the shelves and folios and mistrals from drawers in a great iron safe in one corner and laid them on the mahogany desk it was the railroad presidents hobby and could he find an appreciative guest he was happy it need scarcely be said that he found william wetherell appreciative and possessed of knowledge of shaksperiana and other matters that astonished his host as well as pleased him for wetherell had found his tongue at last  after a while mr duncan drew out his watch and gave a start  by george he exclaimed its after eight oclock ill have to ask you to excuse me tonight mr wetherell id like to show you the rest of themcant you come around tomorrow afternoon  mr wetherell who had forgotten his own engagement and uncle toms cabin said he would be happy to come and they went out together and began to walk toward the state house  it isnt often i find a man who knows anything at all about these things continued mr duncan whose heart was quite won why do you bury yourself in coniston  i went there from briton for my health said the storekeeper  jethro bass lives there doesnt he said mr duncan with a laugh but i suppose you dont know anything about politics  i know nothing at all said mr wetherell which was quite true he had been in dreamland but now the fact struck him again with something of a shock that this mildmannered gentleman was one of those who had been paying certain legislators to remain in their seats wetherell thought of speaking to mr duncan of his friendship with jethro bass but the occasion passed  i wish to heaven i didnt have to know anything about politics mr duncan was saying they disgust me theres a little matter on now about an extension of the truro railroad to harwich which wouldnt interest you but you cant conceive what a nuisance it has been to watch that house day and night as ive had to its no joke to have that townsman of yours jethro bass opposed to you i wont say anything against him for he many be a friend of yours and i have to use him sometimes myself mr duncan sighed its all very sordid and annoying now this evening for instance when we might have enjoyed ourselves with those books ive got to go to the house just because some backwoods farmers want to talk about woodchucks i suppose its foolish said mr duncan but bass has tricked us so often that ive got into the habit of being watchful i should have been here twenty minutes ago  by this time they had come to the entrance of the state house and wetherell followed mr duncan in to have a look at the woodchuck session himself several members hurried by and up the stairs some of them in their sunday black and the lobby above seemed even to the storekeepers unpractised eye a trifle active for a woodchuck session mr duncan muttered something and quickened his gait a little on the steps that led to the gallery this place was almost empty they went down to the rail and the railroad president cast his eye over the house  good god he said sharply theres almost a quorum here he ran his eye over the members there is a quorum here  mr duncan stood drumming nervously with his fingers on the rail scanning the heads below the members were scattered far and wide through the seats like an army in open order listening in silence to the droning voice of the clerk moths burned in the gas flames and june bugs hummed in at the high windows and tilted against the walls then mr duncans finger nails whitened as his thin hands clutched the rail and a sense of a pending event was upon wetherell slowly he realized that he was listening to the speakers deep voice  the committee on corporations to whom was referred house bill number 109 entitled an act to extend the truro railroad to harwich having considered the same report the same with the following resolution resolved that the bill ought to pass chauncey weed for the committee  the truro franchise the lights danced and even a sudden weakness came upon the storekeeper jethros trick the duncan and lovejoy representatives in the theatre the adherents of the bill here wetherell saw mr duncan beside him a tense figure leaning on the rail calling to some one below a man darted up the centre another up the side aisle then mr duncan flashed at william wetherell from his blue eye such a look of anger as the storekeeper never forgot and he too was gone tingling and perspiring wetherell leaned out over the railing as the speaker rapped calmly for order hysteric laughter mingled with hoarse cries ran over the house but the honorable heth sutton did not even smile  a dozen members were on their feet shouting to the chair one was recognized and that man wetherell perceived with amazement to be mr jameson of wantage adherent of jethroshe who had moved to adjourn for uncle toms cabin a score of members crowded into the aisles but the speakers voice again rose above the tumult  the doorkeepers will close the doors mr jameson of wantage moves that the report of the committee be accepted and on this motion a rollcall is ordered  the doorkeepers who must have been inspired had already slammed the doors in the faces of those seeking wildly to escape the clerk already had the little shortlegged desk before him and was calling the roll with incredible rapidity bewildered and excited as wetherell was and knowing as little of parliamentary law as the gentleman who had proposed the woodchuck session he began to form some sort of a notion of jethros generalship and he saw that the innocent rural members who belonged to duncan and lovejoys faction had tried to get away before the rollcall destroy the quorum and so adjourn the house these needless to say were not parliamentarians either they had lacked a leader they were stunned by the suddenness of the onslaught and had not moved quickly enough like trapped animals they wandered blindly about for a few moments and then sank down anywhere each answered the rollcall sullenly out of necessity for every one of them was a marked man then wetherell remembered the two members who had escaped and mr duncan and fell to calculating how long it would take these to reach fosters opera house break into the middle of an act and get out enough partisans to come back and kill the bill mr wetherell began to wish he could witness the scene there too but something held him here shaking with excitement listening to each name that the clerk called  would the people at the theatre get back in time  despite william wetherells principles whatever these may have been he was so carried away that he found himself with his watch in his hand counting off the minutes as the rollcall went on fosters opera house was some six squares distant and by a liberal estimate mr duncan and his advance guard ought to get back within twenty minutes of the time he left wetherell was not aware that people were coming into the gallery behind him he was not aware that one sat at his elbow until a familiar voice spoke directly into his ear  erwillheld duncan pretty tightdidnt you hes a hard one to fool too never suspected a mite did he look out for your watch  mr bixby seized it or it would have fallen if his life had depended on it william wetherell could not have spoken a word to mr bixby then  you done well will sure enough that gentleman continued to whisper and alvys gal done well tooyou understand i guess shes the only one that ever snarled up al lovejoy so that he didnt know where he was at but it took a fine delicate touch for her job and yours will godfrey this is the quickest rollcall i ever seed theyve got halfway through truro county that fellow can talk faster than a sideshow ticketseller at a circus  the clerk was indeed performing prodigies of pronunciation when he reached wells county the last mr bixby so far lost his habitual sang froid as to hammer on the rail with his fist  if there haint a quorum were done for he said how much time has gone away twenty minutes godfrey some of em may break loose and git here is five minutes  break loose wetherell exclaimed involuntarily  mr bixby screwed up his face  you understand accidents is liable to happen  mr wetherell didnt understand in the least but just then the clerk reached the last name on the roll an instant of absolute silence save for the junebugs followed while the assistant clerk ran over his figures deftly and handed them to mr sutton who leaned forward to receive them  one hundred and twelve gentlemen have voted in the affirmative and fortyeight in the negative and the report of the committee is accepted  ten moren a quorum ejaculated mr bixby in a voice of thanksgiving as the turmoil below began again it seemed as though every man in the opposition was on his feet and yelling at the chair some to adjourn some to indefinitely postpone some demanding rollcalls others swearing at thesefor a division vote would have opened the doors others tried to get out and then ran down the aisles and called fiercely on the speaker to open the doors and threatened him but the honorable heth sutton did not lose his head and it may be doubted whether he ever appeared to better advantage than at that moment he had a voice like one of the clovelly bulls that fed in his own pastures in the valley and by sheer bellowing he got silence or something approaching itthe protests dying down to a hum had recognised another friend of the bill and was putting another question  mr gibbs of wareham moves that the rules of the house be so far suspended that this bill be read a second and third time by its title and be put upon its final passage at this time and on this motion thundered mr sutton above the tide of rising voices the yeas and nays are called for the doorkeepers will keep the doors shut  abbey of ashburton  the nimble clerk had begun on the roll almost before the speaker was through and checked off the name bijah bixby mopped his brow with a blue pockethandkerchief  my god he said what a risk jethros took they cant git through another rollcall jest look at heth aint he carryin it magnificent haint as ruffled as i be ive knowed him ever sence he wahnt no highern that desk never would have ben in politics if it hadnt ben for me funny thing willyou and i was so excited we never thought to look at the clock put up your watch godfrey whats this  the noise of many feet was heard behind them men and women were crowding breathlessly into the gallery  didnt take it long to git noised araound said mr bixby say will theyre bound to have got at em in the theatre dont see how they held em off ccussed if i do  the seconds ticked into minutes the air became stifling for now the front of the gallery was packed now if ever the fate of the truro franchise hung in the balance and perhaps the rule of jethro bass and now as in the distance came a faint indefinable stir not yet to be identified by wetherells ears as a sound but registered somewhere in his brain as a warning note bijah bixby as sensitive as he straightened up to listen and then the whispering was hushed the members below raised their heads and some clutched the seats in front of them and looked up at the high windows only the speaker sat like a wax statue of himself and glanced neither to the right nor to the left  harkness of truro said the clerk  hes almost to wells county again whispered bijah excitedly i didnt callate he could do it will  yes  willyou hear somethin  a distant shout floated with the night breeze in at the windows a man on the floor got to his feet and stood straining a commotion was going on at the back of the gallery and a voice was heard crying out  for the love of god let me through  then wetherell turned to see the crowd at the back parting a little to see a desperate man in a gorgeous white necktie fighting his way toward the rail he wore no hat his collar was wilted and his normally ashen face had turned white and strangest of all clutched tightly in his hand was a pink ribbon  its al lovejoy said bijah laconically  unmindful of the awestricken stares he got from those about him when his identity became known mr lovejoy gained the rail and shoved aside a man who was actually making way for him leaning far out he scanned the house with inarticulate rage while the rollcall went monotonously on some of the members looked up at him and laughed others began to make frantic signs indicative of helplessness still others telegraphed him obvious advice about reenforcements which if anything increased his fury mr bixby was now fanning himself with the blue handkerchief  i hear em he said i hear em will  and he did the unmistakable hum of the voices of many men and the sound of feet on stone flagging shook the silent night without the clerk read off the last name on the roll  tompkins of ulster  his assistant lost no time now a mistake would have been fatal but he was an old hand unmindful of the rumble on the wooden stairs below mr sutton took the list with an admirable deliberation  one hundred and twelve gentlemen have voted in the affirmative fortyeight in the negative the rules of the house are suspended and the clerk having twice mumbled the title of the bill the question is shall the bill pass as many as are of opinion that the bill pass will say aye contrary minded no  feet were in the house corridor now and voices rising there and noises that must have been scufflingyes and beating of door panels almost every member was standing and it seemed as if they were all shoutingpersonal privilege fraud trickery open the doors bijah was slowly squeezing the blood out of william wetherells arm  the doorkeepers has the keys in their pockets mr bixby had to shout for once  even then the speaker did not flinch by a seeming miracle he got a semblance of order recognized his man and his great voice rang through the hall and drowned all other sounds  and on this question a rollcall is ordered the doorkeepers will close the doors  then as in reaction the gallery trembled with a roar of laughter but mr sutton did not smile the clerk scratched off the names with lightning rapidity scarce waiting for the answers every mans color was known and it was against the rules to be present and fail to vote the noise in the corridors grew louder some one dealt a smashing kick on a panel and wetherell ventured to ask mr bixby if he thought the doors would hold  they can break in all theyve a mind to now he chuckled the truro franchise is safe  what do you mean wetherell demanded excitedly  if a member haint present when a question is put he cant git into a rollcall said bijah  the fact that the day was lost was evidently brought home to those below for the strife subsided gradually and finally ceased altogether the whispers in the gallery died down the spectators relayed a little lovejoy alone remained tense though he had seated himself on a bench and the hot anger in which he had come was now cooled into a vindictiveness that set the hard lines of his face even harder he still clutched the ribbon the last part of that famous rollcall was conducted so quietly that a stranger entering the house would have suspected nothing unusual it was finished in absolute silence  one hundred and twelve gentlemen have voted in the affirmative fortyeight in the negative and the bill passes the house will attend to the title of the bill  an act to extend the truro railroad to harwich said the clerk glibly  such will be the title of the bill unless otherwise ordered by the house said mr speaker sutton the doorkeepers will open the doors  somebody moved to adjourn the motion was carried and thus ended what has gone down to history as the woodchuck session pandemonium reigned one hundred and forty belated members fought their way in at the four entrances and mingled with them were lobbyists of all sorts and conditions residents and visitors to the capital men and women to whom the drama of uncle toms cabin was as nothing to that of the truro franchise bill it was a sight to look down upon fierce wrangles began in a score of places isolated personal remarks rose above the din but your new englander rarely comes to blows in other spots men with broad smiles seized others by the hands and shook them violently while mr speaker sutton seemed in danger of suffocation by his friends his enemies for the moment could get nowhere near him on this scene mr bijah bixby gazed with pardonable pleasure  guess there wahnt a mite of trouble about the river towns he said i had em in my pocket will lets amble round to the theatre we ought to git in two acts  william wetherell went there is no need to go into the psychology of the matter it may have been numbness it may have been temporary insanity caused by the excitement of the battle he had witnessed for his brain was in a whirl or mr bixby may have hypnotized him as they walked through the silent streets toward the opera house he listened perforce to mr bixbys comments upon some of the innumerable details which jethro had planned and quietly carried out while sitting in the window of the throne room a great light dawned on william wetherell but too late  jethros trusted lieutenants of whom needless to say mr bixby was one had been commanded to notify such of their supporters whose fidelity and secrecy could be absolutely depended upon to attend the woodchuck session and further to guard against surprise this order had not gone out until the last minute hence mr amos cuthberts conduct the seats of these members at the theatre had been filled by accommodating townspeople and visitors forestalling a possible vote on the morrow to recall and reconsider there remained some sixty members whose loyalty was unquestioned but whose reputation for discretion was not of the best so much for the parliamentary side of the affair which was a revelation of generalship and organization to william wetherell by the time he had grasped it they were come in view of the lights of fosters opera house and they perceived among a sprinkling of idlers a conspicuous and meditative gentleman leaning against a pillar he was ludicrously tall and ludicrously thin his hands were in his trousers pockets and the skirts of his sunday broadcloth coat hung down behind him awry one long foot was crossed over the other and rested on the point of the toe and his head was tilted to one side he had on the whole the appearance of a rather mournful stork mr bixby approached him gravely seized him by the lower shoulder and tilted him down until it was possible to speak into his ear the gentleman apparently did not resent this although he seemed in imminent danger of being upset  how be you peleg eryou know will  no said the gentleman  mr bixby seized mr wetherell under the elbow and addressed himself to the storekeepers ear  will i want you to shake hands with senator peleg hartington of brampton this is will wetherell pelegfrom conistonyou understand  the senator took one hand from his pocket  how be you he said mr bixby was once more pulling down on his shoulder  hhaow was it here he demanded  almighty funny answered senator hartington sadly and waved at the lobby there wahnt standin room in the place  jethro bass republican club come and packed the entrance explained mr bixby with a wink you understand will go on peleg  sidewalk and street too continued mr hartington slowly first come along ball of towles hollerin like blazes they crumpled him all up and lost him next come old man duncan himself  will kep duncan mr bixby interjected  that was wholly an accident exclaimed mr wetherell angrily  will wahnt born in the country said mr bixby  mr hartington bestowed on the storekeeper a mournful look and continued  never seed duncan sweatin before he didnt seem to grasp why the boys was there  didnt seem to understand put in mr bixby sympathetically  for gods sake gentlemen says he let me in the truro bill the truro bill haint in the theatre mr duncan says dan everett cussed if i didnt come near laughin thats uncle toms cabin mr duncan says dan youre a dam fool says duncan i didnt know he was profane make room for mr duncan says dan he wants to see the show im agoin to see you in jail for this everett says duncan they let him push in about half a rod and they swallowed him he was makin such a noise that they had to close the doors of the theatresos not to disturb the playactors  you understand said mr bixby to wetherell whereupon he gave another shake to mr hartington who had relapsed into a sort of funereal meditation  well resumed that personage there was some more come hollerin about the truro bill not many guess theyll all have to git their wimmenfolks to press their clothes tomorrow then duncan wanted to git out again but twant exactly convenient callated he was suffocatinseemed to need air little mite limp when he broke loose duncan was  the honorable peleg stopped again as if he were overcome by the recollection of mr duncans plight  ererpeleg  mr hartington started  whatd they dowhatd they do  do  howd they git notice to em  oh said mr hartington cussed if that wuhnt funny lets see where was i after awhile they went over tother side of the street talkin sly waitin for the act to end but goldarned if it ever did end  for once mr bixby didnt seem to understand  ddidnt end  no explained mr hartington seems they hitched a kind of nigger minstrel show right on to itbanjos and thingumajigs in front of the curtain while they was changin scenes and they hitched the second act right on to that nobody come out of the theatre at all funny notion wahnt it  mr bixbys face took on a look of extreme cunning he smiled broadly and poked mr wetherell in an extremely sensitive portion of his ribs on such occasions the nasal quality of bijahs voice seemed to grow  you see he said  know that little man gibbs dont ye inquired mr hartington  airley gibbs haint it runs a livery business daown to rutgers on lovejoys railroad replied mr bixby promptly i know him knew old man gibbs wells i do you mean cuss  this airleys smartwahnt quite smart enough though his bright idea come a little mite late hunted up old christy got the key to his law office right here in the duncan block went up through the skylight clumb down to the roof of randalls store next door shinned up the lightnin rod on tother side and stuck his head plump into the opery house window  i want to know ejaculated mr bixby  somethin terrible pathetic was goin on on the stage resumed mr hartington the folks didnt see him at firstthey was all cryin and everythin was still but airley wahnt affected as quick as he got his breath he hollered right out louds he could the truro bills up in the house boys were skun if you dont git thar quick then they tell me the lightnin rod give way anyhow he came down on randalls gravel roof considerable hard i take it  mr hartington apparently had an aggravating way of falling into mournful revery and of forgetting his subject mr bixby was forced to jog him again  yes they did he said they did they come out like the theatre was afire there was some delay in gettin to the street but not muchnot much all the republican clubs in the state couldnt have held em then and the profanity they used wahnt especially edifyin  pelegs a deaconyou understand said mr bixby say peleg where was al lovejoy  lovejoy come along with the first of em must have hurried somethey tell me he was settin way down in front alongside of alvy hopkinss gal and when airley hollered out she screeched and clutched on to al and al said somethin he hadnt ought to and tore off one of them pink gewgaws she was covered with he was the maddest man i ever see some of the club was crowded inside behind the seats standin up to see the show al was so anxious to git through he hit si dudley in the mouthinjured him some i guess pity wahnt it  si haint in politics you understand said mr bixby callate si paid to git in there didnt he peleg  callate he did assented senator hartington  a long and painful pause followed there seemed indeed nothing more to be said the sound of applause floated out of the opera house doors around which the remaining loiterers were clustered  goin in be you peleg inquired mr bixby  mr hartington shook his head  will and me had a notion to see somethin of the show said mr bixby almost apologetically i kep my ticket  well said mr hartington reflectively i guess youll find some of the show left that haint ben hurt much so far as i can ascertain  the next afternoon when mr isaac d worthington happened to be sitting alone in the office of the truro railroad at the capital there came a knock at the door and mr bijah bixby entered now incredible as it may seem mr worthington did not know mr bixbyor rather did not remember him mr worthington had not had at that time much of an experience in politics and he did not possess a very good memory for faces  mr bixby who had as we know a confidential and winning manner seated himself in a chair very close to mr worthingtonsomewhat to that gentlemans alarm how be you said bijah iive got a little bill hereyou understand  mr worthington didnt understand and he drew his chair away from mr bixbys  i dont know anything about it sir answered the president of the truro railroad indignantly this is neither the manner nor the place to present a bill i dont want to see it  mr bixby moved his chair up again callate you will want to see this bill mr worthington he insisted not at all abashed jethro bass sent ityou understandits engrossed  whereupon mr bixby drew from his capacious pocket a roll tied with white ribbon and pressed it into mr worthingtons hands it was the truro franchise bill  it is safe to say that mr worthington understood     chapter xvi  there are certain instruments used by scientists so delicate that they have to be wrapped in cotton wool and kept in ductless places and so sensitive that the slightest shock will derange them and there are certain souls which cannot stand the jars of lifesouls created to register thoughts and sentiments too fine for those of coarser construction such was the soul of the storekeeper of coniston whether or not he was one of those immortalized in the famous elegy it is not for us to say a celebrated poet who read the letters to the guardianat miss lucretia pennimans requesthas declared mr wetherell to have been a genius he wrote those letters as we know after he had piled his boxes and rolled his barrels into place after he had added up the columns in his ledger and recorded each week the small but ever increasing deficit which he owed to jethro bass could he have been removed from the barrels and the ledgers and the debts and the cares and the implications what might we have had from his pen that will never be known  we left him in the lobby of the opera house but he did not go in to see the final act of uncle toms cabin he made his way alone back to the hotel slipped in by a side entrance and went directly to his room where cynthia found him half an hour later seated by the open window in the dark  arent you well dad she asked anxiously why didnt you come to see the play  ii was detained cynthia he said yesi am well  she sat down beside him and felt his forehead and his hands and the events of the evening which were on her lips to tell him remained unspoken  you ought not to have left coniston she said the excitement is too much for you we will go back tomorrow  yes cynthia we will go back tomorrow  in the morning  on the early train said wetherell and now you must go to sleep  i am glad said cynthia as she kissed him good night i have enjoyed it here and i am grateful to uncle jethro for bringing us butbut i like coniston best  william wetherell could have slept but a few hours when he awoke the sparrows were twittering outside the fresh cool smells of the morning were coming in at his windows and the sunlight was just striking across the roofs through the green trees of the capitol park the remembrance of a certain incident of the night before crept into his mind and he got up and drew on his clothes and thrust his few belongings into the carpetbag and knocked on cynthias door she was already dressed and her eyes rested searchingly on his face  dad you arent well i know it she said  but he denied that he was not  her belongings were in a neat little bundle under her arm but when she went to put them in the bag she gave an exclamation knelt down took everything out that he had packed and folded each article over again with amazing quickness then she made a rapid survey of the room lest she had forgotten anything closed the bag and they went out and along the corridor but when wetherell turned to go down the stairs she stopped him  arent you going to say goodby to uncle jethro  ii would rather go on and get in the train cynthia he said jethro will understand  cynthia was worried but she did not care to leave him and she led him protesting into the dining room he had a sinking fear that they might meet jethro there but only a few bigboned countrymen were scattered about attended by sleepy waitresses lest cynthia might suspect how his head was throbbing wetherell tried bravely to eat his breakfast he did not know that she had gone out while they were waiting and written a note to jethro explaining that her father was ill and that they were going back to coniston after breakfast when they went to the desk the clerk stared at them in astonishment  going mr wetherell he exclaimed  i find that i have to get back stammered the storekeeper will you tell me the amount of my bill  judge bass gave me instructions that he would settle that  it is very kind of mr bass said wetherell but i prefer to pay it myself  the man hesitated  the judge will be very angry mr wetherell  kindly give me the bill  the clerk made it out and handed it over in silence wetherell had in his pocket the money from several contributions to the guardian and he paid him then they set out for the station bought their tickets and hurried past the sprinkling of people there the little train for truro was standing under the sheds the hissing steam from the locomotive rising perpendicular in the still air of the morning and soon they were settled in one of the straightbacked seats the car was almost empty for few people were going up that day and at length after what seemed an eternity of waiting they started and soon were in the country once more in that wonderful truro valley with its fruit trees and its clover scents with its sparkling stream that tumbled through the passes and mirrored between green meadowbanks the blue and white of the sky how hungrily they drank in the freshness of it  they reached truro village at eleven outside the little tavern there after dinner the green stage was drawn up and tom the driver cracked his long whip over the morgan leaders and they started swaying in the sand ruts and jolting over the great stones that cropped out of the road up they climbed through narrow ways in the forestways hedged with alder and fern and sumach and wild grape adorned with oxeye daisies and tiger lilies and the big purple flowers which they knew and loved so well they passed too wild lakes overhung with primeval trees where the iris and the waterlily grew among the fallen trunks and the waterfowl called to each other across the blue stretches and at length when the sun was beginning visibly to fall they came out into an open cut on the western side and saw again the long line of coniston once more against the sky  dad said cynthia as she gazed dont you love it better than any other place in the world  he did but he could not answer her  an hour later from the hilltops above isaac worthingtons mills they saw the terraced steeple of brampton church and soon the horses were standing with drooping heads and wet sides in front of mr shermans tavern in brampton street and lem hallowell his honest face aglow with joy was lifting cynthia out of the coach as if she were a bundle of feathers  upon my word he cried this is a little might sudden whats the matter with the capital will too wicked and sophisticated down thar to suit ye by this time wetherell too had reached the ground and as lem hallowell gazed into his face the laughter in his own died away and gave place to a look of concern dont wonder ye come back he said youre as white as mosess hoss  he isnt feeling very well lem said cynthia  jest tuckered thats all answered lem you git him right into the stage cynthy i wont be long hurry them things off tom he called and himself seized a huge crate from the back of the coach and flung it on his shoulder he had his cargo on in a jiffy clucked to his horses and they turned into the familiar road to coniston just as the sun was dipping behind the south end of the mountain  theyll be surprised some and disappointed some said lem cheerily they was kind of plannin a little celebration when you come back willyou and cynthy amandy hatch was agoin to bake a cake and the minister was callatin to say some word of welcome wahnt goin to be anything grandjest homelike but you was right to come if you was tuckered i guess cynthy fetched you rias he kep store and done it wellbriskern i ever see him rias was wait till i put some of them things back and make you more comfortable will  he moved a few parcels and packages from wetherells feet and glanced at cynthia as he did so the mountain cast its vast blue shadow over forest and pasture and above the pines the white mist was rising from coniston waterrising in strange shapes lems voice seemed to william wetherell to have given way to a worldwide silence in the midst of which he sought vainly for cynthia and the stage driver most extraordinary of all out of the silence and the void came the checkerpaned windows of the store at coniston then the store itself with the great oaks bending over it then the dear familiar facesmoses and amandy eph prescott limping toward them and little rias richardson in an apron with a scoop shovel in his hand and many others they were not smiling at the storekeepers returnthey looked very grave then somebody lifted him tenderly from the stage and said  dont you worry a mite cynthy jest tuckered thats all  william wetherell was just tuckered the great dr coles authority on pulmonary troubles who came all the way from boston could give no better verdict than that it was jethro bass who had induced dr coles to come to conistonmuch against the great mans inclination and to the detriment of his patients jethro who on receiving cynthias note had left the capital on the next train and had come to coniston and had at once gone to boston for the specialist  i do not know why i came said the famous physician to dr abraham rowell of tarleton i never shall know there is something about that man jethro bass which compels you to do his will he has a most extraordinary personality is this storekeeper a great friend of his  the only intimate friend he had in the world answered dr rowell none of us could ever understand it and as for the girl jethro bass worships her  if nursing could cure him id trust her to do it shes a naturalborn nurse  the two physicians were talking in low tones in the little garden behind the store when jethro came out of the doorway  he looks as if he were suffering too said the boston physician and he walked toward jethro and laid a hand upon his shoulders i give him until winter my friend said dr coles  jethro bass sat down on the doorstepon that same millstone where he had talked with cynthia many years beforeand was silent for a long while the doctor was used to scenes of sorrow but the sight of this mans suffering unnerved him and he turned from it  ddoctor said jethro at last  the doctor turned again yes he said  ddoctorif wetherell hadnt ben to the capital would he have livedif he hadnt been to the capital  my friend said dr coles if mr wetherell had always lived in a warm house and had always been well fed and helped over the rough places and shielded from the storms he might have lived longer it is a marvel to me that he has lived so long  and then the doctor went way back to boston many times in his long professional life had the veil been lifted for hima little but as he sat in the train he said to himself that in this visit to the hamlet of coniston he had had the strangest glimpse of all william wetherell rallied as dr coles had predicted from that first sharp attack and one morning they brought up a reclining chair which belonged to mr satterlee the minister and set it in the window there in the still days of the early autumn wetherell looked down upon the garden he had grown to love and listened to the song of coniston water there cynthia who had scarcely left his side read to him from keats and shelley and tennysonyet the thought grew on her that he did not seem to hear even that wonderful passage of miltons beginning so sinks the daystar in the ocean bed which he always used to beg her to repeat did not seem to move him now  the neighbors came and sat with him but he would not often speak cheery lem hallowell and his wife and cousin ephraim to talk about the war hobbling slowly up the stairsfor rheumatism had been added to that trouble of the wilderness bullet now and ephraim was getting along in years and rias richardson stole up in his carpet slippers and moses after his chores were done and amandy with her cakes and delicacies which he left untouchedthough amandy never knew it yes and jethro came day by day he would come silently into the room and sit silently for a space and go as silently out of it the farms were neglected now on thousand acre hill william wetherell would take his hand and speak to him but do no more than that  there were times when cynthia leaned over him listening as he breathed to know whether he slept or were awake if he were not sleeping he would speak her name he repeated it often in those days as though the sound of it gave him comfort and he would fall asleep with it on his lips holding her hand and thinking perhaps of that other cynthia who had tended and nursed and shielded him in other days then she would steal down the stairs to jethro on the doorstep to jethro who would sit there for hours at a time to the wonder and awe of his neighbors although they knew that he loved the storekeeper as he loved no other man his was a grief that they could not understand  cynthia used to go to jethro in the garden sorrow had brought them very near together and though she had loved him before now he had become her reliance and her refuge the first time cynthia saw him when the worst of the illness had passed and the strange and terrifying apathy had come she had hidden her head on his shoulder and wept there jethro kept that coat with the tear stains on it to his dying day and never wore it again  sometimessometimes i think if he hadnt gone to the capital cynthy this mightnt hev come he said to her once  but the doctor said that didnt matter uncle jethro she answered trying to comfort him she too believed that something had happened at the capital  nnever spoke to you about anything therennever spoke to you cynthia  no never she said hehe hardly speaks at all uncle jethro  one bright morning after the sun had driven away the frost when the sumacs and maples beside coniston water were aflame with red bias richardson came stealing up the stairs and whispered something to cynthia  dad she said laying down her book its mr merrill will you see him  william wetherell gave her a great fright he started up from his pillows and seized her wrist with a strength which she had not thought remained in his fingers  mr merrill he criedmr merrill here  yes answered cynthia agitatedly hes downstairsin the store  ask him to come up said wetherell sinking back again ask him to come up  cynthia as she stood in the passage was of two minds about it she was thoroughly frightened and went first to the garden to ask jethros advice but jethro so milly skinner said had gone off half an hour before and did not know that mr merrill had arrived cynthia went back again to her father  wheres mr merrill asked wetherell  dad do you think you ought to see him hehe might excite you  i insist upon seeing him cynthia  william wetherell had never said anything like that before but cynthia obeyed him and presently led mr merrill into the room the kindly little railroad president was very serious now the wasted face of the storekeeper enhanced as it was by the beard gave mr merrill such a shock that he could not speak for a few momentshe who rarely lacked for cheering words on any occasion a lump rose in his throat as he went over and stood by the chair and took the sick mans hand  i am glad you came mr merrill said wetherell simply i wanted to speak to you cynthia will you leave us alone for a few minutes  cynthia went troubled and perplexed wondering at the change in him he had had something on his mindnow she was sure of itsomething which mr merrill might be able to relieve  it was mr merrill who spoke first when she was gone  i was coming up to brampton he said and tom collins who drives the truro coach told me you were sick i had not heard of it  mr merrill too had something on his mind and did not quite know how to go on there was in william wetherell as he sat in the chair with his eyes fixed on his visitors face a dignity which mr merrill had not seen beforehad not thought the man might possess  i was coming to see you anyway mr merrill said  i did you a wrongthough as god judges me i did not think of it at the time it was not until alexander duncan spoke to me last week that i thought of it at all  yes said wetherell  you see continued mr merrill wiping his brow for he found the matter even more difficult than he had imagined it was not until duncan told me how you had acted in his library that i guessed the truththat i remembered myself how you had acted i knew that you were not mixed up in politics but i also knew that you were an intimate friend of jethros and i thought that you had been let into the secret of the woodchuck session i dont defend the game of politics as it is played mr wetherell but all of us who are friends of jethros are generally willing to lend a hand in any little manoeuvre that is going on and have a practical joke when we can it was not until i saw you sitting there beside duncan that the idea occurred to me it didnt make a great deal of difference whether duncan or lovejoy got to the house or not provided they didnt learn of the matter too early because some of their men had been bought off that day it suited jethros sense of humor to play the game that wayand it was very effective when i saw you there beside duncan i remembered that he had spoken about the guardian letters and the notion occurred to me to get him to show you his library i have explained to him that you were innocent ii hope you havent been worrying  william wetherell sat very still for a while gazing out of the window but a new look had come into his eyes  jethro bass did not know that youthat you had used me he asked at length  no replied mr merrill thickly no he didnt know a thing about ithe doesnt know it now i believe  a smile came upon wetherells face but mr merrill could not look at it  you have made me very happy said the storekeeper tremulously ii have no right to be proudi have taken his moneyhe has supported my daughter and myself all these years but he had never asked me toto do anything and i liked to think that he never would  mr merrill could not speak the tears were streaming down his cheeks  i want you to promise me mr merril he went on presently i want you to promise me that you will never speak to jethro of this or to my daughter cynthia  mr merrill merely nodded his head in assent still he could not speak  they might think it was this that caused my death it was not i know very well that i am worn out and that i should have gone soon in any case and i must leave cynthia to him he loves her as his own child  william wetherell his faith in jethro restored was facing death as he had never faced life mr merrill was greatly affected  you must not speak of dying wetherell said he brokenly will you forgive me  there is nothing to forgive now that you have explained matters mr merrill said the storekeeper and he smiled again if my fibre had been a little tougher this thing would never have happened there is only one more request i have to make and that is to assure mr duncan from me that i did not detain him purposely  i will see him on my way to boston answered mr merrill  then cynthia was called she was waiting anxiously in the passage for the interview to be ended and when she came in one glance at her fathers face told her that he was happier she too was happier  i wish you would come every day mr merrill she said when they descended into the garden after the three had talked awhile it is the first time since he fell ill that he seems himself  mr merrills answer was to take her hand and pat it he sat down on the millstone and drew a deep breath of that sparkling air and sighed for his memory ran back to his own innocent boyhood in the new england country he talked to cynthia until jethro came  i have taken a fancy to this girl jethro said the little railroad president i believe ill steal her a fellow cant have too many of em you know ill tell you one thingyou wont keep her always shut up here in coniston shes much too good to waste on the desert air perhaps mr merrill too had been thinking of the elegy that morning i dont mean to run down coniston its one of the most beautiful places i ever saw but seriously jethro you and wetherell ought to send her to school in boston after a while shes about the age of my girls and she can live in my house aint i right  ddont know but what you be steve jethro answered slowly  i am right declared mr merrill youll back me in this i know it why shes like your own daughter you remember what i say i mean itwhat are you thinking about cynthia  i couldnt leave dad and uncle jethro she said  why bless your soul said mr merrill bring dad along well find room for him and i guess uncle jethro will get to boston twice a month if youre there  and mr merrill got into the buggy with mr sherman and drove away to brampton thinking of many things  ssteves a good man said jethro ccome up here from brampton to see your fatherdid he  yes answered cynthia he is very kind she was about to tell jethro what a strange difference this visit had made in her fathers spirits but some instinct kept her silent she knew that jethro had never ceased to reproach himself for inviting wetherell to the capital and she was sure that something had happened there which had disturbed her father and brought on that fearful apathy but the apathy was dispelled now and she shrank from giving jethro pain by mentioning the fact  he never knew indeed until many years afterward what had brought stephen merrill to coniston when jethro went up the stairs that afternoon he found william wetherell alone looking out over the garden with a new peace and contentment in his eyes jethro drew breath when he saw that look as if a great load had been lifted from his heart  ffeelin some better today will he said  i am well again jethro replied the storekeeper pressing jethros hand for the first time in months  ssoon be will said jethro ssoon be  wetherell who was not speaking of the welfare of the body did not answer  jethro he said presently there is a little box lying in the top of my trunk over there in the corner will you get it for me  jethro rose and opened the rawhide trunk and handed the little rosewood box to his friend wetherell took it and lifted the lid reverently with that same smile on his face and faroff look in his eyes and drew out a small daguerreotype in a faded velvet frame he gazed at the picture a long time and then he held it out to jethro and jethro looked at it and his hand trembled  it was a picture of cynthia ware and who can say what emotions it awoke in jethros heart she was older than the cynthia he had known and yet she did not seem so there was the same sweet virginal look in the gray eyes and the same exquisite purity in the features he saw her againas if it were yesterdaywalking in the golden green light under the village maples and himself standing in the tannery door he saw the face under the poke bonnet on the road to brampton and heard the thrush singing in the woods andif he could only blot out that scene from his liferemembered her a transformed cynthiaremembered that face in the lanternlight when he had flung back the hood that shaded it and that hair which he had kissed wet then from the sleet ah god for that briefest of moments she had been his  so he stared at the picture as it lay in the palm of his hand and forgot him who had been her husband but at length he started as from a dream and gave it back to wetherell who was watching him her name had never been mentioned between the two men and yet she had been the one woman in the world to both  it is strange said william wetherell it is strange that i should have had but two friends in my life and that she should have been one and you the other she found me destitute and brought me back to life and married me and cared for me until she died and after thatyou cared for me  youyou mustnt think of that will twahnt much what i didno more than any one else would hev done  it was everything answered the storekeeper simply each of you came between me and destruction there is something that i have always meant to tell you jethrosomething that it may be a comfort for you to know cynthia loved you  jethro bass did not answer he got up and stood in the window looking out  when she married me wetherell continued steadily she told me that there was one whom she had never been able to drive from her heart and one summer evening how well i recall itwe were walking under the trees on the mall and we met my old employer mr judson the jeweller he put me in mind of the young countryman who had come in to buy a locket and i asked her if she knew you strange that i should have remembered your name wasnt it it was then that she led me to a bench and confessed that you were the man whom she could not forget i used to hate you thenas much as was in me to hate i hated and feared you when i first came to coniston but now i can tell youi can even be happy in telling you  jethro bass groaned he put his hand to his throat as though he were stifling many many years ago he had worn the locket there and now now an impulse seized him and he yielded to it he thrust his hand in his coat and drew out a cowhide wallet and from the wallet the oval locket itself there it was tarnished with age but with that memorable inscription still legiblecynthy from jethro not cynthia but cynthy how the years fell away as he read it he handed it in silence to the storekeeper and in silence went to the window again jethro bass was a man who could find no outlet for his agony in speech or tears  yes said wetherell i thought you would have kept it dear dear how well i remember it and i remember how i patronized you when you came into the shop i believed i should live to be something in the world then yes she loved you jethro i can die more easily now that i have told youit has been on my mind all these years  the locket fell open in william wetherells hand for the clasp had become worn with time and there was a picture of little cynthia within of little cynthianot so little nowa photograph taken in brampton the year before wetherell laid it beside the daguerreotype  she looks like her he said aloud but the child is more vigorous more humanless like a spirit i have always thought of cynthia ware as a spirit  jethro turned at the words and came and stood looking over wetherells shoulder at the pictures of mother and daughter in the rosewood box was a brooch and a gold ringcynthia wares wedding ringand two small slips of yellow paper william wetherell opened one of these disclosing a little braid of brown hair he folded the paper again and laid it in the locket and handed that to jethro  it is all i have to give you he said but i know that you will cherish it and cherish her when i am gone sheshe has been a daughter to both of us  yes said jethro i will  william wetherell lived but a few days longer they laid him to rest at last in the little ground which captain timothy prescott had hewn out of the forest with his axe where captain timothy himself lies under his slate headstone with the quaint lettering of bygone daysthat same autumn jethro bass made a pilgrimage to boston and now cynthia ware sleeps there too beside her husband amid the scenes she loved so well     book iii     chapter i  one day in the november following william wetherells death jethro bass astonished coniston by moving to the little cottage in the village which stood beside the disused tannery and which had been his fathers it was known as the tannery house his reasons for this step when at length discovered were generally commended they were in fact a disinclination to leave a girl of cynthias tender age alone on thousand acre hill while he journeyed on his affairs about the country the rev mr satterlee gaunt redfaced but the six feet of him a man and a christian from his squaretoed boots to the bleaching yellow hair around his temples offered to become her teacher for by this time cynthia had exhausted the resources of the little school among the birches  the four years of her life in the tannery house which are now briefly to be chronicled were for her full of happiness and peace though the young may sorrow they do not often mourn cynthia missed her father at times when the winds kept her wakeful at night she wept for him but she loved jethro bass and served him with a devotion that filled his heart with strange ecstasiesyes and forebodings in all his existence he had never known a love like this he may have imagined it once back in the bright days of his youth but the dreams of its fulfilment had fallen far short of the exquisite touch of the reality in which he now spent his days at home in summer when she sat in the face of all the conventions of the village reading under the butternut tree before the house she would feel his eyes upon her and the mysterious yearning in them would startle her often during her lessons with mr satterlee in the parlor of the parsonage she would hear a noise outside and perceive jethro leaning against the pillar both cynthia and mr satterlee knew that he was there and both by a kind of tacit agreement ignored the circumstance  cynthia in this period undertook jethros education too she could have induced him to study the making of latin verse by the mere asking during those days which he spent at home and which he had grown to value beyond price he might have been seen seated on the ground with his back to the butternut tree while cynthia read aloud from the wellworn books which had been her fathers treasures books that took on marvels of meaning from her lips cynthias powers of selection were not remarkable at this period and perhaps it was as well that she never knew the effect of the various works upon the hitherto untamed soul of her listener milton and tennyson and longfellow awoke in him by their very music troubled and halfformed regrets carlyles frederick the great set up tumultuous imaginings but the life of jackson as did the story of napoleon long ago stirred all that was masterful in his blood unlettered as he was jethro had a power which often marks the american of actiona singular grasp of the application of any sentence or paragraph to his own life and often about this time he took away the breath of a judge or a senator by flinging at them a chunk of carlyle or parton  it was perhaps as well that cynthia was not a woman at this time and that she had grown up with him as it were his love indeed was that of a father for a daughter but it held within it as a core the revived love of his youth for cynthia her mother tender as were the manifestations of this love cynthia never guessed the fires within for there was in truth something primeval in the fierceness of his passion she was his nowhis alone to cherish and sweeten the declining years of his life and when by a chance jethro looked upon her and thought of the suitor who was to come in the fulness of her years he burned with a hatred which it is given few men to feel it was well for jethro that these thoughts came not often  sometimes in the summer afternoons they took long drives through the town behind jethros white horse on business jethros gal as cynthia came to be affectionately called held the reins while jethro went in to talk to the men folk one august evening found cynthia thus beside a poplar in front of amos cuthberts farmhouse a poplar that shimmered greengold in the late afternoon and from the buggyseat cynthia looked down upon a thousand purple hilltops and mountain peaks of another state the view aroused in the girl visions of the many wonders which life was to hold and she did not hear the sharp voice beside her until the woman had spoken twice jethro came out in the middle of the conversation nodded to mrs cuthbert and drove off  uncle jethro asked cynthia presently what is a mortgage  jethro struck the horse with the whip an uncommon action with him and the buggy was jerked forward sharply over the boulders  erwhos ben talkin about mortgages cynthy he demanded  mrs cuthbert said that when folks had mortgage held over them they had to take orders whether they liked them or not she said that amos had to do what you told him because there was a mortgage that isnt so is it  jethro did not speak presently cynthia laid her hand over his  mrs cuthbert is a spiteful woman she said i know the reason why people obey youits because youre so great and daddy used to tell me so  a tremor shook jethros frame and the hand on which hers rested and all the way down the mountain valleys to coniston village he did not speak again but cynthia was used to his silences and respected them  to ephraim prescott who as the days went on found it more and more difficult to sew harness on account of his rheumatism jethro was not only a great man but a hero for cynthia was vaguely troubled at having found one discontent she was wont to entertain ephraim on the days when his hands failed him when he sat sunning himself before his door and she knew that he was honest  whos ben talkin to you cynthia he cried why jethros the biggest man i know and the best i dont like to think where some of us would have ben if he hadnt given us a lift  but he has enemies cousin eph said cynthia still troubled what great man haint exclaimed the soldier jethros enemies haint worth thinkin about  the thought that jethro had enemies was very painful to cynthia and she wanted to know who they were that she might show them a proper contempt if she met them lem hallowell brushed aside the subject with his usual bluff humor and pinched her cheek and told her not to trouble her head amanda hatch dwelt upon the inherent weakness in the human race and the rev mr satterlee faced the question once during a history lesson the nations heroes came into inevitable comparison with jethro bass was washington so good a man and would not jethro have been as great as the father of his country if he had had the opportunities  the answers sorely tried mr satterlees conscience albeit he was not a man of the world it set him thinking he liked jethro this man of rugged power whose word had become law in the state he knew best that side of him which cynthia saw andif the truth be toldas a native of coniston mr satterlee felt in the bottom of his heart a certain pride in jethro the ministers opinions well represented the attitude of his time he had not given thought to the subjectfor such matters had came to be taken for granted a politician now was a politician his ways and standards set apart from those of other citizens and not to be judged by men without the pale of public life mr satterlee in his limited vision did not then trace the matter to its source did not reflect that jethro bass himself was almost wholly responsible in that state for the condition of politics and politicians coniston was proud of jethro prouder of him than ever since his last great victory in the legislature which brought the truro railroad through to harwich and settled their townsman more firmly than ever before in the seat of power every statesman who drove into their little mountain village and stopped at the tannery house made their blood beat faster senators came and representatives and judges and governors to git their orders as rias richardson briefly put it and jethro could make or unmake them at a word each was scanned from the store where rias now reigned supreme and from the harness shop across the road some drove away striving to bite from their lips the telltale smile which arose in spite of them others tried to look happy despite the sentence of doom to which they had listened  jethro bass was indeed a great man to make such as these tremble or rejoice when he went abroad with cynthia awheel or afoot some took off their hatsan unheardof thing in coniston if he stopped at the store they scanned his face for the mood he was in before venturing their remarks if he lingered for a moment in front of the house of amanda hatch the whole village was advised of the circumstance before nightfall  two personages worthy of mention here visited the tannery house during the years that cynthia lived with jethro the honorable heth sutton drove over from clovelly attended by his prime minister mr bijah bixby the honorable heth did not attempt to conceal the smile with which he went away and he stopped at the store long enough to enable rias to produce certain refreshments from depths unknown to the united states internal revenue authorities mr sutton shook hands with everybody including jake wheeler well he might he came to coniston a private citizen and drove away to all intents and purposes a congressman the darling wish of his life realized after heaven knows how many caucuses and conventions of disappointment when jethro had judged it expedient for one reason or another that a north countryman should go by the time the pair reached brampton chamberlain bixby was introducing his chief as congressman sutton and by this title he was known for many years to come  another day when the snow lay in great billows on the ground and filled the mountain valleys when the pines were rusty from the long winter two other visitors drove to coniston in a twohorse sleigh the sun was shining brightly the wind held its breath and the noonday warmth was almost like that of spring those who know the mountain country will remember the joy of many such days cynthia standing in the sun on the porch breathing deep of the pure air recognized as the sleigh drew near the somewhat portly gentleman driving and the young woman beside him regally clad in furs who looked patronizingly at the tannery house as she took the reins the young woman was miss cassandra hopkins and the portly gentleman the honorable alva himself patron of the drama who had entered upon his governorship and now wished to be senator  jethro bass home he called out  mr bass is home answered cynthia the girl in the sleigh murmured something laughing a little and cynthia flushed mr hopkins gave a somewhat peremptory knock at the door and was admitted by millicent skinner but cynthia stood staring at cassandra in the sleigh some instinct warning her of a coming skirmish  do you live here all the year round  of course said cynthia  miss cassandra shrugged as though that were beyond her comprehension  id die in a place like this she said no balls or theatres doesnt your father take you around the state  my fathers dead said cynthia  oh your names cynthia wetherell isnt it you know bob worthington dont you hes gone to harvard now but he was a great friend of mine at andover  cynthia didnt answer it would not be fair to say that she felt a pang though it might add to the romance of this narrative but her dislike for the girl in the sleigh decidedly increased how was she in her inexperience to know that the radiant beauty in furs was what the boys at phillips andover called an old stager  so you live with jethro bass was miss cassandras next remark hes rich enough to take you round the state and give you everything you want  i have everything i want replied cynthia  i shouldnt call living here having everything i wanted declared miss hopkins with a contemptuous glance at the tannery house  i suppose you wouldnt said cynthia  miss hopkins was nettled she was out of humor that day besides she shared some of her fathers political ambition if he went to washington she went too  didnt you know jethro bass was rich she demanded imprudently why my father gave twenty thousand dollars to be governor and jethro bass must have got half of it  cynthias eyes were of that peculiar gray which lighted by love or anger once seen are never forgotten one hand was on the dashboard of the cutter the other had seized the seat her voice was steady and the three words she spoke struck miss hopkins with startling effect  miss hopkinss breath was literally taken away and for once she found no retort let it be said for her that this was a new experience with a new creature a demure country girl turn into a wildcat before her very eyes perhaps it was as well for both that the door of the house opened and the honorable alva interrupted their talk and without so much as a glance at cynthia he got hurriedly into the sleigh and drove off when cynthia turned the points of color still high in her cheeks and the light still ablaze in her eyes she surprised jethro gazing at her from the porch and some sorrow she felt rather than beheld stopped the confession on her lips it would be unworthy of her even to repeat such slander and the color surged again into her face for very shame of her anger cassandra hopkins had not been worthy of it  jethro did not speak but slipped his hand into hers and thus they stood for a long time gazing at the snow fields between the pines on the heights of coniston  the next summer was the first which the painterpioneer of summer visitors therespent at coniston he was an unsuccessful painter who became by a process which he himself does not today completely understand a successful writer of novels as a character however he himself confesses his inadequacy and the chief interest in him for the readers of this narrative is that he fell deeply in love with cynthia wetherell at nineteen it is fair to mention in passing that other young men were in love with cynthia at this time notably eben hatchhistory repeating itself once in a moment of madness eben confessed his love the painter never did and he has to this day a delicious memory which has made cynthia the heroine of many of his stories he boarded with chester perkins and he was humored by the village as a harmless but amiable lunatic  the painter had never conceived that a new england conscience and a temper of no mean proportions could dwell together in the body of a wood nymph when he had first seen cynthia among the willows by coniston water he had thought her a wood nymph but she scolded him for his impropriety with so unerring a choice of words that he fell in love with her intellect too he spent much of his time to the neglect of his canvases under the butternut tree in front of jethros house trying to persuade cynthia to sit for her portrait and if jethro himself had not overheard one of these arguments the portrait never would have been painted jethro focussed a look upon the painter  erpainterman be you paint cynthys picture  but i dont want to be painted uncle jethro i wont be painted  hhow much for a good picture eronly want the bestonly want the best  the painter said a few things with pardonable heat to the effectwell never mind the effect his remarks made no impression whatever upon jethro  erpaint the picturepaint the picture and then well talk about the price erwait a minute  he went into the house and they heard him lumbering up the stairs cynthia sat with her back to the artist pretending to read but presently she turned to him  ill never forgive younever as long as i live she cried and i wont be painted  nnot to please me cynthy it was jethros voice  her look softened she laid down the book and went up to him on the porch and put her hand on his shoulder  do you really want it so much as all that uncle jethro she said  callate i do cynthy he answered he held a bundle covered with newspaper in his hand he looked down at cynthia  he seated himself on the edge of the porch and for the moment seemed lost in revery then he began slowly to unwrap the newspaper from the bundle there were five layers of it but at length he disclosed a bolt of cardinal cloth  call this to mind cynthy  yes she answered with a smile  hhows this for the dress mr painterman said jethro with a pride that was illconcealed  the painter started up from his seat and took the material in his hands and looked at cynthia he belonged to a city club where he was popular for his knack of devising costumes and a vision of cynthia as the daughter of a doge of venice arose before his eyes wonder of wonders the daughter of a doge discovered in a new england hill village the painter seized his pad and pencil and with a few strokes guided by inspiration sketched the costume then and there and held it up to jethro who blinked at it in astonishment but jethro was suspicious of his own sensations  erwellgodfreygguess thatll do then came the involuntary wwouldnt athought you had it in you how about it cynthy and he held it up for her inspection  if you are pleased its all i care about uncle jethro she answered and then her face suddenly flushing you must promise me on your honor that nobody in coniston shall know about it mr painterman  after this she always called him mr paintermanwhen she was pleased with him  so the cardinal cloth was come to its usefulness at last it was inevitable that sukey kittredge the village seamstress should be taken into confidence it was no small thing to take sukey into confidence for she was the legitimate successor in more ways than one of speedy bates and much of cynthia and the artists ingenuity was spent upon devising a form of oath which would hold sukey silent sukey however got no small consolation from the sense of the greatness of the trust confided in her and of the uproar she could make in coniston if she chose the painter to do him justice was the real dressmaker and did everything except cut the cloth and sew it together he sent to friends of his in the city for certain paste jewels and ornaments and one day cynthia stood in the old tannery shedhastily transformed into a studiobefore a variously moved audience sukey having adjusted the last pin became hysterical over her handiwork millicent skinner stared openmouthed words having failed her for once and jethro thrust his hands in his pockets in a quiet ecstasy of approbation  aalways had a notion that clothd set you off cynthy said he ernext time i go to the state capital you come alonggguess itll surprise em some  i guess it would uncle jethro said cynthia laughing  jethro postponed two political trips of no small importance to be present at the painting of that picture and he would sit silently by the hour in a corner of the shed watching every stroke of the brush never stood doges daughter in her jewels and seed pearls amidst stranger surroundingsthe beam and the centre post around which the old white horse had toiled in times gone by and all the piledup disused machinery of forgotten days and never was venetian lady more unconscious of her environment than cynthia  the portrait was of the head and shoulders alone and when he had given it the last touch the painter knew that for once in his life he had done a good thing never before perhaps had the fire of such inspiration been given him jethro who expressed himself in terms for him of great enthusiasm was for going to boston immediately to purchase a frame commensurate with the importance of such a work of art but the artist had his own views on that subject and sent to new york for this also  the day after the completion of the picture a rugged figure in rawhide boots and coonskin cap approached chester perkinss house knocked at the door and inquired for the painterman it was jethro the painterman forthwith went out into the rain behind the shed where a somewhat curious colloquy took place  gguess im willin to pay you full as much as its worth said jethro producing a cowhide wallet erwhat figure do you allow it comes to with the frame  the artist was past taking offence since jethro had long ago become for him an engrossing study  i will send you the bill for the frame mr bass he said the picture belongs to cynthia  earn your livin by paintin dont youearn your livin  the painter smiled a little bitterly  no he said if i did i shouldnt bealive mr bass have you ever done anything the pleasure of doing which was pay enough and to spare  jethro looked at him and something very like admiration came into the face that was normally expressionless  he put up his wallet a little awkwardly and held out his hand more awkwardly  you be more of a feller than i thought for he said and strode off through the drizzle toward coniston the painter walked slowly to the kitchen where chester perkins and his wife were sitting down to supper  jethro got a mortgage on you too asked chester  the artist had his reward for when the picture was hung at length in the little parlor of the tannery house it became a source of pride to coniston second only to jethro himself     chapter ii  time passes and the engines of the truro railroad are now puffing in and out of the yards of worthingtons mills in brampton and a fine layer of dust covers the old green stage which has worn the road for so many years over truro gap if you are ever in brampton you can still see the stage if you care to go into the back of what was once jim sanborns livery stable now owned by mr sherman of the brampton house  conventions and elections had come and gone and the honorable heth sutton had departed triumphantly to washington cheered by his neighbors in clovelly chamberlain bixby was left in charge there supreme who could be more desirable as a member of congress than mr sutton who had so ably served his party and jethro by holding the house against the insurgents in the matter of the truro bill mr sutton was moreover a gentleman an owner of cattle and land a man of substance whom lesser men were proud to mention as a frienda very hillrajah with stock in railroads and other enterprises who owed allegiance and paid tribute alone to the great man of coniston  mr sutton was one who would make himself felt even in the capital of the united statesfelt and heard and he had not been long in the halls of congress before he made a speech which rang under the very dome of the capitol so said the brampton and harwich papers at least though rivals and detractors of mr sutton declared that they could find no matter in it which related to the subject of a bill but that is neither here nor there the oration began with a lengthy tribute to the resources and history of his state and ended by a declaration that the speaker was in congress at no mans bidding but as the servant of the common people of his district  under the lamp of the little parlor in the tannery house cynthia who has now arrived at the very serious age of nineteen was reading the papers to jethro and came upon mr suttons speech there were four columns of it but jethro seemed to take delight in every word and portions of the noblest parts of it indeed he had cynthia read over again sometimes in the privacy of his home jethro was known to chuckle and to cynthias surprise he chuckled more than usual that evening  uncle jethro she said at length when she had laid the paper down i thought that you sent mr sutton to congress  jethro leaned forward  what put that into your head cynthy he asked  oh answered the girl everybody says somoses hatch rias and cousin eph didnt you  jethro looked at her as she thought strangely  youre too young to know anything about such things cynthy he said too young  but you make all the judges and senators and congressmen in the state i know you do why exclaimed cynthia indignantly why does mr sutton say the people elected him when he owes everything to you  jethro arose abruptly and flung a piece of wood into the stove and then he stood with his back to her her instinct told her that he was suffering though she could not fathom the cause and she rose swiftly and drew him down into the chair beside her  what is it she said anxiously have you got rheumatism too like cousin eph all old men seem to have rheumatism  no cynthy it haint rheumatism he managed to answer wimmen folks hadnt ought to mix up in politics theythey dont understand em cynthy  but i shall understand them some day because i am your daughternow thatnow that i have only you i am your daughter am i not  yes yes he answered huskily with his hand on her hair  and i know more than most women now continued cynthia triumphantly im going to be such a help to you soonvery soon ive read a lot of history and i know some of the constitution by heart i know why old timothy prescott fought in the revolutionit was to get rid of kings wasnt it and to let the people have a chance the people can always be trusted to do what is right cant they uncle jethro  jethro was silent but cynthia did not seem to notice that after a space she spoke againive been thinking it all out about you uncle jethro  aabout me  yes i know why you are able to send men to congress and make judges of them its because the people have chosen you to do all that for themyou are so great and good  jethro did not answer  although the month was march it was one of those wonderful still nights that sometimes come in the mountaincountry when the wind is silent in the notches and the stars seem to burn nearer to the earth cynthia awoke and lay staring for an instant at the red planet which hung over the black and ragged ridge and then she arose quickly and knocked at the door across the passage  are you ill uncle jethro  no he answered no cynthy go to bed eri was just thinkinthinkin thats all cynthy  though all his life he had eaten sparingly cynthia noticed that he scarcely touched his breakfast the next morning and two hours later he went unexpectedly to the state capital that day too coniston was clothed in clouds and by afternoon a wild march snowstorm was sweeping down the face of the mountain piling against doorways and blocking the roads through the storm cynthia fought her way to the harness shop for ephraim prescott had taken to his bed bound hand and foot by rheumatism  much of that spring ephraim was all but helpless and cynthia spent many days nursing him and reading to him meanwhile the harness industry languished cynthia and ephraim knew and coniston guessed that jethro was taking care of ephraim and strong as was his affection for jethro the old soldier found dependence hard to bear he never spoke of it to cynthia but he used to lie and dream through the spring days of what he might have done if the war had not crippled him for ephraim prescott like his grandfather was a man of actiona keen intelligent american whose energy under other circumstances might have gone toward the making of the west ephraim furthermore had certain principles which some in coniston called cranks for instance he would never apply for a pension though he could easily have obtained one through all his troubles he held grimly to the ideal which meant more to him than ease and comfortthat he had served his country for the love of it  with the warm weather he was able to be about again and occasionally to mend a harness but doctor rowell shook his head when jethro stopped his buggy in the road one day to inquire about ephraim whereupon jethro went on to the harness shop the inspiration by the way had come from cynthia  erephraim howd you like to be postmaster hhavent any objections to that kind of a job hev you  why no said ephraim we haint agoin to hev a postoffice at conistonair we  hhowd you like to be postmaster at brampton demanded jethro abruptly  ephraim dropped the trace he was shaving  postmaster at brampton he exclaimed  hhowd you like it said jethro again  well said ephraim i haint got any objections  jethro started out of the shop but paused again at the door  wwont say nothin about it will you eph he inquired  not till i git it answered ephraim the sorrows of three years were suddenly lifted from his shoulders and for an instant ephraim wanted to dance until he remembered the rheumatism and the wilderness leg suddenly a thought struck him and he hobbled to the door and called out after jethros retreating figure jethro returned  well he said well  whats the pay said ephraim in a whisper  jethro named the sum instantly also in a whisper  you dont tell me said ephraim and sank stupefied into the chair in front of the shop where lately he had spent so much of his time  jethro chuckled twice on his way home he chuckled twice again to cynthias delight at supper and after supper he sent millicent skinner to find jake wheeler jake as usual was kicking his heels in front of the store talking to rias and others about the coming fourth of july celebration at brampton brampton as we know was famous for its fourth of july celebrations not neglecting to let it be known that jethro had sent for him jake hurried off through the summer twilight to the tannery house bowed ceremoniously to cynthia under the butternut tree and discovered jethro behind the shed it was usually jethros custom to allow the other man to begin the conversation no matter how trivial the subjecta method which had commended itself to mr bixby and other minor politicians who copied him and usually the other man played directly into jethros hands jake wheeler always did and now to cover the awkwardness of the silence he began on the brampton celebration  they tell me heth suttons agoin to make the addressseems prouder than ever sence he went to congress i guess youll tell him what to say when the time comes jethro  ergoin to clovelly after wool this week jake  i kin go tomorrow said jake scenting an affair  ergoin to clovelly after wool this week jake  jake reflected he saw it was expedient that this errand should not smell of haste  i was goin to see cutter on friday he answered  erif you should happen to meet heth  yes interrupted jake  if by chance you should happen to meet heth or bije jethro knew that jake never went to clovelly without a conference with one or the other of these personages if only to be able to talk about it afterward at the store erwhat would you say to em  why said jake scratching his head for the answer id tell him you was at coniston  think well have rain jake inquired jethro blandly  jake wended his way back to the store filled with renewed admiration for the great man jethro had given him no instructions whatever could deny before a jury if need be that he had sent him jake to clovelly to tell heth sutton to come to coniston for instructions on the occasion of his brampton speech and jake was filled with a mysterious importance when he took his seat once more in the conclave  jake wheeler although in many respects a fool was one of the most efficient pack of political hounds that the state has ever known by six oclock on friday morning he was descending a brook valley on the clovelly side of the mountain and by seven was driving between the forest and river meadows of the rajahs domain and had come in sight of the big white house with its somewhat pretentious baywindows and gothic doorway it might be dubbed the palace of these parts the wide river flowed below it and the pastures so wondrously green in the morning sun were dotted with fat cattle and sheep jake was content to borrow a cut of tobacco from the superintendent and wonder aimlessly around the farm until mr suttons family prayers and breakfast were accomplished we shall not concern ourselves with the message or the somewhat lengthy manner in which it was delivered jake had merely dropped in by accident but the rajah listened coldly while he picked his teeth said he didnt know whether he was going to brampton or nothadnt decided didnt know whether he could get to coniston or nothis affairs were multitudinous now in short he set jake to thinking deeply as his horse walked up the western heights of coniston on the return journey he had let it be repeated a sure instinct once his nose was fairly on the scent and he was convinced that a war of great magnitude was in the air and he jake wheeler was probably the first in all the elate to discover it his blood leaped at the thought  the hillrajahs defiance boiled down could only mean one thingthat somebody with sufficient power and money was about to lock horns with jethro bass not for a moment did jake believe that for all his pomp and circumstance the honorable heth sutton was a big enough man to do this jake paid to the honorable heth all the outward respect that his high position demanded but he knew the man through and through he thought of the honorable heths reform speech in congress and laughed loudly in the echoing woods no mr sutton was not the man to lead a fight but to whom had he promised his allegiance this question puzzled mr wheeler all the way home and may it be said finally for many days thereafter he slid into coniston in the dusk big with impending events which he could not fathom as to giving jethro the careless answer of the hillrajah that was another matter  the fourth of july came at last nor was any contradiction made in the brampton papers that the speech of the honorable heth sutton had been cancelled instead advertisements appeared in the brampton clarion announcing the fact in large letters when cynthia read this advertisement to jethro he chuckled again they were under the butternut tree for the evenings were long now  will you take me to brampton uncle jethro said she letting fall the paper on her lap  wwhos to get in the hay said jethro  hay on the fourth of july exclaimed cynthia why thatssacrilege youd much better come and hear mr suttons speechit will do you good  cynthia could see that jethro was intensely amused for his eyes had a way of snapping on such occasions when he was alone with her she was puzzled and slightly offended because to tell the truth jethro had spoiled her  very well then she said ill go with the painterman  jethro came and stood over her his expression the least bit wistful  ercynthy he said presently haint fond of that painterman be you  why yes said cynthia arent you  hes fond of you said jethro shshouldnt be surprised if he was in love with you  cynthia looked up at him the corners of her mouth twitching and then she laughed the rev mr satterlee writing his sunday sermon in his study heard her and laid down his pen to listen  uncle jethro said cynthia sometimes i forget that youre a great wise man and i think that you are just a silly old goose  jethro wiped his face with his blue cotton handkerchief  then you haint agoin to marry the painterman he said  im not going to marry anybody cried cynthia contritely im going to live with you and take care of you all my life  on the morning of the fourth cynthia drove to brampton with the painterman and when he perceived that she was dreaming he ceased to worry her with his talk he liked her dreaming and stole many glances at her face of which she knew nothing at all through the cool and fragrant woods past the millpond stained blue and white by the sky and scented clover fields and wayside flowers nodding in the morning aircynthia saw these things in the memory of another journey to brampton on that fourth her father had been with her and jethro and ephraim and moses and amanda hatch and the children and how well she recalled too standing amidst the curious crowd before the great house which mr worthington had just built  there are weeks and months perhaps when we do not think of people when our lives are full and vigorous and then perchance a memory will bring them vividly before usso vividly that we yearn for them there rose before cynthia now the vision of a boy as he stood on the gothic porch of the house and how he had come down to the wondering country people with his smile and his merry greeting and how he had cajoled her into lingering in front of the meetinghouse had he forgotten her with just a suspicion of a twinge cynthia remembered that janet duncan she had seen at the capital whom she had been told was the heiress of the state when he had graduated from harvard bob would of course marry her that was in the nature of things  to some the great event of that day in brampton was to be the speech of the honorable heth sutton in the meetinghouse at eleven others and this party was quite as numerous had looked forward to the baseball game between brampton and harwich in the afternoon the painter would have preferred to walk up meetinghouse hill with cynthia and from the cool heights look down upon the amphitheatre in which the town was built but cynthia was interested in history and they went to the meetinghouse accordingly where she listened for an hour and a half to the patriotic eloquence of the representative the painter was glad to see and hear so great a man in the hour of his glory though so much as a fragment of the oration does not now remain in his memory in size in figure in expression in the sonorous tones of his voice mr sutton was everything that a congressman should be the people said isaac d worthington in presenting him should indeed be proud of such an able and highminded representative we shall have cause to recall that word highminded  many persons greeted cynthia outside the meetinghouse for the girl seemed genuinely loved by all who knew hertoo much loved her companion thought by certain spickandspan young men of brampton but they ate the lunch cynthia had brought far from the crowd under the trees by coniston water it was she who proposed going to the baseball game and the painter stifled a sigh and acquiesced their way brought them down brampton street past a house with great iron dogs on the lawn so imposing and cityfied that he hung back and asked who lived there  mr worthington answered cynthia making to move on impatiently  her escort did not think much of the house but it interested him as the type which mr worthington had built on that same gothic porch sublimely unconscious of the covert stares and subdued comments of the passersby the first citizen himself and the honorable heth sutton might be seen mr worthington whose hawklike look had become more pronounced sat upright while the honorable heth his legs crossed filled every nook and cranny of an armchair and an occasional fragrant whiff from his cigar floated out to those on the tar sidewalk although the pedestrians were but twenty feet away what mr worthington said never reached them but the honorable heth on public days carried his voice of the forum around with him  come on said cynthia in one of those startling little tempers she was subject to dont stand there like an idiot  then the voice of mr sutton boomed toward them  as i understand worthington they heard him say you want me to appoint young wheelock for the brampton postoffice he stuck his thumb into his vest pocket and recrossed his legs i guess it can be arranged  when the painter at last overtook cynthia the jewel paints he had so often longed to catch upon a canvas were in her eyes he fell back wondering how he could so greatly have offended when she put her hand on his sleeve  did you hear what he said about the brampton postoffice she cried  the brampton postoffice he repeated dazed  yes said cynthia uncle jethro has promised it to cousin ephraim who will starve without it did you hear this man say he would give it to mr wheelock  here was a new cynthia aflame with emotions on a question of politics of which he knew nothing he did understand however her concern for ephraim prescott for he knew that she loved the soldier she turned from the painter now with a gesture which he took to mean that his profession debarred him from such vital subjects and she led the way to the fairgrounds there he meekly bought tickets and they found themselves hurried along in the eager crowd toward the stand  the girl was still unaccountably angry over that mysterious affair of the postoffice and sat with flushed cheeks staring out on the green field past the line of buggies and carryalls on the farther side to the southern shoulder of coniston towering above them all the painter already beginning to love his new england folk listened to the homely chatter about him until suddenly a cheer starting in one corner ran like a flash of gunpowder around the field and eighteen young men trotted across the turf although he was not a devotee of sport he noticed that nine of these as they took their places on the bench wore bluethe harwich champions seven only of those scattering over the field wore white two young gentlemen one at second base and the other behind the batter wore gray uniforms with crimson stockings and crimson piping on the caps and a crimson h embroidered on the breasta sight that made the painters heart beat a little faster the honored livery of his own college  what are those two harvard men doing here he asked  cynthia who was leaning forward started and turned to him a face which showed him that his question had been meaningless he repeated it  oh said she the tall one burned brickred like an indian is bob worthington  hes a good type the artist remarked  youre right mister there haint a finer young feller anywhere chimed in mr dodd a portly person with a tuft of yellow beard on his chin mr dodd kept the hardware store in brampton  and who asked the painter is the bulletheaded little fellow with freckles and short red hair behind the bat  i dont know said cynthia indifferently  why exclaimed mr dodd with just a trace of awe in his voice thats somers duncan son of millionaire duncan down to the capital i guess he added i guess them two will be the richest men in the state some day duncan come up from harvard with bob  in a few minutes the game was in full swing brampton against harwich the old rivalry in another form every advantage on either side awoke thundering cheers from the partisans beribboned young women sprang to their feet and waved the harwich blue at a home run and were on the verge of tears when the brampton pitcher struck out their best batsman but beyond the facts that the tide was turning in bramptons favor that young mr worthington stopped a ball flying at a phenomenal speed and batted another at a still more phenomenal speed which was not stopped that his name and duncans were mingled generously in the cheering the painter remembered little of the game the exhibition of human passions which the sight of it drew from an undemonstrative race the shouting the comments wrung from hardy spirits off their guard the joy and the sorrowsuch things interested him more high above the turmoil coniston as through the ages looked down upon the scene impassive  he was aroused from these reflections by an incident some one had leaped over the railing which separated the stand from the field and stood before cynthiaa tanned and smiling young man in gray and crimson his honest eyes were alight with an admiration that was unmistakable to the painterperhaps to cynthia also for a glow that might have been of annoyance or anger and yet was like the color of the mountain sunrise answered in her cheek mr worthington reached out a large brown hand and seized the girls as it lay on her lap  hello cynthia he cried ive been looking for you all day i thought you might be here where were you  where did you look answered cynthia composedly withdrawing her hand  everywhere said bob up and down the street all through the hotel i asked lem hallowell and he didnt know where you were i only got here last night myself  i was in the meetinghouse said cynthia  the meetinghouse he echoed you dont mean to tell me that you listened to that silly speech of suttons  this remark delivered in all earnestness was the signal for uproarious laughter from mr dodd and others sitting near by attending earnestly to the conversation  cynthia bit her lip  yes i did she said but im sorry now  i should think you would be said bob suttons a silly pompous old fool i had to sit through dinner with him i believe i could represent the district better myself  by gosh exploded mr dodd i believe you could  but bob paid no attention to him he was looking at cynthia  cynthia youve grown up since i saw you he said hows uncle jethro  hes wellthanks said cynthia and now she was striving to put down a smile  still running the state said bob you tell him i think he ought to muzzle sutton what did he send him down to washington for  i dont know said cynthia  what are you going to do after the game bob demanded  im going home of course said cynthia  his face fell  cant you come to the house for supper and stay for the fireworks he begged pleadingly wed be mighty glad to have your friend too  cynthia introduced her escort  its very good of you bob she said with that new england demureness which at times became her so well but we couldnt possibly do it and then i dont like mr sutton  oh hang him exclaimed bob he took a step nearer to her wont you stay this once i have to go west in the morning  i think you are very lucky said cynthia  bob scanned her face searchingly and his own fell  lucky he cried i think its the worst thing that ever happened to me my fathers so hardheaded when he gets his mind sethes making me do it he wants me to see the railroads and the country so ive got to go with the duncans i wanted to stay he checked himself i think its a blamed nuisance  so do i said a voice behind him  it was not the first time that mr somers duncan had spoken but bob either had not heard him or pretended not to mr duncans freckled face smiled at them from the top of the railing his eyes were on cynthias face and he had been listening eagerly mr duncans chief characteristic beyond his freckles was his eagernessa quality probably amounting to keenness  hello said bob turning impatiently i might have known you couldnt keep away youre the cause of all my troublesyou and your fathers private car  somers became apologetic  it isnt my fault he said im sure i hate going as much as you do its spoiled my summer too  then he coughed and looked at cynthia  well said bob i suppose ill have to introduce you this he added dragging his friend over the railing is mr somers duncan  im awfully glad to meet you miss wetherell said somers fervently to tell you the truth i thought he was just making up yarns  yarns repeated cynthia with a look that set mr duncan floundering  why yes he stammered worthy said that you were up here but i thought he was crazy the way he talkedi didnt think  think what inquired cynthia but she flushed a little  oh rot somers said bob blushing furiously under his tan you ought never to go near a womanyoure the darndest fool with em i ever saw  this time even the painter laughed outright and yet he was a little sorrowful too because he could not be even as these youths but cynthia sat serene the eternal feminine of all the ages and it is no wonder that bob worthington was baffled as he looked at her he lapsed into an awkwardness quite as bad as that of his friend  i hope you enjoyed the game he said at last with a formality that was not at all characteristic  cynthia did not seem to think it worth while to answer this so the painter tried to help him out  that was a fine stop you made mr worthington he said wasnt it cynthia  everybody seemed to think so answered cynthia cruelly but if i were a man and had hands like that bob thrust them in his pockets i believe i could stop a ball too  somers laughed uproariously  goodby said bob with uneasy abruptness ive got to go into the field now when can i see you  when you get back from the westperhaps said cynthia  oh cried bob they were calling him i must see you tonight he vaulted over the railing and turned ill come back here right after the game he said theres only one more inning  well come back right after the game repeated mr duncan  bob shot one look at himof which mr duncan seemed blissfully unconsciousand stalked off abruptly to second base  the artist sat pensive for a few moments wondering at the ways of women his sympathies unaccountably enlisted in behalf of mr worthington  werent you a little hard on him he said  for answer cynthia got to her feet  i think we ought to be going home she said  going home he ejaculated in amazement  i promised uncle jethro id be there for supper and she led the way out of the grand stand  so they drove back to coniston through the level evening light and when they came to ephraim prescotts harness shop the old soldier waved at them cheerily from under the big flag which he had hung out in honor of the day the flag was silk and incidentally ephraims most valued possession then they drew up before the tannery house and cynthia leaped out of the buggy and held out her hand to the painter with a smile  it was very good of you to take me she said  jethro bass rugged uncouth in rawhide boots and swallowtail and coonskin cap came down from the porch to welcome her and she ran toward him with an eagerness that started the painter to wondering afresh over the contrasts of life what he asked himself had fate in store for cynthia wetherell     chapter iii  hhave a good time cynthy said jethro looking down into her face love had wrought changes in jethro mightier changes than he suspected and the girl did not know how zealous were the sentries of that love how watchful they were and how they told him often and again whether her heart too was smiling  it was very gay said cynthia  ppainterman gay inquired jethro  cynthias eyes were on the orange line of the sunset over coniston but she laughed a little indulgently  cynthy  yes  erthat painterman haint such a bad fellowwwhy didnt you ask him in to supper  ill give you three guesses said cynthia but she did not wait for them it was because i wanted to be alone with you millys gone out hasnt she  ggone acourtin said jethro  she smiled and went into the house to see whether milly had done her duty before she left it was characteristic of cynthia not to have mentioned the subject which was agitating her mind until they were seated on opposite sides of the basswood table  uncle jethro she said i thought you told mr sutton to give cousin eph the brampton postoffice do you trust mr sutton she demanded abruptly  erwhy said jethro why  because i dont she answered with conviction i think hes a big fraud he must have deceived you uncle jethro i cant see why you ever sent him to congress  although jethro was in no mood for mirth he laughed in spite of himself for he was an american his lifelong habit would have made him defend heth to any one but cynthia  d you see heth cynthy he asked yes replied the girl disgustedly i should say i did but not to speak to him he was sitting on mr worthingtons porch and i heard him tell mr worthington he would give the brampton postoffice to dave wheelock i dont want you to think that i was eavesdropping she added quickly i couldnt help hearing it  jethro did not answer  youll make him give the postoffice to cousin eph wont you uncle jethro  yes said jethro very simply i will he meditated awhile and then said suddenly wwont speak about itwill you cynthy  you know i wont she answered  let it not be thought by any chance that coniston was given over to revelry and late hours even on the fourth of july by ten oclock the lights were out in the tannery house but cynthia was not asleep she sat at her window watching the shy moon peeping over coniston ridge and she was thinking to be exact of how much could happen in one short day and how little in a long month she was aroused by the sound of wheels and the soft beat of a horses hoofs on the dirt road then came stifled laughter and suddenly she sprang up alert and tingling her own name came floating to her through the darkness  the next thing that happened will be long remembered in coniston a tentative chord or two from a guitar and then the startled village was listening with all its might to the voices of two young men singing when i first went up to harvardprobably meant to disclose the identity of the serenaders as if that were necessary coniston never having listened to grand opera was entertained and thrilled and thought the rendering of the song better on the whole than the church choir could have done it or even the quartette that sung at the brampton celebrations behind the flowers cynthia had her own views on the subject  there were five other songscynthia remembers all of them although she would not confess such a thing naughty naughty clara was another one the other three were almost wholly about love some treating it flippantly others seriouslythis applied to the last one which had many farewells in it then they went away and the crickets and frogs on coniston water took up the refrain  although the occurrence was unusualit might almost be said epochmakingjethro did not speak of it until they had reached the sparkling heights of thousand acre hill the next morning even then he did not look at cynthia  know who that was last night cynthy he inquired as though the matter were a casual one  i believe said cynthia heroically i believe it was a boy named somers duncanand bob worthington  erbob worthington repeated jethro but said nothing more  of course coniston and presently brampton knew that bob worthington had serenaded cynthiaand coniston and brampton talked it is noteworthy that with the jocular exceptions of ephraim and lem hallowell they did not talk to the girl herself the painter had long ago discovered that cynthia was an individual she had good blood in her as a mere child she had shouldered the responsibility of her father she had a natural aptitude for booksa quality reverenced in the community she visited as a matter of habit the sick and the unfortunate and lastly perhaps the crowning achievement she had bound jethro bass of all men with the fetters of love of course i have ended up by making her a paragon although i am merely stating what people thought of her coniston decided at once that she was to marry the heir to the brampton mills  but the heir had gone west and as the summer wore on the gossip died down other and more absorbing gossip took its place never distinctly formulated but whispered always wishing for more definite news that never came the statesmen drove out from brampton to the door of the tannery house as usual only it was remarked by astute observers and jake wheeler that certain statesmen did not come who had been in the habit of coming formerly in short those who made it a custom to observe such matters felt vaguely a disturbance of some kind the organs of the people felt it and became more guarded in their statements what no one knew except jake and a few in high places was that a war of no mean magnitude was impending  there were three men in the stateand perhaps only threewho realized from the first that all former political combats would pale in comparison to this one to come similar wars had already started in other states and when at length they were fought out another twist had been given to the tail of a longsuffering constitution political history in the united states had to be written from an entirely new and unforeseen standpoint and the unsuspecting people had changed masters  this was to be a war of extermination of one side or the other no quarter would be given or asked and every weapon hitherto known to politics would be used of the three men who realized this and all that would happen if one side or the other were victorious one was alexander duncan another isaac d worthington and the third was jethro bass  jethro would never have been capable of being master of the state had he not foreseen the time when the railroads tired of paying tribute would turn and try to exterminate the boss the really astonishing thing about jethros foresight known to few only was that he perceived clearly that the time would come when the railroads and other aggregations of capital would exterminate the boss or at least subserviate him this alone the writer thinks gives him some right to greatness and jethro bass made up his mind that the victory of the railroads in his state at least should not come in his day he would hold and keep what he had fought all his life to gain  jethro knew when jake wheeler failed to bring him a message back from clovelly that the war had begun and that isaac d worthington commander of the railroad forces in the field had captured his pawn the hillrajah by getting through to harwich the truro had made a sad muddle in railroad affairs it was now a connecting link and its president the first citizen of brampton a man of no small importance in the state this fact was not lost upon jethro who perceived clearly enough the fight for consolidation that was coming in the next legislature  seated on an old haystack on thousand acre hill that sits in turn on the lap of coniston jethro smiled as he reflected that the first trial of strength in this mighty struggle was to be over what the unsuspecting world would deem a trivial matter the postmastership of brampton and worthingtons first move in the game would be to attempt to capture for his faction the support of the administration itself  jethro thought the view from thousand acre hill especially in september to be one of the sublimest efforts of the creator it was september first of the purple months in coniston not the redpurple of the maine coast but the bluepurple of the mountain the color of the bloom on the concord grape his eyes sweeping the mountain from the notch to the granite ramp of the northern buttress fell on the weatherbeaten little farmhouse in which he had lived for many years and rested lovingly on the orchard where the golden early apples shone among the leaves but jethro was not looking at the apples  cynthy he called out abruptly hhowd you like to go to washington  washington exclaimed cynthia when  nnowtomorrow then he added uneasily ccant you get ready  cynthia laughed  why ill go tonight uncle jethro she answered  well he said admiringly you haint one of them clutterin females we can get some finery for you in new york cynthy ddont want any of them town ladies to put you to shame ernot that they would he added hastilynot that they would  cynthia climbed up beside him on the haystack  uncle jethro she said solemnly when you make a senator or a judge i dont interfere do i  he looked at her uneasily for there were moments when he could not for the life of him make out her drift  nno he assented of course not cynthy  why is it that i dont interfere  i callate answered jethro still more uneasily i callate its because youre a woman  and dont you think asked cynthia that a woman ought to know what becomes her best  jethro reflected and then his glance fell on her approvingly  gguess youre right cynthy he said i always had some success in dressin up listy and that kind of set me up  on such occasions he spoke of his wife quite simply he had been genuinely fond of her although she was no more than an episode in his life cynthia smiled to herself as they walked through the orchard to the place where the horse was tied but she was a little remorseful this feeling on the drive homeward was swept away by sheer elation at the prospect of the trip before her she had often dreamed of the great world beyond coniston and no one not even jethro had guessed the longings to see it which had at times beset her often she had dropped her book to summon up a picture of what a great city was like to reconstruct the boston of her early childhood she remembered the mall where she used to walk with her father and the row of houses where the rich dwelt which had seemed like palaces indeed when she read of palaces these houses always came to her mind and now she was to behold a palace even greater than theseand the house where the president himself dwelt but why was jethro going to washington  as if in answer to the question he drove directly to the harness shop instead of to the tannery house ephraim greeted them from within with a cheery hail and hobbled out and stood between the wheels of the buggy  that bridle bust again he inquired  erephraim said jethro how long since you ben away from conistonhow long  ephraim reflected  i went to harwich with moses before that bad spell i had in march he answered  cynthia smiled from pure happiness for she began to see the drift of things now  hhow long since youve ben in foreign parts said jethro  sixtyfive answered ephraim with astonishing promptness  erlike to go to washington with us tomorrow like to go to washington  ephraim gasped even as cynthia had  washinton he ejaculated  cynthy and i was thinkin of takin a little trip said jethro almost apologetically and we kind of thought wed like to have you with us didnt we cynthy erwe might see general grant he added meaningly  ephraim was a new englander and not an adept in expressing his emotions both cynthia and jethro felt that he would have liked to have said something appropriate if he had known how what he actually said waswhat time tomorrow  ccallate to take the nine oclock from brampton said jethro  ill report for duty at seven said ephraim and it was then he squeezed the hand that he found in his he watched them calmly enough until they had disappeared in the barn behind the tannery house and then his thoughts became riotous rumors had been rife that summer prophecies of changes to come and the resignation of the old man who had so long been postmaster at brampton was freely discussedor rather the matter of his successor as the months passed ephraim had heard david wheelock mentioned with more and more assurance for the place he had had many nights when sleep failed him but it was characteristic of the old soldier that he had never once broached the subject since jethro had spoken to him two months before ephraim had even looked up the law to see if he was eligible and found that he was since coniston had no postoffice and was within the limits of delivery of the brampton office  the next morning coniston was treated to a genuine surprise after loading up at the store lem hallowell instead of heading for brampton drove to the tannery house left his horses standing as he ran in and presently emerged with a little cowhide trunk that bore the letter w following the trunk came a radiant cynthia following cynthia jethro bass in a stovepipe hat with a carpetbag and hobbling after jethro ephraim prescott with another carpetbag it was remarked in the buzz of query that followed the stages departure that ephraim wore the blue suit and the army hat with a cord around it which he kept for occasions coniston longed to follow them in spirit at least but even milly skinner did not know their destination  fortunately we can follow them at brampton station they got into the little train that had just come over truro pass and steamed with many stops down the valley of coniston water until it stretched out into a wide range of shimmering green meadows guarded by blue hills veiled in the morning haze then bustling harwich and a wait of half an hour until the express from the north country came thundering through the gap then a fivehours journey down the broad river that runs southward between the hills dinner in a huge station amidst a pleasant buzz of excitement and the ringing of many bells then into another train through valleys and factory towns and cities until they came at nightfall to the metropolis itself  cynthia will always remember the awe with which that first view of new york inspired her and ephraim confessed that he too had felt it when he had first seen the myriad lights of the city after the long dusty ride from the hills with his regiment for all the flags and bunting it had held in 61 ephraim thought that city crueller than war itself and cynthia thought so too as she clung to jethros arm between the carriages and the clanging streetcars and looked upon the riches and poverty around her there entered her soul that night a sense of that which is the worst cruelty of allthe cruelty of selfishness every man going his own pace seeking to gratify his own aims and desires unconscious and heedless of the want with which he rubs elbows her natural imagination enhanced by her life among the hills the girl peopled the place in the street lights with all kinds of strange evildoers of whose sins she knew nothing adventurers charlatans alert cormorants who preyed upon the unwary she shrank closer to ephraim from a perfumed lady who sat next to her in the car and was thankful when at last they found themselves in the corridor of the astor house standing before the desk  hotel clerks especially city ones are supernatural persons this one knew jethro greeted him deferentially as judge bass and dipped the pen in the ink and handed it to him that he might register by halfpast nine cynthia was dreaming of lem hallowell and coniston and lem was driving a yellow streetcar full of queer people down the road to brampton  there were few guests in the great dining room when they breakfasted at seven the next morning new york in the sunlight had taken on a more kindly expression and those who were near by smiled at them and seemed full of goodwill persons smiled at them that day as they walked the streets or stood spellbound before the shop windows and some who saw them felt a lump rise in their throats at the memories they aroused of forgotten days the three seemed to bring the very air of the hills with them into that teeming place and many who had come to the city with high hopes now in the shackles of drudgery looked after them they were a curious party indeed the straight dark girl with the light in her eyes and the color in her cheeks the quaint rugged figure of the elderly man in his swallowtail and brass buttons and squaretoed country boots and the old soldier hobbling along with the aid of his green umbrella clad in the blue he had loved and suffered for had they remained until sunday they might have read an amusing account of their visitof jethros suppers of crackers and milk at the astor house of their progress along broadway the story was not lacking in pathos either and in real human feeling for the young reporter who wrote it had come not many years before from the hills himself but by that time they had accomplished another marvellous span in their journey and were come to washington itself     chapter iv  cynthia was deprived too of that thrilling first view of the capital from the train which she had pictured for night had fallen when they reached washington likewise as the train slowed down she leaned a little out of the window and looked at the shabby houses and shabby streets revealed by the flickering lights in the lampposts finally they came to a shabby station were seized upon by a grinning darky hackman who would not take no for an answer and were rattled away to the hotel although he had been to washington but once in his life before as a lincoln elector jethro was greeted as an old acquaintance by this clerk also  glad to see you judge said he genially train late youve come purty nigh missin supper  a familiar of great men the clerk was not offended when he got no response to his welcome cynthia and ephraim intent on getting rid of some of the dust of their journey followed the colored hallboy up the stairs jethro stood poring over the register when a distinguishedlooking elderly gentleman with a heavy gray beard and eyes full of shrewdness and humor paused at the desk to ask a question  ersenator  the senator for such he was although he did not represent jethros state turned and stared and then held out his hand with unmistakable warmth  jethro bass he exclaimed upon my word what are you doing in washington  jethro took the hand but he did not answer the question  ersenatorwhen can i see the president  why answered the senator somewhat taken aback why tonight if you like im going to the white house in a few minutes and i think i can arrange it  ttomorrow afternoonttomorrow afternoon  the senator cast his eye over the swallowtail coat and stovepipe hat tilted back and laughed  thunder he exclaimed you havent changed a bit im beginning to look like an old man but that milkandcrackers diet seems to keep you young jethro ill fix it for tomorrow afternoon  wwhat timetwo  well ill fix it for two tomorrow afternoon i never could understand you jethro you dont do things like other men do i smell gunpowder whats up nowwhat do you want to see grant about  jethro cast his eye around the corridor where a few men were taking their ease after supper and looked at the senator mysteriously  any place where we can talk he demanded  we can go into the writing room and shut the door answered the senator more amused than ever  when cynthia came downstairs jethro was standing with the gentleman in the corridor leading to the dining room and she heard the gentleman say as he took his departurei havent forgotten what you did for us in 70 jethro ill go right along and see to it now  cynthia liked the gentlemans looks and rightly surmised that he was one of the big men of the nation she was about to ask jethro his name when ephraim came limping along and put the matter out of her mind and the three went into the almost empty dining room there they were served with elaborate attention by a darky waiter who had in some mysterious way learned jethros name and title cynthia reflected with pride that jethro too was one of the nations great men who could get anything he wanted simply by coming to the capital and asking for it  ephraim was very much excited on finding himself in washington the sight of the place reviving in his mind a score of forgotten incidents of the war after supper they found seats in a corner of the corridor where a number of people were scattered about smoking and talking it did not occur to jethro or cynthia or even to ephraim that these people were all of the male sex and on the other hand the guests of the hotel were apparently used once in a while to see a lady from the country seated there at any rate cynthia was but a young girl and her two companions however unusual their appearance were clearly most respectable jethro his hands in his pockets and his hat tilted sat on the small of his back rapt in meditation cynthia her head awhirl looked around her with sparkling eyes while ephraim was smoking a cigar he had saved for just such a festal occasion he did not see the stout man with the button and corded hat until he was almost on top of him  eph prescott i believe exclaimed the stout one how be you comrade  heedless of his rheumatism ephraim sprang to his feet and dropped the cigar which the stout one picked up with much difficulty  well said ephraim in a voice that shook with unwonted emotion you kin skin me if it aint amasy beard his eye travelled around amasas figure wouldnt aknowed you i swan i wouldnt why when i seen you last amasy your stomach was havin all it could do to git hold of your backbone  cynthia laughed outright and even jethro sat up and smiled  when was it said amasa still clinging on to ephraims hand and incidentally to the cigar which ephraim had forgotten beaver creek wahnt it  july 10 1863 said ephraim instantly  gradually they reached a sitting position the cigar was restored to its rightful owner and mr beard was introduced with some ceremony to cynthia and jethro from beaver creek they began to fight the war over again backward and forward much to cynthias edification when her attention was distracted by the entrance of a street band of wind instruments as the musicians made their way to another corner and began tuning up she glanced mischievously at jethro for she knew his peculiarities by heart one of these was a most violent detestation of any but the best music he had often given her this excuse laughingly for not going to meeting in coniston how he had come by his love for good music cynthia never knewhe certainly had not heard much of it  suddenly a great volume of sound filled the corridor and the band burst forth into what many supposed to be the watch on the rhine some people were plainly delighted the veterans once recovered from their surprise shouted their reminiscences above the music undismayed jethro held on to himself until the refrain when he began to squirm and as soon as the tune was done and the scattering applause had died down he reached over and grabbed mr amasa beard by the knee mr beard did not immediately respond being at that moment behind logworks facing a rebel charge he felt vaguely that some one was trying to distract his attention and in some lobe of his brain was registered the fact that that particular knee had gout in it jethro increased the pressure and then mr beard abandoned his logworks and swung around with a snort of pain  hhow much do they git for that noisehhow much do they git  mr beard tenderly lifted the hand from his knee and stared at jethro with his mouth open like a man aroused from a bad dream  who what noise he demanded  the dutchmen said jethro hhow much do they git for that noise  oh mr beard glanced at the band and began to laugh he thought jethro a queer customer no doubt but he was a friend of comrade prescotts by gum said mr beard i thought for a minute a rebel chainshot had took my leg off well sir i guess that band gets about two dollars theyve come in here every evening since ive been at the hotel  ttwo dollars is that the price eryou say two dollars is their price  thereabouts answered mr beard uneasily veteran as he was jethros appearance and earnestness were a little alarming  you say two dollars is their price  thereabouts shouted mr beard seating himself on the edge of his chair  but jethro paid no attention to him he rose unfolding by degrees his six feet two and strode diagonally across the corridor toward the band leader conversation was hushed at the sight of his figure a titter ran around the walls but jethro was oblivious to these things he drew a great calfskin wallet from an inside pocket of his coat and the band leader a florid german laid down his instrument and made an elaborate bow jethro waited until the man had become upright and then held out a twodollar bill  is that about right for the performance he said is that about right  ja mein herr said the man nodding vociferously  i want to pay whats righti want to pay whats right said jethro  i thank you very much sir said the leader finding his english you haf pay for all  ppaid for everythingeverything tonight demanded jethro  the leader spread out his hands  you haf pay for one whole evening said he and bowed again  then take it take it said jethro pushing the bill into the mans palm but dont you come back tonightdont you come back tonight  the amazed leader stared at jethroand words failed him there was something about this man that compelled him to obey and he gathered up his followers and led the way silently out of the hotel roars of laughter and applause arose on all sides but jethro was as one who heard them not as he made his way back to his seat again  you did a good job my friend said mr beard approvingly im going to take eph prescott down the street to see some of the boys wont you come too  mr beard doubtless accepted it as one of the mans eccentricities that jethro did not respond to him for without more ado he departed arm in arm with ephraim jethro was looking at cynthia who was staring toward the desk at the other end of the corridor her face flushed and her fingers closed over the arms of her chair it never occurred to jethro that she might have been embarrassed  wwhats the matter cynthy he asked sinking into the chair beside her  her breath caught sharply but she tried to smile at him he did not discover what was the matter until long afterward when he recalled that evening to mind jethro was a man used to hotel corridors used to sitting in an attitude that led the unsuspecting to believe he was half asleep but no person of note could come or go whom he did not remember he had seen the distinguished party arrive at the desk preceded by a host of bellboys with shawls and luggage on the other hand some of the distinguished party had watched the proceeding of paying off the band with no little amusement miss janet duncan had giggled audibly her mother had smiled while her father and mr worthington had pretended to be deeply occupied with the hotel register somers was not there bob worthington laughed heartily with the rest until his eye travelling down the line of jethros progress fell on cynthia and now he was striding across the floor toward them and even in the horrible confusion of that moment cynthia had a vagrant thought that his clothes had an enviable cut and became him remarkably  well of all things to find you here he cried this is the best luck that ever happened i am glad to see you i was going to steal away to brampton for a couple of days before the term opened and i meant to look you up there and mr bass said bob turning to jethro im glad to see you too  jethro looked at the young man and smiled and held out his hand it was evident that bob was blissfully unaware that hostilities between powers of no mean magnitude were about to begin that the generals themselves were on the ground and that he was holding treasonable parley with the enemy the situation appealed to jethro especially as he glanced at the backs of the two gentlemen facing the desk these backs seemed to him full of expression ththank you bob ththank you he answered  i like the way you fixed that band said bob i havent laughed as much for a year you hate music dont you i hope youll forgive that awful noise we made outside of your house last july mr bass  youyou make that noise bob youyou make that  well said bob im afraid i did most of it there was another fellow that helped some and played the guitar it was pretty bad he added with a side glance at cynthia but it was meant for a compliment  oh said she it was meant for a compliment was it  of course he answered glad of the opportunity to turn his attention entirely to her i was for slipping away right after supper but my father headed us off  slipping away repeated cynthia  you see he had a kind of a reception and fireworks afterward we didnt get away till after nine and then i thought id have a lecture when i got home  did you asked cynthia  no said bob he didnt know where id been  cynthia felt the blood rush to her temples but by habit and instinct she knew when to restrain herself  would it have made any difference to him where you had been she asked calmly enough  bob had a presentiment that he was on dangerous ground this new and selfpossessed cynthia was an enigma to himcertainly a fascinating enigma  my father world have thought i was a fool to go off serenading he answered flushing bob did not like a lie he knew that his father would have been angry if he had heard he had gone to coniston he felt in the small of his back that his father was angry mow and guessed the reason  she regarded him gravely as he spoke and then her eyes left his face and became fixed upon an object at the far end of the corridor bob turned in time to see janet duncan swing on her heel and follow her mother up the stairs he struggled to find words to tide over what he felt was an awkward moment  weve had a fine trip he said though i should much rather have stayed at home the west is a wonderful country with its canons and mountains and great stretches of plain my father met us in chicago and we came here i dont know why because washingtons dead at this time of the year i suppose it must be on account of politics looking at jethro with a sudden inspiration i hadnt thought of that  jethro had betrayed no interest in the conversation he was seated as usual on the small of his back but he saw a young man of short stature with a freckled face and closecropped curly red hair come into the corridor by another entrance he saw isaac d worthington draw him aside and speak to him and he saw the young man coming towards them  how do you do miss wetherell cried the young man joyously while still ten feet away im awfully glad to see you upon my word i am how long are you going to be in washington  i dont know mr duncan answered cynthia  did worthy know you were here demanded mr duncan suspiciously  he did when he saw me said cynthia smiling  not till then asked mr duncan say worthy your father wants to see you right away im going to be in washington a day or twowill you go walking with me tomorrow morning miss wetherell  shes going walking with me said bob not in the best of tempers  then ill go along said mr duncan promptly  by this time cynthia got up and was holding out her hand to bob worthington im not going walking with either of you she said i have another engagement and i think ill have to say good night because im very tired  when can i see you both the young men asked the question at once  oh youll have plenty of chances she answered and was gone  the young men looked at each other somewhat blankly and then down at jethro who did not seem to know that they were there and then they made their way toward the desk but isaac d worthington and his friends had disappeared  a few minutes later the distinguishedlooking senator with whom jethro had been in conversation before supper entered the hotel he seemed preoccupied and heedless of the salutations he received but when he caught sight of jethro he crossed the corridor rapidly and sat down beside him jethro did not move the corridor was deserted now save for the two  bass began the senator whats the row up in your state  hhavent heard of any row said jethro  what did you come to washington for demanded the senator somewhat sharply  ervacation said jethro vacationto show my gal cynthy the capital  now see here bass said the senator i dont forget what happened in 70 i dont object to wading through a swarm of bees to get a little honey for a friend but i think im entitled to know why he wants it  ggot the honey asked jethro  the senator took off his hat and wiped his brow and then he stole a look at jethro with apparently barren results  jethro he said people say you run that state of yours right up to the handle whats all this trouble about a twoforacent postmastership  hhavent heard of any trouble said jethro  well there is trouble said the senator losing patience at last when i told grant you were here and mentioned that little brampton matter to himit didnt seem much to methe bees began to fly pretty thick i can tell you i saw right away that somebody had been stirring em up it looks to me jethro said the senator gravely it looks to me as if you had something of a rebellion on your hands  wwhatd grant say jethro inquired  well he didnt say a great dealhe isnt much of a talker you know but what he did say was to the point it seems that your man prescott doesnt come from brampton in the first place and grant says that while he likes soldiers he hasnt any use for the kind that want to lie down and make the government support em ill tell you what i found out worthington and duncan wired the president this morning and theyve gone up to the white house now theyve got a lot of railroad interests back of them and theyve taken your friend sutton into camp but i managed to get the president to promise not to do anything until he saw you tomorrow afternoon at two  jethro sat silent so long that the senator began to think he wasnt going to answer him at all in his opinion he had told jethro some very grave facts  wwhen are you going to see the president again said jethro at last  tomorrow morning answered the senator he wants me to walk over with him to see the postmastergeneral who is sick in bed  what time do you leave the white house  at eleven said the senator very much puzzled  ergrant ever pay any attention to an old soldier on the street  the senator glanced at jethro and a twinkle came into his eye  sometimes he has been known to he answered  youyou ever pay any attention to an old soldier on the street  then the senators eyes began to snap  sometimes i have been known to  ersuppose an old soldier was in front of the white house at eleven oclockan old soldier with a gal suppose  the senator saw the point and took no pains to restrain his admiration  jethro he said slapping him on the shoulder im willing to bet a few thousand dollars youll run your state for a while yet     chapter v  heard you say you was goin for a walk this morning cynthy jethro remarked as they sat at breakfast the next morning  why of course answered cynthia cousin eph and i are going out to see washington and he is to show me the places that he remembers she looked at jethro appealingly arent you coming with us she asked  mmeet you at eleven cynthy he said  eleven exclaimed cynthia in dismay thats almost dinnertime  mmeet you in front of the white house at eleven said jethro plumb in front of it under a tree  by halfpast seven cynthia and ephraim with his green umbrella were in the street but it would be useless to burden these pages with a description of all the sights they saw and with the things that ephraim said about them and incidentally about the war after new york much of washington would then have seemed small and ragged to any one who lacked ideals and a national sense but washington was to cynthia as athens to a greek to her the marble capitol shining on its hill was a sacred temple and the great shaft that struck upward through the sunlight though yet unfinished a fitting memorial to him who had led the barefoot soldiers of the colonies through ridicule to victory they looked up many institutions and monument they even had time to go to the navy yard and they saved the contemplation of the white house till the last the white house which cynthia thought the finest and most graceful mansion in all the world in its simplicity and dignity a fitting dwelling for the chosen of the nation under the little tree which jethro had mentioned ephraim stood bareheaded before the walls which had sheltered lincoln which were now the home of the greatest of his captains grant and wondrous emotions played upon the girls spirit too as she gazed they forgot the present in the past and the future and they did not see the two gentlemen who had left the portico some minutes before and were now coming toward them along the sidewalk  the two gentlemen however slowed their steps involuntarily at a sight which was uncommon even in washington the girls arm was in the soldiers and her face which even in repose had a true nobility now was alight with an inspiration that is seen but seldom in a lifetime in marble could it have been wrought by a great sculptor men would have dreamed before it of high things  the two indeed might have stood for a group the girl as the spirit the man as the body which had risked and suffered all for it and still held it fast for the honest face of the soldier reflected that spirit as truly as a mirror  ephraim was aroused from his thoughts by cynthia nudging his arm he started put on his hat and stared very hard at a man smoking a cigar who was standing before him then he stiffened and raised his hand in an involuntary salute the man smiled he was not very tall he had a closely trimmed light beard that was growing a little gray he wore a soft hat something like ephraims a black tie on a white pleated shirt and his eyeglasses were pinned to his vest his eyes were all kindness  how do you do comrade he said holding out his hand  general said ephraim mr president he added correcting himself how be you he shifted the green umbrella and shook the hand timidly but warmly  general will do said the president with a smiling glance at the tall senator beside him i like to be called general  youve growed some older general said ephraim scanning his face with a simple reverence and affection but you haint changed so much as id a thought since i saw you whittlin under a tree beside the lacy house in the wilderness  my duty has changed some answered the president quite as simply he added with a touch of sadness i liked those days best comrade  well i guess exclaimed ephraim youre general over everything now but youre not a mite bigger man to me than you was  the president took the compliment as it was meant  i found it easier to run an army than i do to run a country he said  ephraims blue eyes flamed with indignation  i dont take no stock in the bulldogs and the gold harness at long branch andand all them lies the dratted newspapers print about youephraim hammered his umbrella on the pavement as an expression of his feelingsand whats more the people dont  the president glanced at the senator again and laughed a little quietly  thank you comrade he said  youre a plain common man continued ephraim paying the highest compliment known to rural new england the people think a sight of you or they wouldnt hev chose you twice general  so you were in the wilderness said the president adroitly changing the subject  yes general i was pressed into orderly duty the first daythats when i saw you whittlin under the tree and you didnt seem to have no more consarn than if it had been a company drill had a cigar then too but the second day may the 6th i was with the regiment ill never forget that day said ephraim warming to the subject when we was fightin ewell up and down the orange plank road playin hideandseek with the johnnies in the woods you remember them woods general  the president nodded his cigar between his teeth he looked as though the scene were coming back to him  never seen such woods said ephraim scrub oak and pine and cedars and young stuff springin up until you couldnt see the length of a company and the rebs jumpin and hollerin around and shoutin every which way after a while a lot of them saplings was mowed off clean by the bullets and then the woods caught afire and that was hell  were you wounded asked the president quickly  i was hurt some in the hip answered ephraim  some exclaimed cynthia why you have walked lame ever since she knew the story by heart but the recital of it never failed to stir her blood they carried him out just as he was going to be burned up in a blanket hung from rifles and he was in the hospital nine months and had to come home for a while  cynthy said ephraim in gentle reproof i callate the general dont want to hear that  cynthia flushed but the president looked at her with an added interest  my dear young lady he said that seems to me the vital part of the story if i remember rightly he added turning again to ephraim the fifth corps was on the orange turnpike what brigade were you in  the third brigade of the first division answered ephraim  griffins said the president there were several splendid new england regiments in that brigade i sent them with griffin to help sheridan at five forks  i was thar too cried ephraim  what said the president with the lame hip  well general i went back i couldnt help it i couldnt stay away from the boysjust couldnt i didnt limp as bad then as i do now i wahnt much use anywhere else and i had larned to fight five forks exclaimed ephraim i call that day to mind as if it was yesterday i remember how the boys yelled when they told us we was goin to sheridan we got started about daylight and it took us till four oclock in the afternoon to git into position the woods was just comin a little green and the white dogwoods was bloomin around sheridan he galloped up to the line with that black horse of hisn and hollered out come on boys go in at a clean jump or you wont ketch one of em you know how men even veterans like that fifth corps sometimes hev to be pushed into a fight there was a man from a maine regiment got shot in the head fust thing im killed said he oh no youre not says sheridan pickup your gun and go for em but he was killed well we went for em through all the swamps and briers and everything and sheridan thar in front had got the battleflag and was rushin round with it swearin and prayin and shoutin and the first thing we knowed hed jumped his horse clean over their logworks and landed right on top of the johnnies  yes said the president that was sheridan sure enough  mr president said the senator who stood by wonderingly while general grant had lost himself in this conversation do you realize what time it is  yes yes said the president we must go on what was your rank comrade  sergeant general  i hope you have got a good pension for that hip said the president kindly it may be well to add that he was not always so incautious but this soldier bore the unmistakable stamp of simplicity and sincerity on his face  ephraim hesitated  he never would ask for a pension general said cynthia  what exclaimed the president in real astonishment are you so rich as all that and he glanced at the green umbrella  well general said ephraim uncomfortably i never liked the notion of gittin paid for it you see i was what they call a wardemocrat  good lord said the president but more to himself what do you do now  i callate to make harness answered ephraim  only he cant make it any more on account of his rheumatism mr president cynthia put in  i think you might call me general too he said with the grace that many simple people found inherent in him and may i ask your name young lady  cynthia wetherellgeneral she said smiling  that sounds more natural said the president and then to ephraim your daughter  i couldnt think more of her if she was answered ephraim cynthys pulled me through some tight spells her mother was my cousin general my names prescottephraim prescott  ephraim prescott ejaculated the president sharply taking his cigar from his mouth ephraim prescott  prescottthats rightprescott general repeated ephraim sorely puzzled by these manifestations of amazement  what did you come to washington for asked the president  well general i kind of hate to tell youi didnt intend to mention that i guess i wont say nothin about it he added weve had such a sociable time ive always ben a little mite ashamed of it general ever since twas first mentioned  good lord said the president again and then he looked at cynthia what is it miss cynthia he asked  it was now cynthias turn to be a little confused  uncle jethrothat is mr bass the president nodded went to cousin eph when he couldnt make harness any more and said hed give him the brampton postoffice  the presidents eyes met the senators and both gentlemen laughed cynthia bit her lip not seeing any cause for mirth in her remark while ephraim looked uncomfortable and mopped the perspiration from his brow  he said hed give it to him did he said the president is mr bass your uncle  oh no general replied cynthia hes really no relation hes done everything for me and i live with him since my father died he was going to meet us here she continued looking around hurriedly im sure i cant think whats kept him  mr president we are half an hour late already said the senator hurriedly  well well said the president i suppose i must go goodby miss cynthia said he taking the girls hand warmly goodby comrade if ever you want to see general grant just send in your name goodby  the president lifted his hat politely to cynthia and passed he said something to the senator which they did not hear and the senator laughed heartily ephraim and cynthia watched them until they were out of sight  godfrey exclaimed ephraim they told me he was hard to talk to why cynthy hes as simple as a child  ive always thought that all great men must be simple said cynthia uncle jethro is  to think that the president of the united states stood talkin to us on the sidewalk for half an hour said ephraim clutching cynthias arm cynthy im glad we didnt press that postoffice matter it was worth more to me than all the postoffices in the union to have that talk with general grant  they waited some time longer under the tree happy in the afterglow of this wonderful experience presently a clock struck twelve  why its dinnertime cynthy said ephraim i guess jethro haint acominmust hev ben delayed by some of them politicians  its the first time i ever knew him to miss an appointment said cynthia as they walked back to the hotel  jethro was not in the corridor so they passed on to the dining room and looked eagerly from group to group jethro was not there either but cynthia heard some one laughing above the chatter of the guests and drew back into the corridor she had spied the duncans and the worthingtons making merry by themselves at a corner table and it was somerss laugh that she heard bob too sitting next to miss duncan was much amused about something suddenly cynthias exaltation over the incident of the morning seemed to leave her and bob worthingtons words which she had pondered over in the night came back to her with renewed force he did not find it necessary to steal away to see miss duncan why should he have stolen away to see her was it because she was a country girl and poor that was true but on the other hand did she not live in the sunlight as it were of uncle jethros greatness and was it not an honor to come to his house and see any one and why had mr worthington turned hid back on jethro and sent for bob when he was talking to them cynthia could not understand these things and her pride was sorely wounded by them  perhaps jethros in his room suggested ephraim  and indeed they found him there seated on the bed poring over some newspapers and both in a breath demanded where he had been ephraim did not wait for an answer  we seen general grant jethro he cried while we was waitin for you under the tree he come up and stood talkin to us half an hour full half an hour wahnt it cynthy  oh yes answered cynthia forgetting her own grievance at the recollection only it didnt seem nearly that long  wwant to know exclaimed jethro in astonishment putting down his paper hhow did it happen  come right up and spoke to us said ephraim in a tone he might have used to describe a miracle jest as if he was common folk never had a more sociable talk with anybody why there was times when i clean forgot he was president of the united states the boys wont believe it when we git back at coniston  and ephraim full of his subject began to recount from the beginning the marvellous affair occasionally appealing to cynthia for confirmation how he had lived over again the wilderness and five forks how the general had changed since he had seen him whittling under a tree how the general had asked about his pension  ddidnt mention the postoffice did you ephraim  why no replied ephraim i didnt like to exactly you see we was havin such a good time i didnt want to spoil it but cynthy  i told the president about it uncle jethro i told him how sick cousin eph had been and that you were going to give him the postmastership because he couldnt work any more with his hands  the training of a lifetime had schooled jethro not to betray surprise  kkind of mixin up in politics haint you cynthy ppresident say hed give you the postmastership eph he asked  he didnt say nothin about it jethro answered ephraim slowly i callate he has other views for the place and he was too kind to come right out with em and spoil our mornin you see jethro i wahnt only a sergeant and bramptons gittin to be a big town  but surely cried cynthia who could scarcely wait for him to finish surely youre going to give cousin eph the postoffice arent you uncle jethro all you have to do is to tell the president that you want it for him why i had an idea that we came down for that  now cynthy ephraim put in deprecatingly  who else would get the postoffice asked cynthia surely youre not going to let mr sutton have it for dave wheelock  ercynthy said jethro slyly wwhatd you say to me once about interferin with womens fixins  cynthia saw the point she perceived also that the mazes of politics were not to be understood by a young woman of even by an old soldier she laughed and seized jethros hands and pulled him from the bed  we wont get any dinner unless we hurry she said  when they reached the dining room she was relieved to discover that the party in the corner had gone  in the afternoon there were many more sights to be viewed but they were back in the hotel again by halfpast four because ephraims wilderness leg had its limits of endurance jethro though he had not mentioned the fact to them had gone to the white house  it was during the slack hours that our friend the senator whose interest in the matter of the brampton post office outweighed for the present certain grave problems of the administration in which he was involved hurried into the willard hotel looking for jethro bass he found him without much trouble in his usual attitude occupying one of the chairs in the corridor  well exclaimed the senator with a touch of eagerness he did not often betray did you see grant how about your old soldier hes one of the most delightful characters i ever metsimple as a child and he laughed at the recollection that was a masterstroke of yours bass putting him under that tree with that pretty girl i doubt if you ever did anything better in your life did they tell you about it  yes said jethro they told me about it  and how about grant what did he say to you  wwell i went up there and sent in my card ddidnt have to wait a great while as i was pretty early and soon he came in smokin a black cigar head bent forward a little ddidnt ask me to sit down and what talkin we did we did standin ddidnt ask me what he could do for me what i wanted or anything else but just stood there and i stood there ffust time in my life i didnt know how to commerce or what to say lookedlooked at medidnt take his eye off me after a while i got started somehow told him i was there to ask him to appoint ephraim prescott to the brampton postofficettold him all about ephraim from the time he was locked in the cradlenever was so hard put that i could remember

listened to more of it ttold him about ephraims wilderness bulletsttold him about ephraims rheumatismhow it bothered him when he went to bed and when he got up again  if jethro had glanced at his companion he would have seen the senator was shaking with silent and convulsive laughter  all the time i talked to him i didnt see a muscle move in his face jethro continued so i started in again and he lookedlookedlooked right at me wwouldnt winkdont think he winked once while i was in that room i watched him as close as i could and i watched to see if a muscle moved or if i was makin any impression all he would do was to stand there and looklooklook kkept me there ten minutes and never opened his mouth at all hardest man to talk to i ever metnever see a man before but what i could get him to say somethin if it was only a cuss word i got tired of it after a while made up my mind that i had found one man i couldnt move then what bothered me was to get out of that room if id a had a bible i believe id a read it to him i didnt know what to say but i did say this after a whilewwell mr president i guess ive kept you long enoughgguess youre a pretty busy man hhope youll give mr prescott that postmastership erer goodby  wait sir he said  yes i said iill wait  thought you was goin to give him that postmastership mr bass he said  at this point the senator could not control his mirth and the empty corridor echoed his laughter  by thunder what did you say to that  eri said mr president i thought i was until a while ago  and when did you change your mind says he  then he laughed a littlenot muchbut he laughed a little  i understand that your old soldier lives within the limits of the delivery of the brampton office said he  thats correct mr president said i  well said he i will appint him postmaster at brampton mr bass  when said i  then he laughed a little more  ill have the appintment sent to your hotel this afternoon said he  then i said to him this has come out full better than i expected mr president im much obliged to you he didnt say nothin more so i come out  grant didnt say anything about worthington or duncan did he asked the senator curiously as he rose to go  gguess ive told you all he said answered jethro twahnt a great deal  the senator held out his hand  bass he said laughing i believe you came pretty near meeting your match but if grants the hardest man in the union to get anything out of ive a notion whos the second and with this parting shot the senator took his departure chuckling to himself as he went  as has been said there were but few visitors in washington at this time and the hotel corridor was all but empty presently a substantiallooking gentleman came briskly in from the street nodding affably to the colored porters and bellboys who greeted him by name he wore a flowing prince albert coat which served to dignify a growing portliness and his coalblack whiskers glistened in the light a voice which appeared to come from nowhere in particular brought the gentleman up standing  how be you heth  it may not be that mr suttons hand trembled but the ashes of his cigar fell to the floor he was not used to visitations and for the instant if the truth be told he was not equal to looking around  like washington hethlike washington  then mr sutton turned his presence of mind and that other presence of which he was so proud seemed for the moment to have deserted him  sstick pretty close to business heth comin down here out of session time sstick pretty close to business dont you since the people sent you to congress  mr sutton might have offered another man a cigar or a drink but as is well known jethro was proof against tobacco or stimulants  well said the honorable heth catching his breath and making a dive i am surprised to see you jethro which was probably true  ththought you might be said jethro erglad to see me hethglad to see me  as has been recorded it is peculiarly difficult to lie to people who are not to be deceived  why certainly i am answered the honorable heth swallowing hard certainly i am jethro i meant to have got to coniston this summer but i was so busy  peoples business i understand erhear youve gone in for highminded politics hethrread a highminded speech of yourstwo highminded speeches always thought you was a highminded man heth  how did you like those speeches jethro asked mr sutton striving as best he might to make some show of dignity  ththought they was highminded said jethro  then there was a silence for mr sutton could think of nothing more to say and he yearned to depart with a great yearning but something held him there  heth said jethro after a while you was always very friendly and obliging youve done a great many favors for me in your life  ive always tried to be neighborly jethro said mr sutton but his voice sounded a little husky even to himself  and i may have done one or two little things for you heth jethro continued but i cant remember exactly ercan you remember heth  mr sutton was trying with becoming nonchalance to light the stump of his cigar he did not succeed this time he pulled himself together with a supreme effort  i think weve both been mutually helpful jethro he said mutually helpful  well said jethro reflectively i dont know as i could have put it as well as thattheres somethin in being an orator  there was another silence a much longer one the honorable heth threw his butt away and lighted another cigar suddenly as if by magic his aplomb returned and in a flash of understanding he perceived the situation he saw himself once more as the successful congressman the trusted friend of the railroad interests and he saw jethro as a discredited boss he did not stop to reflect that jethro did not act like a discredited boss as a keener man might have done but if the honorable heth had been a keener man he would not have been at that time a congressman mr sutton accused himself of having been stupid in not grasping at once that the tables were turned and that now he was the one to dispense the gifts  kkind of fortunate you stopped to speak to me heth nnow i come to think of it i hev a little favor to ask of you  ah exclaimed mr sutton blowing out the smoke of course anything i can do jethroanything in reason  wwouldnt ask a highminded man to do anything he hadnt ought to said jethro the fact is id like to git eph prescott appointed at the brampton postoffice you can fix that hethcant youyou can fix that  mr sutton stuck his thumb into his vest pocket and cleared his throat  i cant tell you how sorry i am not to oblige you jethro but ive arranged to give that postoffice to dave wheelock  aarranged it hev youaarranged it  why yes said mr sutton scarcely believing his own ears could it be possible that he was using this patronizingly kind tone to jethro bass  well thats too bad said jethro ggot it all fixed hev you  practically answered mr sutton grandly indeed i may go as far as to say that it is as certain as if i had the appointment here in my pocket im sorry not to oblige you jethro but these are matters which a member of congress must look after pretty closely he held out his hand but jethro did not appear to see ithe had his in his pockets ive an important engagement said the honorable heth consulting a large gold watch are you going to be in washington long  gguess ive about got through hethgguess ive about got through said jethro  well if you have time and theres any other little thing im in room 29 said mr sutton as he put his foot on the stairway  ttold worthington you got that appintment for wheelockttold worthington jethro called out after him  mr sutton turned and waved his cigar and smiled in acknowledgment of this parting bit of satire he felt that he could afford to smile a few minutes later he was ensconced on the sofa of a private sitting room reviewing the incident with much gusto for the benefit of mr isaac d worthington and mr alexander duncan both of these gentlemen laughed heartily for the honorable heth sutton knew the art of telling a story well at least and was often to be seen with a group around him in the lobbies of congress     chapter vi  about five oclock that afternoon ephraim was sitting in his shirtsleeves by the window of his room and cynthia was reading aloud to him an article about the war of course from a washington paper which his friend mr beard had sent him there was a knock at the door and cynthia opened it to discover a colored hallboy with a roll in his hand  mistah ephum prescott he said  yes answered ephraim thats me  cynthia shut the door and gave him the roll but ephraim took it as though he were afraid of its contents  guess its some of them war records from amasy he said  oh cousin eph exclaimed cynthia excitedly why dont you open it if you dont i will  guess youd better cynthy and he held it out to her with a trembling hand  cynthia did open it and drew out a large document with seals and printing and signatures  cousin eph she cried holding it under his nose cousin eph youre postmaster of brampton  ephraim looked at the paper but his eyes swam and he could only make out a dancing bronze seal  i want to know he exclaimed fetch jethro  but cynthia had already flown on that errand curiously enough she ran into jethro in the hall immediately outside of ephraims door ephraim got to his feet it was very difficult for him to realize that his troubles were ended that he was to earn his living at last he looked at jethro and his eyes filled with tears i guess i cant thank you as id ought to jethro he said leastways not now  ill thank him for you cousin eph said cynthia and she did  ddont thank me said jethro i didnt have much to do with it eph thank the president  ephraim did thank the president in one of the most remarkable letters from a literary point of view ever received at the white house for the art of literature largely consists in belief in what one is writing and ephraims letter had this quality of sincerity and no lack of vividness as well he spent most of the evening in composing it  cynthia too had received a letter that daya letter which she had read several times now with a smile and again with a pucker of the forehead which was meant for a frown dear cynthia it said where do you keep yourself i am sure you would not be so cruel if you knew that i was aching to see you aching cynthia repeated the word and remembered the glimpse she had had of him in the dining room with miss janet duncan whenever i have been free cynthia repeated this also somewhat ironically although she conceded it the merit of frankness whenever i have been free i have haunted the corridors for a sight of you think of me as haunting the hotel desk for an answer to this telling me when i can see youand where ps i shall be around all evening and it was signed your friend and playmate r worthington  it is a factnot generally knownthat cynthia did answer the lettertwice but she sent neither answer even at that age she was given to reflection and much as she may have approved of the spirit of the letter she liked the tone of it less cynthia did not know a great deal of the world it is true but the felt instinctively that something was wrong when bob resorted to such means of communication and she was positively relieved or thought that she was when she went down to supper and discovered that the table in the corner was empty  after supper ephraim had his letter to write and jethro wished to sit in the corridor but cynthia had learned that the corridor was not the place for a girl so she explainedto jethro that he would find her in the parlor if he wanted her and that she was going there to read that parlor cynthia thought a handsome room with its high windows and lace curtains its long mirrors and marbletopped tables she established herself under a light on a sofa in one corner and sat with the book on her lap watching the people who came and went she had that delicious sensation which comes to the young when they first travelthe sensation of being a part of the great world and she wished that she knew these people and which were the great and which the little ones some of them looked at her intently she thought too intently and at such times she pretended to read she was aroused by hearing some one sayingisnt this miss wetherell  cynthia looked up and caught her breath for the young lady who had spoken was none other than miss janet duncan herself seen thus startlingly at close range miss duncan was not at all like what cynthia had expectedbut then most people are not janet duncan was in fact one of those strange persons who do not realize the picture which their names summon up she was undoubtedly goodlooking her hair of a more golden red than her brothers was really wonderful her neck was slender and she had a strange dreamy face that fascinated cynthia who had never seen anything like it  she put down her book on the sofa and got up not without a little tremor at this unexpected encounter  yes im cynthia wetherell she replied  to add to her embarrassment miss duncan seized both her hands impulsively and gazed into her face  youre really very beautiful she said do you know it  cynthias only answer to this was a blush she wondered if all city girls were like miss duncan  i was determined to come up and speak to you the first chance i had janet continued ive been making up stories about you  stories exclaimed cynthia drawing away her hands  romances said miss duncanreal romances sometimes i think im going to be a novelist because im always weaving stories about people that i see people who interest me i mean and you look as if you might be the heroine of a wonderful romance  cynthias breath was now quite taken away  oh she said ihad never thought that i looked like that  but you do said miss duncan youve got all sorts of possibilities in your faceyou look as if you might have lived for ages  as old as that exclaimed cynthia really startled  perhaps i dont express myself very well said the other hastily i wish you could see what ive written about you already i can do it so much better with pen and ink ive started quite a romance already  what is it asked cynthia not without interest  sit down on the sofa and ill tell you said miss duncan ive done it all from your face too ive made you a very poor girl brought up by peasants only you are really of a great family although nobody knows it a rich duke sees you one day when he is hunting and falls in love with you and you have to stand a lot of suffering and persecution because of it and say nothing i believe you could do that added janet looking critically at cynthias face  i suppose i could if i had to said cynthia but i shouldnt like it  oh it would do you good said janet it would ennoble your character not that it needs it she added hastily and i could write another story about that quaint old man who paid the musicians to go away and who made us all laugh so much  cynthias eye kindled  mr bass isnt a quaint old man she said hes the greatest man in the state  miss duncans patronage had been of an unconscious kind she knew that she had offended but did not quite realize how  im so sorry she cried i didnt mean to hurt you you live with him dont youconiston  yes replied cynthia not knowing whether to laugh or cry  ive heard about coniston it must be quite a romance in itself to live all the year round in such a beautiful place and to make your own clothes yours become you very well said miss duncan although i dont know why theyre not at all in style and yet they give you quite an air of distinction i wish i could live in coniston for a year anyway and write a book about you my brother and bob worthington went out there one night and serenaded you didnt they  yes said cynthia that peculiar flash coming into her eyes again and i think it was very foolish of them  do you exclaimed miss duncan in surprise i wish somebody would serenade me i think it was the most romantic thing bob ever did hes wild about you and so is somers they have both told me so in confidence  cynthias face was naturally burning now  if it were true she said they wouldnt have told you about it  i suppose thats so said miss duncan thoughtfully only youre very clever to have seen it now that i know you i think you a more remarkable person than ever you dont seem at all like a country girl and you dont talk like one  cynthia laughed outright she could not help liking janet duncan mere flesh and blood not being proof against such compliments  i suppose its because my father was an educated man she said he taught me to read and speak when i was young  why you are just like a person out of a novel who was your father  he kept the store at coniston answered cynthia smiling a little sadly she would have liked to have added that william wetherell would have been a great man if he had had health but she found it difficult to give out confidences especially when they were in the nature of surmises  well said janet stoutly i think that is more like a story than ever do you know she continued i saw you once at the state capital outside of our grounds the day bob ran after you that was when i was in love with him we had just come back from europe then and i thought he was the most wonderful person i had ever seen  if cynthia had felt any emotion from this disclosure she did not betray it janet moreover was not looking for it  what made you change your mind asked cynthia biting her lip  oh bob hasnt the temperament said janet making use of a word that she had just discovered hes too practicalhe never does or says the things you want him to hes just been out west with us on a trip and he was always looking at locomotives and brakes and grades and bridges and all such tiresome things i should like to marry a poet said miss duncan dreamily i know they want me to marry bob and mr worthington wants it im sure of that but he wouldnt at all suit me  if cynthia had been able to exercise an equal freedom of speech she might have been impelled to inquire what young mr worthingtons views were in the matter as it was she could think of nothing appropriate to say and just then four people entered the room and came towards them two of these were janets mother and father and the other two were mr worthington the elder and the honorable heth sutton mrs duncan whom janet did not at all resemble was a person who naturally commanded attention she had strong features and a very decided though not disagreeable manner  i couldnt imagine what had become of you janet she said coming forward and throwing off her lace shawl whom have you founda school friend  no mamma said janet this is cynthia wetherell oh said mrs duncan looking very hard at cynthia in a nearsighted way and not knowing in the least who she was you havent seen senator and mrs meade have you janet they were to be here at eight oclock  no said janet turning again to cynthia and scarcely hearing the question  janet hasnt seen them dudley said mrs duncan going up to mr worthington who was pulling his chop whiskers by the door janet has discovered such a beautiful creature she went on in a voice which she did not take the trouble to lower do look at her alexander and you mr suttonwho are such a bureau of useful information do tell me who she is perhaps she comes from your part of the countryher names wetherell  wetherell why of course i know her said mr sutton who was greatly pleased because mrs duncan had likened him to an almanac greatly pleased this evening in every respect and even the diamond in his bosom seemed to glow with a brighter fire he could afford to be generous tonight and he turned to mr worthington and laughed knowingly shes the ward of our friend jethro he explained  what is she demanded mrs duncan who knew and cared nothing about politics a country girl i suppose  yes replied mr sutton a country girl from a little village not far from clovelly a good girl i believe in spite of the atmosphere in which she has been raised  its really wonderful mr sutton how you seem to know every one in your district including the women and children said the lady but i suppose you wouldnt be where you are if you didnt  the honorable heth cleared his throat  wetherell mr duncan was saying staring at cynthia through his spectacles where have i heard that name  he must suddenly have remembered and recalled also that he and his ally worthington had been on opposite sides in the woodchuck session for he sat down abruptly beside the door and remained there for a while for mr duncan had never believed mr merrills explanation concerning poor william wetherell s conduct  pretty aint she said mr sutton to mr worthington guess shes more dangerous than jethro now that weve clipped his wings a little the congressman had heard of bobs infatuation  isaac d worthington however was in a good humor this evening and was moved by a certain curiosity to inspect the girl though what he had seen and heard of his sons conduct with her had annoyed him he did not regard it seriously  arent you going to speak to your constituent mr sutton said mrs duncan who was bored because her friends had not arrived a congressman ought to keep on the right side of the pretty girls you know  it hadnt occurred to the honorable heth to speak to his constituent the ways of mrs duncan sometimes puzzled him and he could not see why that lady and her daughter seemed to take more than a passing interest in the girl but if they could afford to notice her certainly he could so he went forward graciously and held out his hand to cynthia interrupting miss duncan in the middle of a discourse upon her diary  how do you do cynthia said mr sutton had he been in coniston he would have said how be you  cynthia took the hand but did not rise somewhat to mr suttons annoyance a certain respect was due to a member of congress and the rajah of clovelly  how do you do mr sutton said cynthia very coolly  i like her remarked mrs duncan to mr worthington  this is a splendid trip for you eh cynthia mr sutton persisted with a praiseworthy determination to be pleasant  it has turned out to be so mr sutton replied cynthia this was not precisely the answer mr sutton expected and to tell the truth he didnt know quite what to make of it  a great treat to see washington and new york isnt it said mr sutton kindly a great treat for a coniston girl i suppose you came through new york and saw the sights  is there another way to get to washington asked cynthia  mrs duncan nudged mr worthington and drew a little nearer while mr sutton began to wish he had not been lured into the conversation cynthia had been very polite but there was something in the quiet manner in which the girls eyes were fixed upon him that made him vaguely uneasy he could not back out with dignity and he felt himself on the verge of becoming voluble mr sutton prided himself on never being voluble  why no he answered we have to go to new york to get anywhere in these days there was a slight pause uncle jethro taking you and mr prescott on a little pleasure trip he had not meant to mention jethros name but he found himself to his surprise a little at a loss for a subject  well partly a pleasure trip its always a pleasure for uncle jethro to do things for others said cynthia quietly although people do not always appreciate what he does for them  the honorable heth coughed he was now very uncomfortable indeed how much did this astounding young person know whom he had thought so innocent  i didnt discover he was in town until i ran across him in the corridor this evening should have liked to have introduced him to some of the washington folkssome of the big men although not many of em are here mr sutton ran on not caring to notice the little points of light in cynthias eyes the idea of mr sutton introducing uncle jethro to anybody i havent seen ephraim prescott it must be a great treat for him too to get away on a little trip and see his army friends how is he  hes very happy said cynthia  happy exclaimed mr sutton oh yes of course ephraims always happy in spite of his troubles and his rheumatism i always liked ephraim prescott  cynthia did not answer this remark at all and mr sutton suspected strongly that she did not believe it therefore he repeated it  i always liked ephraim i want you to tell jethro that im downright sorry i couldnt get him that brampton postmastership  ill tell him that you are sorry mr sutton replied cynthia gravely but i dont think itll do any good  not do any goodwhat did the girl mean mr sutton came to the conclusion that he had been condescending enough that somehow he was gaining no merit in mrs duncans eyes by this kindness to a constituent he buttoned up his coat rather grandly  i hope you wont misunderstand me cynthia he said i regret extremely that my sense of justice demanded that i should make david wheelock postmaster at brampton and i have made him so  it was now cynthias turn to be amazed  but she exclaimed but cousin ephraim is postmaster of brampton  mr sutton started violently and that part of his face not hidden by his whiskers seemed to pale and mr worthington usually selfpossessed took a step forward and seized him by the arm  what does this mean sutton he said  mr sutton pulled himself together and glared at cynthia  i think you are mistaken said he the congressman of the district usually arranges these matters and the appointment will be sent to mr wheelock tomorrow  but cousin ephraim already has the appointment said cynthia it was sent to him this afternoon and he is up in his room now writing to thank the president for it  what in the worlds the matter cried mrs duncan in astonishment  cynthias simple announcement had indeed caused something of a panic among the gentlemen present mr duncan had jumped up from his seat beside the door and mr worthington his face anything but impassive tightened his hold on the congressmans arm  good god sutton he exclaimed can this be true  as for cynthia she was no less astonished than mrs duncan by the fact that these rich and powerful gentlemen were so excited over a little thing like the postmastership of brampton but mr sutton laughed it was not hearty but still it might have passed muster for a laugh  nonsense he exclaimed making a fair attempt to regain his composure the girls got it mixed up with something elseshe doesnt know what shes talking about  mrs duncan thought the girl did look uncommonly as if she knew what she was talking about and mr duncan and mr worthington had some such impression too as they stared at her cynthias eyes flashed but her voice was no louder than before  i am used to being believed mr sutton she said but heres uncle jethro himself you might ask him  they all turned in amazement and one at least in trepidation to perceive jethro bass standing behind them with his hands in his pockets as unconcerned as though he were under the butternut tree in coniston  how be you heth he said erstill got that appointment ppractically in your pocket  uncle jethro said cynthia mr sutton does not believe me when i tell him that cousin ephraim has been made postmaster of brampton he would like to have you tell him whether it is so or not  but this as it happened was exactly what the honorable heth did not want to have jethro tell him how he got out of the parlor of the willard house he has not to this day a very clear idea as a matter of fact he followed mr worthington and mr duncan and they made their exit by the farther door jethro did not appear to take any notice of their departure  janet said mrs duncan i think senator and mrs meade must have gone to our sitting room then to cynthias surprise the lady took her by the hand i cant imagine what youve done my dear she said pleasantly but i believe that you are capable of taking care of yourself and i like you  thus it will be seen that mrs duncan was an independent person sometimes heiresses are apt to be  and i like you too said janet taking both of cynthias hands and i hope to see you very very often  jethro looked after them  erthe women folks seem to have some sense he said then he turned to cynthia bben havin some fun with heth cynthy he inquired  i havent any respect for mr sutton said cynthia indignantly it serves him right for presuming to think that he could give a postoffice to any one  jethro made no remark concerning this presumption on the part of the congressman of the district cynthias indignation against mr sutton was very real and it was some time before she could compose herself sufficiently to tell jethro what had happened his enjoyment as he listened may be imagined but presently he forgot this and became aware that something really troubled her  uncle jethro she asked suddenly why do they treat me as they do  he did not answer at once this was because of a pain around his hearthad she known it he had felt that pain before  hhow do they treat you cynthy  she hesitated she had not yet learned to use the word patronize in the social sense and she was at a loss to describe the attitude of mrs duncan and her daughter though her instinct had registered it she was at a loss to account for mr worthingtons attitude too mr suttons she bitterly resented  are they your enemies she demanded  jethro was in real distress  if they are she continued i wont speak to them again if they cant treat me asas your daughter ought to be treated ill turn my back on them i ami am just like your daughteram i not uncle jethro  he put out his hand and seized hers roughly and his voice was thick with suffering  yes cynthy he said youyoure all ive got in the world  she squeezed his hand in return  i know it uncle jethro she cried contritely i oughtnt to have troubled you by asking youyou have done everything for me much more than i deserve and i shant be hurt after this when people are too small to appreciate how good you are and how great  the pain tightened about jethros hearttightened so sharply that he could not speak and scarcely breathe because of it cynthia picked up her novel and set the bookmark  now that cousin eph is provided for lets go back to coniston uncle jethro a sudden longing was upon her for the peaceful life in the shelter of the great ridge and she thought of the village maples all red and gold with the magic touch of the frosts not that i havent enjoyed my trip she added but we are so happy there  he did not look at her because he was afraid to  ccynthy he said after a little pause ththought wed go to boston  boston uncle jethro  ertomorrowat onetomorrowlike to go to boston  yes she said thoughtfully i remember parts of it the common where i used to walk with daddy and the funny old streets that went uphill it will be nice to go back to coniston that wayover truro pass in the train  that night a piece of news flashed over the wires to new england and the next morning a small item appeared in the newcastle guardian to the effect that one ephraim prescott had bean appointed postmaster at brampton copied in the local papers of the state it caused some surprise in brampton to be sure and excitement in coniston perhaps there were but a dozen men however who saw its real significance who knew through this item that jethro bass was still supremethat the railroads had failed to carry this first position in their war against him  it was with a light heart the next morning that cynthia packed the little leather trunk which had been her fathers ephraim was in the corridor regaling his friend mr beard with that wonderful encounter with general grant which sounded so much like a fifth reader anecdote of a chance meeting with royalty jethros room was full of visiting politicians so cynthia when she had finished her packing went out to walk about the streets alone scanning the people who passed her looking at the big houses and wondering who lived in them presently she found herself in the middle of the morning seated on a bench in a little park surrounded by colored mammies and children playing in the paths it seemed a long time since she had left the hills and this glimpse of cities had given her many things to think and dream about would she always live in coniston or was her future to be cast among those who moved in the world and helped to sway it cynthia felt that she was to be of these though she could not reason why and she told herself that the feeling was foolish perhaps it was that she knew in the bottom of her heart that she had been given a spirit and intelligence to cope with a larger life than that of coniston with a sense that such imaginings were vain she tried to think what the would do if she were to become a great lady like mrs duncan  she was aroused from these reflections by a distant glimpse through the trees of mr robert worthington he was standing quite alone on the edge of the park his hands in his pockets staring at the white house cynthia half rose and then sat down and looked at him again he wore a light gray loosefitting suit and a straw hat and she could not but acknowledge that there was something stalwart and clean and altogether appealing in him she wondered indeed why he now failed to appeal to miss duncan and she began to doubt the sincerity of that young ladys statements bob certainly was not romantic but he was a manor would be very soon  cynthia sat still although her impulse was to go away she scarcely analyzed her feeling of wishing to avoid him it may not be well indeed to analyze them on paper too closely she had an instinct that only pain could come from frequent meetings and she knew now what but a week ago was a surmise that he belonged to the world of which she had been dreamingmrs duncans world again there was that mysterious barrier between them of which she had seen so many evidences and yet she sat still on her bench and looked at him  presently he turned slowly as if her eyes had compelled his she sat stillit was too late then in less than a minute he was standing beside her looking down at her with a smile that had in it a touch of reproach  how do you do mr worthington said cynthia quietly  mr worthington he cried you havent called me that before we are not children any more she said  what difference does that make  a great deal said cynthia not caring to define it  cynthia said mr worthington sitting down on the beach and facing her do you think youve treated me just right  of course i do she said or i should have treated you differently  bob ignored such quibbling  why did you run away from that baseball game in brampton and why couldnt you have answered my letter yesterday if it were only a line and why have you avoided me here in washington  it is very difficult to answer for another questions which one cannot answer for ones self  i havent avoided you said cynthia  ive been looking for you all over town this morning said bob with pardonable exaggeration and i believe that idiot somers has too  then why should you call him an idiot cynthia flashed  bob laughed  how you do catch a fellow up said he admiringly we both found out youd gone out for a walk alone  how did you find it out  well said bob hesitating we asked the colored doorkeeper  mr worthington said cynthia with an indignation that made him quail do you think it right to ask a doorkeeper to spy on my movements  im sorry cynthia he gasped ii didnt think of it that wayand he wont tell desperate cases require desperate remedies you know  but cynthia was not appeased  if you wanted to see me she said why didnt you send your card to my room and i would have come to the parlor  but i did send a note and waited around all day  how was she to tell him that it was to the tone of the note she objectedto the hint of a clandestine meeting she turned the light of her eyes full upon him  would you have been content to see me in the parlor she asked did you mean to see me there  why yes said he i would have given my head to see you anywhere only  only what  duncan might have came in and spoiled it  spoiled what  bob fidgeted  look here cynthia he said youre not stupidfar from it of course you know a fellow would rather talk to you alone  i should have been very glad to have seen mr duncan too  you would would you he exclaimed i shouldnt have thought that  isnt he your friend asked cynthia  oh yes said bob and one of the best in the world onlyi shouldnt have thought youd care to talk to him and he looked around for fear the vigilant mr duncan was already in the park and had discovered them cynthia smiled and immediately became grave again  so it was only on mr duncans account that you didnt ask me to come down to the parlor she said  bob was in a quandary he was a truthful person and he had learned something of the world through his three years at cambridge he had seen many young women and many kinds of them but the girl beside him was such a mixture of innocence and astuteness that he was wholly at a loss how to deal with herhow to parry her searching questions  naturallyi wanted to have you all to myself he said you ought to know that  cynthia did not commit herself on this point she wished to go mercilessly to the root of the matter but the notion of what this would imply prevented her bob took advantage of her silence  everybody who sees you falls a victim cynthia he went on mrs duncan and janet lost their hearts you ought to have heard them praising you at breakfast he paused abruptly thinking of the rest of that conversation and laughed bob seemed fated to commit himself that day i heard the way you handled heth sutton he said plunging in ill bet he felt as if hed been dropped out of the thirdstory window and bob laughed again id have given a thousand dollars to have been there somers and i went out to supper with a classmate who lives in washington in that house over there and he pointed casually to one of the imposing mansions fronting on the park mrs duncan said shed never heard anybody lay it on the way you did i dont believe you half know what happened cynthia you made a tenstrike  a tenstrike she repeated  well he said you not only laid out heth but my father and mr duncan too mrs duncan laughed at emshe isnt afraid of anything but they didnt say a word all through breakfast ive never seen my father so mad he ought to have known better than to run up against uncle jethro  how did they run up against uncle jethro asked cynthia now keenly interested  dont you know exclaimed bob in astonishment  no said cynthia or i shouldnt have asked  didnt uncle jethro tell you about it  he never tells me anything about his affairs she answered  bobs astonishment did not wear off at once here was a new phase and he was very hard put he had heard casually a good deal of abuse of jethro and his methods in the last two days  well he said i dont know anything about politics i dont know myself why father and mr duncan were so eager for this postmastership but they were and i heard them say something about the president going back on them when they had telegraphed from chicago and come to see him here and maybe they didnt let heth in for it it seems uncle jethro only had to walk up to the white house they ought to have sense enough to know that he runs the state but whats the use of wasting time over this business said bob i told you i was going to brampton before the term begins just to see you didnt i  yes but i didnt believe you said cynthia  why not he demanded  because its my nature i suppose she replied  this was too much for bob exasperated though he was and he burst into laughter  youre the queerest girl ive ever known he said  not a very original remark  that must be saying a great deal she answered  why  you must have known many  i have he admitted and none of em no matter how much theyd knocked about were able to look out for themselves any better than you  not even cassandra hopkins cynthia could not resist saying she saw that she had scored his expressions registered his sensations so accurately  what do you know about her he said  oh said cynthia mysteriously i heard that you were very fond of her at andover  bob could not help pluming himself a little he thought the fact that she had mentioned the matter a flaw in cynthias armor as indeed it was and yet he was not proud of the cassandra hopkins episode in his career  cassandra is one of the institutions at andover said he most fellows have to take a course in cassandra to complete their education  yours seems to be very complete cynthia retorted  great scott he exclaimed looking at her no wonder you made mincemeat of the honorable heth where did you learn it all cynthia  cynthia did not know she merely wondered where she would be if she hadnt learned it something told her that if it were not for this anchor she would be drifting out to sea might indeed soon be drifting out to sea in spite of it it was one thing for mr robert worthington with his numerous resources to amuse himself with a girl in her position it would be quite another thing for the girl she got to her feet and held out her hand to him  goodby she said  goodby  we are leaving washington at one oclock and uncle jethro will be worried if i am not in time for dinner  leaving at one thats the worst luck ive had yet but im going back to the hotel myself  cynthia didnt see how she was to prevent him walking with her she would not have admitted to herself that she had enjoyed this encounter since she was trying so hard not to enjoy it so they started together out of the park bob for a wonder was silent awhile glancing now and then at her profile he knew that he had a great deal to say but he couldnt decide exactly what it was to be this is often the case with young men in his state of mind in fact to be paradoxical again he might hardly be said at this time to have had a state of mind he lacked both an attitude and a policy  if you see duncan before i do let me know he remarked finally  cynthia bit her lip why should i she asked  because weve only got five minutes more alone together at best if we see him in time we can go down a side street  i think it would be hard to get away from mr duncan if we met himeven if we wanted to she said laughing outright  you dont know how true that is he replied with feeling  that sounds as though youd tried it before  he paid no attention to this thrust  i shant see you again till i get to brampton he said that will be a whole week and then he ventured to look at her i shant see you until the christmas holidays you might be a little kind cynthia you know iveive always thought the world of you i dont know how im going to get through the three months without seeing you  you managed to get through a good many years said cynthia looking at the pavement  i know he said i was sent away to school and college and our lives separated  yes our lives separated she assented  and i didnt know you were going to be likelike this he went on vaguely enough but with feeling  like what  likewell id rather be with you and talk to you than any girl i ever saw i dont care who she is bob declared or how much she may have traveled he was running into deep water why are you so cold cynthia why cant you be as you used to be you used to like me well enough  and i like you now answered cynthia they were very near the hotel by this time  you talk as if you were ten years older than i he said smiling plaintively  she stopped and turned to him smiling they had reached the steps  i believe i am bob she replied i havent seen much of the world but ive seen something of its troubles dont be foolish if youre coming to brampton just to see me dont come goodby and she gave him her hand frankly  but i will come to brampton he cried taking her hand and squeezing it id like to know why i shouldnt come  as cynthia drew her hand away a gentleman came out of the hotel paused for a brief moment by the door and stared at them and then passed on without a word or a nod of recognition it was mr worthington bob looked after his father and then glanced at cynthia there was a trifle more color in her cheeks and her head was raised a little and her eyes were fixed upon him gravely  you should know why not she said and before he could answer her she was gone into the hotel he did not attempt to follow her but stood where she had left him in the sunlight  he was aroused by the voice of the genial colored doorkeeper  wal suh you found the lady mistah wothington thought you would suh tother young gentleman come in while agolooked as if he was feelin powerful bad mistah wothington     chapter vii  when they reached boston cynthia felt almost as if she were home again and ephraim declared that he had had the same feeling when he returned from the war though it be the prosperous capital of new england it is a city of homes and the dwellers of it have held stanchly to the belief of their forefathers that the home is the very foundationrock of the nation held stanchly to other beliefs too that wealth carries with it some little measure of responsibility the stranger within the gates of that city feels that if he falls a heedless world will not go charging over his body that a helping hand will be stretched outa helping and a wise hand that will inquire into the circumstances of his fallbut still a human hand  they were sitting in the parlor of the tremont house that morning with the sun streaming in the windows waiting for ephraim  uncle jethro cynthia asked abruptly did you ever know my mother  jethro started and looked at her quickly  wwhy cynthy he asked  because she grew up in coniston answered cynthia i never thought of it before but of course you must have known her  yes i knew her he said  did you know her well she persisted  jethro got up and went over to the window where he stood with his back toward her  yes cynthy he answered at length  why havent you ever told me about her asked cynthia how was she to know that her innocent questions tortured him cruelly that the spirit of the cynthia who had come to him in the tannery house had haunted him all his life and that she herself a new cynthia was still that spirit the bygone cynthia had been much in his thoughts since they came to boston  what was she like  sheshe was like you cynthy he said but he did not turn round she was a clever woman and a good woman anda lady cynthy  the girl said nothing for a while but she tingled with pleasure because jethro had compared her to her mother she determined to try to be like that if he thought her so  uncle jethro she said presently id like to go to see the house where she lived  erephraim knows it said jethro  so when ephraim came the three went over the hill past the state house which bulfinch set as a crown on the crest of it looking over the sweep of the common and on into the maze of quaint oldworld streets on the slope beyond streets with white porticos and violet panes in the windows they came to an old square hidden away on a terrace of the hill and after that the streets grew narrower and dingier ephraim whose memory never betrayed him hobbled up to a shabby house in the middle of one of these blocks and rang the bell  heres where i found will when i come back from the war he said and explained the matter in full to the slatternly landlady who came to the door she was a goodnatured woman who thought her boarder would not mind and led the way up the steep stairs to the chamber over the roofs where wetherell and cynthia had lived and hoped and worked together where he had written those pages by which with the aid of her loving criticism he had thought to become famous the room was as bare now as it had been then and ephraim poking his stick through a hole in the carpet ventured the assertion that even that had not been changed jethro staring out over the chimney tops passed his hand across his eyes cynthia ware had come to this  i found him right here in that bed ephraim was saying and he poked the bottom boards too the same bed had a shack when i saw him callate he wouldnt have lived two months if the war hadnt bust up and i hadnt come along  oh cousin eph exclaimed cynthia  the old soldier turned and saw that there were tears in her eyes but stranger than that cynthia saw that there were tears in his own he took her gently by the arm and led her down the stairs again she supporting him and jethro following  that same morning jethro whose memory was quite as good as ephraims found a little shop tucked away in cornhill which had been miraculously spared in the advance of prosperity mr judsons name however was no longer in quaint lettering over the door standing before it jethro told the story in his droll way of a city clerk and a country bumpkin and cynthia and ephraim both laughed so heartily that the people who were passing turned round to look at them and laughed too for the three were an unusual group even in boston it was not until they were seated at dinner in the hotel ephraim with his napkin tucked under his chin that jethro gave them the key to the characters in this story  and who was the locket for uncle jethro demanded cynthia  jethro however shook his head and would not be induced to tell  they were still so seated when cynthia perceived coming toward them through the crowded dining roam a merry middleaged gentleman with a bald head he seemed to know everybody in the room for he was kept busy nodding right and left at the tables until he came to theirs he was mr merrill who had come to see her father in coniston and who had spoken so kindly to her on that occasion  well well well he said jethro youll be the death of me yet dont writesend eh well as long as you sent word you were here i dont complain so you licked em again ehdown in washington never had a doubt but what you would is this the new postmaster how are you mr prescottand cynthiaa young lady bless my soul said mr merrill looking her over as he shook her hand what have you done to her jethro what kind of beauty powder do they use in coniston  mr merrill took the seat next to her and continued to talk scattering his pleasantries equally among the three patting her arm when her own turn came she liked mr merrill very much he seemed to her as indeed he was honest and kindhearted cynthia was not lacking in a proper appreciation of herselfthat may have been discovered but she was puzzled to know why this gentleman should make it a point to pay such particular attention to a young country girl other railroad presidents whom she could name had not done so she was thinking of these things rather than listening to mr merrills conversation when the sound of mr worthingtons name startled her  well jethro mr merrill was saying you certainly nipped this little game of worthingtons in the bud thought hed take you in the rear by going to washington did he ha ha id like to know how you did it ill get you to tell me tonightsee if i dont youre all coming in to supper tonight you know at seven oclock  ephraim laid down his knife and fork for the first time were the wonders of this journey never to cease and jethro once in his life looked nervous  erercynthyll go stevecynthyll go  yes cynthyll go laughed mr merrill and youll go and ephraimll go although he by no means liked everybody as would appear at first glance mr merrill had a way of calling people by their first names when he did fancy them  ersteve said jethro what would your wife say if i was to drink coffee out of my saucer  lets see said mr merrill grave for once whats the punishment for that in my house i know what shed do if you didnt drink it what do you think shed do cynthy  ask him what was the matter with it said cynthia promptly  well cynthy said he i know why these old fellows take you round with em to take care of em eh theyre not fit to travel alone  and so it was settled after much further argument that they were all to sup at mr merrills house cynthia stoutly maintaining that she would not desert them and then mr merrill having several times repeated the street and number went back to his office there was much mysterious whispering between ephraim and jethro in the hotel parlor after dinner while cynthia was turning over the leaves of a magazine and then ephraim proposed going out to see the sights  wheres uncle jethro going she asked  hell meet us said ephraim promptly but his voice was not quite steady  oh uncle jethro cried cynthia youre trying to get out of it you remember you promised to meet us in washington  guess hell keep this appintment said ephraim who seemed to be full of a strange mirth that bubbled over for he actually winked at jethro  went first to faneuil hall presently they found themselves among the crowd in washington street where ephraim confessed the trepidation which he felt over the coming supper party a trepidation greater so he declared many times than he had ever experienced before any of his battles in the war he stopped once or twice in the eddy of the crowd to glance up at the numbers and finally came to a halt before the windows of a large drygoods store  i guess i ought to buy a new shirt for this occasion cynthy he said staring hard at the articles of apparel displayed there lets go in  cynthia laughed outright since ephraim could not by any chance have worn any of the articles in question  why cousin ephraim she exclaimed you cant buy gentlemens things here  oh i guess you can said ephraim and hobbled confidently in at the doorway there we will leave him for a while conversing in an undertone with a floorwalker and follow jethro he curiously enough had some fifteen minutes before gone in at the same doorway questioned the same floorwalker and he found himself in due time walking amongst a bewildering lot of models on the third floor followed by a giggling saleswoman  what kind of a dress do you want sir asked the salesladyfor we are impelled to call her so  ssilk cloth said jethro  what shades of silk would you like sir  shades shades what do you mean by shades  why colors said the saleslady giggling openly  green said jethro with considerable emphasis  the saleslady clapped her hand over her mouth and led the way to another model  you dont call that greendo you thats not green enough  they inspected another dress and then another and anothernot all of them were greenjethro expressing very decided if not expert views on each of them at last he paused before two models at the far end of the room passing his hand repeatedly over each as he had done so often with the cattle of coniston  these two pieces same kind of goods he demanded  yes  erthis one is a little shinier than that one  perhaps the finish is a little higher ventured the saleslady  shshinier said jethro  yes shinier if you please to call it so  wwhat would you call it  by this time the saleslady had become quite hysterical and altogether incapable of performing her duties jethro looked at her for a moment in disgust and in his predicament cast around for another to wait on him there was no lack of these at a safe distance but they all seemed to be affected by the same mania jethros eye alighted upon the back of another customer she was apparently a respectablelooking lady of uncertain age and her own attention was so firmly fixed in the contemplation of a model that she had not remarked the merriment about her nor its cause she did not see jethro either as he strode across to her indeed her first intimation of his presence was a dig in her arm the lady turned gave a gasp of amazement at the figure confronting her and proceeded to annihilate it with an eye that few women possess  hhow do maam he said had he known anything about the appearance of women in general he might have realized that he had struck a tartar this lady was at least sixtyfive and probably unmarried her face though not at all unpleasant was a study in characterdevelopment she wore ringlets a peculiar bonnet of a bygone age and her clothes had certain eccentricities which for lack of knowledge must be omitted in short the lady was no fool and not being one she glanced at the giggling group of saleswomen andwonderful to relatethey stopped giggling then she looked again at jethro and gave him a smile one of superiority no doubt but still a smile  how do you do sir  ttrying to buy a silk cloth gown for a woman theres two over here i fancied a little erthought perhaps youd help me  where are the dresses she demanded abruptly  jethro led the way in silence until they came to the models she planted herself in front of them and looked them over swiftly but critically  what is the age of the lady  wwhat difference does that make said jethro whose instinct was against committing himself to strangers  difference she exclaimed sharply it makes a considerable difference perhaps not to you but to the lady what coloring is she  ccoloring shes white  his companion turned her back on him  what size is she  aabout that size said jethro pointing to a model  about about she ejaculated and then she faced him now look here my friend she said vigorously theres something very mysterious about all this you look like a good man but you may be a very wicked one for all i know ive lived long enough to discover that appearances especially where your sex is concerned are deceitful unless you are willing to tell me who this lady is for whom you are buying silk dresses and what your relationship is to her i shall leave you and mind no evasions i can detect the truth pretty well when i hear it  unexpected as it was jethro gave back a step or two before this onslaught of feminine virtue and the movement did not tend to raise him in the ladys esteem he felt that he would rather face general grant a thousand times than this person she was indeed preparing to sweep away when there came a familiar taptap behind them on the bare floor and he turned to behold ephraim hobbling toward them with the aid of his green umbrella cynthia by his side  why its uncle jethro cried cynthia looking at him and the lady in astonishment and then with equal astonishment at the models what in the world are you doing here then a light seemed to dawn on her  you frauds so this is what you were whispering about this is the way cousin ephraim buys his shirts  ccynthy said jethro apologetically ddont you think you ought to have a nice city dress for that supper party  so youre ashamed of my country clothes are you she asked gayly  wwant you to have the best cynthy he replied iimeant to have it all chose and bought when you come but i got into a kind of argument with this lady  argument exclaimed the lady but she did not seem displeased she had been staring very fixedly at cynthia my dear she continued kindly you look like some one i used to know a long long time ago and ill be glad to help you your uncle may be sensible enough in other matters but i tell him frankly he is out of place here let him go away and sit down somewhere with the other gentleman and well get the dress between us if hell tell us how much to pay  ppay anything sos you get it said jethro  uncle jethro do you really want it so much  it must not be thought that cynthia did not wish for a dress too but the sense of dependence on jethro and the fear of straining his purse never quite wore off so jethro and ephraim took to a bench at some distance and at last a dress was chosennot one of the gorgeous models jethro had picked out but a pretty simple girlish gown which cynthia herself had liked and of which the lady highly approved not content with helping to choose it the lady must satisfy herself that it fit which it did perfectly and so cynthia was transformed into a city person though her skin glowed with a health with which few city people are blessed  my dear said the lady still staring at her you look very well i should scarcely have supposed it cynthia took the remark in good part for she thought the lady a character which she was i hope you will remember that we women were created for a higher purpose than mere beauty the lord gave us brains and meant that we should use them if you have a good mind as i believe you have learn to employ it for the betterment of your sex for the time of our emancipation is at hand having delivered this little lecture the lady continued to stare at her with keen eyes you look very much like someone i used to love when i was younger what is your name  cynthia wetherell  cynthia wetherell was your mother cynthia ware from coniston  yes said cynthia amazed  in an instant the strange lady had risen and had taken cynthia in her embrace new dress and all  my dear she said i thought your face had a familiar look it was your mother i knew and loved im miss lucretia penniman  miss lucretia penniman could this be indeed the authoress of the hymn to coniston of whom brampton was so proud the miss lucretia penniman who sounded the first clarion note for the independence of american women the friend of bryant and hawthorne and longfellow cynthia had indeed heard of her did not all brampton point to the house which had held the social library as to a shrine  cynthia said miss lucretia i have a meeting now of a girls charity to which i must go but you will come to me at the offices of the womans hour tomorrow morning at ten i wish to talk to you about your mother and yourself  cynthia promised provided they did not leave for coniston earlier and in that event agreed to write whereupon miss lucretia kissed her again and hurried off to her meeting on the way back to the tremont house cynthia related excitedly the whole circumstance to jethro and ephraim ephraim had heard of miss lucretia of course who had not but he did not read the womans hour jethro was silent perhaps he was thinking of that fresh summer morning so long ago when a girl in a gig had overtaken him in the canon made by the brampton road through the woods the girl had worn a poke bonnet and was returning a book to this same miss lucretia pennimans social library and the book was the life of napoleon bonaparte  uncle jethro shall we still be in boston tomorrow morning cynthia asked  he roused himself yes he said yes when are you going home  he did not answer this simple question but countered haint you enjoyin yourself cynthy  of course i am she declared but she thought it strange that he would not tell her when they would be in coniston  ephraim did buy a new shirt and also in view of the postmastership in his packet a new necktie his old one being slightly frayed  the grandeur of the approaching supper party and the fear of mrs merrill hung very heavy over him nor was jethros mind completely at rest ephraim even went so far as to discuss the question as to whether mr merrill had not surpassed his authority in inviting him and full expected to be met at the door by that gentleman uttering profuse apologies which ephraim was quite prepared and willing to take in good faith  nothing of the kind happened however mr merrills railroad being a modest one his house was modest likewise but ephraim thought it grand enough and yet acknowledged a homelike quality in its grandeur he began by sitting on the edge of the sofa and staring at the cutglass chandelier but in five minutes he discovered with a shock of surprise that he was actually leaning back describing in detail how his regiment had been cheered as they marched through boston and incredible as it may seem the person whom he was entertaining in this manner was mrs stephen merrill herself mrs merrill was as tall as mr merrill was short she wore a black satin dress with a big cameo brooch pinned at her throat her hair was gray and her face almost masculine until it lighted up with a wonderfully sweet smile that smile made ephraim and jethro feel at home and cynthia too who liked mrs merrill the moment she laid eyes on her  then there were the daughters jane and susan who welcomed her with a hospitality truly amazing for city people jane was bigboned like her mother but susan was short and plump and merry like her father susan talked and laughed and jane sat and listened and smiled and cynthia could not decide which she liked the best and presently they all went into the dining room to supper where there was another chandelier over the table there was also real silver which shone brilliantly on the white clothbut there was nothing to eat  do tell us another story mr prescott said susan who had listened to his last one  the sight of the table however had for the moment upset ephraim get jethro to tell you how he took dinner with jedge binney he said  this suggestion under the circumstances might not have been a happy one but its lack of appropriateness did not strike jethro either he yielded to the demand  well he said i supposed i was goin to set down same as i would at home where we put the vittles on the table wwondered what i was goin to eatwahnt nothin but a piece of bread on the table ssat there and watched emnobody ate anything presently i found out that binneys wife ran her house same as they run hotels pretty soon a couple of girls come in and put down some food and took it away again before you had a chance aafter a while we had coffee and when i set my cup on the table i noticed mis binney looked kind of cross and began whisperin to the girls one of em fetched a small plate and took my cup and set it on the plate that was all right i used the plate  well along about next summer binney had to come to coniston to see me on a little matter and fetched his wife listy my wife was alive then id made up my mind that if i could ever get mis binney to eat at my place i would so i asked em to stay to dinner when we set down i said now mis binney you and the judge take right hold and anything you cant reach speak out and well wait on you and mis binney  yes she said she was a little mite scared i guess bbegun to suspect somethin  mis binney said i yyou can set your cup and sarcer where youve a mind to oought to have heard the judge laugh says he to his wife fanny i told you jethrod get even with you some time for that sarcer business  this story strange as it may seem had a great success at mr merrills table mr merrill and his daughter susan shrieked with laughter when it was finished while mrs merrill and jane enjoyed themselves quite as much in their quiet way even the two neat irish maids who were serving the supper very much as poor mis binneys had been served were fain to leave the dining room abruptly and one of them disgraced herself at sight of jethro when she came in again and had to go out once mare mrs merrill insisted that jethro should pour out his coffee in what she was pleased to call the oldfashioned way all of which goes to prove that tablesilver and cut glass chandeliers do not invariably make their owners heartless and inhospitable and ephraim whose plan of campaign had been to eat nothing to speak of and have a meal when he got back to the hotel found that he wasnt hungry when he arose from the table  there was much bantering of jethro by mr merrill which the ladies did not understandtalk of a mighty coalition of the big railroads which was to swallow up the little railroads fortunately said mr merrill humorously fortunately they did not want his railroad or unfortunately which was it jethro didnt know he never laughed at anybodys jokes but cynthia who was listening with one ear while susan talked into the other gathered that jethro had been struggling with the railroads and was sooner or later to engage in a mightier struggle with them how she asked herself in her innocence was any one even uncle jethro to struggle with a railroad many other people in these latter days have asked themselves that very question  all together the evening at mr merrills passed off so quickly and so happily that ephraim was dismayed when he discovered that it was ten oclock and he began to make elaborate apologies to the ladies but jethro and mr merrill were still closeted together in the dining room once mrs merrill had been called to that conference and had returned after a while to take her place quietly again among the circle of ephraims listeners now mr merrill came out of the dining room alone  cynthia he said and his tone was a little more grave than usual your uncle jethro wants to speak to you  cynthia rose with a sense of something in the air which concerned her and went into the dining room was it the light falling from above that brought out the lines of his face so strongly cynthia did not know but she crossed the room swiftly and sat down beside him  what is it uncle jethro  ccynthy he said putting his hand over hers on the table i want you to do something for me erfor me he repeated emphasizing the last word  ill do anything in the world for you uncle jethro she answered you know that whatwhat is it  llike mr merrill dont you yes indeed  llike mrs merrilllike the

youyoull be happy here cynthy itll be a change for you and i shant be so lonesome as youd think illill be busy this winter cynthy  you know that i wouldnt leave you uncle jethro she said reproachfully

for me  she was silent a long while before she turned to him and then the tears were running very swiftly down her cheeks  yes i will do it for you she answered uncle jethro i believe you are the best man in the world  ddont say that cynthyddont say that he exclaimed and a sharp agony was in his voice he got to his feet and went to the folding doors and opened them steve he called steve  ssays shell stay steve  mr merrill had come in followed by his wife cynthia saw them but dimly through her tears and while she tried to wipe the tears away she felt mrs merrills arm about her and heard that lady saywell try to make you very happy my dear and send you back safely in the spring     chapter viii  an attempt will be made in these pages to set down such incidents which alone may be vital to this chronicle now so swiftly running on the reasons why mr merrill was willing to take cynthia into his house must certainly be clear to the reader in the first place he was under very heavy obligations to jethro bass for many favors in the second place mr merrill had a real affection for jethro which strange as it may seem to some was quite possible and in the third place mr merrill had taken a fancy to cynthia and he had never forgotten the unintentional wrong he had done william wetherell mr merrill was a man of impulses and generally of good impulses had he not himself urged upon jethro the arrangement it would never have come about lastly he had invited cynthia to his house that his wife might inspect her and mrs merrills verdict had been instant and favorablea verdict not given in words a single glance was sufficient for these good people so understood each other that mrs merrill had only to raise her eyes to her husbands and this she did shortly after the supper party began while she was pouring the coffee to be exact thus the compact that cynthia was to spend the winter in their house was ratified  there was first of all the parting with jethro and the messages with which he and ephraim were laden for the whole village and town of coniston it was very hard that parting and need not be dwelt upon ephraim waved his blue handkerchief as the train pulled out but jethro stood on the platform silent and motionless more eloquent in his sorrowso mr merrill thoughtthan any human being he had ever known mr merrill wondered if jethros sorrow were caused by this parting alone he believed it was not and suddenly guessed at the true note of it having come by chance upon the answer to the riddle mr merrill stood still with his hand on the carriage door and marvelled that he had not seen it all sooner he was a man to take to heart the troubles of his friends a subtle change had indeed come over jethro and he was not the same man mr merrill had known for many years would others the men with whom jethro contended and the men he commanded mark this change and what effect would it have on the conflict for the mastery of a state which was to be waged from now on  father said his daughter susan if you dont get in and close the door well drive off and leave you standing on the sidewalk  thus cynthia went to her new friends in their own carriage mrs merrill was goodness itself and loved the girl for what she was how indeed was she to help loving her cynthia was scrupulous in her efforts to give no trouble and yet she never had the air of a dependent or a beneficiary but held her head high and when called upon gave an opinion as though she had a right to it the very first morning susan who was prone to be late to breakfast came down in a great state of excitement and laughter  what do you think cynthias done mother she cried i went into her room a while ago and it was all swept and aired and she was making up the bed  thats an excellent plan said mrs merrill tomorrow morning you three girls will have a race to see who makes up her room first  it is needless to say that the race at bedmaking never came off susan and jane having pushed cynthia into a corner as soon as breakfast was over and made certain forcible representations which she felt bound to respect and a treaty was drawn up and faithfully carried out between the three that she was to do her own room if necessary to her happiness the chief gainer by the arrangement was the chambermaid  odd as it may seem the misses merrill lived amicably enough with cynthia it is a difficult matter to force an account of the relationship of five people living in one house into a few pages but the fact that the merrills had large hearts makes this simpler there are few families who can accept with ease the introduction of a stranger into their midst even for a time and there are fewer strangers who can with impunity be introduced the sisters quarrelled among themselves as all sisters will and sometimes quarrelled with cynthia but oftener they made her the arbiter of their disputes and asked her advice on certain matters especially was this true of susan whom certain young gentlemen from harvard college called upon more or less frequently and cynthia had all of susans love affairsincluding the current oneby heart in a very short time  as for cynthia there were many subjects on which she had to take the advice of the sisters they did not criticise the joint creations of herself and miss sukey kittredge as frankly as janet duncan had done but jethro had left in mrs merrills hands a certain sufficient sum for new dresses for cynthia and in due time the dresses were got and worn to do them justice the sisters were really sincere in their rejoicings over the very wonderful transformation which they had been chiefly instrumental in effecting  it is not a difficult task to praise a heroine and one that should be indulged in but charily but let some little indulgence be accorded this particular heroine by reason of the life she had led and the situation in which she now found herself a poor coniston girl dependent on one who was not her father though she loved him as a father beholden to these good people who dwelt in a world into which she had no reasonable expectations of entering and which to tell the truth she now feared  it was inevitable that cynthia should be brought into contact with many friends and relations of the family some of these noticed and admired her others did neither others gossiped about mrs merrill behind her back at her own dinners and sewing circles and wondered what folly could have induced her to bring the girl into her house but mrs merrill like many generous people who do not stop to calculate a kindness was always severely criticised  and then there were janes and susans friends in and out of miss sadlers school for mrs merrills influence had been sufficient to induce miss sadler to take cynthia as a day scholar with her own daughters this be it known was a great concession on the part of miss sadler who regarded cynthias credentials as dubious enough and her young ladies were inclined to regard them so likewise some of these young ladies came from other citiesnew york and philadelphia and elsewhereand their fathers and mothers were usually people to be mentioned as a matter of coursewere indeed frequently so mentioned by miss sadler especially when a visitor called at the school  isabel i saw that your mother sailed for europe yesterday or sally your father tells me he is building a gallery for his collection then to the visitor you know the broke house in washington square of course  of course the visitor did but sally or isabel would often imitate miss sadler behind her back showing how well they understood her snobbishness  miss sadler was by no means the type which we have come to recognize in the cartoons as the boston school maam she was a little round person with thin lips and a sharp nose all out of character with her roundness and bright eyes like a birds to do her justice so far as instruction went her scholars were equally well cared for whether they hailed from washington square or washington court house there were indeed none from such rural sorts of placesexcept cynthia but miss sadler did not take her hand on the opening dayor afterwardand ask her about uncle jethro oh no miss sadler had no interest for great men who did not sail for europe or add picture galleries on to their houses cynthia laughed a little bitterly perhaps at the thought of a picture gallery being added to the tannery house and she told herself stoutly that uncle jethro was a greater man than any of the others even if miss sadler did not see fit to mention him so she had her first taste of a kind of wormwood that is very common in the world though it did not grow in coniston  for a while after cynthias introduction to the school she was calmly ignored by many of the young ladies there and once openlysnubbed to use the word in its most disagreeable sense not that she gave any of them any real cause to snub her she did not intrude her own affairs upon them but she was used to conversing kindly with the people about her as equals and for this offence on the third day miss sally broke snubbed her it is hard not to make a heroine of cynthia not to be able to relate that she instantly put miss sallys nose out of joint susan merrill tried to do that and failed signally for miss sallys nose was not easily dislodged susan fought more than one of cynthias battles as a matter of fact cynthia did not know that she had been affronted until that evening she did not tell her friends how she spent the night yearning fiercely for coniston and uncle jethro at times weeping for them if the truth be told how she had risen before the dawn to write a letter and to lay some things in the rawhide trunk the letter was never sent and the packing never finished uncle jethro wished her to stay and to learn to be a lady and stay she would in spite of miss broke and the rest of them she went to school the next day and for many days and weeks thereafter and held communion with the few alone who chose to treat her pleasantly unquestionably this is making a heroine of cynthia  if young men are cruel in their schools what shall be written of young women it would be better to say that both are thoughtless miss sally broke strange as it may seem had a heart and many of the other young ladies whose fathers sailed for europe and owned picture galleries but these young ladies were absorbed especially after vacation in affairs of which a girl from coniston had no part their friends were not her friends their amusements not her amusements and their talk not her talk but cynthia watched them as was her duty and gradually absorbed many things which are useful if not essentialoutward observances of which the world takes cognizance and which she had been sent there by uncle jethro to learn young people of cynthias type and nationality are the most adaptable in the world  before the december snows set in cynthia had made one firm friend at least in boston outside of the merrill family that friend was miss lucretia penniman editress of the womans hour miss lucretia lived in the queerest and quaintest of the little houses tucked away under the hill with the back door a story higher than the fronts an arrangement which in summer enabled the mistress to walk out of her sittingroom windows into a little walled garden in winter that sitting room was the sunniest cosiest room in the city and cynthia spent many hours there reading or listening to the wisdom that fell from the lips of miss lucretia or her guests the sitting room had uneven yellowwhite panelling that fairly shone with enamel mahogany bookcases filled with authors who had chosen to comply with miss lucretias somewhat rigorous censorship there was a table laden with such magazines as had to do with the uplifting of a sex a delightful wavy floor covered with a rose carpet and needless to add not a pin or a pair of scissors out of place in the whole apartment  there is no intention of enriching these pages with miss lucretias homilies their subjectmatter may be found in the files of the womans hour she did not always preach although many people will not believe this statement miss lucretia too had a heart though she kept it hidden away only to be brought out on occasions when she was sure of its appreciation and she grew strangely interested in this selfcontained girl from coniston whose mother she had known miss lucretia understood cynthia who also was the kind who kept her heart hidden the kind who conceal their troubles and sufferings because they find it difficult to give them out so miss lucretia had cynthia to take supper with her at least once in the week and watched her quietly and let her speak of as much of her life as she chosewhich was not much at first but miss lucretia was content to wait and guessed at many things which cynthia did not tell her and made some personal effort unknown to cynthia to find out other things it will be said that she had designs on the girl if so they were generous designs and perhaps it was inevitable that miss lucretia should recognize in every young woman of spirit and brains a possible recruit for the cause  it has now been shown in some manner and as briefly as possible how cynthias life had changed and what it had become we have got her partly through the winter and find her still dreaming of the sparkling snow on coniston and of the wind whirling it on clear cold days like smoke among the spruces of uncle jethro sitting by his stove through the long evenings all alone of rias in his store and moses hatch and lem hallowell and cousin ephraim in his new postoffice uncle jethro wrote for the first time in his lifeletters short letters but in his own handwriting and deserving of being read for curiositys sake if there were time the wording was queer enough and guarded enough but they were charged with a great affection which clung to them like lavender  and cynthia kept them every one and read them over on such occasions when she felt that she could not live another minute out of sight of her mountain  such was the state of affairs one gray afternoon in december when cynthia who was sitting in mrs merrills parlor suddenly looked up from her book to discover that two young men were in the room the young men were apparently quite as much surprised as she and the parlor maid stood grinning behind them  tell miss susan and miss jane ellen said cynthia preparing to depart one of the young men she recognized from a photograph on susans bureau he was for the time being susans his name although it does not matter much was morton browne and he would have been considerably astonished if he had guessed how much of his history cynthia knew it was mr brownes habit to take susan for a walk as often as propriety permitted and on such occasions he generally brought along a goodnatured classmate to take care of jane this apparently was one of the occasions mr browne was tall and dark and generally goodlooking while his friends were usually distinguished for their good nature  mr browne stood between her and the door and looked at her rather fixedly then he saidexcuse me  a great many friendships and even love affairs have been inaugurated by just such an opening  certainly said cynthia and tried to pass out but mr browne had no intention of allowing her to do so if he could help it  i hope i am not intruding he said politely  oh no answered cynthia wondering how she could get by him  were you waiting for miss merrill  oh no said cynthia again  the other young man turned his back and became absorbed in the picture of a lion getting ready to tear a lady to pieces but mr browne was of that mettle which is not easily baffled in such matters he introduced himself and desired to know whom he had the honor of addressing cynthia could not but enlighten him mr browne was greatly astonished and showed it  so you are the mysterious young lady who has been staying here in the house this winter he exclaimed as though it were a marvellous thing i have heard miss merrill speak of you she admires you very much is it true that you come fromconiston  yes she said  let me seewhere is coniston inquired mr browne  do you know where brampton is asked cynthia coniston is near brampton  brampton exclaimed mr browne i have a classmate who comes from bramptonbob worthingtonyou must know bob then  yes cynthia knew mr worthington  his fathers got a mint of money they say ive been told that old worthington was the whole show up in those parts is that true  not quite said cynthia  not quite mr morton browne eyed her in surprise and from that moment she began to have decided possibilities just then jane and susan entered arrayed for the walk but mr browne showed himself in no hurry to depart began to speak indeed in a deprecating way about the weather appealed to his friend mr king if it didnt look remarkably like rain or hail or snow susan sat down jane sat down mr browne and his friend prepared to sit down when cynthia moved toward the door  youre not going cynthia cried susan in a voice that may have had a little too much eagerness in it you must stay and help us entertain mr browne mr king apparently was not to be entertained weve tried so hard to make her come down when people called mr browne but she never would  cynthia was not skilled in the art of making excuses she hesitated for one and was lost so she sat down as far from mr browne as possible next to jane in a few minutes mr browne was seated beside her and how he accomplished this manoeuvre cynthia could not have said so skilfully and gradually was it done for lack of a better subject he chose mr robert worthington related for cynthias delectation several of bobs escapades in his freshman year silly escapades enough but very bold and daring and original they sounded to cynthia who listened if mr browne could have known it with almost breathless interest and forgot all about poor susan talking to mr king did mr worthington still while away his evenings stealing barber poles and being chased around cambridge by irate policemen mr browne laughed at the notion o dear no seniors never descended to that had not miss wetherell heard the song wherein seniors were designated as grave and reverend yes miss wetherell had heard the song she did not say where or how mr worthington said his classmate had become very seriousminded this year was captain of the baseball team and already looking toward the study of law  study law exclaimed cynthia i thought he would go into his fathers mills  do you know bob very well asked mr browne  she admitted that she did not  hes been away from brampton a good deal of course said mr browne who seemed pleased by her admission to do him justice he would not undermine a classmate although he had other rules of conduct which might eventually require a little straightening out worthys a firstrate fellow a little quicktempered perhaps and inclined to go his own way hes got a good mind and hes taken to using it lately he has come pretty near being suspended once or twice  cynthia wanted to ask what suspended was it sounded rather painful but at this instant there was the rattle of a latch key at the door and mr merrill walked in  well well he said spying cynthia so you have got cynthia to come down and entertain the young men at last  yes said susan we have got cynthia to come down at last  susan did not go to cynthias room that night to chat as usual and mr morton brownes photograph was mysteriously removed from the prominent position it had occupied if susan had carried out a plan which she conceived in a moment of folly of placing that photograph on cynthias bureau there would undoubtedly have been a quarrel cynthias own feelingsseeing that mr browne had not dazzled herwere notenviable  but she held her peace which indeed was all she could do and the next time mr browne called though he took care to mention her name particularly at the door she would not go down to entertain him though susan implored and jane appealed she would not go down mr browne called several times again with the same result cynthia was inexorableshe would have none of him then susan forgave her there was no quarrel indeed but there was a reconciliation which is the best part of a quarrel there were tears of susans shedding there was a charactersketch of mr browne of susans drawing and that gentleman flitted lightly out of susans life  some ten days subsequent to this reconciliation ellen the parlor maid brought up a card to cynthias room the card bore the name of mr robert worthington cynthia stared at it and bent it in her fingers while ellen explained how the gentleman had begged that she might see him to tell the truth cynthia had wondered more than once why he had not come before and smiled when she thought of all the assurances of undying devotion she had heard in washington after all she reflected why should she not see himonce he might give her news of brampton and coniston thus willingly deceiving herself she told ellen that she would go down much to the girls delight for cynthia was a favorite in the house  as she entered the parlor mr worthington was standing in the window when he turned and saw her he started to come forward in his old impetuous way and stopped and looked at her in surprise she herself did not grasp the reason for this  can it be possible he said can it be possible that this is my friend from the country and he took her hand with the greatest formality pressed it the least little bit and released it how do you do miss wetherell do you remember me  how do you dobob she answered laughing in spite of herself at his banter you havent changed anyway  it was mr worthington in washington said he now it is bob and miss wetherell rank patronage how did you do it cynthia  you are like all men said cynthia you look at the clothes and not the woman they are not very fine clothes but if they were much finer they wouldnt change me  then it must be miss sadler  miss sadler would willingly change meif she could said cynthia a little bitterly how did you find out i was at miss sadlers  morton browne told me yesterday said bob i felt like punching his head  what did he tell you she asked with some concern  he said that you were here visiting the merrills among other things and said that you knew me  the other things mr browne had said were interesting but flippant he had seen bob at a college club and declared that he had met a witch of a country girl at the merrills he couldnt make her out because she had refused to see him every time he called again he had also repeated cynthias remark about bobs father not being quite the biggest man in his part of the country and ventured the surmise that she was the daughter of a rival mill owner  why didnt you let me know you were in boston said bob reproachfully  why should i asked cynthia and she could not resist adding didnt you find it out when you went to bramptonto see me  well said he getting fiery red the fact isi didnt go to brampton  im glad you were sensible enough to take my advice though i suppose that didnt make any difference butfrom the way you spoke i should have thought nothing could have kept you away  to tell you the truth said bob id promised to visit a fellow named broke in my class who lives in new york and i couldnt get out of it his sister by the way is in miss sadlers i suppose you know her but if id thought youd see me i should have gone to brampton anyway you were so down on me in washington  it was very good of you to take the trouble to come to see me here there must be a great many girls in boston you have to visit  he caught the little note of coolness in her voice cynthia was asking herself whether if mr browne had not seen fit to give a good report of her he would have come at all he would have come certainly it is to be hoped that bob worthingtons attitude up to this time toward cynthia has been sufficiently defined by his conversation and actions there had been nothing serious about it but there can be no question that mr brownes openly expressed admiration had enhanced her value in his eyes  theres no girl in boston that i care a rap for he said  im relieved to hear it said cynthia with feeling  are you really  didnt you expect me to be when you said it  he laughed uncomfortably  youve learned more than one thing since youve been in the city he remarked i suppose there are a good many fellows who come here all the time  yes there are she said demurely  well he remarked youve changed a lot in three months i always thought that if you had a chance thered be no telling where youd end up  that doesnt sound very complimentary said cynthia she had indeed changed in what terrible place do you think ill end up  i suppose youll marry one of these boston men  oh she laughed that wouldnt be so terrible would it  i believe youre engaged to one of em now he remarked looking very hard at her  if you believed that i dont think you would say it she answered  i cant make you out you used to be so frank with me and now youre not at all so are you going to coniston for the holidays  her face fell at the question  oh bob she cried surprising him utterly by a glimpse of the real cynthia i wish i werei wish i were but i dont dare to  dont dare to  if i went i should never come backnever i should stay with uncle jethro hes so lonesome up there and im so lonesome down here without him and i promised him faithfully id stay a whole winter at school in boston  cynthia said bob in a strange voice as he leaned toward her do youdo you care for him as much as all that  care for him she repeated  care forfor uncle jethro  of course i care for him she cried her eyes flashing at the thought i love him better than anybody in the world certainly no one ever had better reason to care for a person my father failed when he came to conistonhe was not meant for business and uncle jethro took care of him all his life and paid his debts and he has taken care of me and given me everything that a girl could wish very few people know what a fine character uncle jethro has continued cynthia carried away as she was by the pentup flood of feeling within her i know what he has done for others and i should love him for that even if he never had done anything for me  bob was silent he was in the first place utterly amazed at this outburst revealing as it did a depth of passionate feeling in the girl which he had never suspected and which thrilled him it was unlike her for she was usually so selfrepressed and being unlike her accentuated both sides of her character the more  but what was he to say of the defence of jethro bass bob was not a young man who had pondered much over the problems of life because these problems had hitherto never touched him but now he began to perceive dimly things that might become the elements of a tragedy even as mr merrill had perceived them some months before could a union endure between so delicate a creature as the girl before him and jethro bass could cynthia ever go back to him again and live with him happily without seeing many things which before were hidden by reason of her youth and innocence  bob had not been nearly four years at college without learning something of the world and it had not needed the lecture from his father which he got upon leaving washington to inform him of jethros political practices he had argued soundly with his father on that occasion having the courage to ask mr worthington in effect whether he did not sanction his underlings to use the same tools as jethro used mr worthington was righteously angry and declared that jethro had inaugurated those practices in the state and had to be fought with his own weapons but mr worthington had had the sense at that time not to mention cynthias name he hoped and believed that that affair was not serious and merely a boyish fancyas indeed it was  it remains to be said however that the lecture had not been without its effect upon bob jethro bass after all wasjethro bass all his life bob had heard him familiarly and jokingly spoken of as the boss of the state and had listened to the tales current in all the country towns of how jethro had outwitted this man or that some of them were not refined tales jethro bass as the boss of the statewith the tolerance with which the public in general regard politicswas one thing bob was willing to call him uncle jethro admire his great strength and shrewdness and declare that the men he had outwitted had richly deserved it but jethro bass as the ward of cynthia wetherell was quite another thing  it was not only that cynthia had suddenly and inevitably become a lady that would not have mattered for such as she would have borne coniston and the life of coniston cheerfully but bob reflected as he walked back to his rooms in the dark through the snowladen streets that cynthia young though she might be possessed principles from which no love would sway her a hairs breadth how indeed was she to live with jethro once her eyes were opened  the thought made him angry but returned to him persistently during the days that followedin the lecture room in the gymnasium in his own study where he spent more time than formerly by these tokens it will be perceived that bob too had changed a little and the sight of cynthia in mrs merrills parlor had set him to thinking in a very different manner than the sight of her in washington had affected him bob had managed to shift the subject from jethro not without an effort though he had done it in that merry careless manner which was so characteristic of him he had talked of many thingshis college life his friendsand laughed at her questions about his freshman escapades but when at length at twilight he had risen to go he had taken both her hands and looked down into her face with a very different expression than she had seen him wear beforea much more serious expression which puzzled her it was not the look of a lover nor yet that of a man who imagines himself in love with either of these her instinct would have told her how to deal it was more the look of a friend with much of the masculine spirit of protection in it  may i come to see you again he asked  gently she released her hands and she did not answer at once she went to the window and stared across the sloping street at the grilled railing before the big house opposite thinking her reason told her that he should not come but her spirit rebelled against that reason it was a pleasure to see him so she freely admitted to herself why should she not have that pleasure if the truth be told she had argued it all out before when she had wondered whether he would come mrs merrill she thought would not object to his coming butthere was the question she had meant to ask him  bob she said turning to him bob would your father want you to come  it was growing dark and she could scarcely see his face he hesitated but he did not attempt to evade the question  no he would not he answered and added with a good deal of force and dignity i am of age and can choose my own friends i am my own master if he knew you as i knew you he would look at the matter in a different light  cynthia felt that this was not quite true she smiled a little sadly  i am afraid you dont know me very well bob he was about to protest but she went on bravely is it because he has quarrelled with uncle jethro  yes said bob she was making it terribly hard for him sparing indeed neither herself nor him  if you come here to see me it will cause a quarrel between you and your father ii cannot do that  there is nothing wrong in my seeing you said bob stoutly if he cares to quarrel with me for that i cannot help it if the people i choose for my friends are good people he has no right to an objection even though he is my father  cynthia had never come so near real admiration for him as at that moment  no bob you must not come she said i will not have you quarrel with him on my account  then i will quarrel with him on my own account he had answered goodby you may expect me this day week  he went into the hall to put on his overcoat cynthia stood still on the spot of the carpet where he had left her he put his head in at the door  this day week he said  bob you must not come she answered but the street door closed after him as he spoke     chapter ix  you must not come had cynthia made the prohibition strong enough ought she not to have said if you do come i will not see you her knowledge of the motives of the men and women in the greater world was largely confined to that which she had gathered from novelsnot trashy novels but those by standard authors of english life and many another girl of nineteen has taken a novel for a guide when she has been suddenly confronted with the first great problem outside of her experience somebody has declared that there are only seven plots in the world there are many parallels in english literature to cynthias positionso far as she was able to define that positionthe wealthy young peer the parsons or physicians daughter and the worldly inexorable parents who had other plans  cynthia was of course foolish she would not look ahead yet there was the mirage in the sky when she allowed herself to dream it can truthfully be said that she was not in love with bob worthington she felt rather than knew that if love came to her the feeling she had for jethro bassstrong though that waswould be as nothing to it the girl felt the intensity of her nature and shrank from it when her thoughts ran that way for it frightened her  mrs merrill she said a few days later when she found herself alone with that lady you once told me you would have no objection if a friend came to see me here  none whatever my dear answered mrs merrill i have asked you to have your friends here  mrs merrill knew that a young man had called on cynthia the girls had discussed the event excitedly had teased cynthia about it they had discovered moreover that the young man had not been a tiller of the soil or a clerk in a country store ellen with the enthusiasm of her race had painted him in glowing colorsbut she had neglected to read the name on his card  bob worthington came to see me last week and he wants to come again he lives in brampton cynthia explained and is at harvard college  mrs merrill was decidedly surprised she went on with her sewing however and did not betray the fact she knew of dudley worthington as one of the richest and most important men in his state she had heard her husband speak of him often but she had never meddled with politics and railroad affairs  by all means let him come cynthia she replied  when mr merrill got home that evening she spoke of the matter to him  cynthia is a strange character she said sometimes i cant understand hershe seems so much older than our girls stephen think of her keeping this to herself for four days  mr merrill laughed but he went off to a little writing room he had and sat for a long time looking into the glowing coals then he laughed again mr merrill was a philosopher after all he could not forbid dudley worthingtons son coming to his house nor did he wish to  that same evening cynthia wrote a letter and posted it she found it a very difficult letter to write and almost as difficult to drop into the mailbox she reflected that the holidays were close at hand and then he would go to brampton and forget even as he had forgotten before and she determined when wednesday afternoon came around that she would take a long walk in the direction of brookline cynthia loved these walks for she sadly missed the country airand they had kept the color in her cheeks and the courage in her heart that winter she had amazed the merrill girls by the distances she covered and on more than one occasion she had trudged many miles to a spot from which there was a view of blue hills they reminded her faintly of coniston  who can speak or write with any certainty of the feminine character or declare what unexpected twists perversity and curiosity may give to it wednesday afternoon came and cynthia did not go to brookline she put on her coat and took it off again would he dare to come in the face of the mandate he had received if he did come she wouldnt see him ellen had received her orders  at four oclock the doorbell rang and shortly thereafter ellen appeared simpering and apologetic enough with a card she had taken the trouble to read it this time cynthia was angry or thought she was and her cheeks were very red  i told you to excuse me ellen why did you let him in  miss cynthia darlin said ellen if it was made of flint i was wouldnt he bring the tears out of me with his wheedlin an coaxin an him such a fine young gintleman and whin he took to commandin like sure i couldnt say no to him at all at all take the card to her ellen he saysdidnt he know me namean if she says she wont see me thin i wont trouble her more thim were his words miss  there he was before the fire his feet slightly apart and his hands in his pockets waiting for her she got a glimpse of him standing thus as she came down the stairs it was not the attitude of a culprit nor did he bear the faintest resemblance to a culprit as he came up to her in the doorway the chief recollection she carried away of that moment was that his teeth were very white and even when he smiled he had the impudence to smile he had the impudence to seize one of her hands in his and to hold aloft a sheet of paper in the other  what does this mean said he  what do you thick it means retorted cynthia with dignity  a summons to stay away said bob thereby more or less accurately describing it what would you have thought of me if i had not come  cynthia was not prepared for any such question as this she had meant to ask the questions herself but she never lacked for words to protect herself  ill tell you what i think of you for coming bob for insisting upon seeing me as you did she said remembering with shame ellens account of that proceeding it was very unkind and very thoughtless of you  unkind thus she succeeded in putting him on the defensive  yes unkind because i know it is best for you not to come to see me and you know it and yet you will not help me when i try to do what is right i shall be blamed for these visits she said the young ladies in the novels always were but it was a serious matter for poor cynthia and her voice trembled a little her troubles seemed very real  who will blame you asked bob though he knew well enough then he added seeing that she did not answer i dont at all agree with you that it is best for me not to see you i know of nobody in the world it does me more good to see than yourself lets sit down and talk it all over he said for she still remained standing uncompromisingly by the door  the suspicion of a smile came over cynthias face she remembered how ellen had been wheedled her instinct told her that now was the time to make a stand or never  it wouldnt do any good bob she replied shaking her head we talked it all over last week  not at all said he we only touched upon a few points last week we ought to thrash it out various aspects of the matter have occurred to me which i ought to call to your attention  he could not avoid this bantering tone but she saw that he was very much in earnest too he realized the necessity of winning likewise and he had got in and meant to stay  i dont want to argue said cynthia ive thought it all out  so have i said bob i havent thought of anything else to speak of and by the way he declared shaking the envelope i never got a colder and more formal letter in my life you must have taken it from one of miss sadlers copy books  im sorry i havent been able to equal the warmth of your other correspondents said cynthia smiling at the mention of miss sadler  youve got a good many degrees yet to go he replied  i have no idea of doing so said cynthia  if cynthia had lured him there and had carefully thought out a plan of fanning his admiration into a flame she could not have done better than to stand obstinately by the door nothing appeals to a man like resistanceresistance for a principle appealed to bob although he did not care a fig about that particular principle in his former dealings with young womenand they had not been fewthe son of dudley worthington had encountered no resistance worth the mentioning he looked at the girl before him and his blood leaped at the thought of a conquest over her she was often demure but behind that demureness was firmness she was mistress of herself and yet possessed a marvellous vitality  and now said cynthia dont you think you had better go  go he laughed outright never he would sit down under that fortress and some day he meant to scale the walls like john paul jones he had not yet begun to fight but he did not sit down just yet because cynthia remained standing  im here now he said whats the good of going away i might as well stay the rest of the afternoon  you will find a photograph album on the table said cynthia with pictures of all the merrill family and their friends and relations  in spite of the threat this remark conveyed he could not help laughing at it mrs merrill in her sitting room heard the laugh and felt that she would like bob worthington  its a heavy album cynthia he said perhaps you would hold up one side of it  it was cynthias turn to laugh she could not decide whether he were a man or a boy sometimes she had to admit he was very much of a man  where are you going he cried  upstairs of course she answered  this was really alarming but fate thrust a final weapon into his hands  all right said he ill look at the album what time does mr merrill get home  about six answered cynthia why  when he comes said bob i shall put on my most disconsolate expression hell ask me what im doing and ill tell him you went upstairs at halfpast four and havent come down hell sympathize ill bet anything  whether bob were really capable of doing this cynthia could not tell she believed he was perhaps she really did not intend to go upstairs just then to his intense relief she seated herself on a straightbacked chair near the door although she had the air of being about to get up again at any minute it was not a surrender not at allbut a parley at least  i really want to talk to you seriously bob she said and her voice was serious i like you very muchi always haveand i want you to listen seriously all of us have friends some peopleyou for instancehave a great many we have but one father her voice failed a little at the word no friend can ever be the same to you as your father and no friendship can make up what his displeasure will cost you i do not mean to say that i shant always be your friend for i shall be  young men seldom arrive at maturity by gradual stepssomething sets them thinking a week passes and suddenly the world has a different aspect bob had thought much of his father during that week and had considered their relationship very carefully he had a few precious memories of his mother before she had been laid to rest under that hideous and pretentious monument in the brampton hill cemetery how unlike her was that monument even as a young boy when on occasions he had wandered into the cemetery he used to stand before it with a lump in his throat and bitter resentment in his heart and once he had shaken his fist at it he had grown up out of sympathy with his father but he had never until now began to analyze the reasons for it his father had given him everything except that communion of which cynthia spoke so feelingly mr worthington had acted according to his lights of all the people in the world he thought first of his son but his thoughts and care had been alone of what the son would be to the world how that son would carry on the wealth and greatness of isaac d worthington  bob had known this before but it had had no such significance for him then as now he was by no means lacking in shrewdness and as he had grown older he had perceived clearly enough mr worthingtons reasons for throwing him socially with the duncans mr worthington had never been a plainspoken man but he had as much as told his son that it was decreed that he should marry the heiress of the state there were other plans connected with this mr worthington meant that his son should eventually own the state itself for he saw that the man who controlled the highways of a state could snap his fingers at governor and council and legislature and judiciary could indeed do morecould own them even more completely than jethro bass now owned them and without effort the dividends would do the work would canvass the counties and persuade this man and that with sufficient eloquence by such tokens it will be seen that isaac d worthington is destined to become great though the greatness will be akin to that possessed by those gentlemen who in past ages had built castles across the highway between venice and the north sea all this was in store for bob worthington if he could only be brought to see it these things would be given him if he would but confine his worship to the god of wealth  we are running ahead however of bobs reflections in mr merrills parlor in mount vernon street and the ceremony of showing him the cities of his world from brampton hill was yet to be gone through bob knew his fathers plans only in a general way but in the past week he had come to know his father with a fair amount of thoroughness if isaac d worthington had but chosen a worldly wife he might have had a more worldly son as it was bobs thoughts were a little bitter when cynthia spoke of his father and he tried to think instead what his mother would have him do he could not indeed speak of mr worthingtons shortcomings as he understood them but he answered cynthia vigorously enougheven if his words were not as serious as she desired  i tell you i am old enough to judge for myself cynthia said he and i intend to judge for myself i dont pretend to be a paragon of virtue but i have a kind of a conscience which tells me when i am doing wrong if i listen to it i have not always listened to it it tells me im doing right now and i mean to listen to it  cynthia could not but think there was very little selfdenial attached to this men are not given largely to selfdenial  it is easy enough to listen to your conscience when you think it impels you to do that which you want to do bob she answered laughing at his argument in spite of herself  are you wicked he demanded abruptly  why no i dont think i am said cynthia taken aback but she corrected herself swiftly perceiving his bent i should be doing wrong to let you come here  he ignored the qualification  are you vain and frivolous  she remembered that she had looked in the glass before she had come down to him and bit her lip  are you given over to idle pursuits to leading young men from their occupations and duties  if youve come here to recite the blue laws said she laughing again i have something better to do than to listen to them  cynthia he cried ill tell you what you are ill draw your character for you and then if you can give me one good reason why i should not associate with you ill go away and never come back  thats all very well said cynthia but suppose i dont admit your qualifications for drawing my character and i dont admit them not for a minute  i will draw it said he standing up in front of her oh confound it  this exclamation astonishing and out of place as it was was caused by a ring at the doorbell the ring was followed by a whispering and giggling in the hall and then by the entrance of the misses merrill into the parlor curiosity had been too strong for them susan was human and here was the opportunity for a little revenge in justice to her she meant the revenge to be very slight  well cynthia you should have come to the concert she said it was fine wasnt it jane is this mr worthington how do you do im miss susan merrill and this is miss jane merrill susan only intended to stay a minute but how was bob to know that she was tempted into staying longer bob lighted the gas and she inspected him and approved her approval increased when he began to talk to her in his bantering way as if he had known her always then when she was fully intending to go he rose to take his leave  im awfully glad to have met you at last he said to susan ive heard so much about you his leavetaking of jane was less effusive and then he turned to cynthia and took her hand im going to brampton on friday he said for the holidays i wish you were going  we couldnt think of letting her go mr worthington cried susan for the thought of the hills had made cynthia incapable of answering were only to have her for one short winter you know  yes i know said mr worthington gravely ill see old ephraim and tell him youre well and what a marvel of learning youve become andand ill go to coniston if that will please you  oh no bob you mustnt do anything of the kind answered cynthia trying to keep back the tears ii write to uncle jethro very often goodby i hope you will enjoy your holidays  im coming to see you the minute i get back and tell you all about everybody said he  how was she to forbid him to come before susan and jane she could only be silent  do come mr worthington said susan warmly wondering at cynthias coldness and indeed misinterpreting it i am sure she will be glad to see you and we shall always make you welcome at any rate  as soon as he was out of the door susan became very repentant and slipped her hand about cynthias waist  we shouldnt have come in at all if we had known he would go so soon indeed we shouldnt cynthia and seeing that cynthia was still silent she added i wouldnt do such a mean thing cynthia i really wouldnt wont you believe me and forgive me  cynthia scarcely heard her at first she was thinking of coniston mountain and how the sun had just set behind it the mountain would be ultramarine against the white fields and the snow on the hill pastures to the east stained red as with wine what would she not have given to be going back tomorrowyes with bob she confessedthough startled by the very boldness of the thoughtthat she would like to be going there with bob susans appeal brought her back to boston and the gaslit parlor  forgive you susan theres nothing to forgive i wanted him to go  you wanted him to go repeated susan amazed she may be pardoned if she did not believe this but a glance at cynthias face scarcely left a room for doubt cynthia wetherell youre the strangest girl ive ever known in all my life if i had aa friend susan had another word on her tongue if i had such a friend as mr worthington i shouldnt be in a hurry to let him leave me of course she added i shouldnt let him know it  cynthias heart was very heavy during the next few days heavier by far than her friends in mount vernon street imagined they had grown to love her almost as one of themselves and because of the sympathy which comes of such love they guessed that her thoughts would be turning homeward at christmastide at school she had listened perforce to the festival plans of thirty girls of her own age to accounts of the probable presents they were to receive the cost of some of which would support a family in coniston for several months to arrangements for visits during which there were to be theatreparties and dances and other gaieties cynthia could not help wondering as she listened in silence to this talk whether uncle jethro had done wisely in sending her to miss sadlers whether she would not have been far happier if she had never known about such things  then came the last day of school which began with leavetakings and embraces there were not many who embraced cynthia though had she known it this was largely her own fault poor cynthia how was she to know it many more of them than she imagined would have liked to embrace her had they believed that the embrace would be returned secretly they had grown to admire this strange dark girl who was too proud to bend for the good opinion of any oneeven of miss sally broke once during the term cynthia had held some of themin the hollow of her hand and had incurred the severe displeasure of miss sadler by refusing to tell what she knew of certain mischiefmakers  now miss sadler was going about among them in the school parlor saying goodby sending particular remembrance to such of the fathers and mothers as she thought worthy of that honor kissing some shaking hands with all it was then that a dramatic incident occurreddramatic for a girls school at least cynthia deliberately turned her back on miss sadler and looked out of the window the chatter in the room was hushed and for a moment a dangerous wrath flamed in miss sadlers eyes then she passed on with a smile to send most particular messages to the mother of miss isabel burrage  some few moments afterward cynthia felt a touch on her arm and turned to find herself confronted by miss sally broke unfortunately there is not much room for miss broke in this story although she may appear in another one yet to be written she was extremely goodlooking with real golden hair and mischievous blue eyes she was in brief the leader of miss sadlers school  cynthia she said i was rude to you when you first came here and im sorry for it i want to beg your pardon and she held out her hand  there was a moments suspense for those watching to see if cynthia would take it she did take it  im sorry too said cynthia simply i couldnt see what id done to offend you perhaps youll explain now  miss broke blushed violently and for an instant looked decidedly uncomfortable then she burst into laughtermerry irresistible laughter that carried all before it  i was a snob thats all said she just a plain low down snob you dont understand what that means because youre not one cynthia did understand  but i like you and i want you to be my friend perhaps when i get to know you better you will come home with me sometime for a visit  go home with her for a visit to that house in washington square with the picture gallery  i want to say that id give my head to have been able to turn my back on miss sadler as you did continued miss broke if you ever want a friend remember sally broke  some of cynthias trouble at least was mitigated by this episode and miss broke having led the way miss brokes followers came shyly one by one with proffers of friendship to the goodhearted merrill girls the walk home that day was a kind of a triumphal march a victory over miss sadler and a vindication of their friend mrs merrill when she heard of it could not find it in her heart to reprove cynthia miss sadler had got her just deserts but miss sadler was not a person who was likely to forget such an incident indeed mrs merrill half expected to receive a note before the holidays ended that cynthias presence was no longer desired at the school no such note came however  if one had to be away from home on christmas there could surely be no better place to spend that day than in the merrill household cynthia remembers still when that blessed season comes around how each member of the family vied with the others to make her happy how they showered presents on her and how they strove to include her in the laughter and jokes at the big family dinner mr merrills brother was there with his wife and mrs merrills aunt and her husband and two broods of cousins it may be well to mention that the merrill relations like sally broke had overcome their dislike for cynthia  there were eatables from coniston on that board a turkey sent by jethro for which mr merrill declared the table would have to be strengthened a saddle of venisonlem hallowell having shot a deer on the mountain two sundays before and mincemeat made by amanda hatch herself other presents had come to cynthia from the hills a gorgeous copy of mr longfellows poems from cousin ephraim and a gold locket from uncle jethro this locket was the precise counterpart had she but known it of a silver one bought at mr judsons shop many years before though the inscription cynthy from uncle jethro was within into the other side exactly fitted that daguerreotype of her mother which her father had given her when he died the locket had a gold chain with a clasp and cynthia wore it hidden beneath her gowntoo intimate a possession to be shown  there was still another and very mysterious present this being a huge box of roses addressed to miss cynthia wetherell which was delivered on christmas morning if there had been a card susan merrill would certainly have found it there was no card there was much pretended speculation on the part of the merrill girls as to the sender sly reference to cynthias heightened color and several attempts to pin on her dress a bunch of the flowers and susan declared that one of them would look stunning in her hair they were put on the diningroom table in the centre of the wreath of holly and under the mistletoe which hung from the chandelier whether cynthia surreptitiously stole one has never been discovered  so christmas came and went not altogether unhappily deferring for a day at least the knotty problems of life although cynthia accepted the present of the roses with such magnificent unconcern and would not make so much as a guess as to who sent them mr robert worthington was frequently in her thoughts he had declared his intention of coming to mount vernon street as soon as the holidays ended and had been cordially invited by susan to do so cynthia took the trouble to procure a harvard catalogue from the library and discovered that he had many holidays yet to spend she determined to write another letter which he would find in his rooms when he returned just what terrible prohibitory terms she was to employ in that letter cynthia could not decide in a moment nor yet in a day or a week she went so far as to make several drafts some of which she destroyed for the fault of leniency and others for that of severity what was she to say to him she had expended her arguments to no avail she could wound him indeed and at length made up her mind that this was the only resource left her although she would thereby wound herself more deeply when she had arrived at this decision there remained still more than a week in which to compose the letter  on the morning after new years when the family were assembled around the breakfast table mrs merrill remarked that her husband was neglecting a custom which had been his for many years  didnt the newspaper come stephen she asked  mr merrill had read it  read it repeated his wife in surprise you havent been down long enough to read a column  it was full of trash said mr merrill lightly and began on his usual jokes with the girls but mrs merrill was troubled she thought his jokes not as hearty as they were wont to be and disquieting surmises of business worries filled her mind the fact that he beckoned her into his writing room as soon as breakfast was over did not tend to allay her suspicions he closed and locked the door after her and taking the paper from a drawer in his desk bade her read a certain article in it  the article was an arraignment of jethro bassand a terrible arraignment indeed step by step it traced his career from the beginning showing first of all how he had debauched his own town of coniston how enlarging on the same methods he had gradually extended his grip over the county and finally over the state how he had bought and sold men for his own power and profit deceived those who had trusted in him corrupted governors and legislators congressmen and senators and even justices of the courts how he had trafficked ruthlessly in the enterprises of the people instance upon instance was given and men of high prominence from whom he had received bribes were named not the least important of these being the honorable alva hopkins of gosport  mrs merrill looked up from the paper in dismay  its copied from the newcastle guardian she said for lack of immediate power to comment isnt the guardian the chief paper in that state  yes worthingtons bought it and he instigated the article of course ive been afraid of this for a long time carry said mr merrill pacing up and down theres a bigger fight than theyve ever had coming on up there and this is the first gun worthington with duncan behind him is trying to get possession of and consolidate all the railroads in the western part of that state if he succeeds it will mean the end of jethros power but he wont succeed  stephen said his wife do you mean to say that jethro bass will try to defeat this consolidation simply to keep his power  well my dear answered mr merrill still pacing two wrongs dont make a right i admit ive known these things a long time and ive thought about them a good deal but ive had to run along with the tide or give place to another man who would andand starve  mrs merrills eyes slowly filled with tears  stephen she began do you mean to say there she stopped utterly unable to speak he ceased his pacing and sat down beside her and took her hand  yes my dear i mean to say ive submitted to these things god knows whether ive been right or wrong but i have ive often thought id be happier if i resigned my office as president of my road and became a clerk in a store i dont attempt to excuse myself carry but my sin has been in holding on to my post as long as i remain president i have to cope with things as i find them  mr merrill spoke thickly for the sight of his wifes tears wrung his heart  stephen she said when we were first married and you were a district superintendent you used to tell me everything  stephen merrill was a man and a good man as men go how was he to tell her the degrees by which he had been led into his present situation how was he to explain that these degrees had been so gradual that his conscience had had but a passing wrench here and there politics being what they were progress and protection had to be obtained in accordance with them and there was a duty to the holders of bonds and stocks  his wife had a question on her lips a question for which she had to summon all her courage she chose that form for it which would hurt him least  mr worthington is going to try to change these things  mr merrill roused himself at the words and his eyes flashed he became a different man  change them he cried bitterly change them for the worse if he can he will try to wrest the power from jethro bass i dont defend him i dont defend myself but i like jethro bass i wont deny it hes human and i like him and whatever they say about him i know that hes been a true friend to me and i tell you as i hope for happiness here and hereafter that if worthington succeeds in what he is trying to do if the railroads win in this fight there will be no mercy for the people of that state im a railroad man myself though i have no interest in this affair my turn may come later will come later i suppose isaac d worthington has a very little heart or soul or mercy himself but the corporation which he means to set up will have none at all it will grind the people and debase them and clog their progress a hundred times more than jethro bass has done mark my words carry im running ahead of the times a little but i can see it all as clearly as if it existed now  mrs merrill went about her duties that morning with a heavy heart and more than once she paused to wipe away a tear that would have fallen on the linen she was sorting at eleven oclock the doorbell rang and ellen appeared at the entrance to the linen closet with a card in her hand mrs merrill looked at it with a flurry of surprise it read             miss lucretia penniman              the womans hour     chapter x  it was certainly affinity that led miss lucretia to choose the rosewood sofa of a bygone age which was covered with horsehair miss lucretias features seemed to be constructed on a larger and more generous principle than those of women are nowadays her face was longer with her curls and her bonnet and her bombazinewhich she wore in all seasonsshe was in complete harmony with the sofa she had thrown aside the storm cloak which had become so familiar to pedestrians in certain parts of boston  my dear miss penniman said mrs merrill i am delighted and honored i scarcely hoped for such a pleasure i have so long admired you and your work and i have heard cynthia speak of you so kindly  it is very good of you to say so mrs merrill answered miss lucretia in her full deep voice it was by no means an unpleasant voice she settled herself though she sat quite upright in the geometrical centre of the horsehair sofa and cleared her throat to be quite honest with you mrs merrill she continued i came upon particular errand though i believe it would not be a perversion of the truth if i were to add that i have had for a month past every intention of paying you a friendly call  good mrs merrills breath was a little taken away by this extremely scrupulous speech she also began to feel a misgiving about the cause of the visit but she managed to say something polite in reply  i have come about cynthia announced miss lucretia without further preliminaries  about cynthia faltered mrs merrill  miss lucretia opened a reticule at her waist and drew forth a newspaper clipping which she unfolded and handed to mrs merrill  have you seen this she demanded  mrs merrill took it although she guessed very well what it was glanced at it with a shudder and handed it back  yes i have read it she said  i have come to ask you mrs merrill said miss lucretia if it is true  here was a question indeed for the poor lady to answer but mrs merrill was no coward  it is partly true i believe  partly said miss lucretia sharply  yes partly said mrs merrill rousing herself for the trial i have never yet seen a newspaper article which was wholly true  that is because newspapers are not edited by women observed miss lucretia what i wish you to tell me mrs merrill is this how much of that article is true and how much of it is false  really miss penniman replied mrs merrill with spirit i dont see why you should expect me to know  a woman should take an intelligent interest in her husbands affairs mrs merrill i have long advocated it as an entering wedge  an entering wedge exclaimed mrs merrill who had never read a page of the womans hour  yes your husband is the president of a railroad i believe which is largely in that state i should like to ask him whether these statements are true in the main whether this jethro bass is the kind of man they declare him to be  mrs merrill was in a worse quandary than ever her own spirits were none too good and miss lucretias eye in its search for truth seemed to pierce into her very soul there was no evading that eye but mrs merrill did what few people would have had the courage or good sense to do  that is a political article miss penniman she said inspired by a bitter enemy of jethro bass mr worthington who has bought the newspaper from which it was copied for that reason i was right in saying that it is partly true you nor i miss penniman must not be the judges of any man or woman for we know nothing of their problems or temptations god will judge them we can only say that they have acted rightly or wrongly according to the light that is in us you will find it difficult to get a judgment of jethro bass that is not a partisan judgment and yet i believe that that article is in the main a history of the life of jethro bass a partisan history but still a history he has unquestionably committed many of the acts of which he is accused  here was talk to make the author of the hymn to coniston sit up if she hadnt been sitting up already  and dont you condemn him for those acts she gasped  ah said mrs merrill thinking of her own husband yesterday she would certainly have condemned jethro bass but now i do not condemn anybody miss penniman  miss lucretia thought this extraordinary to say the least  i will put the question in another way mrs merrill said she do you think this jethro bass a proper guardian for cynthia wetherell  to her amazement mrs merrill did not give her an instantaneous answer to this question mrs merrill was thinking of jethros love for the girl manifold evidences of which she had seen and her heart was filled with a melting pity it was such a love mrs merrill knew as is not given to many here below and there was cynthias love for him mrs merrill had suffered that morning thinking of this tragedy also  i do not think he is a proper guardian for her miss penniman  it was then that the tears came to mrs merrills eyes for there is a limit to all human endurance the sight of these caused a remarkable change in miss lucretia and she leaned forward and seized mrs merrills arm  my dear she cried my dear what are we to do cynthia cant go back to that man she loves him i know she loves him as few girls are capable of loving but when she finds out what he is when she finds out how he got the money to support her father miss lucretia fumbled in her reticule and drew forth a handkerchief and brushed her own eyeseyes which a moment ago were so piercing i have seen many young women she continued but i have known very few who were made of as fine a fibre and who have such principles as cynthia wetherell  that is very true assented mrs merrill too much cast down to be amazed by this revelation of miss lucretias weakness  but what are we to do insisted that lady who is to tell her what he is how is it to be kept from her indeed  yes said mrs merrill there will be more articles mr merrill says so it seems there is to be a great political struggle in that state  precisely said miss lucretia sadly and whoever tells the girl will forfeit her friendship ii am very fond of her and here she applied again to the reticule  whom would she believe asked mrs merrill whose estimation of miss lucretia was increasing by leaps and bounds  precisely agreed miss lucretia but she must hear about it sometime  wouldnt it be better to let her hear suggested mrs merrill we cannot very well soften that shock i talked the matter over a little with mr merrill and he thinks that we must take time over it miss penniman whatever we do we must not act hastily  well said miss lucretia as i said i am very fond of the girl and i am willing to do my duty whatever it may be and i also wished to say mrs merrill that i have thought about another matter very carefully i am willing to provide for the girl i am getting too old to live alone i am getting too old indeed to do my work properly as i used to do it i should like to have her to live with me  she has become as one of my own daughters said mrs merrill yet she knew that this offer of miss lucretias was not one to be lightly set aside and that it might eventually be the best solution of the problem after some further earnest discussion it was agreed between them that the matter was if possible to be kept from cynthia for the present and when miss lucretia departed mrs merrill promised her an early return of her call  mrs merrill had another talk with her husband which lasted far into the night this talk was about cynthia alone and the sorrow which threatened her these good people knew that it would be no light thing to break the faith of such as she and they made her troubles their own  cynthia little guessed as she exchanged raillery with mr merrill the next morning that he had risen fifteen minutes earlier than usual to search his newspaper through he would read no more at breakfast so he declared in answer to his daughters comments it was a bad habit which did not agree with his digestion it was something new for mr merrill to have trouble with his digestion  there was another and scarcely less serious phase of the situation which mr and mrs merrill had yet to discuss between thema phase of which miss lucretia penniman knew nothing  the day before miss sadlers school was to reopen nearly a week before the harvard term was to commencea raging wet snowstorm came charging in from the atlantic snow had no terrors for a coniston person and cynthia had been for her walk returning about five oclock she was surprised to have the door opened for her by susan herself  what a picture you are in those furs she cried with an intention which for the moment was lost upon cynthia i thought you would never come you must have walked to dedham this time who do you think is here mr worthington  mr worthington  i have been trying to entertain him but i am afraid i have been a very poor substitute however i have persuaded him to stay for supper  it needed but little persuasion said bob appearing in the doorway all the snowstorms of the wide atlantic could not have brought such color to her cheeks cynthia for all her confusion at the meeting had not lost her faculty of observation he seemed to have changed again even during the brief time he had been absent his tone was grave  he needs to be cheered up cynthia susan went on as though reading her thoughts i have done my best without success he wont confess to me that he has come back to make up some of his courses i dont mind owning that ive got to finish a theme to be handed in tomorrow  with these words susan departed and left them standing in the hall together bob took hold of cynthias jacket and helped her off with it he could read neither pleasure nor displeasure in her face though he searched it anxiously enough it was she who led the way into the parlor and seated herself as before on one of the uncompromising straightbacked chairs whatever inward tremors the surprise of this visit had given her she looked at him clearly and steadily completely mistress of herself as ever  i thought your holidays did not end until next week she said  they do not  then why are you here  because i could not stay away cynthia he answered it was not the manner in which he would have said it a month ago there was a note of intense earnestness in his voicenow and to it she could make no light reply confronted again with an unexpected situation she could not decide at once upon a line of action  when did you leave brampton she asked to gain time but with the words her thoughts flew to the hill country  this morning he said on the early train they have three feet of snow up there he too seemed glad of a respite from something theyre having a great fuss in brampton about a new teacher for the village school miss goddard has got married did you know miss goddard the lanky one with the glasses  yes said cynthia beginning to be amused at the turn the conversation was taking  well they cant find anybody smart enough to replace miss goddard old ezra graves whos on the prudential committee told ephraim they ought to get you i was in the postoffice when they were talking about it just see what a reputation for learning you have in brampton  cynthia was plainly pleased by the compliment  how is cousin eph she asked  happy as a lark said bob the greatest living authority in new england on the civil war hes made the postoffice the most popular social club i ever saw if anybodys missing in brampton you can nearly always find them in the postoffice but i smiled at the notion of your being a school maam  i dont see anything so funny about it replied cynthia smiling too why shouldnt i be i should like it  you were made for something different he answered quietly  it was a subject she did not choose to discuss with him and dropped her lashes before the plainly spoken admiration in his eyes so a silence fell between them broken only by the ticking of the agate clock on the mantel and the music of sleighbells in a distant street presently the sleighbells died away and it seemed to cynthia that the sound of her own heartbeats must be louder than the ticking of the clock her tact had suddenly deserted her without reason and she did not dare to glance again at bob as he sat under the lamp that minutefor it was a full minutewas charged with a presage which she could not grasp cynthias instincts were very keen she understood of course that he had cut short his holiday to come to see her and she might have dealt with him had that been all butthrough that sixth sense with which some women are endowedshe knew that something troubled him he too had never yet been at a loss for words  the silence forced him to speak first and he tried to restore the light tone to the conversation  cousin ephraim gave me a piece of news he said ezra graves got it too he told us you were down in boston at a fashionable school cousin ephraim knows a thing or two he says he always callated you were cut out for a fine lady  bob said cynthia nerving herself for the ordeal did you tell cousin ephraim you had seen me  i told him and ezra that i had been a constant and welcome visitor at this house  did you tell your father that you had seen me  this was too serious a question to avoid  no i did not there was no reason why i should have  there was every reason said cynthia and you know it did you tell him why you came to boston today  no  why does he think you came  he doesnt think anything about it said bob he went off to chicago yesterday to attend a meeting of the board of directors of a western railroad  and so she said reproachfully you slipped off as soon as his back was turned i would not have believed that of you bob do you think that was fair to him or me  bob worthington sprang to his feet and stood over her she had spoken to a boy but she had aroused a man and she felt an amazing thrill at the result the muscles in his face tightened and deepened the lines about his mouth and a fire was lighted about his eyes  cynthia he said slowly even you shall not speak to me like that if i had believed it were right if i had believed that it would have done any good to you or me i should have told my father the moment i got to brampton in affairs of this kindin a matter of so much importance in my life he continued choosing his words carefully i am likely to know whether i am doing right or wrong if my mother were alive i am sure that she would approve of thisthis friendship  having got so far he paused cynthia felt that she was trembling as though the force and feeling that was in him had charged her also  i did not intend to come so soon he went on buti had a reason for coming i knew that you did not want me  you know that that is not true bob she faltered his next words brought her to her feet  cynthia he said in a voice shaken by the intensity of his passion i came because i love you better than all the worldbecause i always will love you so i came to protect you and care for you whatever happens i did not mean to tell you so now but it cannot matter cynthia  he seized her roughly indeed in his arms but his very roughness was a proof of the intensity of his love for an instant she lay palpitating against him and as long as he lives he will remember the first exquisite touch of her firm but supple figure and the marvellous communion of her lips a current from the great store that was in her pent up and all unknown ran through him and then she had struggled out of his arms and fled leaving him standing alone in the parlor  it is true that such things happen and no man or woman may foretell the day or the hour thereof cynthia fled up the stairs miraculously arriving unnoticed at her own room and locked the door and flung herself on the bed  tears cametears of shame of joy of sorrow of rejoicing of regret tears that burned and yet relieved her tears that pained while they comforted had she sinned beyond the pardon of heaven or had she committed a supreme act of right one moment she gloried in it and the next upbraided herself bitterly her heart beat with tumult and again seemed to stop such though the words but faintly describe them were her feelings for thoughts were still to emerge out of chaos love comes like a flame to few women but so it came to cynthia wetherell and burned out for a while all reason  only for a while generations which had practised selfrestraint were strong in hergenerations accustomed too to thinking out so far as in them lay the logical consequences of their acts generations ashamed of these very instants when nature has chosen to take command after a time had passed during which the world might have shuffled from its course cynthia sat up in the darkness how was she ever to face the light again reason had returned  so she sat for another space and thought of what she had donethought with a surprising calmness now which astonished her then she thought of what she would do for there was an ordeal still to be gone through although she shrank from it she no longer lacked the courage to endure it certain facts began to stand out clearly from the confusion the least important and most immediate of these was that she would have to face him and incidentally face the world in the shape of the merrill family at supper she rose mechanically and lighted the gas and bathed her face and changed her gown then she heard susans voice at the door  cynthia what in the world are you doing  cynthia opened the door and the sisters entered was it possible that they did not read her terrible secret in her face apparently not susan was busy commenting on the qualities and peculiarities of mr robert worthington and showering upon cynthia a hundred questions which she answered she knew not how but neither susan nor jane wonderful as it may seem betrayed any suspicion did he send the flowers cynthia had not asked him did he want to know whether she read the newspapers he had asked susan that before cynthia came susan was ready to repeat the whole of her conversation with him why did he seem so particular about newspapers had he notions that girls ought not to read them  the significance of bobs remarks about newspapers was lost upon cynthia then not till afterward did she think of them or connect them with his unexpected visit then the supper bell rang and they went downstairs  the reader will be spared mr worthingtons feelings after cynthia left him although they were intense enough and absorbing and farreaching enough he sat down on a chair and buried his head in his hands his impulse had been to leave the house and return again on the morrow but he remembered that he had been asked to stay for supper and that such a proceeding would cause comment at length he got up and stood before the fire his thoughts still above the clouds and it was thus that mr merrill found him when he entered  good evening said that gentleman genially not knowing in the least who bob was but prepossessed in his favor by the way he came forward and shook his hand and looked him clearly in the eye  im robert worthington mr merrill said he  eh mr merrill gasped eh oh certainly how do you do mr worthington mr merrill would have been polite to a tax collector or a sheriff he separated the office from the man which ought not always to be done im glad to see you mr worthington well well bad storm isnt it i had an idea the college didnt open until next week  mr worthingtons going to stay for supper papa said susan entering  good cried mr merrill capital you wont miss the old folks after supper will you girls your mother wants me to go to a whist party  it cant be helped carry said mr merrill to his wife as they walked up the hill to a neighbors that evening  hes in love with cynthia said mrs merrill somewhat sadly its as plain as the nose on your face stephen  that isnt very plain suppose he is you can dam a mountain stream but you cant prevent it reaching the sea as we used to say when i was a boy in edmundton i like bob said mr merrill with his usual weakness for christian names and he isnt any more like dudley worthington than i am if you were to ask me id say he couldnt do a better thing than marry cynthia  stephen exclaimed mrs merrill but in her heart she thought so too what will mr worthington say when he hears the young man has been coming to our house to see her  mr merrill had been thinking of that very thing but with more amusement than concern  to return to mr merrills house the three girls and the one young man were seated around the fire and their talk merrill as it had begun was becoming minute by minute more stilted this was largely the fault of susan who would not be happy until she had taken jane upstairs and left mr worthington and cynthia together this matter had been arranged between the sisters before supper susan found her opening at last and upbraided jane for her unfinished theme jane having learned her lesson well accused susan but cynthia who saw through the ruse declared that both themes were finished susan naturally indignant at such ingratitude denied this the manoeuvre in short was executed very clumsily and very obviously but executed neverthelessthe sisters marching out of the room under a fire of protests the reader too will no doubt think it a very obvious manoeuvre but some things are managed badly in life as well as in books  cynthia and bob were left alone left moreover in mortal terror of each other it is comparatively easy to open the door of a room and rush into a ladys arms if the lady be willing and alone but to be abandoned as susan had abandoned them and with such obvious intent creates quite a different atmosphere bob had dared to hope for such an opportunity had made up his mind during supper while striving to be agreeable just what he would do if the opportunity came instead all he could do was to sit foolishly in his chair and look at the coals not so much as venturing to turn his head until the sound of footsteps had died away on the upper floors it was cynthia who broke the silence and took commanda very different cynthia from the girl who had thrown herself on the bed not three hours before she did not look at him but stared with determination into the fire  bob you must go she said  go he cried her voice loosed the fetters of his passion and he dared to seize the band that lay on the arm of her chair she did not resist this  yes you must go you should not have stayed for supper  cynthia he said how can i leave you i will not leave you  but you can and must she replied  why he asked looking at her in dismay  you know the reason she answered  know it he cried i know why i should stay i know that i love you with my whole heart and soul i know that i love you as few men have ever lovedand that you are the one woman among millions who can inspire such a love  no bob no she said striving hard to keep her head withdrawing her hand that it might not betray the treason of her lips aware strange as it may seem of the absurdity of the source of what she was to say for a trace of a smile was about her mouth as she gazed at the coals you will get over this you are not yet out of college and many such fancies happen there  for the moment he was incapable of speaking incapable of finding an answer sufficiently emphatic how was he to tell her of the rocks upon which his love was built  how was he to declare that the very perils which threatened her had made a man of him with all of a mans yearning to share these perils and shield her from them how was he to speak at all of those perils he did not declaim yet when he spoke an enduring sincerity which she could not deny was in his voice  you know in your heart that what you say is not true cynthia whatever happens i shall always love you  whatever happens she shuddered at the words reminding her as they did of all her vague misgivings and fears  whatever happens she found herself repeating them involuntarily  yes whatever happens i will love you truly and faithfully i will never desert you never deny you as long as i live and you love me cynthia he cried you love me i know it  no no she answered her breath coming fast he was on his feet now dangerously near her and she rose swiftly to avoid him  she turned her head that he might not read the denial in her eyes and yet had to look at him again for he was coming toward her quickly dont touch me she said dont touch me  he stopped and looked at her so pitifully that she could scarce keep back her tears  you do love me he repeated  so they stood for a moment while cynthia made a supreme effort to speak calmly  listen bob she said at last if you ever wish to see me again you must do as i say you must write to your father and tell him what you have done andand what you wish to do you may come to me and tell me his answer but you must not come to me before she would have said more but her strength was almost gone yes and more would have implied a promise or a concession she would not bind herself even by a hint but of this she was sure that she would not be the means of wrecking his opportunities and nowyou must go  he stayed where he was though his blood leaped within him his admiration and respect for the girl outran his passion robert worthington was a gentleman  i will do as you say cynthia he answered but i am doing it for you whatever my fathers reply may be will not change my love or my intentions for i am determined that you shall be my wife  with these words and one long lingering look he turned and left her he had lacked the courage to speak of his fathers bitterness and animosity who will blame him cynthia thought none the less of him for not telling her there was indeed no need now to describe dudley worthingtons feelings  when the door had closed she stoke to the window and listened to his footfalls in the snow until she heard them no more     book iv     chapter xi  the next morning cynthias heart was heavy as she greeted her new friends at miss sadlers school life had made a woman of her long ago while these girls had yet been in short dresses and now an experience had come to her which few if any of these could ever know it was of no use for her to deny to herself that she loved bob worthingtonloved him with the full intensity of the strong nature that was hers to how many of these girls would come such a love and how many would be called upon to make such a renunciation as hers had been no wonder she felt out of place among them and once more the longing to fly away to coniston almost overcame her jethro would forgive her she knew and stretch out his arms to receive her and understand that some trouble had driven her to him  she was aroused by some one calling her namesome one whose voice sounded strangely familiar cynthia was perhaps the only person in the school that day who did not know that miss janet duncan had entered it miss sadler certainly knew it and asked miss duncan very particularly about her father and mother and even her brother miss sadler knew even before janets unexpected arrival that mr and mrs duncan had come to boston after christmas and had taken a large house in the back bay in order to be near their son at harvard mrs duncan was in fact a bostonian and more at home there than at any other place  miss sadler observed with a great deal of astonishment the warm embrace that janet bestowed on cynthia the occurrence started in miss sadler a train of thought as a result of which she left the drawingroom where these reunions were held and went into her own private study to write a note this she addressed to mrs alexander duncan at a certain number on beacon street and sent it out to be posted immediately in the meantime janet duncan had seated herself on the sofa beside cynthia not having for an instant ceased to talk to her of what use to write a romance when they unfolded themselves so beautifully in real life here was the country girl she had seen in washington already in a fine way to become the princess and in four months janet would not have thought it possible for any one to change so much in such a time cynthia listened and wondered what language miss duncan would use if she knew how great and how complete that change had been romances cynthia thought sadly were one thing to theorize about and quite another thing to endureand smiled at the thought but miss duncan had no use for a heroine without a heartache  it is not improbable that miss janet duncan may appear with miss sally broke in another volume the style of her conversation is known and there is no room to reproduce it here she too had a heart but she was a young woman given to infatuations as cynthia rightly guessed cynthia must spend many afternoons at her houselunch with her drive with her for one omission cynthia was thankful she did not mention bob worthingtons name there was the romance under miss duncans nose and she did not see it it is frequently so with romancers  cynthias impassiveness her complete poise had fascinated miss duncan with the others had there been nothing beneath that exterior janet would never have guessed it and she would have been quite as happy cynthia saw very clearly that mr worthington or no other man or woman could force bob to marry janet  the next morning in such intervals as her studies permitted janet continued her attentions to cynthia that same morning she had brought a note from her father to miss sadler of the contents of which janet knew nothing miss sadler retired into her study to read it and two newspaper clippings fell out of it under the papercutter this was the note     my dear miss sadler     mrs duncan has referred your note to me and i enclose two    clippings which speak for themselves miss wetherell i believe    stands in the relation of ward to the person to whom they refer and    her father was a sort of political assistant to this person    although as you say we are from that part of the country miss    sadler bad spoken of the duncans as the people of importance there    it was by the merest accident that miss wetherells connection with    this jethro bass was brought to my notice     sincerely yours     alexander duncan  it is pleasant to know that there were people in the world who could snub miss sadler and there could be no doubt from the manner in which she laid the letter down and took up the clippings that miss sadler felt snubbed equally there could be no doubt that the revenge would fall on other shoulders than mr duncans and when miss sadler proceeded to read the clippings her hair would have stood on end with horror had it not been so efficiently plastered down miss sadler seized her pen and began a letter to mrs merrill miss sadlers knowledge of the proprietiestogether with other qualificationshad made her school what it was no cynthia wetherells had ever before entered its sacred portals or should again  the first of these clippings was the article containing the arraignment of jethro bass which mr merrill had shown to his wife and which had been the excuse for miss pennimans call the second was one which mr duncan had clipped from the newcastle guardian of the day before and gave from mr worthingtons side a very graphic account of the conflict which was to tear the state asunder the railroads were tired of paying toll to the chief of a band of thieves and cutthroats to a man who had long throttled the state which had nourished him toin shortto jethro bass miss sadler was not much interested in the figures and metaphors of political compositions right had found a championthe article continuedin mr isaac d worthington of brampton president of the truro road and owner of large holdings elsewhere mr worthington backed by other respectable property interests would fight this monster of iniquity to the death and release the state from his thraldom jethro bass the article alleged was already about his abominable workhad long been soas in mockery of that very vigilance which is said to be the price of liberty his agents were busy in every town of the state seeing to it that the slaves of jethro bass should be sent to the next legislature  and what was this system which he had built up among these rural communities it might aptly be called the system of mortgages the mortgagedread name for a dreadful thingwas the chief weapon of the monster even as jethro bass held the mortgages of coniston and tarleton and round about so his lieutenants held mortgages in every town and hamlet of the state what was a poor farmer to do his choice was not between right and wrong but between a roof over the heads of his wife and children and no roof he must vote for the candidate of jethro bass end corruption or become a homeless wanderer how the gentleman and his other respectable backers were to fight the system the article did not say were they to buy up all the mortgages as a matter of fact they intended to buy up enough of these to count but to mention this would be to betray the methods of mr worthingtons reform the first bitter frontier fighting between the advance cohorts of the new giant and the oldthe struggle for the caucuses and the pollshad begun miss sadler cared but little and understood less of all this matter she lingered over the sentences which described jethro bass as a monster of iniquity as a pariah with whom decent men would have no intercourse and in the heat of her passion that one who had touched him had gained admittance to the most exclusive school for young ladies in the country she wrote a letter  miss sadler wrote the letter and three hours later tore it up and wrote another and more diplomatic one mrs merrill though not by any means of the same importance as mrs duncan was not a person to be wantonly offended and mightknowing nothing about the monsterin the goodness of her heart have taken the girl into her house had it been otherwise surely mrs merrill would not have had the effrontery she would give mrs merrill a chance the bell of release from studies was ringing as she finished this second letter and miss sadler in her haste forgot to enclose the clippings she ran out in time to intercept susan merrill at the door and to press into her hands the clippings and the note with a request to take both to her mother  although the duncans dined in the evening the merrills had dinner at halfpast one in the afternoon when the girls returned from school mr merrill usually came home but he had gone off somewhere for this particular day and mrs merrill had a sewing circle the girls sat down to dinner alone when they got up from the table susan suddenly remembered the note which she had left in her coat pocket she drew out the clippings with it  i wonder what miss sadler is sending mamma clippings for she said why cynthia theyre about your uncle look  and she handed over the article headed jethro bass jane who had quicker intuitions than her sister would have snatched it from cynthias hand and it was a long time before susan forgave herself for her folly thus miss sadler had her revenge  it is often mercifully ordained that the mightiest blows of misfortune are tempered for us during the winter evenings in coniston cynthia had read little newspaper attacks on jethro and scorned them as the cowardly devices of enemies they had been indeed but guarded and covert allusionsgrimaces from a safe distance cynthias first sensation as she read was angeranger so intense as to send all the blood in her body rushing to her head but what was this right had found a champion at last inin isaac d worthington that was the first blow and none but cynthia knew the weight of it it sank but slowly into her consciousness and slowly the blood left her face slowly but surely left it at length as white as the lace curtain of the window which she clutched in her distress words which somebody had spoken were ringing in her ears whatever happens whatever happens i will never desert you never deny you as long as i live this then was what he had meant by newspapers and why he had come to her  the sisters watching her cried out in dismay there was no need to tell them that they were looking on at a tragedy and all the love and sympathy in their hearts went out to her  cynthia cynthia what is it cried susan who thinking she would faint seized her in her arms what have i done  cynthia did not faint being made of sterner substance gently but with that inexorable instinct of her kind which compels them to look for reliance within themselves even in the direst of extremities cynthia released herself from susans embrace and put a hand to her forehead  will you leave me here a little whilealone she said  it was jane now who drew susan out and shut the door of the parlor after them in utter misery they waited on the stairs while cynthia fought out her battle for herself  when they were gone she sank down into the big chair under the reading lampthe very chair in which he had sat only two nights before she saw now with a terrible clearness the thing which for so long had been but a vague premonition of disaster and for a while she forgot the clippings and when after a space the touch of them in her hand brought them back to her remembrance she lacked the courage to read them through but not for long suddenly her fear of them gave place to a consuming hatred of the man who had inspired these articles of isaac d worthington for she knew that he must have inspired them and then she began again to read them  truth though it come perverted from the mouth of an enemy has in itself a note to which the soul responds let the mind deny as vehemently as it will cynthia read and as she read her body was shaken with sobs though the tears came not could it be true could the least particle of the least of these fearful insinuations be true oh the treason of those whispers in a voice that was surely not her own and yet which she could not hush was it possible that such things could be printed about one whom she had admired and respected above all mennay whom she had so passionately adored from childhood a monster of iniquity a pariah the cruel bitter calumny of those names cynthia thought of his goodness and loving kindness and his charity to her and to many others his charity the dreaded voice repeated that word and sent a thought that struck terror into her heart whence had come the substance of that charity then came another wordmortgage there it was on the paper and at sight of it there leaped out of her memory a goldengreen poplar shimmering against the sky and the distant blue billows of mountains in the west she heard the highpitched voice of a woman speaking the word and even then it had had a hateful sound and she heard herself asking uncle jethro what is a mortgage he had struck his horse with the whip  loyal though the girl was the whispers would not hush nor the doubts cease to assail her what if ever so small a portion of this were true could the whole of this hideous structure tier resting upon tier have been reared without something of a foundation fiercely though she told herself she would believe none of it fiercely though she hated mr worthington fervently though she repeated aloud that her love for jethro and her faith in him had not changed the doubts remained yet they remained unacknowledged  an hour passed it was a thing beyond belief that one hour could have held such a store of agony an hour passed and cynthia came dryeyed from the parlor susan and jane waiting to give her comfort when she was recovered a little from this unknown but overwhelming affliction were fain to stand mute when they saw her to pay a silent deference to one whom sorrow had lifted far above them and transfigured that was the look on cynthias face she went up the stairs and they stood in the hall not knowing what to do whispering in awestruck voices they were still there when cynthia came down again dressed for the street jane seized her by the hand  where are you going cynthia she asked  i shall be back by five said cynthia  she went up the hill and across to old louisburg square and up the hill again the weather had cleared the violetpaned windows caught the slanting sunlight and flung it back across the piles of snow it was a day for weddingbells at last cynthia came to a queerly fashioned little green door that seemed all askew with the slanting street and rang the bell and in another moment was standing on the threshold of miss lucretia pennimans little sitting room to miss lucretia at her writing table one glance was sufficient she rose quickly to meet the girl kissed her unresponsive cheek and led her to a chair miss lucretia was never one to beat about the bush even in the gravest crisis  you have read the articles she said  read them during her walk hither cynthia had been incapable of thought but the epithets and arraignments and accusations the sentences and paragraphs wars printed now upon her brain never she believed to be effaced every step of the way she had been unconsciously repeating them  have you read them asked cynthia  yes my dear  has everybody read them did the whole world then know of her shame  i am glad you came to me my dear said miss lucretia taking her hand have you talked of this to any one else  no said cynthia simply  miss lucretia was puzzled she had not looked for apathy but she did not know all of cynthias troubles she wondered whether she had misjudged the girl and was misled by her attitude  cynthia she said with a briskness meant to hide emotion for miss lucretia had emotions i am a lonely old woman getting too old indeed to finish the task of my life i went to see mrs merrill the other day to ask her if she would let you come and live with me will you  cynthia shook her head  no miss lucretia i cannot she answered  i wont press it on you now said miss lucretia  i cannot miss lucretia im going to coniston  going to coniston exclaimed miss lucretia  the name of that placemagic name once so replete with visions of happiness and contentseemed to recall cynthias spirit from its flight yes the spirit was there for it flashed in her eyes as she turned and looked into miss lucretias face  are these the articles you read she asked taking the clippings from her muff  miss lucretia put on her spectacles  i have seen both of them she said  and do you believe what they say aboutabout jethro bass  poor miss lucretia for once in her life she was at a loss she too paid a deference to that face young as it was she had robbed herself of sleep trying to make up her mind what she would say upon such an occasion if it came a wonderful virgin faith had to be shattered and was she to be the executioner she loved the girl with that strange intense affection which sometimes comes to the elderly and the lonely and she had prayed that this cup might pass from her was it possible that it was her own voice using very much the same words for which she had rebuked mrs merrill  cynthia she said those articles were written by politicians in a political controversy no such articles can ever be taken literally  miss lucretia do you believe what it says about jethro bass repeated cynthia  how was she to avoid those eyes they pierced into her soul even as her own had pierced into mrs merrills oh miss lucretia who pride yourself on your plain speaking that you should be caught quibbling miss lucretia blushed for the first time in many years and into her face came the light of battle  i am a coward my dear i deserve your rebuke to the best of my knowledge and belief and so far as i can judge from the inquiries i have undertaken jethro bass has made his living and gained and held his power by the methods described in those articles  miss lucretia took off her spectacles and wiped them she had committed a fine act of courage  cynthia stood up  thank you she said that is what i wanted to know  but cried miss lucretia in amazement and apprehension but what are you going to do  i am going to coniston said cynthia to ask him if those things are true  to ask him  yes if he tells me they are true then i shall believe them  if he tells you miss lucretia gasped here was a courage of which she had not reckoned do you think he will tell you  he will tell me and i shall believe him miss lucretia  you are a remarkable girl cynthia said miss lucretia involuntarily then she paused for a moment suppose he tells you they are true you surely cant live with him again cynthia  do you suppose i am going to desert him miss lucretia she asked he loves me andand i love him this was the first time her voice had faltered he kept my father from want and poverty and he has brought me up as a daughter if his life has been as you say i shall make my own living  how demanded miss lucretia the practical part of her coming uppermost  i shall teach school i believe i can get a position in a place where i can see him often i can break his heart miss lucretia ii can bring sadness to myself but i will not desert him  miss lucretia stared at her for a moment not knowing what to say or do she perceived that the girl had a spirit as strong as her own that her plans were formed her mind made up and that no arguments could change her  why did you come to me she asked irrelevantly  because i thought that you would have read the articles and i knew if you had you would have taken the trouble to inform yourself of the worlds opinion  again miss lucretia stared at her  i will go to coniston with you she said at least as far as brampton  cynthias face softened a little at the words  i would rather go alone miss lucretia she answered gently but with the same firmness ii am very grateful to you for your kindness to me in boston i shall not forget itor you goodby miss lucretia  but miss lucretia sobbing openly gathered the girl in her arms and pressed her age was coming on her indeed that she should show such weakness for a long time she could not trust herself to speak and then her words were broken cynthia must come to her at the first sign of doubt or trouble this miss lucretias house was to be a refuge in any storm that life might sendand miss lucretias heart cynthia promised and when she went out at last through the little door her own tears were falling for she loved miss lucretia  cynthia was going to coniston that journey was as fixed as inevitable as things mortal can be she would go to coniston unless she perished on the way no loving entreaties no fears of mrs merrill or her daughters were of any avail mrs merrill too was awed by the vastness of the girls sorrow and wondered if her own nature were small by comparison she had wept to be sure at her husbands confession and lain awake over it in the night watches and thought of the early days of their marriage  and then mrs merrill told herself cynthia would have to talk with mr merrill how was he to come unscathed out of that there was pain and bitterness in that thought and almost resentment against cynthia quivering though she was with sympathy for the girl for mrs merrill though the canker remained had already pardoned her husband and had asked the forgiveness of god for that pardon on other occasions in other crisis she had waited and watched for him in the parlor window and tonight she was at the door before his key was in the lock while he was still stamping the snow from his boots she drew him into the room and told him what had happened  oh stephen she cried what are you going to say to her  what indeed his wife had sorrowed but she had known the obstacles and perils by which he had been beset but what was he to say to cynthia her very name had grown upon him middleaged man of affairs though he was until the thought of it summoned up in his mind a figure of purity and of the strength which was from purity he would not have believed it possible that the country girl whom they had taken into their house three months before should have wrought such an influence over them all  even in the first hour of her sorrow which she had spent that afternoon in the parlor cynthia had thought of mr merrill he could tell her whether those accusations were true or false for he was a friend of jethros her natural impulsethe primeval one of a creature which is hurthad been to hide herself to fly to her own room and perhaps by nightfall the courage would come to her to ask him the terrible questions he was a friend of jethros an illuminating flash revealed to her the meaning of that friendshipif the accusations were true it was then she had thought of miss lucretia penniman and somehow she had found the courage to face the sunlight and go to her she would spare mr merrill  but had she spared him sadly the family sat down to supper without her and after supper mr merrill sent a message to his club that he could not attend a committee meeting there that evening he sat with his wife in the little writing room he pretending to read and she pretending to sew until the silence grew too oppressive and they spoke of the matter that was in their hearts it was one of the bitterest evenings in mr merrills life and there is no need to linger on it they talked earnestly of cynthia and of her future but they both knew why she did not come down to them  so she is really going to coniston said mr merrill  yes answered mrs merrill and i think she is doing right stephen  mr merrill groaned his wife rose and put her hand on his shoulder  come stephen she said gently you will see her in the morning  i will go to coniston with her he said  no replied mrs merrily she wants to go alone and i believe it is best that she should     chapter xii  great afflictions generally bring in their train a host of smaller sorrows each with its own little pang one of these sorrows had been the parting with the merrill family under any circumstance it was not easy for cynthia to express her feelings and now she had found it very difficult to speak of the gratitude and affection which she felt but they understooddear good people that they were no eloquence was needed with them the ordeal of breakfast over and the tearful god bless you miss cynthia of ellen the parlormaid the whole family had gone with her to the station for susan and jane had spent their last day at miss sadlers school  mr merrill had sent for the conductor and bidden him take care of miss wetherell and recommend her in his name to a conductor on the truro road the man took off his cap to mr merrill and called him by name and promised it was a dark day and long after the train had pulled out cynthia remembered the tearful faces of the family standing on the damp platform of the station as they fled northward through the flat rivermeadows the conductor would have liked to talk to her of mr merrill there were few employees on any railroad who did not know the genial and kindly president of the grand gulf and sympathize with his troubles but there was a look on the girls face that forbade intrusion passengers stared at her covertly as though fascinated by that look and some tried to fathom it but her eyes were firmly fixed upon a point far beyond their vision the car stopped many times and flew on again but nothing seemed to break her absorption  at last she was aroused by the touch of the conductor on her sleeve the people were beginning to file out of the car and the train was under the shadow of the snowcovered sheds in the station of the state capital cynthia recognized the place though it was cold and bare and very different in appearance from what it had been on the summers evening when she had come into it with her father that in effect had been her first glimpse of the world and well she recalled the thrill it had given her the joy of such things was gone now the rapture of holidays and new sights these were over so she told herself sorrow had quenched the thrills forever  the kind conductor led her to the eating room and when she would not eat his concern drew greater than ever he took a strange interest in this young lady who had such a face and such eyes he pointed her out to his friend the truro conductor and gave him some sandwiches and fruit which he himself had bought with instructions to press them on her during the afternoon  cynthia could not eat she hated this place with its memories hated it too as a mart where men were bought and sold for the wording of those articles ran in her head as though some priest of evil were chanting them in her ears she did not remember then the sweeter aspect of the old town its pretty homes set among their shaded gardenshomes full of good and kindly people state house affairs were far removed from most of these and the sickness and corruption of the body politic and this political corruption had she known it was no worse than that of the other states in the wide union not so bad indeed as many though this was small comfort no comfort at all to cynthia who did not think of it  after a while she rose and followed the new conductor to the truro train glad to leave the capital behind her she was going to the hillsto the mountains they in truth could not change though the seasons passed over them hot and cold wet and dry they were immutable in their goodness presently she saw them the lower ones the waters of the little stream beside her broke the black bonds of ice and raced over the rapids the engine was puffing and groaning on the grade then the sun crept out slowly from the indefinable margin of vapor that hung massed over the low country  yes she had come to the hills up and up climbed the train through the little white villages in the valley nooks banked with whiter snow through the narrow gorgessometimes hanging over themunder steep granite walls seared with icefilled cracks their brows hung with icicles  truro pass is not so high as the brenner but it has a grand wild look in winter remote as it is from the haunts of men a fitting refuge it might be for a great spirit heavy with the sins of the world below such a place might have been chosen in the olden time for a monasterya gray fastness built against the black forest over the crag looking down upon the green clumps of spruces against the snow some vague longing for such a refuge was in cynthias heart as she gazed upon that silent place and then the waters had already begun to run westwardthe waters of tumble down brook which flowed into coniston water above brampton the sun still had more than two hours to go on its journey to the hill crests when the train pulled into brampton station there were but a few people on the platform but the first face she saw as she stepped from the car was lem hallowells it was a very red face as we know and its owner was standing in front of the coniston stage on runners now he stared at her for an instant and no wonder and then he ran forward with outstretched hands  cynthycynthy wetherell he cried great godfrey  he got so far he seized her hands and then he stopped not knowing why there were many more ejaculations and welcomes and what not on the end of his tongue it was not that she had become a ladya lady of a type he had never before seen he meant to say that too in his own way but he couldnt and that transformation would have bothered lem but little what was the change then why was he in awe of herhe lem hallowell who had never been in awe of any one he shook his head as though openly confessing his inability to answer that question he wanted to ask others but they would not come  lem she said i am so glad you are here  climb right in cynthy ill get the trunk there it lay the little rawhide one before him on the boards and he picked it up in his bare hands as though it had been a paper parcel it was a peculiarity of the stage driver that he never wore gloves even in winter so remarkable was the circulation of his blood after the trunk he deposited apparently with equal ease various barrels and boxes and then he jumped in beside cynthia and they drove down familiar brampton street as wide as a wide river past the meetinghouse with the terraced steeple past the postofficecousin ephraims postofficewhere lem gave her a questioning lookbut she shook her head and he did not wait for the distribution of the last mail that day past the great mansion of isaac d worthington where the iron mastiffs on the lawn were up to their muzzles in snow after that they took the turn to the right which was the road to coniston  wellremembered road and in winter or summer cynthia knew every tree and farmhouse beside it now it consisted of two deep grooves in the deep snow that was all save for a curving turnout here and there for team to pass team wellremembered scene how often had cynthia looked upon it in happier days such a crust was on the snow as would bear a heavy man and the pasture hillocks were like glazed cakes in the window of a bakers shop never had the western sky looked so yellow through the black columns of the pine trunks a lonely beautiful road it was that evening  for a long time the silence of the great hills was broken only by the sweet jingle of the bells on the shaft many a day winter and summer lem had gone that road alone whistling and never before heeding that silence now it seemed to symbolize a great sorrow to be in subtle harmony with that of the girl at his side what that sorrow was he could not guess the good man yearned to comfort her and yet he felt his comfort too humble to be noticed by such sorrow he longed to speak but for the first time in his life feared the sound of his own voice cynthia had not spoken since she left the station had not looked at him had not asked for the friends and neighbors whom she had loved so wellhad not asked for jethro was there any sorrow on earth to be felt like that and was there one to feel it  at length when they reached the great forest lem hallowell knew that he must speak or cry aloud but what would be the sound of his voiceafter such an age of disuse could he speak at all broken and hoarse and hideous though the sound might be he must speak and hoarse and broken it was it was not his own but still it was a voice  folksfolksll be surprised to see you cynthy  no he had not spoken at all yes he had for she answered him  i suppose they will lem  mighty glad to have you back cynthy we think a sight of you we missed you  thank you lem  jethro haint lookin for you by any chance be he  no she said but the question startled her suppose he had not been at home she had never once thought of that could she have borne to wait for him  after that lem gave it up he had satisfied himself as to his vocal powers but he had not the courage even to whistle the journey to coniston was faster in the winter and at the next turn of the road the little village came into view there it was among the snows the pain in cynthias heart so long benumbed quickened when she saw it how write of the sharpness of that pain to those who have never known it the sight of every gable brought its agonythe store with the checkerpaned windows the harness shop the meetinghouse the white parsonage on its little hill rias richardson ran out of the store in his carpet slippers bareheaded in the cold and gave one shout lem heeded him not did not stop there as usual but drove straight to the tannery house and pulled up under the butternut tree milly skinner ran out on the porch and gave one long look and cried  good lord its cynthy  wheres jethro demanded lem  milly did not answer at once she was staring at cynthia  hes in the tannery shed she said choppin wood but still she kept her eyes on cynthias face ill fetch him  no said cynthia ill go to him there  she took the path leaving millicent with her mouth open too amazed to speak again and yet not knowing why  in the tannery shed would jethro remember what happened there almost six and thirty years before would he remember how that other cynthia had come to him there and what her appeal had been  cynthia came to the doors one of these was open nowboth had been closed that other evening against the storm of sleetand she caught a glimpse of him standing on the floor of chips and barktanbark no more cynthia caught a glimpse of him and love suddenly welled up into her heart as waters into a spring after a drought he had not seen her not heard the sound of the sleighbells he was standing with his foot upon the sawbuck and the saw across his knee he was staring at the woodpile and there was stamped upon his face a look which no man or woman had ever seen there a look of utter loneliness and desolation a look as of a soul condemned to wander forever through the infinite cold spaces between the worldsalone  cynthia stopped at sight of it what had been her misery and affliction compared to this her limbs refused her though she knew not whether she would have fled or rushed into his arms how long she stood thus and he stood may not be said but at length he put down his foot and took the saw from his knee his eyes fell upon her and his lips spoke her name  cynthy  speechless she ran to him and flung her arms about his neck and he dropped the saw and held her tightlyeven as he had held that other cynthia in that place in the year gone by and yet not so now he clung to her with a desperation that was terrible as though to let go of her would be to fall into nameless voids beyond human companionship and love but at last he did release her and stood looking down into her face as if seeking to read a sentence there  and how was she to pronounce that sentence though her faith might be taken away her love remained and grew all the greater because he needed it yet she knew that no subterfuge or pretence would avail her to hide why she had come she could not hide it it must be spoken out now though death was preferable  and he was waiting did he guess she could not tell he had spoken no word but her name he had expressed no surprise at her appearance asked no reasons for it superlatives of suffering or joy or courage are hard to conveywords fall so far short of the feeling and cynthias pain was so far beyond tears  uncle jethro she said yesterday somethingsomething happened i could not stay in boston any longer  he nodded  i had to come to you i could not wait  he nodded again  ii read something to take a whitehot iron and sear herself would have been easier than this  yes he said  she felt that the look was coming againthe look which she had surprised in his face his hands dropped lifelessly from her shoulders and he turned and went to the door where he stood with his back to her silhouetted against the eastern sky all pink from the reflection of sunset he would not help her perhaps he could not the things were true there had been a grain of hope within her ready to sprout  i read two articles from the newcastle guardian about youabout your life  yes he said but he did not turn  how you hadhow you had earned your living how you had gained your power she went on her pain lending to her voice an exquisite note of many modulations  yescynthy he said and still stared at the eastern sky  she took two steps toward him her arms outstretched her fingers opening and closing and then she stopped  i would believe no one she said i will believe no oneuntilunless you tell me uncle jethro she cried in agony uncle jethro tell me that those things are not true  she waited a space but he did not stir there was no sound save the song of coniston water under the shattered ice  wont you speak to me she whispered wont you tell me that they are not true  his shoulders shook convulsively o for the right to turn to her and tell her that they were lies he would have bartered his soul for it what was all the power in the world compared to this priceless treasure he had lost once before he had cast it away though without meaning to then he did not know the eternal value of loveof such love as those two women had given him now he knew that it was beyond value the one precious gift of life and the knowledge had come too late could he have saved his life if he had listened to that other cynthia  wont you tell me that they are not true  even then he did not turn to her but he answered curious to relate though his heart was breaking his voice was steadysteady as it always had been  iive seen it comin cynthy he said i never knowed anything i was afraid of beforebut i was afraid of this i knowed what your notions of right and wrong wasyouryour mother had them theyre the principles of good people ii knowed the day would come when youd ask but i wanted to be happy as long as i could i haint been happy cynthy but you was right when you said id tell you the truth sso i will i guess them things which you speak about are truethe way i got where i am and the way i made my livin theythey haint put just as theyd ought to be perhaps but thats the way i done it in the main  it was thus that jethro bass met the supreme crisis of his life and who shall say he did not meet it squarely and honestly few men of finer fibre and more delicate morals would have acquitted themselves as well that was a judgment day for jethro and though he knew it not he spoke through cynthia to his maker confessing his faults freely and humbly and dwelling on the justness of his punishment putting not forward any good he may have done nor thinking of it nor seeking excuse because of the light that was in him had he been at deaths door in the face of nameless tortures no man could have dragged such a confession from him but a great love had been given him and to that love he must speak the truth even at the cost of losing it  but he was not to lose it even as he was speaking a thrill of admiration ran through cynthia piercing her sorrow the superb strength of the man was there in that simple confession and it is in the nature of woman to admire strength he had fought his fight and gained and paid the price without a murmur seeking no palliation cynthia had not come to that trialso bitter for heras a judge if the reader has seen youth and innocence sitting in the seat of justice with age and experience at the bar he has mistaken cynthia she came to coniston inexorable it is true because hers was a nature impelled to do right though it perish she did not presume to say what jethros lights and opportunities might have been her own she knew and by them she must act accordingly  when he had finished speaking she stole silently to his side and slipped her hand in his he trembled violently at her touch  uncle jethro she said in a low tone i love you  at the words he trembled more violently still  no no cynthy he answered thickly dont say thatii dont expect it cynthy i know you canttwouldnt be right cynthy i haint fit for it  uncle jethro she said i love you better than i have ever loved you in my life  oh how welcome were the tears and how human he turned pitifully incredulous wondering that she should seek by deceit to soften the blow he saw them running down her cheeks and he believed yes he believed though it seemed a thing beyond belief unworthy unfit though he were she loved him and his own love as he gazed at her sevenfold increased as it had been by the knowledge of losing her changed in texture from homage to worshipnay to adoration his punishment would still be heavy but whence had come such a wondrous gift to mitigate it  oh dont you believe me she cried cant you see that it is true  and yet he could only hold her there at arms length with that new and strange reverence in his face he was not worthy to touch her but still she loved him  the flush had faded from the eastern sky and the faintest border of yellow light betrayed the ragged outlines of the mountain as they walked together to the tannery house  millicent in the kitchen was making great preparationsfor millicent miss skinner was a person who had hitherto laid it down as a principle of life to pay deference or do honor to no human made of mere dust like herself millicents exception if cynthia had thought about it was a tribute of no mean order cynthia alas did not think about it she did not know that in her absence the fire had not been lighted in the evening jethro supping on crackers and milk and milly partaking of the evening meal at home moreover miss skinner had an engagement with a young man cynthia saw the fire and threw off her sealskin coat which mr and mrs merrill had given her for christmas and took down the saucepan from the familiar nail on which it hung it was a miraculous fact for which she did not attempt to account that she was almost happy happy indeed in comparison to that which had been her state since the afternoon before millicent snatched the saucepan angrily from her hand  what be you doin cynthy she demanded  such was miss skinners little way of showing deference though deference is not usually vehement miss skinners was very real nevertheless  why milly whats the matter exclaimed cynthia in astonishment  you haint agoin to do any cookin thats all said milly very red in the face  but ive always helped said cynthia why not  why not a tribute was one thing but to have to put the reasons for that tribute into words was quite another  why not cried milly because you haint agoin to thats all  strange deference but cynthia turned and looked at the girl with a little sad smile of comprehension and affection she took her by the shoulders and kissed her  whereupon a most amazing thing happenedmillicent burst into tearswild ungovernable tears they were  because you haint agoin to she repeated her words interspersed with violent sobs you go way cynthy she cried git out  milly said cynthia shaking her head you ought to be ashamed of yourself but they were not words of reproof she took a little lamp from the shelf and went up the narrow stairs to her own room in the gable where lemuel had deposited the rawhide trunk  though she had had nothing all day she felt no hunger but for millys sake she tried hard to eat the supper when it came before it had fairly begun moses hatch had arrived with amandy and eben and rias richardson came in and other neighbors to say a word of welcome to hear if the truth be not too disparaging to their characters the reasons for her sudden appearance and such news of her boston experiences as she might choose to give them they had learned from lem hallowell that cynthia had returned a lady a real lady not a sham one who relied on airs and graces such as had come to coniston the summer before to look for a summer place on the painters recommendation lem was not a gossip in the disagreeable sense of the term and he had not said a word to his neighbors of his feelings on that terrible drive from brampton knowing that some blow had fallen upon cynthia he would have spared her these visits if he could but lem was wise and kind so he merely said that she had returned a lady  and they had found a lady as they stood or sat around the kitchen eben and rias stood cynthia talked to themabout coniston rather be it said that they talked about coniston in answer to her questions the sledding had been good moses had hauled so many thousand feet of lumber to brampton sam prices woman she of harwich had had a spell of sciatica chester perkinss bull had tossed his brotherinlaw come from iowy on a visit and broke his leg yes amandy guessed her dyspepsy was somewhat improved since she had tried grahams golden remedyit made her feel real lighthearted eben blushing furiously was to have the brook farm in the spring there was a case of spotted fever in tarleton  yes lem hallowell had been right cynthia was a lady but not a mite stuck up what was the difference in her not her clothes which she wore as if she had been used to them all her life poor cynthia the clothes were simple enough not her manner which was as kind and sweet as ever what was it that compelled their talk about themselves that made them refrain from asking those questions about boston and why she had come back some such query was running in their minds as they talked while jethro having finished his milk and crackers sat silent at the end of the table with his eyes upon her he rose when mr satterlee came in  mr satterlee looked at her and then he went quietly across the room and kissed her but then mr satterlee was the minister cynthia thought his hair a little thinner and the lines in his face a little deeper and mr satterlee thought perhaps he was the only one of the visitors who guessed why she had come back he laid his thin hand on her head as though in benediction and sat down beside her  and how is the learning cynthia he asked  now indeed they were going to hear something at last an intuition impelled cynthia to take advantage of that opportunity  the learning has become so great mr satterlee she said that i have come back to try to make some use of it it shall be wasted no more  she did not dare to look at jethro but she was aware that he had sat down abruptly what sacrifice will not a good woman make to ease the burden of those whom she loves and jethros burden would be heavy enough such a woman will speak almost gayly though her heart be heavy but cynthias was lighter now than it had been  i was always sure you would not waste your learning cynthia said mr satterlee gravely that you would make the most of the advantages god has given you  i am going to try mr satterlee i cannot be content in idleness i was wasting time in boston and ii was not happy so far away from you allfrom uncle jethro mr satterlee i am going to teach school i have always wanted to and now i have made up my mind to do it  this was jethros punishment but had she not lightened it for him a little by choosing this way of telling him that she could not eat his bread or partake of his bounty though by reason of that bounty she was what she was she could not live and thrive on it longer coming as it did from such a source mr satterlee might perhaps surmise the truth but the town and village would think her ambition a very natural one certainly no better time could have been chosen to announce it  to teach school she was sure now that mr satterlee knew and approved and perceived something at least of her little ruse he was a man whose talents fitted him for a larger flock than he had at coniston but he possessed neither the graces demanded of city ministers nor the power of pushing himself never was a more retiring man the years she had spent in his study had not gone for nothing for he who has cherished the bud can predict what the flower will be and mr satterlee knew her spiritually better than any one else in coniston he had heard of her return and had walked over to the tannery house full of fears the remembrance of those expressions of simple faith in jethro coming back to his mind had the revelation which he had so long expected come at last and how had she taken it would it embitter her the good man believed that it would not and now he saw that it had not and rejoiced accordingly  to teach school he said i expected that you would wish to cynthia it is a desire that most of us have who like books and what is in them i should have taught school if i had not become a minister it is a high calling and an absorbing one to develop the minds of the young mr satterlee was often a little discursive though there was reason for it on this occasion and moses hatch half closed his eyes and bowed his head a little out of sheer habit at the sound of the ministers voice but he raised it suddenly at the next words i was in brampton yesterday and saw mr graves who is on the prudential committee of that district you may not have heard that miss goddard has left they have not yet succeeded in filling her place and i think it more than likely that you can get it  cynthia glanced at jethro but the habit of years was so strong in him that he gave no sign  do you think so mr satterlee she said gratefully i had heard of the place and hoped for it because it is near enough for me to spend the saturdays and sundays with uncle jethro and i meant to go to brampton tomorrow to see about it  i will go with you said the minister i have business in brampton tomorrow he did not mention that this was the business  when at length they had all departed jethro rose and went about the house making fast the doors as was his custom while cynthia sat staring through the bars at the dying embers in the stove he knew now and it was inevitable that he should know what she had made up her mind to do it had been decreed that she who owed him everything should be made to pass this most dreadful of censures upon his whole life oh the cruelty of that decree  how she mused would it affect him had the blow been so great that he would relinquish those practices which had become a lifelong habit with him would he she caught her breath at this thought would he abandon that struggle with isaac d worthington in which he was striving to maintain the mastery of the state by those very practices cynthia hated mr worthington the term is not too strong and it expresses her feeling but she would have got down on her knees on the board floor of the kitchen that very night and implored jethro to desist from that contest if she could she remembered how in her innocence she had believed that the people had given jethro his powerin those days when she was so proud of that very powernow she knew that he had wrested it from them what more supreme sacrifice could he make than to relinquish it ah there was a still greater sacrifice that jethro was to make had she known it  he came and stood over her by the stove and she looked up into his face with these yearnings in her eyes yes she would have thrown herself on her knees if she could but she could not perhaps he would abandon that struggle perhapsperhaps his heart was broken and could a man with a broken heart still fight on she took his hand and pressed it against her face and he felt that it was wet with her tears  bbetter go to bed now cynthy he said mmust be worn outmmust be worn out  he stooped and kissed her on the forehead it was thus that jethro bass accepted his sentence     chapter xiii  at sunrise in that coniston hillcountry it is the western hills which are red and a distant hillock on the meadow farm which was soon to be edens looked like the daintiest conical cake with pink icing as cynthia surveyed the familiar view the next morning there was the mountain the pastures on the lower slopes all red too and higher up the dark masses of bristling spruce and pine and hemlock mottled with white where the snowcovered rocks showed through  sunrise in january is not very early and sunrise at any season is not early for coniston cynthia sat at her window and wondered whether that beautiful landscape would any longer be hers her life had grown up on it but now her life had changed would the beauty be taken from it too almost hungrily she gazed at the scene she might look upon it againmany times perhapsbut a conviction was strong in her that its daily possession would now be only a memory  mr satterlee was as good as his word for he was seated in the stage when it drew up at the tannery house ready to go to brampton and as they drove away cynthia took one last look at jethro standing on the porch it seemed to her that it had been given her to feel all things and to know all things to know especially this strange man jethro bass as none other knew him and to love him as none other loved him the last severe wrench was come and she had left him standing there alone in the cold divining what was in his heart as though it were in her own how worthless was this mighty power which he had gained how hateful when he could not bestow the smallest fragment of it upon one whom he loved someone has described hell as disqualification in the face of opportunity such was jethros torment that morning as he saw her drive away the minister in the place where he should have been at her side and he jethro bass as helpless as though he had indeed been in the pit among the flames had the prudential committee at brampton promised the appointment ten times over he might still have obtained it for her by a word and he must not speak even that word who shall say that a large part of the punishment of jethro bass did not come to him in the life upon this earth  some such thoughts were running in cynthias head as they jingled away to brampton that dazzling morning perhaps the stage driver too who knew something of men and things and who meddled not at all had made a guess at the situation he thought that cynthias spirits seemed lightened a little and he meant to lighten them more so he joked as much as his respect for his passengers would permit and told the news of brampton not the least of the news concerned the first citizen of that place there was a certain railroad in the west which had got itself much into congress and much into the newspapers and isaac d worthington had got himself into that railroad was gone west it was said on that business and might not be back for many weeks and lem hallowell remembered when mr worthington was a slimcheated young man wandering up and down coniston water in search of health good mr satterlee thinking this a safe subject allowed himself to be led into a discussion of the first citizens career which indeed had something fascinating in it  thus they jingled into brampton street and stopped before the cottage of judge gravesa courtesy title the judge himself came to the door and bestowed a pronounced bow on the minister for mr satterlee was honored in brampton just think of what ezra graves might have looked like and you have him he greeted cynthia too with a warm welcomefor ezra gravesand ushered them into a best parlor which was reserved for ministers and funerals and great occasions in general and actually raised the blinds then mr satterlee with much hemming and hawing stated the business which had brought them while cynthia looked out of the window  mr graves sat and twirled his lean thumbs he went so far as to say that he admired a young woman who scorned to live in idleness who wished to impart the learning with which she had been endowed fifteen applicants were under consideration for the position and the prudential committee had so far been unable to declare that any of them were completely qualified it was well named that prudential committee mr graves furthermore volunteered that he had expressed a wish to colonel prescott oh ephraim you too have got a title with your new honors to colonel prescott and others that miss wetherell might take the place the middle term opened on the morrow and miss bruce of the worthington free library had been induced to teach until a successor could be appointed although it was most inconvenient for miss bruce  could miss wetherell start in at once provided the committee agreed cynthia replied that she would like nothing better there would be an examination before mr errol the brampton superintendent of schools in short owing to the pressing nature of the occasion the judge would take the liberty of calling the committee together immediately would mr satterlee and miss wetherell make themselves at home in the parlor  it very frequently happens that one member of a committee is the brain and the other members form the body of it it was so in this case ezra graves typified all of prudence there was about it which it must be admitted was a great deal he it was who had weighed in the balance the fifteen applicants and found them wanting another member of the committee was that comfortable mr dodd with the tuft of yellow beard the hardware dealer whom we have seen at the baseball game mr dodd was not a person who had opinions unless they were presented to him from certain sources and then he had been known to cling to them tenaciously it is sufficient to add that when cynthia wetherells name was mentioned to him he remembered the girl to whom bob worthington had paid such marked attentions on the grand stand he knew literally nothing else about cynthia judge graves apparently knew all about her this was sufficient at that time for mr dodd he was sick and tired of the whole affair and if by the grace of heaven an applicant had been sent who conformed with judge gravess multitude of requirements he was devoutly thankful the other member mr hill was a feed and lumber dealer and not a very good one for he was always in difficulties certain scholarly attainments were attributed to him and therefore he had been put on the committee they met in mr dodds little office back of the store and in five minutes cynthia was a schoolmistress subject to examination by mr errol  just a word about mr errol he was a retired lawyer with some means who took an interest in town affairs to occupy his time he had a very delicate wife whom he had been obliged to send south at the beginning of the winter there she had for a while improved but had been taken ill again and two days before cynthias appointment he had been summoned to her bedside by a telegram cynthia could go into the school and her examination would take place when mr errol returned  all this was explained by the judge when half an hour after he had left them he returned to the best parlor miss wetherell would then be prepared to take the school the following morning whereupon the judge shook hands with her and did not deny that he had been instrumental in the matter  and mr satterlee i am so grateful to you said cynthia when they were in the street once more  my dear cynthia i did nothing answered the minister quite bewildered by the quick turn affairs had taken it is your own good reputation that got you the place  nevertheless mr satterlee had done his share in the matter he had known mr graves for a long time and better than any other person in brampton mr graves remembered cynthia ware and indeed had spoken to cynthia that day about her mother mr graves had also read poor william wetherells contributions to the newcastle guardian and he had not read that paper since they had ceased from time to time mr satterlee had mentioned his pupil to the judge whose mind had immediately flown to her when the vacancy occurred so it all came about  and now said mr satterlee what will you do cynthia weve got the good part of a day to arrange where you will live before the stage returns  i wont go back tonight i think said cynthia turning her head away if you would be good enough to tell uncle jethro to send my trunk and some other things  perhaps that is just as well assented the minister understanding perfectly i have thought that miss bruce might be glad to board you he continued after a pause let us go to see her  mr satterlee said cynthia would you mind if we went first to see cousin ephraim  why of course we must see ephraim said mr satterlee briskly so they walked on past the mansion of the first citizen and the new block of stores which the first citizen had built to the old brick building which held the brampton postoffice and right through the door of the partition into the sanctum of the postmaster himself which some one had nicknamed the brampton club on this occasion the postmaster was seated in his shirt sleeves by the stove alone his listeners being conspicuously absent cynthia who had caught a glimpse of him through the little mailwindow thought he looked very happy and comfortable  great tecumseh he criedan exclamation he reserved for extraordinary occasions if it haint cynthy  he started to hobble toward her but cynthia ran to him  why said he looking at her closely after the greeting was over you be changed cynthy mercy i dont know as id have dared done that if id seed you first what have you ben doin to yourself you must have seed a whole lot down there in boston and youre a fullblown lady too  oh no im not cousin eph she answered trying to smile  yes you be he insisted still scrutinizing her vainly trying to account for the change tact as we know was not ephraims strong point now he shook his head you always was beyond me got a sort of air about you and it grows on you too wouldnt be surprised he declared speaking now to the minister wouldnt be a mite surprised to see her in the white house some day  now cousin eph said cynthia coloring a little you mustnt talk nonsense what have you done with your coat you have no business to go without it with your rheumatism  it haint ben so bad since uncle sam took me over again cynthy he answered with nothin to do but sort letters in a nice hot room the room was hot indeed but where did you come from  i grew tired of being taught cousin eph iive always wanted to teach mr satterlee has been with me to see mr graves and theyve given me miss goddards place im coming to brampton to live today  great tecumseh exclaimed ephraim again overpowered by the yews i want to know what does jethro say to that  hehe is willing she replied in a low voice  well said ephraim i always thought youd come to it its in the blood i guessteachin your mother had it too im kind of sorry for jethro though so i be but im glad for myself cynthy so youre comin to brampton to live with me  i was going to ask miss bruce to take me in said cynthia  no you haint anything of the kind said ephraim indignantly ive got a little house up the street and a room all ready for you  will you let me share expenses cousin eph  ill let you do anything you want said he sos you come dont you think shed ought to come and take care of an old man mr satterlee  mr satterlee turned he had been contemplating during this conversation a lifesize print of general grant under two crossed flags that was hung conspicuously on the wall  i do not think you could do better cynthia he answered smiling the minister liked ephraim and he liked a little joke occasionally he felt that one would not be particularly out of place just now so he repeated i do not think you could do better than to accept the offer of colonel prescott  ephraim grew very red as was his wont when twitted about his new title he took things literally  i haint a colonel no more than you be mr satterlee but the boys down here will have it so  three days later by the early train which leaves the state capital at an unheardof hour in the morning a young man arrived in brampton his jaw seemed squarer than ever to the citizens who met the train out of curiosity and to mr dodd who was expecting a pump and there was a set look on his face like that of a man who is going into a race or a fight mr dodd though astonished hastened toward him  well this is unexpected bob said he how be you harvard college failed up  for mr dodd never let slip a chance to assure a member of the worthington family of his continued friendship  how are you mr dodd answered bob nodding at him carelessly and passing on mr dodd did not dare to follow what was young worthington doing in brampton and his father in the west on that railroad business filled with curiosity mr dodd forgot his pump but bob was already striding into brampton street carrying his bag if he had stopped for a few moments with the hardware dealer or chatted with any of the dozen people who bowed and stared at him he might have saved himself a good deal of trouble he turned in at the worthington mansion and rang the bell which was answered by sarah the housemaid  mr bob she exclaimed  wheres mrs holden he asked  mrs holden was the elderly housekeeper she had gone unfortunately to visit a bereaved relative unfortunately for bob because she too might have told him something  get me some breakfast sarah anything he commanded and tell silas to hitch up the black trotters to my cutter  sarah though in consternation did as she was bid the breakfast was forthcoming and in half an hour silas had the black trotters at the door bob got in without a word seized the reins the cutter flew down brampton street observed by many of the residents thereof and turned into the coniston road silas said nothing silas as a matter of fact never did say anything he had been the worthington coachman for five and twenty years and he was known in brampton as silas the silent young mr worthington had no desire to talk that morning  the black trotters covered the ten miles in much quicker time than lem hallowell could do it in his stage but the distance seemed endless to bob it was not much more than half an hour after he had left brampton street however that he shot past the store and by the time rias richardson in his carpet slippers reached the platform the cutter was in front of the tannery house and the trotters with their sides smoking were pawing up the snow under the butternut tree  bob leaped out hurried up the path and knocked at the door it was opened by jethro bass himself  how do you do mr bass said the young man gravely and he held out his hand jethro gave him such a scrutinizing look as he had given many a man whose business he cared to guess but bob looked fearlessly into his eyes jethro took his hand  ccome in he said  bob went into that little room where jethro and cynthia had spent so many nights together and his glance flew straight to the picture on the wallthe portrait of cynthia wetherell in crimson and seed pearls so strangely set amidst such surroundings his glance went to the portrait and his feet followed as to a lodestone he stood in front of it for many minutes in silence and jethro watched him at last he turned  where is she he asked  it was a queer question and jethros answer was quite as lacking in convention  ggone to bramptongone to brampton  gone to brampton do you mean to say what is she doing there bob demanded  teachin school said jethro ggot miss goddards place  bob did not reply for a moment the little schoolhouse was the only building in brampton he had glanced at as he came through mrs merrill had told him that she might take that place but he had little imagined she was already there on her platform facing the rows of shining little faces at the desks he had deemed it more than possible that he might see jethro at coniston but he had not taken into account that which he might say to him bob had indeed thought of nothing but cynthia and of the blow that had fallen upon her he had tried to realize the multiple phases of the situation which confronted him here was the man who by the conduct of his life had caused the blow he too was her benefactor and again this same man was engaged in the bitterest of conflicts with his father isaac d worthington and it was this conflict which had precipitated that blow bob could not have guessed by looking at jethro bass how great was the sorrow which had fallen upon him but bob knew that jethro hated his father must hate him now because of cynthia with a hatred given to few men to feel he thought that jethro would crush mr worthington and ruin him if he could and bob believed he could  what was he to say he did not fear jethro for bob worthington had courage enough but these things were running in his mind and he felt the power of the man before him as all men did bob went to the window and came back again he knew that he must speak  mr bass he said at last did cynthia ever mention me to you  no said jethro  mr bass i love her i have told her so and i have asked her to be my wife  there was no need indeed to have told jethro this the shock of that revelation had come to him when he had seen the trotters had been confirmed when the young man had stood before the portrait jethros face might have twitched when bob stood there with his back to him  jethro could not speak once more there had come to him a moment when he would not trust his voice to ask a question he dreaded the answer though none might have surmised this he knew cynthia he knew that when she had given her heart it was for all time he dreaded the answer because it might mean that her sorrow was doubled  i believe bob continued painfully seeing that jethro would say nothing i believe that cynthia loves me i should not dare to say it or to hope it without reason she has not said so but the words were very hard for him yet he stuck manfully to the truth but she told me to write to my father and let him know what i had done and not to come back to her until i had his answer this he added wondering that a man could listen to such a thing without a sign this was beforebefore she had any idea of coming home  yes cynthia did love him there was no doubt about it in jethros mind she would not have bade bob write to his father if she had not loved him still jethro did not speak but by some intangible force compelled bob to go on  i shall write to my father as soon as he comes back from the west but i wish to say to you mr bass that whatever his answer contains i mean to marry cynthia nothing can shake me from that resolution i tell you this because my father is fighting you and you know what he will say jethro knew dudley worthington well enough to appreciate that this would make no particular difference in his opposition to the marriage except to make that opposition more vehement and because you do not know me continued bob when i say a thing i mean it even if my father cuts me off and casts me out i will marry cynthia goodby mr bass  jethro took the young mans hand again bob imagined that he even pressed ita littlesomething he had never done before  goodby bob  bob got as far as the door  ergo back to harvard bob  i intend to mr bass  erbob  yes  ddont quarrel with your fatherdont quarrel with your father  i shant be the one to quarrel mr bass  bobhaint you pretty youngpretty young  yes said bob rather unexpectedly i am then he added i know my own mind  ppretty young dont want to get married yet awhiledo you  yes i do said bob but i suppose i shant be able to  erwait awhile bob go back to harvard wwouldnt write that letter if i was you  but i will ill not have him think im ashamed of what ive done im proud of it mr bass  in the eyes of coniston which had been waiting for his reappearance bob worthington jumped into the sleigh and drove off he left behind him jethro bass who sat in his chair the rest of the morning with his head bent in revery so deep that millicent had to call him twice to his simple dinner bob left behind him too a score of rumors sprung full grown into life with his visit men and women an incredible distance away heard them in an incredible time those in the village found an immediate pretext for leaving their legitimate occupation and going to the store and a gathering was in session there when young mr worthington drove past it on his way back bob thought little about the rumors and not thinking of them it did not occur to him that they might affect cynthia the only person then in coniston whom he thought about was jethro bass bob decided that his liking for jethro had not diminished but rather increased he admired jethro for the advice he had given although he did not mean to take it and for the first time he pitied him  bob did not know that rumor too was spreading in brampton he had his dinner in the big walnut dining room all alone and after it he smoked his fathers cigars and paced up and down the big hall watching the clock for he could not go to her in the school hours at length he put on his hat and hurried out crossing the parklike enclosure in the middle of the street bowed at by mr dodd who always seemed to be on hand and others and nodding absently in return concealment was not in bob worthingtons nature he reached the postoffice where the partition door was open and he walked right into a comparatively full meeting of the brampton club ephraim sat in their midst and for once he was not telling war stories he was silent and the others fell suddenly silent too at bobs entrance  how do you do mr prescott he said as ephraim struggled to his feet how is the rheumatism  how be you mr worthington said ephraim this is a kind of a surprise haint it ephraim was getting used to surprises well it is goodnatured of you to come in and shake hands with an old soldier  dont mention it mr prescott answered honest bob a little abashed i should have done so anyway but the fact is i wanted to speak to you a moment in private  certain said ephraim glancing helplessly around him jest come out front that space where the public were supposed to be was the only private place in the brampton postoffice but the members of the brampton club could take a hint and with one consent began to make excuses bob knew them all from boyhood and spoke to them all some of them ventured to ask him if harvard had bust up  where does cynthialive he demanded coming straight to the point  ephraim stared at him for a moment in a bewildered fashion and then a light began to dawn on him  lives with me he answered he was quite as ashamed for bobs sake as if he himself had asked the question and he went on talking to cover that embarrassment its made some difference too sence she come house looks like a different place afore she come i cooked with a kit same as i used to in the harness shop i larned it in the army cynthys got a stove  it was not the way ephraim would have gone about a love affair had he had one sam prices were the approved methods in that section of the country though sam had overdone them somewhat it was an unheardof thing to ask a man right out like that where a girl lived  much obliged said bob and was gone ephraim raised his hands in despair and hobbled to the little window to get a last look at him where were the proprieties in these days the other aspect of the affair what mr worthington would think of it when he returned did not occur to the innocent mind of the old soldier until people began to talk about it that afternoon then it worried him into another attack of rheumatism  half of brampton must have seen bob worthington march up to the little yellow house which ephraim had rented from john billings it had four rooms around the big chimney in the middle and that was all simple as it was an architect would have said that its proportions were nearly perfect john billings had it from his grandfather post who built it and though brampton would have laughed at the statement isaac d worthingtons mansion was not to be compared with it for beauty the old cherry furniture was still in it and the old wall papers and the panelling in the little room to the right which cynthia had made into a sitting room  half of brampton too must have seen cynthia open the door and bob walk into the entry then the door was shut but it had been held open for an appreciable time howeverwhile you could count twentybecause cynthia had not the power to close it for a while she could only look into his eyes and he into hers she had not seen him coming she had but answered the knock then slowly the color came into her cheeks and she knew that she was trembling from head to foot  cynthia he said maynt i come in  she did not answer for fear her voice would tremble too and she could not send him away in the face of all brampton she opened the door a little wider a very little and he went in then she closed it and for a moment they stood facing each other in the entry which was lighted only by the fanlight over the door cynthia with her back against the wall he spoke her name again his voice thick with the passion which had overtaken him like a flood at the sight of hera passion to seize her in his arms and cherish and comfort and protect her forever and ever all this he felt and more as he looked into her face and saw the traces of her great sorrow there he had not thought that that face could be more beautiful in its strength and purity but it was even so  cynthiamy love he cried and raised his arms but a look as of a great fear came into her eyes which for one exquisite moment had yielded to his own and her breath came quickly as though she were spentas indeed she was so far spent that the wall at her back was grateful  no she said noyou must notyou must notyou must not again and again she repeated the words for she could summon no others they were a mandatehad he guessed itto herself as to him for the time her brain refused its functions and she could think of nothing but the fact that he was there beside her ready to take her in his arms how she longed to fly into them none but herself knewto fly into them as into a refuge secure against the evil powers of the world it was not reason that restrained her then but something higher in her that restrained him likewise without moving from the wall she pushed open the door of the sitting room  go in there she said  he went in as she bade him and stood before the flickering logs in the wide and shallow chimneyplacelogs that seemed to burn on the very hearth itself and yet the smoke rose unerring into the flue no stove had ever desecrated that room bob looked into the flames and waited and cynthia stood in the entry fighting this second great battle which had come upon her while her forces were still spent with that other one woman in her very nature is created to be sheltered and protected and the yearning in her when her love is given is intense as nature itself to seek sanctuary in that love so it was with cynthia leaning against the entry wall her arms full length in front of her and her hands clasped as she prayed for strength to withstand the temptation at last she grew calmer though her breath still came deeply and she went into the sitting room  perhaps he knew vaguely why she had not followed him at once he had grown calmer himself calmer with that desperation which comes to a man of his type when his soul and body are burning with desire for a woman he knew that he would have to fight for her with herself he knew now that she was too strong in her position to be carried by storm and the interval had given him time to collect himself he did not dare at first to look up from the logs for fear he should forget himself and be defeated instantly  i have been to coniston cynthia he said  yes  i have been to coniston this morning and i have seen mr bass and i have told him that i love you and that i will never give you up i told you so in boston cynthia he said i knew that this this trouble would come to you i would have given my life to have saved you from itfrom the least part of it i would have given my life to have been able to say it shall not touch you i saw it flowing in like a great sea between you and me and yet i could not tell you of it i could not prepare you for it i could only tell you that i would never give you up and i can only repeat that now  you must bob she answered in a voice so low that it was almost a whisper you must give me up  i would not he said i would not if the words were written on all the rocks of coniston mountain i love you  hush she said gently i have to say some things to you they will be very hard to say but you must listen to them  i will listen he said doggedly but they will not affect my determination  i am sure you do not wish to drive me away from brampton she continued in the same low voice when i have found a place to earn my living nearnear uncle jethro  these words told him all he had suspectedalmost as much as though he had been present at the scene in the tannery shed in coniston she knew now the life of jethro bass but he was still uncle jethro to her it was even as bob had supposedthat her affection once given could not be taken away  cynthia he said i would not by an act or a word annoy or trouble you if you bade me i would go to the other side of the world tomorrow you must know that but i should come back again you must know that too i should come back again for you  bob she said again and her voice faltered a very little now you must know that i can never be your wife  i do not know it he exclaimed interrupting her vehemently i will not know it  think she said think i must say what i have to say however it hurts me if it had not been forfor your father those things never would have been written they were in his newspaper and they express his feelings towardtoward uncle jethro  once the words were out she marvelled that she had found the courage to pronounce them  yes he said yes i know that but listen  wait she went on wait until i have finished i am not speaking of the pain i had when i read these things ii am not speaking of the truth that may be in themi have learned from them what i should have known before and felt indeed that your father will never consent toto a marriage between us  and if he does not cried bob if he does not do you think that i will abide by what he says when my lifes happiness depends upon you and my lifes welfare i know that you are a good woman and a true woman that you will be the best wife any man could have though he is my father he shall not deprive me of my soul and he shall not take my life away from me  as cynthia listened she thought that never had words sounded sweeter than theseno and never would again so she told herself as she let them run into her heart to be stored among the treasures there she believed in his lovebelieved in it now with all her might who indeed would not she could not demean herself now by striving to belittle it or doubt its continuance as she had in boston he was young yes but he would never be any older than this could never love again like this so much was given her ought she not to be content could she expect more  she understood isaac worthington now as well as his son understood him she knew that if she were to yield to bob worthington his father would disown and disinherit him she looked ahead into the years as a woman will and allowed herself for the briefest of moments to wonder whether any happiness could thrive in spite of the violence of that schismany happiness for him she would be depriving him of his birthright and it may be that those who are born without birthrights often value them the most cynthia saw these things and more for those who sit at the feet of sorrow soon learn the worlds ways she saw herself pointed out as the woman whose designs had beggared and ruined him in his youth and agonizing and revolting thought the name of one would be spoken from whom she had learned such craft lest he see the scalding tears in her eyes she turned away and conquered them what could she do where should she hide her love that it might not be seen of men and how in truth could she tell him these things  cynthia he went on seeing that she did not answer and taking heart i will not say a word against my father i know you would not respect me if i did we are different he and i and find happiness in different ways bob wondered if his father had ever found it if i had never met you and loved you i should have refused to lead the life my father wishes me to lead it is not in me to do the things he will ask i shall have to carve out my own life and i feel that i am as well able to do it as he was percy broke a classmate of mine and my best friend has a position for me in a locomotive works in which his father is largely interested we are going in together the day after we graduate it is all arranged and his father has agreed i shall work very hard and in a few years cynthia we shall be together never to part again oh cynthia he cried carried away by the ecstasy of this dream which he had summoned up why do you resist me i love you as no man has ever loved he exclaimed with scornful egotism and contempt of those who had made the world echo with that cry through the centuries and you love me ah do you think i do not see itcannot feel it you love metell me so  he was coming toward her and how was she to prevent his taking her by storm that was his way and well she knew it in her dreams she had felt herself lifted and borne off breathless in his arms to elysium her breath was going now her strength was going and yet she made him pause by the magic of a word a concession was in that word but one could not struggle so piteously and concede nothing  bob she said do you love me  love her if there was a love that acknowledged no bounds that was confined by no superlatives it was his he began to speak but she interrupted him with a wild passion that was new to her as he sat in the train on his way back to cambridge through the darkening afternoon the note of it rang in his ears and gave him hopeyes and through many months afterward  if you love me i beg i implore i beseech you in the name of that lovefor your sake and my sake to leave me oh can you not see why you must go  he stopped even as he had before in the parlor in mount vernon street he could but stop in the face of such an appealand yet the blood beat in his head with a mad joy  tell me that you love meonce he criedonce cynthia  dodo not ask me she faltered go  her words were a supplication not a command and in that they were a supplication he had gained a victory yes though she had striven with all her might to deny she had bade him hope he left her without so much as a touch of the hand because she had wished it and yet she loved him incredible fact incredible conjury which made him doubt that his feet touched the snow of brampton street which blotted as with a golden glow the faces and the houses of brampton from his sight he saw no one though many might have accosted him that part of him which was clay which performed the menial tasks of his being had kindly taken upon itself to fetch his bag from the house to the station and to board the train  ah but brampton had seen him     chapter xiv  great events like young mr worthingtons visit to brampton are all very well for a while but they do not always develop with sufficient rapidity to satisfy the audiences of the drama seven days were an interlude quite long enough in which to discuss every phase and bearing of this opening scene and after that the play in all justice ought to move on but there it haltedfor a whileand the curtain obstinately refused to come up if the inhabitants of brampton had only known that the drama when it came would be well worth waiting for they might have been less restless  it is unnecessary to enrich the pages of this folio with all the footnotes and remarks of the sages of brampton these can be condensed into a paragraph of twoand we can ring up the curtain when we like on the next scene for which brampton had to wait considerably over a month there is to be no villain in this drama with the face of an abbe maury like the seven cardinal sins comfortable looking mr dodd of the prudential committee with his chintuft of yellow beard is cast for the part of the villain but will play it badly he would have been better suited to a comedy part  young mr worthington left brampton on the five oclock train and at six mr dodd met his fellowmember of the committee judge graves  called a meetin asked mr dodd pulling the yellow tuft  what for said the judge sharply  what be you agoin to do about it said mr dodd  do about what demanded the judge looking at the hardware dealer from under his eyebrows  mr dodd knew well enough that this was not ignorance on the part of mr graves whose position in the matter dad been very well defined in the two sentences he had spoken mr dodd perceived that the judge was trying to get him to commit himself and would then proceed to annihilate him he levi dodd had no intention of walking into such a trap  well said he with a final tug at the tuft if thats the way you feel about it  feel about what said the judge fiercely  callate you know best said mr dodd and passed on up the street but he felt the judges gimlet eyes boring holes in his back the judges position was very fine no doubt for the judge all of which tends to show that levi dodd had swept his mind and that it was ready now for the reception of an opinion  six weeks or more as has been said passed before the curtain rose again but the snarling trumpets of the orchestra played a fitting prelude cynthias feelings and cynthias life need not be gone into during this interval knowing her character they may well be imagined they were trying enough but brampton had no means of guessing them during the weeks she came and went between the little house and the little school putting all the strength that was in her into her duties the prudential committee which sometimes sat on the platform could find no fault with the performance of these duties or with the capability of the teacher and it is not going too far to state that the children grew to love her better than miss goddard had been loved it may be declared that children are the fittest citizens of a republic because they are apt to make up their own minds on any subject without regard to public opinion it was so with the scholars of brampton village lower school they grew to love the new teacher careless of what the attitude of their elders might be and some of them could have been seen almost any day walking home with her down the street  as for the attitude of the eldersthere was none before assuming one they had thought it best with characteristic caution to await the next act in the drama there were ladies in brampton whose hearts prompted them when they called on the new teacher to speak a kindly word of warning and advice but somehow when they were seated before her in the little sitting room of the john billings house their courage failed them there was something about this daughter of the coniston storekeeper and ward of jethro bass that made them pause so much for the ladies of brampton what they said among themselves would fill a chapter and more  there was at this time a singular fallingoff in the attendance of the brampton club ephraim sat alone most of the day in his windsor chair by the stove pretending to read newspapers but he did not mention this fact to cynthia he was more lonesome than ever on the saturdays and sundays which she spent with jethro bass  jethro bass it is he who might be made the theme of the music of the snarling trumpets what was he about during those six weeks that is what the state at large was beginning to wonder and the state at large was looking on at a drama too a rumor reached the capital and radiated thence to every city and town and hamlet and was followed by other rumors like confirmations jethro bass for the first time in a long life of activity was inactive inactive too at this most critical period of his career the climax of it with a war to be waged which for bitterness and ferocity would have no precedent with the town meetings at hand where the frontier fighting was to be done and no quarter given lieutenants had gone to coniston for further orders and instructions and had come back without either achilles was sulking in the tannery housesome said a broken achilles not a word could be got out of him or the sign of an intention jake wheeler moped through the days in rias richardsons store too sore at heart to speak to any man and could have wept if tears had been a relief to him no more blithe errands over the mountain to clovelly and elsewhere though jake knew the issue now and itched for the battle and the vassals of the hillrajah under a jubilant bijah bixby were arming capapie lieutenantgeneralandsenator peleg hartington of brampton in his office over the livery stable shook his head like a mournful stork when questioned by brother officers from afar operations were at a standstill and the sinews of war relaxed rural givers of mortgages who had not had the opportunity of selling them or had feared to do so began mirabile dictu to express opinions most ominous sign of allthe proprietor of the pelican hotel had confessed that the throne room had not been engaged for the coming session  was it possible that jethro bass lay crushed under the weight of the accusations which had been printed and were still being printed in the newcastle guardian he did not answer them or retaliate in other newspapers but jethro bass had never made use of newspapers in this way still nothing ever printed about him could be compared with those articles had remorse suddenly overtaken him in his old age such were the questions people were asking all over the statepeople at least who were interested in politics or in those operations which went by the name of politics yes and many private citizenswho had participated in politics only to the extent of voting for such candidates as jethro in his wisdom had seen fit to give them read the articles and began to say that boss domination was at an end a new era was at hand which they fondly and very properly believed was to be a golden era it was indeed to be a golden erauntil things got working and then the gold would cease the newcastle guardian with unconscious irony proclaimed the golden era and declared that its columns even in other days and under other ownership had upheld the wisdom of jethro bass and he was still a wise man said the guardian for he had had sense enough to give up the fight  had he given up the fight cynthia fervently hoped and prayed that he had but she hoped and prayed in silence well she knew if the event in the tannery shed had not made him abandon his affairs no appeal could do so her happiest days in this period were the saturdays and sundays spent with him in coniston and as the weeks went by she began to believe that the change miraculous as it seemed had indeed taken place he had given up his power it was a pleasure that made the weeks bearable for her what did it matterwhether he had made the sacrifice for the sake of his love for her he had made it  on these saturdays and sundays they went on long drives together over the hills while she talked to him of her life in brampton or the books she was reading and of those she had chosen for him to read sometimes they did not turn homeward until the delicate tracery of the branches on the snow warned them of the rising moon jethro was often silent for hours at a time but it seemed to cynthia that it was the silence of peaceof a peace he had never known before there came no newspapers to the tannery house now during the midweek he read the books of which she had spoken william wetherells books or sat in thought counting perhaps the days until she should come again and the boy of those days for him was more pathetic than much that is known to the world as sorrow  and what did coniston think coniston indeed knew not what to think when little by little the great men ceased to drive up to the door of the tannery house and presently came no more coniston sank then from its proud position as the real capital of the state to a lonely hamlet among the hills coniston too was watching the drama and had had a better view of the stage than brampton and saw some reason presently for the change in jethro bass not that mr satterlee told but such evidence was bound in the end to speak for itself the newcastle guardian had been read and debated at the storedebated with some heat by chester perkins and other mortgagors discussed nevertheless in a political rather than a moral light then cynthia had returned home her face had awed them by its sorrow and she had begun to earn her own living then the politicians had ceased to come the credit belongs to rias richardson for hawing been the first to piece these three facts together causing him to burn his hand so severely on the stove that he had to carry it bandaged in soda for a week cynthia wetherell had reformed jethro  though the village loved and revered cynthia coniston as a whole did not rejoice in that reform the town had fallen from its mighty estate and there were certain envious ones who whispered that it had remained for a young girl who had learned city ways to twist jethro around her finger that she had made him abandon his fight with isaac d worthington because mr worthington had a sonbut there is no use writing such scandal stripped of his powereven though he stripped himselfjethro began to lose their respect a trait tending to prove that the human race may have had wolves for ancestors as well as apes people had small opportunity however of showing a lack of respect to his person for in these days he noticed no one and spoke to none  when the lion is crippled the jackals begin to range a jackal reconnoitered the lair to see how badly the lion was crippled and conceived with astounding insolence the plan of capturing the lions quarry this jackal who was an old one well knew how to round up a quarry and fled back over the hills to consult with a bigger jackal his master as a result two days before march townmeeting day mr bijah bixby paid a visit to the harwich bank and went among certain coniston farmers looking over the sheep his clothes bulging out in places when he began and seemingly normal enough when he had finished history repeats itself even among lions and jackals thirtysix years before there had been a townmeeting in coniston and a surprise established church decent and orderly selectmen and proceedings had been toppled over that day every outlying farm sending its representative through the sleet to do it and now retribution was at hand this marchmeeting day was mild the grass showing a green color on the south slopes where the snow had melted and the outlying farmers drove through mudholes up to the axles drove albeit in procession along the roads grimly enough and the sheds jock hallowell had built around the meetinghouse could not hold the horses they lined the fences and usurped the hitching posts of the village street and still they came their owners trooped with muddy boots into the meetinghouse and when the moderator rapped for order the chairman of the board of selectmen jethro bass was not in his place never indeed would be there again six and thirty years he had been supreme in that townlong enough for any man the beams and king posts would know him no more mr amos cuthbert was elected chairman not without a gallant and desperate but unsupported fight of a minority led by mr jake wheeler whose loyalty must be taken as a tribute to his species farmer cuthbert was elected and his mortgage was not foreclosed had it been there was more money in the harwich bank  there was no telegraph to coniston in these days and so mr sam price with his horse in a lather might have been seen driving with unseemly haste toward brampton where in due time he arrived half an hour later there was excitement at newcastle sixtyfive miles away in the office of the guardian and the next morning the excitement had spread over the whole state  jethro bass was dethroned in conistondiscredited in his own town  and where was jethro did his heart ache did he bow his head as he thought of that supremacy so hardly won so superbly held gone forever many were the curious eyes on the tannery house that day and for days after but its owner gave no signs of concern he read and thought and chopped wood in the tannery shed as usual never i believe did man shorn of power accept his lot more quietly his struggle was over his battle was fought a greater peace than he had ever thought to hope for was won for the opinion and regard of the world he had never cared a greater reward awaited him greater than any knewthe opinion and regard and the praise of one whom he loved beyond all the world on friday she came to him on friday at sunset for the days were growing longer and that was the happiest sunset of his life she said nothing as she raised her face to his and kissed him and clung to him in the little parlor but he knew and he had his reward so much for earthly power cynthia brought the little rawhide trunk this time and came to coniston for the march vacationa happy two weeks that was soon gone happy by comparison that is with what they both had suffered and a haven of rest after the struggle and despair of the wilderness the bond between them had in truth never been stronger for both the young girl and the old man had denied themselves the thing they held most dear jethro had taken refuge and found comfort in his love but cynthia her greatest love had now been bestowed elsewhere  if there were letters for the tannery house milly skinner who made it a point to meet the stage brought them and there were letters during cynthias sojournmany of them bearing the cambridge postmark one evening it was jethro who laid the letter on the table beside her as she sat under the lamp he did not look at her or speak but she felt that he knew her secretfelt that he deserved to have from her own lips what he had been too proudyesand too humble to ask whose sympathy could she be sure of if not of his still she had longed to keep this treasure to herself she took the letter in her hand  i do not answer them uncle jethro buti cannot prevent his writing them she faltered she did not confess that she kept them every one and read them over and over again that she had grown indeed to look forward to them as to a sustenance ii do love him but i will not marry him  yes she could be sure of jethros sympathy though he could not express it in words yet she had not told him for this she had told him much as the telling had hurt her because she feared to cut him more deeply by her silence  it was a terrible moment for jethro and never had he desired the gift of speech as now had it not been for him cynthia might have been robert worthingtons wife he sat down beside her and put his hand over hers that lay on the letter in her lap it was the only answer he could make but perhaps it was the best after all of what use were words at such a time  four days afterward on a monday morning she went back to brampton to begin the new term  that same monday a circumstance of no small importance took place in bramptonnothing less than the return after a prolonged absence in the west and elsewhere of its first citizen isaac d worthington was again in residence no bells were rung indeed and no delegation of citizens as such headed by the selectmen met him at the station and other feudal expressions of fealty were lacking no staff flew mr worthingtons arms nevertheless the lord of brampton was in his castle again and brampton felt that he was there he arrived alone wearing the silk hat which had become habitual with him now and stepping into his barouche at the station had been driven up brampton street behind his grays looking neither to the right nor left his reddish chop whiskers seemed to cling a little more closely to his face than formerly and long years of compression made his mouth look sterner than ever a hawklike man isaac worthington to be reckoned with and feared whether in a frock coat or in breastplate and mail  his seneschal mr flint was awaiting him in the library mr flint was large and very ugly bigboned smoothshaven with coarse features all askew and a large nose with many excrescences and thick lips he was fortytwo from a foreman of the mills he had risen step by step to his present position which no one seemed able to define he was indeed a seneschal he managed the mills in his lords absence andif the truth be toldin his presence knotty questions of the truro railroad were brought to mr flint and submitted to mr worthington who decided them with mr flints advice and within the last three months mr flint had invaded the realm of politics quietly as such a man would under the cover of his patrons name and glory mr flint it was who had bought the newcastle guardian who went occasionally to newcastle and spoke a few effective words now and then to the editor and if the truth will out mr flint had largely conceived that scheme about the railroads which was to set mr worthington on the throne of the state although the scheme was not now being carried out according to mr flints wishes mr flint was in a sense a bismarck but he was not as yet all powerful sometimes his august master or one of his fellow petty sovereigns would sweep mr flints plans into the waste basket and then mr flint would be content to wait to complete the character sketch mr flint was not above hanging up his masters hat and coat which he did upon the present occasion and went up to mr worthingtons bedroom to fetch a pocket handkerchief out of the second drawer he even knew where the handkerchiefs were kept lucky petty sovereigns sometimes possess mr flints to make them emperors  the august personage seated himself briskly at his desk  so that scoundrel bass is actually discredited at last he said blowing his nose in the pocket handkerchief mr flint had brought him i lose patience when i think how long weve stood the rascal in this state i knew the people would rise in their indignation when they learned the truth about him  mr flint did not answer this he might have had other views  i wonder we did not think of it before mr worthington continued a very simple remedy and only requiring a little courage andand mr worthington was going to say money but thought better of it and the chimera disappears i congratulate you flint  congratulate yourself said mr flint that would not have been my way  very well i congratulate myself said the august personage who was in too good a humor to be put out by the rejection of a compliment you remember what i said the time was ripe just publish a few biographical articles telling people what he was and jethro bass would snuff out like a candle mr duncan tells me the townmeeting results are very good all over the state even if we hadnt knocked out jethro bass wed have a fair majority for our bill in the next legislature  you know basss saying answered mr flint you can hitch that kind of a hoss but they wont always stay hitched  i know i know said mr worthington dont croak flint we can buy more hitch ropes if necessary well whats the outlay up to the present large i suppose well whatever it is its small compared to what well get for it he laughed a little and rubbed his hands and then he remembered that capacity in which he stood before the world yes and he stood before himself in the same capacity isaac worthington may have deceived himself but he may or may not have been a hero to his seneschal we have to fight fire with fire he added in a pained voice let me see the account  i have tabulated the expense in the different cities and towns answered mr flint i will show you the account in a little while the expenses in coniston were somewhat greater than the size of the town justified perhaps but sutton thought  yes yes interrupted mr worthington if it had cost as much to carry coniston as newcastle it would have been worth itfor the moral effect alone  moral effect mr flint thought of mr bixby with his bulging pockets going about the hills and smiled at the manner in which moral effects are sometimes obtained  any news flint  no news yet mr flint might have answered in a few minutes there might be news and plenty of it for it lay ready to be hatched under mr worthingtons eye a letter in the bold and upright hand of his son was on the top of the pile placed there by mr flint himself who had examined mr worthingtons face closely when he came in to see how much he might know of its contents he had decided that mr worthington was in too good a humor to know anything of them mr flint had not steamed the letter open and read the news but he could guess at them pretty shrewdly and so could have the biggest fool in brampton that letter contained the opening scene of the next act in the drama  mr worthington cut the envelope and began to read and while he did so mr flint who was not afraid of man or beast looked at him it was a manly and straight forward letter and mr worthington no matter what his opinions on the subject were should have been proud of it bob announced first of all that he was going to marry cynthia wetherell then he proceeded with praiseworthy selfcontrol for a lover to describe cynthias character and attainments after which he stated that cynthia had refused himtwice because she believed that mr worthington would oppose the marriage and had declared that she would never be the cause of a breach between father and son bob asked for his fathers consent and hoped to have it but he thought it only right to add that he had given his word and his love and did not mean to retract either he spoke of his visit to brampton and explained that cynthia was teaching school there and urged his father to see her before he made a decision mr worthington read it through to the end his lips closing tighter and tighter until his mouth was but a line across his face there was pain in the face too the kind of pain which anger sends and which comes with the tottering of a pride that is false of what gratification now was the overthrow of jethro bass  he stared at the letter for a moment after he had finished it and his face grew a dark red then he seized the paper and tore it slowly deliberately into bits  dudley worthington was not thinking thennot heof the young man in the white beaver who had called at the social library many years before to see a young woman whose name too had been cynthiahe was thinking in fact for he was a man to think in anger whether it were not possible to remove this cynthia from the face of the earthat least to a place beyond his horizon and that of his son had he worn the chain mail instead of the frock coat he would have had her hung outside the town walls  good god he exclaimed and the words sounded profane indeed as he fixed his eyes upon mr flint you knew that robert had been to brampton  yes said flint the whole village knew it  good god cried mr worthington again why was i not informed of this why was i not warned of this have i no friends do you pretend to look after my interests and not take the trouble to write me on such a subject  do you think i could have prevented it asked mr flint very calmly  you allow thisthis woman to come here to brampton and teach school in a place where she can further her designs what were you about  when the prudential committee appointed her nothing of this was known mr worthington  yes but nownow what are you doing what are they doing to allow her to remain who are on that committee  mr flint named the men they had been reelected as usual at the recent townmeeting mr errol who had also been reelected had returned but had not yet issued the certificate or conducted the examination  send for them have them here at once commanded mr worthington without listening to this  if you take my advice you will do nothing of the kind said mr flint who as usual had the whole situation at his fingers ends he had taken the trouble to inform himself about the girl and he had discovered shrewdly enough that she was the kind which might be led but not driven if mr flints advice had been listened to this story might have had quite a different ending but mr flint had not reached the stage where his advice was always listened to and he had a maddened man to deal with now at that moment as if fate had determined to intervene the housemaid came into the room  mr dodd to see you sir she said  show him in shouted mr worthington show him in  mr dodd was not a man who could wait for a summons which he had felt in his bones was coming he was ordinarily as we have seen officious but now he was thoroughly frightened he had seen the great man in the barouche as he drove past the hardware store and he had made up his mind to go up at once and have it over with his opinions were formed now he put a smile on his face when he was a foot outside of the library door  this is a great pleasure mr worthington a great pleasure to see you back he said coming forward i callated  but the great man sat in his chair and made no attempt to return the greeting  mr dodd i thought you were my friend he said  mr dodd went all to pieces at this reception  so i be mr worthingtonso i be he cried thats why im here now ive ben a friend of yours ever since i can remembernever fluctuated id rather have chopped my hand off than had this happenso i would if i could have foreseen what she was shed never have had the place as sure as my names levi dodd  if mr dodd had taken the trouble to look at the seneschals face he would have seen a welldefined sneer there  and now that you know what she is cried mr worthington rising and smiting the pile of letters on his desk why do you keep her there an instant  mr dodd stopped to pick up the letters which had flown over the floor but the great man was now in the full tide of his anger  never mind the letters he shouted tell me why you keep her there  we callated wed wait and see what steps youd like taken said the trembling townsman  steps steps good god what kind of man are you to serve in such a place when you allow the professed ward of jethro bassof jethro bass the most notoriously depraved man in this state to teach the children of this town steps how soon can you call your committee together  right away answered mr dodd breathlessly he would have gone on to exculpate himself but mr worthingtons inexorable finger was pointing at the door  if you are a friend of mine said that gentleman and if you have any regard for the fair name of this town you will do so at once  mr dodd departed precipitately and mr worthington began to pace the room clasping his hands now in front of him now behind him in his agony repeating now and again various appellations which need not be printed here which he applied in turn to the prudential committee to his son and to cynthia wetherell  ill run her out of brampton he said at last  if you do said mr flint who had been watching him apparently unmoved you may have jethro bass on your back  jethro bass shouted mr worthington with a laugh that was not pleasant to hear jethro bass is as dead as julius caesar  it was one thing for mr dodd to promise so readily a meeting of the committee and quite another to decide how he was going to get through the affair without any more burns and scratches than were absolutely necessary he had reversed the usual order and had been in the firenow he was going to the fryingpan he stood in the street for some time pulling at his tuft and then made his way to mr jonathan hills feed store mr hill was reading sartor resartus in his little office the temperature of which must have been 95 and mr dodd was perspiring when he got there  its come said mr dodd sententiously  whats come inquired mr hill mildly  isaac ds come thats what said mr dodd i haint ben sleepin well of nights lately i cant think what we was about jonathan puttin that girl in the school wed ought tove knowed she wahnt fit  whats the matter with her inquired mr hill  matter with her exclaimed his fellowcommitteeman she lives with jethro bassshes his ward  well what of it said mr hill who never bothered himself about gossip or newspapers or indeed about anything not between the covers of a book except when he couldnt help it  good god exclaimed mr dodd hes the most notorious depraved man in the state haint we got to look out for the fair name of brampton  mr hill sighed and closed his book  well he said id hoped we were through with that lets go up and see what judge graves says about it  hold on said mr dodd seizing the feed dealer by the coat weve got to get it fixed in our minds what were goin to do first we cant allow no notorious people in our schools weve got to stand up to the jedge and tell him so we appinted her on his recommendation you know  i like the girl replied mr hill i dont think we ever had a better teacher shes quiet and nice appearin and attends to her business  mr dodd pulled his tuft and cocked his head  mr worthington holds a note of yours dont he jonathan  mr hill reflected he said he thought perhaps mr worthington did  well said mr dodd i guess we might as well go along up to the jedge now as any time  but when they got there mr dodds knock was so timid that he had to repeat it before the judge came to the door and peered at them over his spectacles  well gentlemen what can i do for you he asked severely though he knew well enough he had not been taken by surprise many times during the last forty years mr dodd explained that they wished a little meeting of the committee the judge ushered them into his bedroom the parlor being too good for such an occasion  now gentlemen said he let us get down to business mr worthington arrived here today he has seen mr dodd and mr dodd has seen mr hill mr worthington is a political opponent of jethro bass and wishes miss wetherell dismissed mr dodd and mr hill have agreed for various reasons which i will spare you that miss wetherell should be dismissed have i stated the case gentlemen or have i not  mr graves took off his spectacles and wiped them looking from one to the other of his very uncomfortable fellowmembers mr hill did not attempt to speak but mr dodd who was not sure now that this was not the fire and the other the fryingpan pulled at his tuft until words came to him  jedge he said finally i must say im a mite surprised i must say your language is unwarranted  the truth is never unwarranted said the judge  for the sake of the fair name of brampton began mr dodd we cannot allow  mr dodd interrupted the judge i would rather have mr worthingtons arguments from mr worthington himself if i wanted them at all there is no need of prolonging this meeting if i were to waste my breath until six oclock it would be no use i was about to say that your opinions were formed but i will alter that and say that your minds are fixed you are determined to dismiss miss wetherell is it not so  i wish youd hear me jedge said mr dodd desperately  will you kindly answer me yes or no to that question said the judge my time is valuable  well if you put it that way i guess we are agreed that she hadnt ought to stay not that ive anything against her personally  all right said the judge with a calmness that made them tremble they had never bearded him before all right you are two to one and no certificate has been issued but i tell you this gentlemen that you will live to see the day when you will bitterly regret this injustice to an innocent and a noble woman and isaac d worthington will live to regret it you may tell him i said so good day gentlemen  they rose  jedge began mr dodd again i dont think youve been quite fair with us  fair repeated the judge with unutterable scorn good day gentlemen and he slammed the door behind them  they walked down the street some distance before either of them spoke  goliah said mr dodd at last did you ever hear such talk hes got the drattedest temper of any man i ever knew and he never callates to make a mistake its a little mite hard to do your duty when a man talks that way  im not sure weve done it answered mr hill  not sure ejaculated the hardware dealer for he was now far enough away from the judges house to speak in his normal tone and she connected with that depraved  hold on said mr hill with an astonishing amount of spirit for him ive heard that before  mr dodd looked at him swallowed the wrong way and began to choke  you haint wavered jonathan he said when he got his breath  no i havent said mr hill sadly but i wish to hell i had  mr dodd looked at him again and began to choke again it was the first time he had known jonathan hill to swear  youre agoin to stick by what you agreedby your principles  im going to stick by my bread and butter said mr hill not by my principles i wish to hell i wasnt  and so saying that gentleman departed cutting diagonally across the street through the snow leaving mr dodd still choking and pulling at his tuft this third and totallyunexpected shakingup had caused him to feel somewhat deranged internally though it had not altered the opinions now so firmly planted in his head after a few moments however he had collected himself sufficiently to move on once more when he discovered that he was repeating to himself quite unconsciously mr hills profanity i wish to hell i wasnt the iron mastiffs glaring at him angrily out of the snow banks reminded him that he was in front of mr worthingtons door and he thought he might as well go in at once and receive the great mans gratitude he certainly deserved it but as he put his hand on the bell mr worthington himself came out of the house and would actually have gone by without noticing mr dodd if he had not spoken  ive got that little matter fixed mr worthington he said called the committee and we voted to discharge thethe young woman no he did not deliver judge gravess message  very well mr dodd answered the great man passing on so that mr dodd was obliged to follow him in order to hear im glad youve come to your senses at last kindly step into the library and tell miss bruce from me that she may fill the place tomorrow  certain said mr dodd with his hand to his chin he watched the great man turn in at his bank in the new block and then he did as he was bid  by the time school was out that day the news had leaped across brampton street and spread up and down both sides of it that the new teacher had been dismissed the story ran fairly straightthere were enough clews certainly the great mans return the visit of mr dodd the call on judge graves all had been marked the fiat of the first citizen had gone forth that the ward of jethro bass must be got rid of the designing young woman who had sought to entrap his son must be punished for her amazing effrontery  cynthia came out of school happily unaware that her name was on the lips of brampton unaware too that the lord of the place had come into residence that day she had looked forward to living in the same town with bobs father as an evil which was necessary to be borne as one of the things which are more or less inevitable in the lives of those who have to make their own ways in the world the children trooped around her and the little girls held her hand and she talked and laughed with them as she came up the street in the eyes of bramptoncame up the street to the block of new buildings where the bank was stepping out of the bank with that businesslike alertness which characterized him was the first citizennone other he found himself entangled among the romping children andhorror of horrors he bumped into the schoolmistress herself worse than this he had taken off his hat and begged her pardon before he looked at her and realized the enormity of his mistake and the schoolmistress had actually paid no attention to him but with merely heightened color had drawn the children out of his way and passed on without a word the first citizen raging inwardly but trying to appear unconcerned walked rapidly back to his house on the street of his own town before the eyes of men he had been snubbed by a schoolteacher and such a schoolteacher  mr worthington as he paced his library burning with the shame of this occurrence remembered that he had had to glance at her twice before it came over him who she was his first sensation had been astonishment and now in spite of his bitter anger he had to acknowledge that the face had made an impression on hima fact that only served to increase his rage a conviction grew upon him that it was a face which his son or any other man would not be likely to forget he himself could not forget it  in the meantime cynthia had reached her home her cheeks still smarting conscious that people had stared at her this much of course she knewthat brampton believed bob worthington to be in love with her and the knowledge at such times made her so miserable that the thought of jethros isolation alone deterred her from asking miss lucretia penniman for a position in boston for she wrote to miss lucretia about her life and her reading as that lady had made her promise to do she sat down now at the cherry chest of drawers that was also a desk to write not to pour out her troubles for she never had done thatbut to calm her mind by drawing little character sketches of her pupils but she had only written the words my dear miss lucretia when she looked out of the window and saw judge graves coming up the path and ran to open the door for him  how do you do judge she said for she recognized mr graves as one of her few friends in brampton i have sent to boston for the new reader but it has not come  the judge took her hand and pressed it and led her into the little sitting room his face was very stern but his eyes which had flung fire at mr dodd looked at her with a vast compassion her heart misgave her  my dear he saidit was long since the judge had called any woman my deari have bad news for you the committee have decided that you cannot teach any longer in the brampton school  oh judge she answered trying to force back the tears which would come i have tried so hard i had begun to believe that i could fill the place  fill the place cried the judge startling her with his sudden anger no woman in the state can fill it better than you  then why am i dismissed she asked breathlessly  the judge looked at her in silence his blue lips quivering sometimes even he found it hard to tell the truth and yet he had come to tell it that she might suffer less he remembered the time when isaac d worthington had done him a great wrong  you are dismissed he said because mr worthington has come home and because the two other members of the committee are dogs and cowards mr graves never minced matters when he began and his voice shook with passion if mr errol had examined you and you had your certificate it might have been different errol is not a sycophant worthington does not hold his mortgage  mortgage exclaimed cynthia the word always struck terror to her soul  mr worthington holds mr hills mortgage said mr graves more than ever beside himself at the sight of her suffering that mans tyranny is not to be borne we will not give up cynthia i will fight him in this matter if it takes my last ounce of strength so help me god  mortgage cynthia sank down in the chair by the desk in spite of the misery the news had brought the thought that his father too who was fighting jethro bass as a righteous man dealt in mortgages and coerced men to do his will was overwhelming so she sat for a while staring at the landscape on the old wall paper  i will go to coniston tonight she said at last  no cried the judge seizing her shoulder in his excitement no do you think that i have been your friendthat i am your friend  oh judge graves  then stay here where you are i ask it as a favor to me you need not go to the school tomorrowindeed you cannot but stay here for a day or two at least and if there is any justice left in a free country we shall have it will you stay as a favor to me  i will stay since you ask it said cynthia i will do what you think right  her voice was firmer than he expectedmuch firmer he glanced at her quickly with something very like admiration in his eye  you are a good woman and a brave woman he said and with this somewhat surprising tribute he took his departure instantly  cynthia was left to her thoughts and these were harassing and sorrowful enough one idea however persisted through them all mr worthington whose power she had lived long enough in brampton to know was an unjust man and a hypocrite that thought was both sweet and bitter sweet as a retribution and bitter because he was bobs father she realized now that bob knew these things and she respected and loved him the more if that were possible because he had refrained from speaking of them to her and now another thought came and though she put it resolutely from her persisted was she not justified now in marrying him the reasoning was false so she told herself she had no right to separate bob from his father whatever his father might be did not she still love jethro bass yes but he had renounced his ways her heart swelled gratefully as she spoke the words to herself and she reflected that he at least had never been a hypocrite  of one thing she was sure now in the matter of the school she had right on her side and she must allow judge graves to do whatever he thought proper to maintain that right if isaac d worthingtons character had been different this would not have been her decision now she would not leave brampton in disgrace when she had done nothing to merit it not that she believed that the judge would prevail against such mighty odds so little did she think so that she fell presently into a despondency which in all her troubles had not overtaken herthe despondency which comes even to the pure and the strong when they feel the unjust strength of the world against them in this state her eyes fell on the letter she had started to miss lucretia penniman and in desperation she began to write  it was a short letter reserved enough and quite in character it was right that she should defend herself which she did with dignity saying that she believed the committee had no fault to find with her duties but that mr worthington had seen fit to bring influence to bear upon them because of her connection with jethro bass  it was not the whole truth but cynthia could not bring herself to write of that other reason at the end she asked very simply if miss lucretia could find her something to do in boston in case her dismissal became certain then she put on her coat and walked to the postoffice to post the letter for she resolved that there could be no shame without reason for it there was a little more color in her cheeks and she held her head high preparing to be slighted but she was not slighted and got more salutations if anything than usual she was indeed in the right not to hide her head and policy alone would have forbade it had cynthia thought of policy     chapter xv  public opinion is like the windit bloweth where it listeth it whistled around brampton the next day whirling husbands and wives apart and families into smithereens brampton had a storm all to itselfsave for a sympathetic storm raging in conistonand all about a schoolteacher  had cynthia been a certain type of woman she would have had all the men on her side and all of her own sex against her it is a decided point to be recorded in her favor that she had among her sympathizers as many women as men but the excitement of a day long remembered in brampton began for her when a score or more of children assembled in front of the little house tramping down the snow on the grass plots shouting for her to come to school with them children give no mortgages or keep no hardware stores  cynthia trying to read in front of the fire was all in a tremble at the sound of the highpitched little voices she had grown to love and she longed to go out and kiss them every one her nature however shrank from any act which might appear dramatic or sensational she could not resist going to the window and smiling at them though they appeared but dimlylittle dancing figures in a mist and when they shouted the more she shook her head and put her finger to her lips in reproof and vanished from their sight then they trooped sadly on to school resolved to make matters as disagreeable as possible for poor miss bruce who had not offended in any way  two other episodes worthy of a place in this act of the drama occurred that morning and one had to do with ephraim poor ephraim his way had ever been to fight and ask no questions and in his journey through the world he had gathered but little knowledge of it he had limped home the night before in a state of anger of which cynthia had not believed him capable and had reappeared in the sitting room in his best suit of blue  where are you going cousin eph cynthia had asked suspiciously  never you mind cynthy  but i do mind she said catching hold of his sleeve i wont let you go until you confess  im agoin to tell isaac worthington what i think of him thats whar im agoin cried ephraim what i always hev thought of him sence he sent a substitute to the war an acted treasonable here to home talkin agin lincoln  oh cousin eph you mustnt said cynthia clinging to him with all her strength in her dismay it had taken every whit of her influence to persuade him to relinquish his purpose cynthia knew very well that ephraim meant to lay hands on mr worthington and it would indeed have been a disastrous hour for the first citizen if the old soldier had ever got into his library cynthia pointed out as best she might that it would be an evil hour for her too and that her cause would be greatly injured by such a proceeding she knew very well that it would ruin ephraim but he would not have listened to such an argument  the next thing he wished to do was to go to coniston and rouse jethro cynthias heart stood still when he proposed this for it touched upon her greatest fearwhich had impelled her to go to coniston but she had hoped and believed that jethro knowing her feelings would do nothingsince for her sake he had chosen to give up his power now an acute attack of rheumatism had come to her rescue and she succeeded in getting ephraim off to bed swathed in bandages  the next morning he had insisted upon hobbling away to the postoffice where in due time he was discovered by certain members of the brampton club nailing to the wall a new engraving of abraham lincoln and draping it with a little silk flag he had bought in boston by which it will be seen that a potion of the club were coming back to their old haunt this portion it may be surmised was composed of such persons alone as were likely to be welcomed by the postmaster some of these had grievances against mr worthington or mr flint others in more prosperous circumstances might have been moved by envy of these gentlemen still others might have been actuated largely by righteous resentment at what they deemed oppression by wealth and power these members who came that morning comprised about onefourth of those who formerly had been in the habit of dropping in for a chat and their numbers were a fair indication of the fact that those who from various motives took the part of the schoolteacher in brampton were as one to three  it is not necessary to repeat their expressions of indignation and sympathy there was a certain mr gamaliel ives in the town belonging to an old brampton family who would have been the first citizen if that other first citizen had not by his rise to wealth and power so completely overshadowed him mr ives owned a small mill on coniston water below the town he fairly bubbled over with civic pride and he was an authority on all matters pertaining to bramptons history he knew the hymn to coniston by heart but we are digressing a little mr ives like that other gamaliel of old had exhorted his fellowtownsmen to wash their hands of the controversy but he was an intimate of judge graves and after talking with that gentleman he became a partisan overnight and when he had stopped to get his mail he had been lured behind the window by the debate in progress he was in the midst of some impromptu remarks when he recognized a certain brisk step behind him and isaac d worthington himself entered the sanctum  it must be explained that mr worthington sometimes had an important letter to be registered which he carried to the postoffice with his own hands on such occasionsthough not a member of the brampton clubhe walked as an overlord will into any private place he chose and recognized no partitions or barriers now he handed the letter addressed to a certain person in cambridge massachusetts to the postmaster  you will kindly register that and give me a receipt mr prescott he said  ephraim turned from his contemplation of the features of the martyred president and on his face was something of the look it might have worn when he confronted his enemies over the logworks at five forks no for there was a vast contempt in his gaze now and he had had no contempt for the southerners and would have shaken hands with any of them the moment the battle was over mr worthington in spite of himself recoiled a little before that look fearing perhaps physical violence  i haint agoin to hurt you mr worthington ephraim said but i am agoin to ask you to git out in front and mighty quick if you hev any business with the postmaster theres the window and ephraim pointed to it with his twisted finger i dont allow nobody but my friends here mr worthington and people i respect  mr worthington lookedwell eyewitnesses give various versions as to how he looked all agree that his lip trembled some say his eyes watered at any rate he quailed stood a moment undecided and then swung on his heel and walked to the partition door at this safe distance he turned  mr prescott he said his voice quivering with passion and perhaps another emotion i will make it my duty to report to the postmastergeneral the manner in which this office is run instead of attending to your business you make the place a resort for loafers and idlers good morning sir  ten minutes later mr flint himself came to register the letter but it was done at the window and the loafers and idlers were still there  the curtain had risen again indeed and the action was soon fast enough for the most impatient that day no sooner had the town heard with bated breath of the expulsion of the first citizen from the inner sanctuary of the postoffice than the news of another event began to go the rounds mr worthington had other and more important things to think about than minor postmasters and after his anger andyes and momentary fear had subsided he forgot the incident except to make a mental note to remember to deprive mr prescott of his postmastership which he believed could be done readily enough now that jethro bass was out of the way then he had stepped into the bank which he had come to regard as his own bank as he regarded most institutions in brampton he had in the old days been president of it as we know he stepped into the bank and thenhe stepped out again  most people have experienced that sickly feeling of the diaphragm which sometimes comes from a sadden shock mr worthington had it now as he hurried up the street and he presently discovered that he was walking in the direction opposite to that of his own home he crossed the street made a pretence of going into mr goldthwaites drug store and hurried back again when he reached his own library he found mr flint busy there at his desk mr flint rose mr worthington sat down and began to pull the papers about in a manner which betrayed to his seneschal who knew every mood of his master mental perturbation  flint he said at last striving his best for an indifferent accent jethro bass is herei ran across him just now drawing money in the bank  i could have told you that this morning answered mr flint wheeler who runs errands for him in coniston drove him in this morning and hes been with peleg hartington for two hours over shermans livery stable  an interval of silence followed during which mr worthington shuffled with his letters and pretended to read them  graves has called a mass meeting tonight i understand he remarked in the same casual way the mans a demagogue and mad as a loon i believe he sent back one of our passes once didnt he i suppose bass has come in to get hartington to work up the meeting theyll be laughed out of the town hall or hissed out  i guess youll find bass has come down for something else said mr flint looking up from a division report  what do you mean demanded mr worthington changing his attitude to one of fierceness but he was well aware that whatever tone he took with his seneschal he never fooled him  i mean what i told you yesterday said flint that youve stirred up the dragon  even mr flint did not know how like a knell his words sounded in isaac worthingtons ears  nonsense he cried youre talking nonsense flint we maimed him too thoroughly for that he hasnt power enough left to carry his own town  all right said the seneschal  what do you mean by that said his master with extreme irritation  i mean what i said yesterday that we havent maimed him at all he had his own reasons for going into his hole and he never would have come out again if you hadnt goaded him now hes out and well have to step around pretty lively i can tell you or hell maim us  all of which goes to show that mr flint had some notion of men and affairs he became as may be predicted the head of many material things in later days and he may sometime reappear in company with other characters in this story  the sickly feeling in mr worthingtons diaphragm had now returned  i think you will find you are mistaken flint he said attempting dignity now very much mistaken  very well said flint perhaps i am but i believe youll find he left for the capital on the eleven oclock and if you take the trouble to inquire from bedding you will probably learn that the throne room is bespoken for the session  all of that which mr flint had predicted turned out to be true the dragon had indeed waked up it all began with the news milly skinner had got from the stage driver imparted to jethro as he sat reading about hiawatha and terrible indeed had been that awakening this dragon did not bellow and roar and lash his tail when he was roused but he stood up and there seemed to emanate from him a fire which frightened poor milly skinner upset though she was by the news of cynthias dismissal o wondrous and paradoxical might of love which can tame the most powerful of beasts and stir them again into furies by a touch  coniston was the first to tremble as though the forces stretching themselves in the tannery house were shaking the very ground and the name of jethro bass took on once more as by magic a terrible meaning when vesuvius is silent pygmies may make faces on the very lip of the crater and they on the slopes forget the black terror of the fiery hail jake wheeler himself loyal as he was did not care to look into the crater now that he was summoned but a force pulled him all the way to the tannery house he left behind him an awestricken gathering at the store composed of inhabitants who had recently spoken slightingly of the volcano  we are getting a little mixed in our metaphors between lions and dragons and volcanoes and yet none of them are too strong to represent jethro bass when he heard that isaac worthington had had the teacher dismissed from brampton lower school he did not stop to reason then that action might distress her the beast in him awoke again the desire for vengeance on a man whom he had hated most of his life and who now had dared to cause pain to the woman whom he loved with all his soul and even idolize was too great to resist he had no thought of resisting it for the waters of it swept over his soul like the atlantic over a lost continent he would crush isaac worthington if it took the last breath from his body  jake went to the tannery house and received his ordersorders of which he made a great mystery afterward at the store although they consisted simply of directions to be prepared to drive jethro to brampton the next morning but the look of the man had frightened jake he had never seen vengeance so indelibly written on that face and he had never before realized the terrible power of vengeance mr wheeler returned from that meeting in such a state of trepidation that he found it necessary to accompany rias to a certain keg in the cellar after which he found his tongue his description of jethros appearance awed his hearers and jake declared that he would not be in isaac worthingtons shoes for all of isaac worthingtons money there were others right here in coniston jake hinted who might now find it convenient to emigrate to the far west  jethros face had not changed when jake drove him out of coniston the next morning good mr satterlee saw it and felt that the visit he had wished to make would have been useless mr amos cuthbert and mr sam price saw it from a safe distance within the store and it is a fact that mr price seriously thought of taking mr wheelers advice about a residence in the west mr cuthbert of a sterner nature made up his mind to be hung and quartered a few minutes before jethro walked into his office over the livery stable senator peleg hartington would have denied with that peculiar and mournful scorn of which he was master that jethro bass could ever again have any influence over him peleg was indeed at that moment preparing in his own way to make overtures to the party of isaac d worthington jethro walked into the office leaving jake below with mr sherman and senator hartington was very glad he had not made the overtures and when he accompanied jethro to the station when he left for the capital the senator felt that the eyes of men were upon him  and cynthia happily cynthia passed the day in ignorance that jethro had gone through brampton ephraim though he knew of it did not speak of it when he came home to his dinner mr graves had called and informed her of the meeting in the town hall that night  it is our only chance he said obdurately in answer to her protests we must lay the case before the people of brampton if they have not the courage to right the wrong and force your reinstatement through public opinion there is nothing more to be done  to cynthia the idea of having a mass meeting concerning herself was particularly repellent  oh judge graves she cried if there isnt any other way please drop the matter there are plenty of teachers who willbe acceptable to everybody  cynthia said the judge i can understand that this publicity is very painful to you i beg you to remember that we are contending for a principle in such cases the individual must be sacrificed to the common good  but i cannot go to the meetingi cannot  no said the judge i dont think that will be necessary  after he was gone she could think of nothing but the horror of having her nameyes and her characterdiscussed in that public place and it seemed to her if she listened she could hear a clatter of tongues throughout the length of brampton street and that she must fain stop her ears or go mad the few ladies who called during the day out of kindness or curiosity or both only added to her torture she was not one who could open her heart to acquaintances the curious ones got but little satisfaction and the kind ones thought her cold and they did not perceive that she was really grateful for their little attentions gratitude on such occasions does not always consist in pouring out ones troubles in the laps of visitors  so the visitors went home wondering whether it were worth while after all to interest themselves in the cause of such a selfcontained and selfreliant young woman in spite of all her efforts cynthia had never wholly succeeded in making most of the brampton ladies believe that she did not secretly deem herself above them they belonged to a reserved race themselves but cynthia had a reserve which was even different from their own  as night drew on the predictions of mr worthington seemed likely to be fulfilled and it looked as if judge graves would have a useless bill to pay for gas in the new town hall the judge had never been a man who could compel a following and he had no magnetism with which to lead a cause the town tradesmen especially those in the new brick block would be chary as to risking the displeasure of their best customer at halfpast seven mr graves came in alone and sat on the platform staring grimly at his gas is there a lecturer or a playwright or a politician who has not at one time or another been in the judges place who cannot sympathize with him as he watched the thin and hesitating stream of people out of the corner of his eye as they came in at the door the judge despised them with all his soul but it is human nature not to wish to sit in a hall or a theatre that is threequarters empty  at sixteen minutes to eight a mild excitement occurred an incident of some significance which served to detain many waverers senator peleg hartington walked up the aisle and the judge rose and shook him by the hand and as deacon hartington he was invited to sit on the platform the senators personal influence was not to be ignored and it had sufficed to carry his district in the last election against the worthington forces in spite of the abdication of jethro bass mr page the editor of the clarion senator hartingtons organ was also on the platform but where was mr ives where was that gamaliel who had been such a warm partisan in the postoffice that morning  saw him outside the hallwahnt but ten minutes ago said deacon hartington sadly thought he was acomin in  eight oclock came and no mr ives ten minutes pastfifteen minutes past if the truth must be told mr ives had been on the very threshold of the hall and one glance at the poor sprinkling of people there had decided him mr ives had a natural aversion to being laughed at and as he walked back on the darker side of the street he wished heartily that he had stuck to his original gamalieladvocacy of no interference of allowing the supreme judge to decide such opinions were inevitably just mr ives was well aware though not always handed down immediately if he were to humble the first citizen mr ives reflected that a better opportunity might present itself the whistle of the uptrain served to strengthen his resolution for he was reminded thereby that his mill often had occasion to ask favors of the truro railroad  in the meantime it was twenty minutes past eight in the town hall and mr graves had not rapped for order deacon hartington sat as motionless as a stork on the borders of a glassy lake at sunrise the judge had begun seriously to estimate the gas bill and mr page had chewed up the end of a pencil there was one at least in the audience of whom the judge could be sure a certain old soldier in blue sat uncompromisingly on the front bench with his hands crossed over the head of his stick but the ladies and gentlemen nearest the door were beginning to vanish one by one silently as ghosts when suddenly the judge sat up he would have rubbed his eyes had he been that kind of a man four persons had entered the hallhe was sure of itand with no uncertain steps as if frightened by its emptiness no they came boldly and after them trooped others and still others were heard in the street beyond not whispering but talking in the unmistakable tones of people who had more coming behind them yes and more came it was no illusion or delusion there they were filling the hall as if they meant to stay and buzzing with excitement the judge was quivering with excitement now but he too was only a spectator of the drama and what a drama with a miracleplay for brampton  mr page rose from his chair and leaned over the edge of the platform that something might be whispered in his ear the news whatever it was was apparently electrifying and after the first shock he turned to impart it to mr graves but turned too late for the judge had already rapped for order and was clearing his throat he could not account for this extraordinary and unlookedfor audience among whom he spied many who had thought it wiser not to protest against the dictum of the first citizen and many who had professed to believe that the teachers connection with jethro bass was a good and sufficient reason for dismissal the judge was prepared to take advantage of the tide whatever its cause  ladies and gentlemen he said i take the liberty of calling this meeting to order and before a chairman be elected i mean to ask your indulgence to explain my purposes in requesting the use of this hall tonight in our system of government the inalienable and most precious gift  whatever the gift was the judge never explained he paused at the words and repeated them and stopped altogether because no one was paying any attention to him the hall was almost full the people had risen with a hum and as one man had turned toward the door mr gamaliel ives was triumphantly marching down the aisle and with him waswell another person nay personage would perhaps be the better word  let us go back for a moment there descended from that train of which we have heard the whistle a lady with features of no ordinary moulding with curls and a string bonnet and a cloak that seemed strangely to harmonize with the ladys character she had the way of one in authority and mr sherman himself ran to open the door of his only closed carriage and the driver galloped off with her all the way to the brampton house once there the lady seized the pen as a soldier seizes the sword and wrote her name in most uncompromising characters on the register miss lucretia penniman boston then she marched up to her room  miss lucretia penniman author of the hymn to coniston in the reflected glory of whose fame brampton had shone for thirty years whose name was lauded and whose poem was recited at every fourth of july celebration that the very children might learn it and honor its composer stratfordonavon is not prouder of shakespeare than brampton of miss lucretia and now she was come back unheralded to her birthplace mr raines the clerk looked at the handwriting on the book and would not believe his own sight until it was vouched for by sundry citizens who had followed the lady from the stationon foot and then there was a todo  send for mr gamaliel ives send for miss bruce the librarian send for mr page editor of the clarion and notify the first citizen he indeed could not be sent for but had he known of her coming he would undoubtedly have had her met at the portals and presented with the keys in gold up and down the street flew the news which overshadowed and blotted out all other and the poor little schoolteacher was forgotten  one of these notables was at hand though he did not deserve to be mr gamaliel ives sent up his card to miss lucretia and was shown deferentially into the parlor where he sat mopping his brow and growing hot and cold by turns how would the celebrity treat him the celebrity herself answered the question by entering the room in such stately manner as he had expected to the rustle of the bombazine whereupon mr ives bounced out of his chair and bowed though his body was not formed to bend that way  miss penniman he exclaimed what an honor for brampton and what a pleasure the greater because so unexpected how cruel not to have given us warning and we could have greeted you as your great fame deserves you could never take time from your great duties to accept the invitations of our literary committee alas but now that you are here you will find a warm welcome miss penniman how long it has beenthirty yearsyou see i know it to a day thirty years since you left us thirty years i may say we have kept burning the vestal fire in your worship hoping for this hour  miss lucretia may have had her own ideas about the propriety of the reference to the vestal fire  gamaliel she said sharply straighten up and dont talk nonsense to me ive had you on my knee and i knew your mother and father  gamaliel did straighten up as though miss lucretia had applied a lump of ice to the small of his back so it is when the literary deities vestal or otherwise return to their stratfords there are generally surprises in store for the people they have had on their knees and for others  gamaliel said miss lucretia i want to see the prudential committee for the village district  the prudential committee mr ives fairly shrieked the words in his astonishment  i tried to speak plainly said miss lucretia who are on that committee  ezra graves said mr ives as though mechanically compelled for his head was spinning round ezra graves always has run it until now but hes in the town hall  whats he doing there  mr ives was no fool some inkling of the facts began to shoot through his brain and he saw his chance  he called a mass meeting to protest against the dismissal of a teacher  gamaliel said miss lucretia you will conduct me to that meeting i will get my cloak  mr ives wasted no time in the interval and he fairly ran out into the office miss lucretia penniman was in town and would attend the mass meeting now indeed it was to be a mass meeting away flew the tidings broadcast and people threw off their carpet slippers and dressing gowns and some who had gone to bed got up again mr dodd heard it and changed his shoes three times and his intentions three times three should he go or should he not already he heard in imagination the first distant note of the populace and he was not of the metal to defend a bastille or a louvre for his royal master with the last drop of his blood  in the meantime gamaliel ives was conducting miss lucretia toward the town hall and speaking in no measured tones of indignation of the cringing truckling qualities of that very mr dodd the injustice to miss wetherell which mr ives explained as well as he could made his blood boil so he declared  and note we are back again at the meeting when the judge with his hand on his adams apple is pronouncing the word gift mr ives is triumphantly marching down the aisle escorting the celebrity of brampton to the platform and quite aware of the heart burnings of his fellowcitizens on the benches and miss lucretia with that stern composure with which celebrities accept public situations follows up the steps as of right and takes the chair he assigns her beside the chairman the judge still grasping his adams apple stares at the newcomer in amazement and recognizes her in spite of the years and trembles miss lucretia penniman blucher was not more welcome to wellington or lafayette to washington than was miss lucretia to ezra graves as he turned his back on the audience and bowed to her deferentially then he turned again cleared his throat once more to collect his senses and was about to utter the familiar words we have with us tonight when they were taken out of his mouthtaken out of his mouth by one who had in all conscience stolen enough thunder for one manmr gamaliel ives  mr chairman said mr ives taking a slight dropping of the judges lower jaw for recognition and ladies and gentlemen of brampton it is our great good fortune to have with us tonight most unexpectedly one of whom brampton is and for many years has been justly proud cheers one whose career brampton has followed with a mothers eyes and with a mothers heart one who has chosen a broader field for the exercise of those great powers with which nature endowed her than brampton could give one who has taken her place among the luminaries of literature of her time cheers one who has done more than any other woman of her generation toward the uplifting of the sex which she honors cheers and clapping of hands and one who though her lot has fallen among the great has not forgotten the home of her childhood for has she not written those beautiful lines which we all know by heart       ah coniston thy lordly form i see      before mine eyes in exile drear  mr chairman and fellowtownsmen and women i have the extreme honor of introducing to you one whom we all love and revere the author of the hymn to coniston the editor of the womans hour miss lucretia penniman loud and longcontinued applause  well might brampton be proud too of gamaliel ives president of its literary club who could make such a speech as this on such short notice if the truth be told the literary club had sent miss lucretia no less than seven invitations and this was the speech mr ives had intended to make on those seven occasions it was unquestionably a neat speech and judge graves or no other chairman should cheat him out of making it mr ives with a wave of his hand toward the celebrity sat down by no means dissatisfied with himself what did he care how the judge glared he did not see how stiffly miss lucretia sat in her chair she could not take him on her knee then but she would have liked to  miss lucretia rose and stood quite as stiffly as she had sat and the judge rose too he was very angry but this was not the time to get even with mr ives as it turned out he did not need to bother about getting even  ladies and gentlemen said he in the absence of any other chairman i take pleasure in introducing to you miss lucretia penniman  more applause was started but miss lucretia put a stop to it by the lifting of a hand then there was a breathless silence then she cast her eyes around the hall as though daring any one to break that silence and finally they rested upon mr ives  mr chairman she said with an inclination toward the judge my friendsfor i hope you will be my friends when i have finished miss lucretia made it quite clear by her tone that it entirely depended upon them whether they would be or not i understood when i came here that this was to be a mass meeting to protest against an injustice and not a feast of literature and oratory as gamaliel ives seems to suppose  she paused and when the first shock of amazement was past an audible titter ran through the audience and mr ives squirmed visibly  am i right mr chairman asked miss lucretia  you are unquestionably right miss penniman answered the chairman rising unquestionably  then i will proceed said miss lucretia i wrote the hymn to coniston many years ago when i was younger and yet it is true that i have always remembered brampton with kindly feelings the friends of our youth are dear to us we look indulgently upon their failings even as they do on ours i have scanned the faces here in the hall tonight and there are some that have not changed beyond recognition in thirty years ezra graves i remember and it is a pleasure to see him in that chair mr graves inclined his head reverently none knew how the inner man exulted but there was one who was often in brampton in those days miss lucretia continued whom we all loved and with whom we found no fault and i confess that when i have thought of brampton i have oftenest thought of her her name said miss lucretia her hand now in the reticule her name was cynthia ware  there was a decided stir among the audience and many leaned forward to catch every word  even old people may have an ideal said miss lucretia and you will forgive me for speaking of mine where should i speak of it if not in this village among those who knew her and among their children cynthia ware although she was younger than i has been my ideal and is still she was the daughter of the rev samuel ware of coniston and a descendant of captain timothy prescott whom general stark called honest tim she was to me all that a woman should be in intellect in her scorn of all that is ignoble and false and in her loyalty to her friends here the handkerchief came out of the reticule she went to boston to teach school and some time afterward i was offered a position in new york and i never saw her again but she married in boston a man of learning and literary attainments though his health was feeble and he was poor william wetherell another stir mr wetherell was a gentlemancynthia ware could have married no otherand he came of good and honorable people in portsmouth very recently i read a collection of letters which he wrote to the newcastle guardian which some of you may know i did not trust my own judgment as to those letters but i took them to an author whose name is known wherever english is spoken but which i will not mention and the author expressed it as his opinion in writing to me that william wetherell was undoubtedly a genius of a high order and that he would have been so recognized if life had given him a chance mr wetherell after his wife died was taken in a dying condition to coniston where he was forced in order to earn his living to become the storekeeper there but he took his books with him and found time to write the letters of which i have spoken and to give his daughter an early education such as few girls have  my friends i am rejoiced to see that the spirit of justice and the sense of right are as strong in brampton as they used to bestrong enough to fill this town hall to overflowing because a teacher has been wronglyyes and iniquitouslydismissed from the lower school here there was a considerable stir and many wondered whether miss lucretia was aware of the irony in her words i say wrongly and iniquitously because i have had the opportunity in boston this winter of learning to know and love that teacher i am not given to exaggeration my friends and when i tell you that i know her that her character is as high and pure as her mothers i can say no more i am here to tell you this tonight because i do not believe you know her as i do during the seventy years i have lived i have grown to have but little faith in outward demonstration to believe in deeds and attainments rather than expressions and as for her fitness to teach i believe that even the prudential committee could find no fault with that i wonder whether mr dodd was in the back of the hall i can find no fault with it i am constantly called upon to recommend teachers and i tell you i should have no hesitation in sending cynthia wetherell to a high school young as she is  and now my friends why was she dismissed i have heard the facts though not from her cynthia wetherell does not know that i have come to brampton unless somebody has told her and did not know that i was coming i have heard the facts and i find it difficult to believe that so great a wrong could be attempted against a woman and if the name of cynthia wetherell had meant no more to me than the letters in it i should have travelled twice as far as brampton old as i am to do my utmost to right that wrong i give you my word of honor that i have never been so indignant in my life i do not come here to stir up enmities among you and i will mention no more names i prefer to believe that the prudential committee of this district has made a mistake the gravity of which they must now realize and that they will reinstate cynthia wetherell tomorrow and if they should not of their own free will i have only to look around this meeting to be convinced that they will be compelled to compelled to my friends by the sense of justice and the righteous indignation of the citizens of brampton  miss lucretia sat down her strong face alight with the spirit that was in her not the least of the compelling forces in this world is righteous anger and when it is exercised by a man or a woman whose life has been a continual warfare against the pests of wrong it is wellnigh irresistible while you could count five seconds the audience sat silent and then began such tumult and applause as had never been seen in bramptonall started so it is said by an old soldier in the front row with his stick isaac d worthington sitting alone in the library of his mansion heard it and had no need to send for mr flint to ask what it was or who it was had fired the third estate and mr dodd heard it he may have been in the hall but now he sat at home seeing visions of the lantern and he would have fled to the palace had he thought to get any sympathy from his sovereign no mr dodd did not hold the bastille or even fight for it another and a better man gave up the keys for heroes are sometimes hidden away in meek and retiring people who wear spectacles and have a stoop to their shoulders long before the excitement died away a dozen men were on their feet shouting at the chairman and among them was the tall stooping man with spectacles he did not shout but judge graves saw him and made up his mind that this was the man to speak the chairman raised his hand and rapped with his gavel and at length he had obtained silence  ladies and gentlemen he said i am going to recognize mr hill of the prudential committee and ask him to step up on the platform  there fell another silence as absolute as the first when mr hill walked down the aisle and climbed the steps indeed people were stupefied for the feed dealer was a man who had never opened his mouth in townmeeting who had never taken an initiative of any kind who had allowed other men to take advantage of him and had never resented it and now he was going to speak would he defend the prudential committee or would he declare for the teacher either course in mr hills case required courage and he had never been credited with any if mr hill was going to speak at all he was going to straddle  he reached the platform bowed irresolutely to the chairman and then stood awkwardly with one knee bent peering at his audience over his glasses he began without any address whatever  i want to say he began in a low voice that i had no intention of coming to this meeting and i am going to confessi am going to confess that i was afraid to come he raised his voice a little defiantly a the words and paused one could almost hear the people breathing i was afraid to come for fear that i should do the very thing i am going to do now and yet i was impelled to come i want to say that my conscience has not been clear since as a member of the prudential committee i gave my consent to the dismissal of miss wetherell i know that i was influenced by personal and selfish considerations which should have had no weight and after listening to miss penniman i take this opportunity to declare of my own free will that i will add my vote to that of judge graves to reinstate miss wetherell  mr hill bowed slightly and was about to descend the steps when the chairman throwing parliamentary dignity to the winds arose and seized the feed dealers hand and the people in the hall almost as one man sprang to their feet and cheered and someephraim prescott among theseeven waved their hats and shouted mr hills name a new england audience does not frequently forget itself but there were few present who did not understand the heroism of the mans confession who were not carried away by the simple and dramatic dignity of it he had no need to mention mr worthingtons name or specify the nature of his obligations to that gentleman in that hour jonathan hill rose high in the respect of brampton and some pressed into the aisle to congratulate him on his way back to his seat not a few were grateful to him for another reason he had relieved the meeting of the necessity of taking any further action of putting their names for instance in their enthusiasm to a paper which the first citizen might see  judge graves whose sense of a climax was acute rapped for order  ladies and gentlemen he said in a voice not wholly free from emotion you will all wish to pay your respects to the famous lady who is with us i see that the rev mr sweet is present and i suggest that we adjourn after he has favored us with a prayer  as the minister came forward deacon hartington dropped his head and began to flutter his eyelids the rev mr sweet prayed and so was brought to an end the most exciting meeting ever held in brampton town hall  but miss lucretia did not like being called a famous lady     chapter xvi  while miss lucretia was standing unwillingly enough listening to the speeches that were poured into her ear by various members of the audience receiving the incense and myrrh to which so great a celebrity was entitled the old soldier hobbled away to his little house as fast as his three legs would carry him only one event in his life had eclipsed this in happinessthe interview in front of the white house he rapped on the window with his stick thereby frightening cynthia half out of her wits as she sat musing sorrowfully by the fire  cousin ephraim she said taking off his corded hat what in the worlds the matter with you  youre a schoolmarm again cynthy  do you mean to say  miss lucretia penniman done it  miss lucretia penniman cynthia began to think his rheumatism was driving him out of his mind  you bet long toward the openin of the engagement there wahnt scarcely anybody thar but me and they was agoin but they come fast enough when they larned she was in town and she blew em up highern the petersburg crater great tecumseh theres a woman next to general grant id sooner shake her hand than anybodys livin  do you mean to say that miss lucretia is in brampton and spoke at the mass meeting  spoke exclaimed ephraim callate she didsome tore em all up theyd a hung isaac d worthington or levi dodd if theyd a had em thar  cynthia striving to be calm herself got him into a chair and took his stick and straightened out his leg and then ephraim told her the story and it lost no dramatic effect in his telling he would have talked all night but at length the sound of wheels was heard in the street cynthia flew to the door and a familiar voice came out of the darkness  you need not wait gamaliel no thank you i think i will stay at the hotel  gamaliel was still protesting when miss lucretia came in and seized cynthia in her arms and the door was closed behind her  oh miss lucretia why did you come said cynthia if i had known you would do such a thing i should never have written that letter i have been sorry today that i did write it and now im sorrier than ever  arent you glad to see me demanded miss lucretia  miss lucretia  what are friends for asked miss lucretia patting her hand if you had known how i wished to see you cynthia and i thought a little trip would be good for such a provincial bostonian as i am dear dear i remember this house it used to belong to gabriel post in my time and right across from it was the social library where i have spent so many pleasant hours with your mother and this is ephraim prescott i thought it was when i saw him sitting in the front row and i think he must have been very lonesome there at one time  yes maam said ephraim giving her his gnarled fingers i was just sayin to cynthy that id ruther shake your hand than anybodys livin exceptin general grant  and id rather shake yours than the generals said miss lucretia for the womans hour had taken the opposition side in a certain recent public question concerning women  if youd a fit with him you wouldnt say that miss lucrety  i havent a word to say against his fighting qualities she replied  guess the general might say the same of you said ephraim if youd a ben a man i callate youd a come out of the war with two stars on your shoulder godfrey miss lucrety youd ought tove ben a man  a man cried miss lucretia and stars on my shoulder i think this kind of talk has gone far enough ephraim prescott  cousin eph said cynthia laughing youre no match for miss lucretia and its long past your bedtime  a man repeated miss lucretia after he had retired and after cynthia had tried to express her gratitude and had been silenced they sat side by side in front of the chimney i suppose he meant that as a compliment i never yet saw the man i couldnt back down and i havent any patience with a woman who gives in to them miss lucretia poked vigorously a log which had fallen down as though that were a man too and she was putting him back in his proper place  cynthia strange to say did not reply to this remark  cynthia said miss lucretia abruptly you dont mean to say that you are in love  cynthia drew a long breath and grew as red as the embers  miss lucretia she exclaimed in astonishment and dismay  well miss lucretia said i should have thought you could have gotten along for a while at least without anything of that kind my dear she said leaning toward cynthia who is he  cynthia turned away she found it very hard to speak of her troubles even to miss lucretia and she would have kept this secret even from jethro had it been possible  you must let him know his place said miss lucretia and i hope he is in some degree worthy of you  i do not intend to marry him said cynthia with head still turned away  it was now miss lucretia who was silent  i came near getting married once she said presently with characteristic abruptness  you cried cynthia looking around in amazement  you see i am franker than you my dearthough i never told any one else i believe you can keep a secret  of course i can whowas it anyone in brampton miss lucretia the question was out before cynthia realized its import she was turning the tables with a vengeance  it was ezra graves said miss lucretia  ezra graves and then cynthia pressed miss lucretias hand in silence thinking how strange it was that both of them should have been her champions that evening  miss lucretia poked the fire again  it was shortly after that when i went to boston that i wrote the hymn to coniston i suppose we must all be fools once or twice or we should not be human  andwerent you eversorry asked cynthia  again there was a silence  i could not have done the work i have had to do in the world if i had married but i have often wondered whether that work was worth the while such a feeling must come over all workers occasionally yes said miss lucretia there have been times when i have been sorry my dear though i have never confessed it to another soul i am telling you this for your own goodnot mine if you have the love of a good man cynthia be careful what you do with it  the tears had come into cynthias eyes  i should have told you miss lucretia she faltered if i could have married him it would have been easier  why cant you marry him demanded miss lucretia sharplyto hide her own emotion  his name said cynthia is bob worthington  isaac worthingtons son  yes  another silence miss lucretia being utterly unable to say anything for a space  is he a good man  cynthia was on the point of indignantprotest but she stopped herself in time  i will tell you what he has done she answered and then you shall judge for yourself  and she told miss lucretia simply all that bob had done and all that she herself had done  he is like his mother sarah hollingsworth i knew her well said miss lucretia if isaac worthington were a man he would be down on his knees begging you to marry his son he tried hard enough to marry your own mother  my mother exclaimed cynthia who had never believed that rumor  yes said miss lucretia and you may thank your stars he didnt succeed i mistrusted him when he was a young man and now i know that he hasnt changed he is a coward and a hypocrite  cynthia could not deny this  and yet she said after a moments silence i am sure you will say that i have been right my own conscience tells me that it is wrong to deprive bob of his inheritance and to separate him from his father whatever his fathermay be  we shall see what happens in five years said miss lucretia  five years said cynthia in spite of herself  jacob served seven for rachel answered miss lucretia that period is scarcely too short to test a man and you are both young  no said cynthia i cannot marry him miss lucretia the world would accuse me of design and i feel that i should not be happy i am sure that he would never reproach me even if things went wrong butthe day might come whenwhen he would wish that it had been otherwise  miss lucretia kissed her  you are very young my dear she repeated and none of us may say what changes time may bring forth and now i must go  cynthia insisted upon walking with her friend down the street to the hotelan undertaking that was without danger in brampton and it was only a step after all a late moon floated in the sky throwing in relief the shadow of the worthington mansion against the white patches of snow a light was still burning in the library  the next morning after breakfast miss lucretia appeared at the little house and informed cynthia that she would walk to school with her  but i have not yet been notified by the committee said cynthia there was a knock at the door and in walked judge ezra graves miss lucretia may have blushed but it is certain that cynthia did never had she seen the judge so spick and span and he wore the broadcloth coat he usually reserved for sundays he paused at the threshold with his hand on his adams apple  good morning ladies he said and looked shyly at miss lucretia and cleared his throat and spoke with the elaborate decorum he used on occasions miss penniman i wish to thank you again for your noble action of last evening  dont miss penniman me ezra graves retorted miss lucretia the only noble action i know of was poor jonathan hillsunless it was paying for the gas  this was the way in which miss lucretia treated her lover after thirty years cynthia thought of what the lady had said to her a few hours since by this very fire and began to believe she must have dreamed it fires look very differently at nightand sometimes burn brighter then the judge parted his coat tails and seated himself on the wooden edge of a canebottomed chair  lucretia he said you havent changed  you have ezra she replied looking at the adams apple  im an old man said ezra graves  cynthia could not help thinking that he was a very different man in miss lucretias presence than when at the head of the prudential committee  ezra said miss lucretia for a man you do very well  the judge smiled  thank you lucretia said he he seemed to appreciate the full extent of the compliment  judge graves said cynthia i can tell you how good you are at least and thank you for your great kindness to me which i shall never forget  she took his withered hands from his knees and pressed them he returned the pressure and then searched his coat tails found a handkerchief and blew his nose violently  i merely did my duty miss wetherell he said i would not wilfully submit to a wrong  you called me cynthia yesterday  so i did he answered so i did then he looked at miss lucretia  ezra said that lady smiling a little i dont believe you have changed after all  what she meant by that nobody knows  i had thought cynthia said the judge that it might be more comfortable for you to have me go to the school with you that is the reason for my early call  judge graves i do appreciate your kindness said cynthia i hope you wont think im rude if i say id rather go alone  on the contrary my dear replied the judge i think i can understand and esteem your feeling in the matter and it shall be as you wish  then i think i had better be going said cynthia the judge rose in alarm at the words but she put her hand on his shoulder wont you sit down and stay she begged you havent seen miss lucretia for how many yearsthirty isnt it  again he glanced at miss lucretia uncertainly sit down ezra she commanded and for goodness sake dont be afraid of the cane bottom you wont go through it i should like to talk to you and most of the gossips of our day are dead i shall stay in brampton today cynthia and eat supper with you here this evening  cynthia as she went out of the door wondered what they would talk about then she turned toward the school it was not the march wind that burned her cheeks as she thought of the mass meeting the night before which was all about her she wished she might go to school that morning through the woods and pasture lots rather than down brampton street whatwhat would bob say when he heard of the meeting would he come again to brampton if he did she would run away to boston with miss lucretia every day it had been a trial to pass the worthington house but she could not cross the wide street to avoid it she hurried a little unconsciously when she came to it for there was mr worthington on the steps talking to mr flint how he must hate her now cynthia reflected he did not so much as look up when she passed  the other citizens whom she met made up for mr worthingtons coldness and gave her a hearty greeting and some stopped to offer their congratulations cynthia did not pause to philosophize she was learning to accept the world as it was and hurried swiftly on to the little schoolhouse the children saw her coming and ran to meet her and escorted her triumphantly in at the door of their welcome she could be sure thus she became again teacher of the lower school  how the judge and miss lucretia got along that morning cynthia never knew miss lucretia spent the day in her old home submitting to heroworship and attended an evening party in her honor at mr gamaliel ivess housea mansion not so large as the first citizens though it had two baywindows and was not altogether unimposing the first citizen needless to say was not there but the rest of the elite attended mr ives will tell you all about the entertainment if you go to brampton but the real reason miss lucretia consented to go was to please lucy baird who was gamaliels wife and to chat with certain old friends whom she had not seen the next morning she called at the school to bid cynthia goodby and to whisper something in her ear which made her very red before all the scholars she shook her head when miss lucretia said it for it had to do with an incident in the 29th chapter of genesis  while jonathan hill was being made a hero of in the little twobyfour office of the feed store the morning after the mass meeting though nobody offered to take over his mortgage mr dodd was complaining to his wife of shooting pains and callated he would stay at home that day  shootin fiddlesticks said mrs dodd get along down to the store and face the music levi dodd youd have had shootin pains if youd a went to the meetin  i might stop by at mr worthingtons house and explain how powerless i was  for goodness sake git out levi i guess he knows how powerless you are with your shootin pains if you only could forget isaac d worthington for three minutes you wouldnt have em  mr dodds two clerks saw him enter the store by the back door and he was very much interested in the new ploughs which were piled up in crates outside of it then he disappeared into his office and shut the door and supposedly became very much absorbed in bookkeeping if any one called he was outany one plenty of people did call but he was not disturbeduntil ten oclock mr dodd had a very sensitive ear and he could often recognize a man by his step and this man he recognized  wheres mr dodd demanded the owner of the step indignantly  hes out mr worthington anything i can do for you mr worthington  you can tell him to come up to my house the moment he comes in  unfortunately mr dodd in the office had got into a strained position he found it necessary to move a little the daybook fell heavily to the floor and the perspiration popped out all over his forehead come out levi dodd the bastille is taken but there are other fortresses still in the royal hands where you may be confined  whos in the office  i dont know sir answered the clerk winking at his companion who was sorting nails  in three strides the great man had his hand on the office door and had flung it open disclosing the culprit cowering over the daybook on the floor  mr dodd cried the first citizen what do you mean by  some natures when terrified are struck dumb mr dodds was the kind which bursts into speech  i couldnt help it mr worthington he cried they would have it i dont know what got into em they lost their senses mr worthington plumb lost their senses if youd a ben there you might have brought em to i tried to git the floor but ezry graves  confound ezra graves and wait till i have done cant you interrupted the first citizen angrily what do you mean by putting a bathtub into my house with the tin loose so that i cut my leg on it  mr dodd nearly fainted from sheer relief  ill put a new one in today right now he gasped  see that you do said the first citizen and if i lose my leg ill sue you for a hundred thousand dollars  i was agoin to explain about them losin their heads at the mass meetin  damn their heads said the first citizen and yours too he may have added under his breath as he stalked out it was not worth a swing of the executioners axe in these times of war news had arrived from the state capital that morning of which mr dodd knew nothing certain feudal chiefs from the north country of whose allegiance mr worthington had felt sure had obeyed the summons of their old sovereign jethro bass and had come south to hold a conclave under him at the pelican those chiefs of the north country with their clans behind them as one man what a power they were in the state what magnificent qualities they had in battle or strategy and how cunning and shrewd was their generalship year after year they came down from their mountains and fought shoulder to shoulder and year after year they carried back the lions share of the spoils between them the great south as a whole was powerless to resist them for there could be no lasting alliance between harwich and brampton and newcastle and gosport now their king had come back and the north country men were rallying again to his standard no wonder that levi dodds head poor thing that it was was safe for a while  organize what you have left and be quick about it said mr flint when the news had come and they sat in the library planning a new campaign in the face of this evident defection there was no time to cry over spilt milk or reinstated schoolteachers the messages flew far and wide to the manufacturing towns to range their guilds into line for the railroads the seneschal wrote the messages and sent the summons to the sleek men of the cities and let it be known that the coffers were full and not too tightly sealed that the faithful should not lack for the sinews of war mr flint found time too to write some carefully worded but nevertheless convincing articles for the newcastle guardian very damaging to certain commanders who had proved unfaithful  flint said mr worthington when they had worked far into the night if bass beats us im a crippled man  and if you postpone the fight now that you have begun it what then  the answer mr worthington knew was the same either way he did not repeat it he went to his bed but not to sleep for many hours and when he came down to his breakfast in the morning he was in no mood to read the letter from cambridge which mrs holden had put on his plate but he did read it with what anger and bitterness may be imagined there was the ultimatumrespectful even affectionate but firm i know that you will in all probability disinherit me as you say and i tell you honestly that i regret the necessity of quarrelling with you more than i do the money i do not pretend to say that i despise money and i like the things that it buys but the woman i love is more to me than all that you have  mr worthington laid the letter down and there came irresistibly to his mind something that his wife had said to him before she died shortly after they had moved into the mansion dudley how happy we used to be together before we were rich money had not been everything to sarah worthington either but now no tender wave of feeling swept over him as he recalled those words he was thinking of what weapon he had to prevent the marriage beyond that which was now uselessdisinheritance he would disinherit bob and that very day he would punish his son to the utmost of his power for marrying the ward of jethro bass he wondered bitterly in case a certain event occurred whether he would have much to alienate  when mr flint arrived fresh as usual in spite of the work he had accomplished and the cigars he had smoked the night before mr worthington still had the letter in his hand and was pacing his library floor and broke into a tirade against his son  after all i have done for him building up for him a position and a fortune that is only surpassed by young duncans to treat me in this way to drag down the name of worthington in the mire ill never forgive him ill send for dixon and leave the money for a hospital in brampton cant you suggest any way out of this flint  no said flint not now the only chance you have is to ignore the thing from now on he may get tired of herive known such things to happen  when she hears that ive disinherited him she will get tired of him declared mr worthington  try it and see if you like said flint  look here flint if the woman has a spark of decent feeling as you seem to think ill send for her and tell her that she will ruin robert if she marries him mr worthington always spoke of his son as robert  you ought to have thought of that before the mass meeting perhaps it would have done some good then  because this penniman woman has stirred people upis that what you mean i dont care anything about that money counts in the long run  if money counted with this schoolteacher it would be a simple matter i think youll find it doesnt  ive known you to make some serious mistakes snapped mr worthington  then why do you ask for my advice  ill send for her and appeal to her better nature said mr worthington with an unconscious and sublime irony  flint gave no sign that he heard mr worthington seated himself at his desk and after some thought wrote on a piece of notepaper the following lines my dear miss wetherell i should be greatly obliged if you would find it convenient to call at my house at eight oclock this evening and signed them sincerely yours he sealed them up in an envelope and addressed it to miss wetherell at the schoolhouse and handed it to mr flint that gentleman got as far as the door and then he hesitated and turned  there is just one way out of this for you that i can see mr worthington he said its a desperate measure but its worth thinking about  whats that  it took some courage for mr flint to make the suggestion the girls a good girl well educated and by no means bad looking bob might do a thousand times worse give your consent to the marriage and jethro bass will go back to coniston  it was wisdom such as few lords get from their seneschals but isaac d worthington did not so recognize it his anger rose and took away his breath as he listened to it  i will never give my consent to it neverdo you hearnever send that note he cried  mr flint walked out sent the note and returned and took his place silently at his own table he was a man of concentration and he put his mind on the arguments he was composing to certain political leaders mr worthington merely pretended to work as he waited for the answer to come back and presently when it did come back he tore it open and read it with an expression not often on his lips he flung the paper at mr flint  read that he said  this is what mr flint read miss wetherell begs to inform mr isaac d worthington that she can have no communication or intercourse with him whatsoever  mr flint handed it back without a word his opinion of the schoolteacher had risen mightily but he did not say so mr worthington took the note too without a word speech was beyond him and he crushed the paper as fiercely as he would have liked to have crushed cynthia had she been in his hands  one accomplishment which cynthia had learned at miss sadlers school was to write a letter in the third person miss sadler holding that there were occasions when it was beneath a ladys dignity to write a direct note and cynthia sitting at her little desk in the schoolhouse during her recess had deemed this one of the occasions she could not bring herself to write my dear mr worthington her anger when the note had been handed to her was for the moment so great that she could not go on with her classes but she had controlled it and compelled silas to stand in the entry until recess when she sat with her pen in her hand until that happy notion of the third person occurred to her and after silas had gone she sat still though trembling a little at intervals picturing with some satisfaction mr worthingtons appearance when he received her answer her instinct told her that he had received his sons letter and that he had sent for her to insult her by sending for her indeed he had insulted her irrevocably and that is why she trembled  poor cynthia her troubles came thick and fast upon her in those days when she reached home there was the letter which ephraim had left on the table addressed in the familiar upright handwriting and when cynthia saw it she caught her hand sharply at her breast as if the pain there had stopped the beating of her heart well it was for bobs peace of mind that he could not see her as she read it and before she had come to the end there were drops on the sheets where the purple ink had run how precious would have been those drops to him he would never give her up no mandate or decree could separate themnothing but death and he was happier now so he told herthan he had been for months happy in the thought that he was going out into the world to win bread for her as became a man even if he had not her to strive for he saw now that such was the only course for him he could not conform  it was a manly letterhow manly bob himself never knew but cynthia knew and she wept over it and even pressed it to her lipsfor there was no one to see yes she loved him as she would not have believed it possible to love and she sat through the afternoon reading his words and repeating them until it seemed that he were there by her side speaking them they came untrammelled and undefiled from his heart into hers  and now that he had quarrelled with his father for her sake and was bent with all the determination of his character upon making his own way in the world what was she to do what was her duty not one letter of the twoscore she had received so she kept their count from day to daynot one had she answered his faith had indeed been great but she must answer this must write too on that subject of her dismissal lest it should be wrongly told him he was rash in his anger and fearless this she knew and loved him for such qualities as he had  she must stay in brampton and do her workso much was clearly her duty although she longed to flee from it and at last she sat down and wrote to him some things are too sacred to be set forth on a printed page and this letter is one of those things try as she would she could not find it in her heart at such a time to destroy his hopeor her own the hope which she would not acknowledge and the love which she strove to conceal from him seeped up between the words of her letter like water through grains of sand words indeed are but as grains of sand to conceal strong feelings and as cynthia read the letter over she felt that every line betrayed her and knew that she could compose no lines which would not  she said nothing of the summons which she had received that morning or of her answer and her account of the matter of the dismissal and reinstatement was brief and dignified and contained no mention of mr worthingtons name or agency it was her duty too to rebuke bob for the quarrel with his father to point out the folly of it and the wrong and to urge him as strongly as she could to retract though she felt that all this was useless and thenthen came the betrayal of hope she could not ask him never to see her again but she did beseech him for her sake and for the sake of that love which he had declared not to attempt to see her not for a year she wrote though the word looked to her like eternity her reasons aside from her own scruples were so obvious while she taught in brampton that she felt that he would consent to banishmentuntil the summer holidays in july at least and then she would be in conistonand would have had time to decide upon future steps a reprieve was all she craveda reprieve in which to reflect for she was in no condition to reflect now of one thing she was sure that it would not be right at this time to encourage him although she had a guilty feeling that the letter had given him encouragement in spite of all the prohibitions it contained if in the future years thought cynthia as she sealed the envelope he persists in his determination what then you miss lucretia of all people in the world have planted the seeds with your talk about genesis  the letter was signed one who will always remain your friend cynthia wetherell and she posted it herself  when ephraim came home to supper that evening he brought the brampton clarion just out and in it was an account of miss lucretia pennimans speech at the mass meeting and of her visit and of her career it was written in mr pages best vein and so laudatory was it that we shall have to spare miss lucretia in not repeating it here yes and omit the encomiums too on the teacher of the brampton lower school mr worthington was not mentioned and for this at least cynthia drew along breath of relief though ephraim was of the opinion that the first citizen should have been scored as he deserved and held up to the contempt of his fellowtownsmen the dismissal of the teacher indeed was put down to a regrettable misconception on the part of one of the prudential committee who had confessed his mistake in a manly and altogether praiseworthy speech the article was as near the truth perhaps as the clarions may come on such matterswhich is not very near cynthia would have been better pleased if mr page had spared his readers the recital of her qualities and she did not in the least recognize the paragon whom miss lucretia had befriended and defended she was thankful that mr page did pot state that the celebrity had come up from boston on her account miss penniman had been actuated by a sudden desire to see once more the beauties of her old home to look into the faces of the old friends who had followed her career with such pardonable pride the speech of the president of the literary club you may be sure was printed in full for mr ives himself had taken the trouble to write it out for the editorby request of course  cynthia turned over the sheet and read many interesting items one concerning the beauty and fashion and intellect which attended the party at mr gamaliel ivess in the clovelly notes she saw that miss judy hatch of coniston was visiting relatives there she learned the output of the worthington mills for the past week cynthia was about to fold up the paper and send it to miss lucretia whom she thought it would amuse when her eyes were arrested by the sight of a familiar name          jethro bass come to life again           from the state tribune  that was the heading one of the greatest political surprises in many years was the arrival in the capital on wednesday of judge bass whom it was thought had permanently retired from politics this at least seems to have been the confident belief of a faction in the state who have at heart the consolidation of certain lines of railroads judge bass was found by a tribune reporter in the familiar throne room at the pelican but as usual he could not be induced to talk for publication he was in conference throughout the afternoon with several wellknown leaders from the north country the return of jethro bass to activity seriously complicates the railroad situation and many prominent politicians are freely predicting tonight that in spite of the townmeeting returns the proposed bill for consolidation will not go through judge bass is a man of such remarkable personality that he has regained at a stroke much of the influence that he lost by the sudden and unaccountable retirement which electrified the state some months since his reappearance the news of which was the one topic in all political centres yesterday is equally unaccountable it is hinted that some action on the part of isaac d worthington has brought jethro bass to life they are known to be bitter enemies and it is said that jethro bass has but one object in returning to the fieldto crush the president of the truro railroad another theory is that the railroads and interests opposed to the consolidation have induced judge bass to take charge of their fight for them all indications point to the fiercest struggle the state has ever seen in june when the legislature meets the tribune whose sentiments are well known to be opposed to the iniquity of consolidation extends a hearty welcome to the judge no state we believe can claim a party leader of a higher order of ability than jethro bass  cynthia dropped the paper in her lap and sat very still this then was what happened when jethro had heard of her dismissalhe had left coniston without writing her a word and passed through brampton without seeing her he had gone back to that life which he had abandoned for her sake the temptation had been too strong the desire for vengeance too great he had not dared to see her and yet the love for her which had been strong enough to make him renounce the homage of men and even incur their ridicule had incited him to this very act of vengeance  what should she do now indeed had those peaceful and happy saturdays and sundays in coniston passed away forever should she follow him to the capital and appeal to him ah no she felt that were a useless pain to them both she believed now that he had gone away from her for all time that the veil of limitless space was set between them silently she aroseso silently that ephraim dozing by the fire did not awake she went into her own room and wept and after many hours fell into a dreamless sleep of sheer exhaustion  the days passed and the weeks the snow ran from the brown fields and melted at length even in the moist crotches under the hemlocks of the northern slopes the robin and bluebird came the hillsides were mottled with exquisite shades of green and the scent of fruit blossom and balm of gilead was in the air june came as a maiden and grew into womanhood but jethro bass did not return to coniston     chapter xvii  the legends which surround the famous war which we are about to touch upon are as dim as those of troy or tuscany decorous chronicles and biographies and monographs and eulogies exist bound in leather and stamped in gold each lauding its own hero chronicles written in really beautiful language and highminded and noble out of which the heroes come unstained horatius holds the bridge and not a dent in his armor and swims the tiber without getting wet or muddy castor and pollux fight in the front rank at lake regillus in the midst of all that gore and slaughter and emerge all white and pure at the end of the daybut they are gods  out of the classic wars to which we have referred sprang the great roman republic and empire and legend runs into authentic and written history just so parva componere magnis out of the cloudwrapped conflicts of the five railroads of which our own gaul is composed emerged one imperial railroad authentically and legally written down on the statute books for all men to see we cannot go behind that statute except to collect the legends and write homilies about the heroes who held the bridges  if we were not in mortal terror of the imperial power and a little fearful too of tiring our readers we would write out all the legends we have collected of this first fight for consolidation and show the blood too  in the statute books of a certain state may be found a number of laws setting forth the various things that a railroad or railroads may do and on the margin of these pages is invariably printed a date that being the particular year in which these laws were passed by a singular coincidence it is the very year at which we have now arrived in our story we do not intend to give a map of the state or discuss the merits or demerits of the consolidation of the central and the northwestern and the truro railroads such discussions are not the province of a novelist and may all be found in the files of the tribune at the state library there were likewise decisions without number handed down by the various courts before and after that celebrated sessionopinions on the validity of leases on the extension of railroads on the rights of individual stockholdersall dry reading enough  at the risk of being picked to pieces by the corporation lawyers who may read these pages we shall attempt to state the situation and with all modesty and impartialityfor we at least hold no brief when mr isaac d worthington obtained that extension of the truro railroad which we have read about from the somewhat verdant point of view of william wetherell that railroad then formed a connection with another road which ran northward from harwich through another state and with which we have nothing to do having previously purchased a line to the southward from the capital mr worthingtons railroad was in a position to compete with mr duncans the central for canadian traffic and also to cut into the profits of the northwestern mr lovejoys road in brief the truro railroad found itself very advantageously placed as mr worthington and mr flint had foreseen there followed a period of bickering and recrimination of attempts of the other two railroads to secure representation in the truro directorate of suits and injunctions and appeals to the legislature and i know not what elsein all of which affairs mr bijah bixby and other gentlemen we could name found both pleasure and remuneration  oh that those halcyon days of the little wars would come again when a captain could ride out almost any time at the held of his band of mercenaries and see honest fighting and divide honest spoils there was much knocking about of men and horses but very little bloodshed so we are told mr bixby will sit on the sunny side of his barns in clovelly and tell you stories of that golden period with tears in his eyes when he went to conventions with a pocketful of proxies from the river towns and controlled in the greatest legislative year of all a block which included the president of the senate for which he got the fabulous sum of he will tell you but i wont mr bixbys occupation is gone now we have changed all that and we are ruled from imperial rome if you dont do right they cut off your political head and it is of no use to run away because there is no one to run to  it was isaac d worthingtonor shall we say mr flintwho was responsible for this pernicious change for the worse who conceived the notion of leasing for the truro the central and the northwesternthus making one railroad out of the three if such a gigantic undertaking could be got through mr worthington very rightly deemed that the other railroads of the state would eventually fall like ripe fruit into their capsowning the ground under the tree as they would a movement which we need not go unto was first made upon the courts and for a while adverse decisions came down like summer rain a genius by the name of jethro bass had for many years presided in the room of the governor and council at the state house at the political birth of justices of the supreme court none of them actually wore livery but we have seen one of themalong time agoin a horse blanket none of them were favorable to the plans of mr worthington and mr duncan  we have listened to the firing on the skirmish lines for a long time and now the real battle is at hand it is june and the legislature is meeting and bijah bixby has come down to the capital at the head of his regiment of mercenaries of which mr sutton is the honorary colonel the clans are here from the north well quartered and well fed the throne room within the sacred precincts of which we have been before is occupied but there is another headquarters now too in the pelican housea railroad room larger than the throne room with a bathroom leading out of it another old friend of ours judge abner parkinson of harwich he who gave the sardonic laugh when sam price applied for the post of road agent may often be seen in that railroad room from now on the fact is that the judge is about to become famous far beyond the confines of harwich for he and none other is the author of the consolidation bill itself  mr flint is the generalissimo of the allied railroads and sits in his headquarters early and late going over the details of the campaign with his lieutenants scanning the clauses of the bill with judge parkinson for the last time and giving orders to the captains of mercenaries as to the disposition of their forces writing out passes for the deserving and the true for these latter also and for the wavering there is a clawhammer on the marbletopped mantel wielded by mr bijah bixby pro tem chief of staffor of the hammer for he is selfappointed and very useful he opens the mysterious packing cases which come up to the railroad room thrice a week and there is water to be had in the bathroomand glasses mr bixby also finds time to do some of the scouting about the rotunda and lobbies for which he is justly celebrated and to drill his regiment every day the honorable heth sutton mcwho held the bridge in the woodchuck sessionis there also sitting in a corner swelled with importance smoking big florizel cigars which come fromsomewhere there are indeed many great and battlescarred veterans who congregate in that roomtoo numerous and great to mention and saunterers in the capitol park opposite know when a council of war is being held by the volumes of smoke which pour out of the window just as the romans are made cognizant by the smoking of a chimney of when another notable event takes place  who then are left to frequent the throne room is that ancient seat of power deserted and does jethro bass sit there alone behind the curtains in his bitterness thinking of other bright june days that are gone  of all those who had been amazed when jethro bass suddenly emerged from his retirement and appeared in the capital some months before none were more thunderstruck than certain gentlemen who had been to coniston repeatedly but in vain to urge him to make this very fight the most important of these had been mr balch president of the down east road and the representatives of two railroads of another state they had at last offered jethro fabulous sums to take charge of their armies in the fieldsums at least that would seem fabulous to many people and had seemed so to them when they heard that the lion had roused and shaken himself and had unaccountably come forth of his own accord they hastened to the state capital to renew their offers another shock but of a different kind was in store for them mr balch had not actually driven the packmules laden with treasure to the door of the pelican house where jethro might see them from his window but he requested a private audience and it was probably accidental that the end of his personal checkbook protruded a little from his pocket he was a big coarsegrained man mr balch who had once been a brakeman and had risen by what is known as horse sense to the presidency of his road there was a wonderful sunset beyond the capitol but mr balch did not talk about the sunset although jethro was watching it from behind the curtains  if you are willing to undertake this fight against consolidation said mr balch we are ready to talk business with you  ddont know what youre going to do answered jethro im going to prevent consolidation if i can  all right said balch smiling he regarded this reply as one of jethros delicate euphemisms were prepared to give that same little retainer  jethro did not look up mr balch went to the table and seized a pen and filled out a check for an amount that shall be nameless  i have made it payable to bearer as usual he said and he handed it to jethro  jethro took it and absently tore it into little pieces and threw the pieces on the floor mr balch watched him in consternation he began to think the report that jethro had reached his second childhood was true  what in halifax are you doing bass he cried  wwant to stop this consolidation dont youwant to stop it  certainly i do  ggoin to do all you can to stop it haint you  certainly i am  iill help you said jethro  help us exclaimed balch great scott we want you to take charge of it  iill do all i can but i wont guarantee itwwont guarantee it said jethro  we dont ask you to guarantee it if youll do all you can thats enough you wont take a retainer  wwont take anything said jethro  you mean to say you dont want anything for your for your time and your services if the bill is defeated  tthats about it ed little pprivate matter with both of us you dont want consolidation and i dont i haint offered to give you a retainerhave i  no said the astounded mr balch he scratched his head and fingered the leaves of his checkbook the captains over the tens and the captains over the hundreds would want little retainersand who was to pay these how about the boys asked mr balch  sstill got the same office in the depothaint you ed ssame office  yes  gguess the boys hev ben there before said jethro  mr balch went away meditating upon those sayings and took the train for boston if he had waked up of a fine morning to find himself at the head of some benevolent and charitable organization instead of the down east railroad he could not have been more astonished than he had been at the unaccountable change of heart of jethro bass he did not know what to make of it and told his colleagues so and at first they feared one of two thingstreachery or lunacy but a little later a rumor reached mr balchs ears that jethros hatred of isaac d worthington was at the bottom of his reappearance in public life although jethro himself never mentioned mr worthingtons name jethro sat in the throne room consulting directing day after day and when the legislature assembled the boys began to call at mr balchs office but mr balch never again broached the subject of money to jethro bass  we have to sing the song of sixpence for the last time in these pages and as it is an old song now there will be no encores if you can buy one member of the lower house for ten dollars how many members can you buy for fifty it was no such problem in primary arithmetic that mr balch and his associates had to solvetheirs was in higher mathematics in permutations and combinations and in least squares no wonder the old campaigners speak with tears in their eyes of the days of that ever memorable summer there were spoils to be picked up in the very streets richer than the sack of the thirty cities and as the session wore on it is affirmed by men still living that money rained down in the capitol park and elsewhere like manna from the skies if you were one of a chosen band if you were all you had to do was to look in your vest pockets when you took your clothes off in the evening and extract enough legal tender to pay your bill at the pelican for a week mr lovejoy having been overheard one day to make a remark concerning the diet of hogs the next morning certain visitors to the capital were horrified to discover trails of corn leading from the pelican house to their doorways men who had never seen a receiving teller opened bank accounts no it was not a problem in simple arithmetic and mr balch and mr flint and even mr duncan and mr worthington covered whole sheets with figures during the stifling days in july some men are so valuable that they can be bought twice or even three times and they make figuring complicated  jethro bass did no calculating he sat behind the curtains and he must have kept the figures in his head  the battle had closed in earnest and for twelve long sultry weeks it raged with unabated fierceness consolidation had a terror for the rural mind and the state tribune skilfully played its stream upon the constituents of those gentlemen who stood tamely at the worthington hitchingposts and the constituents flocked to the capital that able newspaper too found space to return with interest the attacks of mr worthingtons organ the newcastle guardian these amenities are much too personal to reproduce here now that the smoke of battle has rolled away an epic could be written upon the conflict if there were space canto one the first position carried triumphantly though at some expense by the worthington forces who elect the speaker that had been a crucial time before the town meetings when jethro abdicated the worthington speaker goes ahead with his committees and it is needless to say that mr chauncey weed is not made chairman of the committee on corporations as an offset to this the jethro forces gain on the extreme right where the honorable peleg hartington is made president of the senate etc  for twelve hot weeks with a public spirit which is worthy of the highest praise the committee sit in their shirt sleeves all day long and listen to arguments for and against consolidation and ask learned questions that startle rural witnesses and smoke big florizel cigars a majority of them judge abner parkinson defends his bill quoting from the constitution and the declaration of independence and the bible a celebrated lawyer from the capital riddles it using the same authorities and citing the federalist and the golden rule in addition the committee sit openminded listening with laudable impartiality it does not become them to arrive at a hasty decision on a question of such magnitude in the meantime the house passes an important bill dealing with the bounty on hedgehogs and there are several card games going on in the cellar where it is cool  the governor of the state is a free lance and may be seen any afternoon walking through the park consorting with no one he may be recognized even at a distance by his portly figure his silk hat and his dignified mien yes it is an old and valued friend the honorable alva hopkins patron of the drama and sometimes he has a beautiful young woman still unattached by his side he lives in a suite of rooms at the pelican it is a wellknown fact among mr worthingtons supporters that the honorable alva promised in january when mr bass retired to sign the consolidation bill and that he suddenly became openminded in march and has remained openminded ever since listening gravely to arguments and giving much study to the subject he is an executive now although it is the last year of his term and of course he is never seen either in the throne room or the railroad room and besides he may become a senator  august has come and the forces are spent and panting and neither side dares to risk the final charge the reputation of jethro bass is at stake should he risk and lose he must go back to coniston a beaten man subject to the contempt of his neighbors and his state people do not know that he has nothing now to go back to and that he cares nothing for contempt as he sits in his window day after day he has only one thought and one wishto ruin isaac d worthington and he will do it if he can those who knowand among them is mr balch himselfsay that jethro has never conducted a more masterly campaign than this and that all the others have been mere childish trials of strength compared to it so he sits there through those twelve weeks while the session slips by while his opponents grumble and while even his supporters eager for the charge complain the truth is that in all the years of his activity be has never had such an antagonist as mr flint victory hangs in the balance and a false move will throw it to either side  victory hangs now to be explicit upon two factors the first and most immediate of these is a certain canny captain of many wars whose regiment is still at the disposal of either armyfor a price a regiment which has hitherto remained strictly neutral and what a regiment it is a block of river towns and a senator and not a casualty since they marched boldly into camp twelve weeks ago mr batch is getting very much worried about this regiment and beginning to doubt jethros judgment  i tell you bass he said one evening if you allow him to run around loose much longer were lost thats all there is to it mr batch referred to the captain in question theyll buy up his block at his figuresee if they dont theyre getting desperate dont you think id better bid him in  bbid him in if youve a mind to ed  look here jethro said mr batch savagely biting off the end of a cigar im beginning to think you dont care a continental about this business which side are you on anyway the heat and the length and the uncertainty of the struggle were telling on the nerves of the railroad president you sit there from morning till night and wont say anything and now when theres only one block out you wont give the word to buy it  nnever told you to buy anything did ied  no answered mr batch you havent i dont know what the devils got into you  ddone all the payin without consultin me haint you ed  yes i have what are you driving at  ddone it if i hadnt ben here wouldnt you  yes and more too said mr batch  wwouldnt make much difference to you if i wasnt herewould it  great scott jethro what do you mean cried the railroad president in genuine alarm youre not going to pull out are you  wwouldnt make much odds if i didwould it ed  the devil it wouldnt exclaimed mr balch if you pulled out wed lose the north country and peleg and gosport and nobody can tell which way alva hopkins will swing i guess you know what hell doyoure so dd secretive i cant tell whether you do or not if you pulled out theyd have their bill on friday  hhaint under any obligations to you edam i  no said mr batch but i dont see why you keep harping on that  jdust wanted to have it clear said jethro and relapsed into silence  there was a fireproof carpet on the throne room and mr batch flung down his cigar and stamped on it and went out no wonder he could not understand jethros sudden scruples about money and obligationsabout railroad money that is jethro was spending some of his own but not in the capital and in a manner which was most effective in short at the very moment when mr batch stamped on his cigar jethro had the victory in his handsonly he did not choose to say so he had had a mysterious telegram that day from harwich signed by chauncey weed and mr weed himself appeared at the door of number 7 fresh from his travels shortly after mr batch had gone out of it mr weed closed the door gently and locked it and sat down in a rocking chair close to jethro and put his hand over his mouth we cannot hear what mr weed is saying all is mystery here and in order to preserve that mystery we shall delay for a little the few words which will explain mr weeds successful mission  mr batch angry and bewildered descended into the rotunda where he shortly heard two astounding pieces of news the first was that the honorable heth sutton had abandoned the florizel cigars and had gone home to clovelly the second that mr bijah bixby had resigned the clawhammer and had ceased to open the packing cases in the railroad room consternation reigned in that room so it was said and this was true mr worthington and mr duncan and mr lovejoy were closeted there with mr flint and the door was locked and the transom shut and smoke was coming out of the windows  yes mr bijah bixby is the canny captain of whom mr balch spoke he it is who owns that block of river towns intact and the one senator impossible we have seen him opening the packing cases we have seen him working for the worthington faction for the last two years mr bixby was very willing to open boxes and to make himself useful and agreeable but it must be remembered that a good captain of mercenaries owes a sacred duty to his followers at first mr flint had thought he could count on mr bixby after a while he made several unsuccessful attempts to talk business with him a particularly difficult thing to do even for mr flint when mr bixby did not wish to talk business mr balch had found it quite as difficult to entice mr bixby away from the boxes and the railroad room the weeks drifted on until twelve went by and then mr bixby found himself with his block of river towns and one senator in the incomparable position of being the arbiter of the fate of the consolidation bill in the house and senate no wonder mr balch wanted to buy the services of that famous regiment at any price  but mr bixby for once in his life had waited too long  when mr balch rejoicing but not a little indignant at not having been taken into confidence ascended to the throne room after supper to question jethro concerning the meaning of the things he had heard he found senator peleg hartington seated mournfully on the bed talking at intervals and jethro listening  come up and eat out of my hand said the senator  who demanded mr balch  bije answered the senator  great scott do you mean to say youve got bixby exclaimed the railroad president he felt as if he would like to shake the senator who was so deliberate and mournful in his answers what did you pay him  mr hartington appeared shocked by the question  guess heth sutton will settle with him he said  heth sutton why thewhy should heth pay him  guess hethd like to make him a little present under the circumstances i was goin through the barber shop mr hartington continued speaking to jethro and ignoring the railroad president and i heard somebody whisperin my name sound came out of that little shampoo closet went in there and found bije peleg says he right into my ear tell jethro its all rightyou understand we want heth to go backbreak his heart if he didntyou understand if id knowed last winter jethro meant business i wouldnt hev helped gus flint out tell jethro he can have emyou know what i mean bije waited a little mite too long said the senator who had given a very fair imitation of mr bixbys nasal voice and manner  well im dd ejaculated mr balch staring at jethro how did you work it  sent chauncey through the deestrict said mr hartington  mr chauncey weed had in truth gone through a part of the congressional district of the honorable heth sutton with a little leather bag mr weed had been able to do some of his work with the little leather bag in the capital itself in this way mr bixbys regiment sutton was the honorary colonel had been attacked in the rear and routed here was to be a congressional convention that autumn and a large part of mr suttons district lay in the north country which as we have seen was loyal to jethro to the back bone the district too was largely rural and therefore anticonsolidation and the inability of the worthington forces to get their bill through had made it apparent that jethro bass was as powerful as ever under these circumstances it had not been very difficult for a gentleman of mr chauncey weeds powers of persuasion to induce various lieutenants in the district to agree to send delegates to the coming convention who would be conscientiously opposed to mr suttons renomination hence the departure from the capital of mr sutton hence the generous offer of mr bixby to put his regiment at the disposal of mr bassfree of charge  the second factor on which victory hung we can use the past tense now was none other than his excellency alva hopkins governor of the state the bill would never get to his excellency nowso people said would never get beyond that committee who had listened so patiently to the twelve weeks of argument these were only rumors after all for the rotunda never knows positively what goes on in high circles but the rotunda does figuring too when at length the problem is reduced to a simple equation with bijah bixby as x if it were true that bijah had gone over to jethro bass the consolidation bill was dead     chapter xviii  when jethro bass walked out of the hotel that evening men looked at him and made way for him but none spoke to him there was something in his face that forbade speech he was a great man once morea greater man than ever and he had if the persistent rumors were true accomplished an almost incomprehensible feat even for jethro bass there was another reason too why they stared at him in all those twelve weeks of that most trying of all sessions he had not once gone into the street and he had been less than ever common in the eyes of men twice a day he had descended to the dining room for a simple mealthat was all and fewer had gained entrance to room number 7 this session than ever before  there is a river that flows by the capital a wide and gentle river bordered by green meadows and fringed with willows higher up if you go far enough a forest comes down to the water on the western side jethro walked through the hooded bridge and up the eastern bank until he could see the forest like a black band between the orange sky and the orange river and there he sat down upon a fallen log on the edge of the bank but jethro was thinking of another sceneof a graniteribbed pasture on coniston mountain that swings in limitless space from either end of which a man may step off into eternity william wetherell in one of his letters had described that place as the threshold of the nameless worlds and so it had seemed to jethro in the years of his desolation he was thinking of it now even as it had been in his mind that winters evening when cynthia had come to coniston and had surprised him with that look of terrible loneliness on his face  yes and he was thinking of cynthia when indeed had he not been thinking of her how many tunes had he rehearsed the events in the tannery housefor they were the events of his life now the triumphs over his opponents and enemies fell away and the pride of power such had not been his achievements she had loved him and no man had reached a higher pinnacle than that  why he had forfeited that love for vengeance he could not tell the embers of a mans passions will suddenly burst into flame and he will fiddle madly while the fire burns his soul he had avenged her as well as himself but had he avenged her now that he held isaac worthington in his power by crushing him had he not added to her trouble and her sorrow she had confessed that she loved isaac worthingtons son and was not he jethro widening the breach between cynthia and the son by crushing the father jethro had not thought of this but he had thought of her night and day as he had sat in his room directing the battle not a day had passed that he had not looked for a letter hoping against hope if she had written to him once if she had come to him once would he have desisted he could not saythe fires of hatred had burned so fiercely and still burned so fiercely that he clenched his fists when it came over him that isaac worthington was at last in his power  a white line above the forest was all that remained of the sunset when he rose up and took from his coat a silver locket and opened it and held it to the fading light presently he closed it again and walked slowly along the river bank toward the little city twinkling on its hill he crossed the hooded bridge and climbed the slope stopping for a moment at a little stationery shop he passed through the groups which were still loudly discussing this thing he had done and gained his room and locked the door men came to it and knocked and got no answer the room was in darkness and the night breeze stirred among the trees in the park and blew in at the window  at last jethro got up and lighted the gas and paused at the centre table he was to violate more than one principle of his life that night though not without a struggle and he sat for a long while looking at the blank paper before him then he wrote and sealed the letterwhich contained three linesand pulled the bell cord the call was answered by a messenger who had been far many years in the service of the pelican house and who knew many secrets of the gods the man actually grew pale when he saw the address on the envelope which was put in his hand and read the denomination of the crisp note under it that was the price of silence  ffind the gentleman and give it to him yourself erjohn  yes mr bass  if you dont find him bring itback  when the man had gone jethro turned down the gas and went again to his chair by the window for a while voices came up to him from the street but at length the groups dispersed one by one and a distant clock boomed out eleven solemn strokes twice the clock struck again at the halfhour and midnight and the noises in the housethe banging of doors and the jangling of keys and the hurrying of feet in the corridorswere hushed jethro took no thought of these or of time and sat gazing at the stars in the depths of the sky above the capital dome until a shadow emerged from the black mass of the trees opposite and crossed the street in a few minutes there were footsteps in the corridorstealthy footstepsand a knock on the door jethro got up and opened it and closed it again and locked it then he turned up the gas  ssit down he said and nodded his head toward the chair by the table  isaac worthington laid his silk hat on the table and sat down he looked very haggard and worn in that light very unlike the first citizen who had entered brampton in triumph on his return from the west not many months before the long strain of a long fight in which he had risked much for which he had labored a life to gain had told on him and there were crowsfeet at the corners of his eyes and dark circles under them isaac worthington had never lost before and to destroy the fruits of such a mans ambition is to destroy the man he was not as young as he had once been but now in the very hour of defeat hope had rekindled the fire in the eyes and brought back the peculiar tightlipped mocking smile to the mouth an hour ago when he had been pacing alexander duncans library the eyes and the mouth had been different  long habit asserts itself at the strangest moments jethro bass took his seat by the window and remained silent the clock tolled the halfhour after midnight  you wanted to see me said mr worthington finally  jethro nodded almost imperceptibly  i suppose said mr worthington slowly i suppose you are ready to sell out he found it a little difficult to control his voice  yes answered jethro rready to sell out  mr worthington was somewhat taken aback by this simple admission he glanced at jethro sitting motionless by the window and in his heart he feared him he had come into that room when the gas was low afraid although he would not confess it to himself he had been in fear of jethro bass all his life and his fear had been greater than ever since the march day when jethro had left coniston and could he have known now the fires of hatred burning in jethros breast isaac worthington would have been in terror indeed  what have you got to sell he demanded sharply  gguess you know or you wouldnt have come here  what proof have i that you have it to sell  jethro looked at him for an instant  mmy word he said  isaac worthington was silent for a while he was striving to calm himself for an indefinable something had shaken him the strange stillness of the hour and the stranger atmosphere which seemed to surround this transaction filled him with a nameless dread the man in the window had been his lifelong enemy more than this jethro bass was not like ordinary menhis ways were enshrouded in mystery and when he struck he struck hard there grew upon isaac worthington a sense that this midnight hour was in some way to be the culmination of the long years of hatred between them  he believed jethro he would have believed him even if mr flint had not informed him that afternoon that he was beaten and bitterly he wished he had taken mr flints advice many months before denunciation sprang to his lips which he dared not utter he was beaten and he must paythe pound of flesh isaac worthington almost thought it would be a pound of flesh  how much do you want he said  again jethro looked at him  bbiggest price you can pay he answered  you must have made up your mind what you want youve had time enough  hhave made up my mind said jethro  make your demand said mr worthington and ill give you my answer  bbiggest price you can pay said jethro again  mr worthingtons nerves could stand it no longer  look here he cried rising in his chair if youve brought me here to trifle with me youve made a mistake its your business to get control of things that belong to other people and sell them out i am here to buy nothing but necessity brings me here and nothing but necessity will keep me here a moment longer than i have to stay to finish this abominable affair i am ready to pay you twenty thousand dollars the day that bill becomes a law  this time jethro did not look at him  ppay me now he said  i will pay you the day the bill becomes a law then i shall know where i stand  jethro did not answer this ultimatum in any manner but remained perfectly still looking out of the window mr worthington glanced at him twice and got his fingers on the brim of his hat but he did not pick it up he stood so for a while knowing full well that if he went out of that room his chance was gone consolidation might come in other years but he isaac worthington would not be a factor in it  you dont want a check do you he said at last  noddont want a check  what in gods name do you want i havent got twenty thousand dollars in currency in my pocket  sit down isaac worthington said jethro  mr worthington sat downout of sheer astonishment perhaps  wwant the consolidationdont you want it baddont you  mr worthington did not answer jethro stood over him now looking down at him from the other side of the narrow table  know cynthy wetherell he said  then isaac worthington understood that his premonitions had been real the pound of flesh was to be demanded but strangely enough he did not yet comprehend the nature of it  i know that there is such a person he answered for his pride would not permit him to say more  wwhat do you know about her  isaac worthington was bitterly angrythe more so because he was helpless and could not question jethros right to ask what did he know about her nothing except that she had intrigued to marry his son bobs letter had described her to be sure but he could not be expected to believe that and he had not heard miss lucretia pennimans speech and yet he could not tell jethro that he knew nothing about her for he was shrewd enough to perceive the drift of the next question  knknow anything against her said jethro  mr worthington leaned back in his chair  i cant see what miss wetherell has to do with the present occasion he replied  hhad her dismissed by the prudential committee had her dismisseddidnt you  they chose to act as they saw fit  ttold levi dodd to dismiss herdidnt you  that was a matter of common knowledge in brampton having leaked out through jonathan hill  i must decline to discuss this said mr worthington  wwouldnt if i was you  what do you mean  what i say ttold levi dodd to dismiss her didnt you  yes i did isaac worthington had lost in selfesteem by not saying so before  why wahnt she honest wahnt she capable wahnt she a lady  i cant say that i know anything against miss wetherells character if thats what you mean  ffit to teachwahnt shefit to teach  i believe she has since qualified before mr errol  fit to teachwahnt fit to marry your sonwas she  isaac worthington clutched the table and started from his chair he grew white to his lips with anger and yet he knew that he must control himself  mr bass he said you have something to sell and i have something to buyif the price is not ruinous let us confine ourselves to that my affairs and my sons affairs are neither here nor there i ask you again how much do you want for this consolidation bill  nno money will buy it  what  cconsent to this marriage cconsent to this marriage there was yet room for isaac worthington to be amazed and for a while he stared up at jethro speechless  is that your price he asked at last  ththats my price said jethro  isaac worthington got up and went to the window and stood looking out above the black mass of trees at the dome outlined against the starflecked sky at first his anger choked him and he could not think he had just enough reason left not to walk out of the door but presently habit asserted itself in him too and he began to reflect and calculate in spite of his anger it is strange that memory plays so small a part in such a man before he allowed his mind to dwell on the fearful price he thought of his ambitions gratified and yet he did not think then of the woman to whom he had once confided those ambitionsthe woman who was the girls mother perhaps jethro was thinking of her  it may have beeni know notthat isaac worthington wondered at this revelation of the character of jethro bass for it was a revelation for this girls sake jethro was willing to forego his revenge was willing at the end of his days to allow the world to believe that he had sold out to his enemy or that he had been defeated by him  but when he thought of the marriage isaac worthington ground his teeth a certain sentiment which we may call pride was so strong in him that he felt ready to make almost any sacrifice to prevent it to hinder it he had quarrelled with his son and driven him away and threatened disinheritance the price was indeed heavythe heaviest he could pay but the alternativewas not that heavier to relinquish his dream of power to sink for a while into a crippled state for he had spent large sums and one of those periodical depressions had come in the business of the mills and those western investments were not looking so bright now  so with his hands opening and closing in front of him isaac worthington fought out his battle a terrible war that between ambition and pridea war to the knife the issue may yet have been undecided when he turned round to jethro with a sneer which he could not resist  why doesnt she marry him without my consent  in a moment mr worthington knew he had gone too far a certain kind of an eye is an incomparable weapon and armed men have been cowed by those who possess it though otherwise defenceless jethro bass had that kind of an eye  gguess you wouldnt understand if i was to tell you he said  mr worthington walked to the window again perhaps to compose himself and then came back again  your proposition is he said at length that if i give my consent to this marriage we are to have bixby and the governor and the consolidation bill will become a law is that it  ththats it said jethro taking his accustomed seat  and this consent is to be given when the bill becomes a law  given now ttonight  mr worthington took another turn as far as the door and suddenly came and stood before jethro  well i consent  jethro nodded toward the table  erpen and paper there he said  what do you want me to do demanded mr worthington  wwrite to bobwrite to cynthy nice letters  this is carrying matters with too high a hand mr bass i will write the letters tomorrow morning it was intolerable that he the first citizen of brampton should have to submit to such humiliation  write em now wwant to see em  but if i give you my word they will be written and sent to you tomorrow afternoon  ttoo late said jethro sit down and write em now  mr worthington went irresolutely to the table stood for a minute and dropped suddenly into the chair there he would have given anything except the realization of his ambitions to have marched out of the room and to have slammed the door behind him the letter paper and envelopes which jethro had bought stood in a little pile and mr worthington picked up the pen the clock struck two as he wrote the date as though to remind him that he had written it wrong if flint could see him now would flint guess would anybody guess he stared at the white paper and his rage came on again like a gust of wind and he felt that he would rather beg in the streets than write such a thing and yetand yet he sat there surely jethro bass must have known that he could have taken no more exquisite vengeance than this to compel a manand such a manto sit down in the white heat of passionand write two letters of forgiveness jethro sat by the window to all appearances oblivious to the tortures of his victim  he who has tried to write a notethe simplest note when his mind was harassed will understand something of isaac worthingtons sensations he would no sooner get an inkling of what his opening sentence was to be than the flames of his anger would rise and sweep it away he could not even decide which letter he was to write first to his son who had defied him and who the father knew in his heart condemned him or to the schoolteacher who was responsible for all his misery whomr worthington believedhad taken advantage of his sons youth by feminine wiles of no mean order so as to gain possession of him i can almost bring myself to pity the first citizen of brampton as he sits there with his pen poised over the paper and his enemy waiting to read those tender epistles of forgiveness which he has yet to write the clock has almost got round to the halfhour again and there is only the dateand a wrong one at that  my dear miss wetherellcircumstances over which i have no controlought he not to call her cynthia he has to make the letter credible in the eyes of the censor who sits by the window my dear miss wetherell i have come to the conclusiontwo sheets torn up or thrust into mr worthingtons pocket by this time words have begun to have a colorless look my dear miss wetherellhaving become convinced of the sincere attachment which my son robert has for you i am writing him tonight to give my full consent to his marriage he has given me to understand that you have hitherto persistently refused to accept him because i have withheld that consent and i take this opportunity of expressing my admiration of this praiseworthy resolution on your part if this be irony it is sublime perhaps isaac worthington has a little of the artist in him and now that he is in the heat of creation has forgotten the circumstances under which he is composing my sons happiness and career in life are of such moment to me that until the present i could not give my sanction to what i at first regarded as a youthful fancy now that my son for your sake has shown his determination and ability to make his own way in the world isaac worthington was not a little proud of this i have determined that it is wise to withdraw my opposition and to recall robert to his proper place which is near me i am sure that my feelings in this matter will be clear to you and that you will look with indulgence upon any acts of mine which sprang from a natural solicitation for the welfare and happiness of my only child i shall be in brampton in a day or two and i shall at once give myself the pleasure of calling on you sincerely yours isaac d worthington  perhaps a little formal and pompous for some people but an admirable and conciliatory letter for the first citizen of brampton written under such trying circumstances with i know not how many erasures and false starts it is little short of a marvel in art neither too much said nor too little for a relenting parent of mr worthingtons character and i doubt whether talleyrand or napoleon or even machiavelli himself could have surpassed it the second letter now that mr worthington had got into the swing was more easily written my dear robert it said i have made up my mind to give my consent to your marriage to miss wetherell and i am ready to welcome you home where i trust i shall see you shortly i have not been unimpressed by the determined manner in which you have gone to work for yourself but i believe that your place is in brampton where i trust you will show the same energy in learning to succeed me in the business which i have founded there as you have exhibited in mr brokes works affectionately your father  a very creditable and handsome letter for a forgiving father when mr worthington had finished it and had addressed both the envelopes his shame and vexation had curious to relate very considerably abated not to go too deeply into the somewhat contradictory mental and cardiac processes of mr worthington he had somehow tricked himself by that magic exercise of wielding his pen into thinking that he was doing a noble and generous action into believing that in the course of a very few daysor weeks at the most he would have recalled his erring son and have given cynthia his blessing he would he told himself have been forced eventually to yield when that paragon of inflexibility bob dictated terms to him at the head of the locomotive works better let the generosity be on his mr worthingtons side at all events victory had never been bought more cheaply humiliation in mr worthingtons eyes had an element of publicity in it and this episode had had none of that element and jethro bass moreover was a highwayman who had held a pistol to his head in such logical manner he gradually bolstered up again his habitual poise and dignity next week at the latest men would point to him as the head of the largest railroad interests in the state  he pushed back his chair and rose merely indicating the result of his labors by a wave of his hand and he stood in the window as jethro bass got up and went to the table i would that i had a pen able to describe jethros sensations when he read them unfortunately he is a man with few facial expressions but i believe that he was artist enough himself to appreciate the perfections of the first citizens efforts after a much longer interval than was necessary for their perusal mr worthington turned  gguess theyll do said jethro as he folded them up he was too generous not to indulge for once in a little welldeserved praise haint underdone it and haint overdone it a mite hev you mman of resource callate you couldnt hev beat that if you was to take a week to it  i think it only fair to tell you said mr worthington picking up his silk hat that in those letters i have merely anticipated a very little my intentions in the matter my son having proved his earnestness i was about to consent to the marriage of my own accord  ggoin to do it anywaywas you  i had so determined  aalways thought you was highminded said jethro  mr worthington was on the point of giving a tart reply to this but restrained himself  then i may look upon the matter as settled he said the consolidation bill is to become a law  yes said jethro youll get your bill mr worthington had got his hand on the knob of the door when jethro stopped him with a word he had no facial expressions but he had an eye as we have seenan eye that for the second time appeared terrible to his visitor isaac worthington he said aact up to it no trickeryor look outlook out  then the incident being closed so far as he was concerned jethro went back to his chair by the window but it is to be recorded that isaac worthington did not answer him immediately then he said  you seem to forget that you are talking to a gentleman  thats so answered jethro so you be  he sat where he was long after the sky had whitened and the stars had changed from gold to silver and gone out and the sunlight had begun to glance upon the green leaves of the park perhaps he was thinking of the life he had lived which was spent now of the men he had ruled of the victories he had gained from that place which would know him no more he had won the last and the greatest of his victories there compared to which the others had indeed been as vanities perhaps he looked back over the highway of his life and thought of the woman whom he had loved and wondered what it had been if she had trod it by his side who will judge him he had been what he had been and as the era was so was he verily one generation passeth away and another generation cometh  when mr isaac worthington arrived at mr duncans house where he was staying at three oclock in the morning he saw to his surprise light from the library windows lying in bars across the lawn under the trees he found mr duncan in that room with somers his son who had just returned from a seaside place and they were discussing a very grave event miss janet duncan had that day eloped with a gentleman whoto judge from the photograph somers heldwas both handsome and romanticlooking he had long hair and burning eyes and a title not to be then verified and he owned a castle near some place on the peninsula of italy not on the map     chapter xix  we are back in brampton owning as we do an annual pass over the truro railroad cynthia has been there all the summer and as it is now the first of september her school has begun again i do not by any means intend to imply that brampton is not a pleasant place to spend the summer the number of its annual visitors is a refutation of that but to cynthia the season had been one of great unhappiness several times lem hallowell had stopped the stage in front of ephraims house to beg her to go to coniston and mr satterlee had come himself but she could not have borne to be there without jethro nor would she go to boston though urged by miss lucretia and mrs merrill and the girls had implored her to join them at a seaside place on the cape  cynthia had made a little garden behind ephraims house and she spent the summer there with her flowers and her books many of which lem had fetched from coniston ephraim loved to sit there of an evening and smoke his pipe and chat with ezra graves and the neighbors who dropped in among these were mr gamaliel ives who talked literature with cynthia and lucy baird his wife who had taken cynthia under her wing i wish i had time to write about lucy baird and mr jonathan hill camehis mortgage not having been foreclosed after all when cynthia was alone with ephraim she often read to himgenerally from books of a martial flavorand listened with an admirable hypocrisy to certain narratives which he was in the habit of telling  they never spoke of jethro ephraim was not a casuist and his sense of right and wrong came largely through his affections it is safe to say that he never made an analysis of the sorrow which he knew was afflicting the girl but he had had a general and most sympathetic understanding of it ever since the time when jethro had gone back to the capital and ephraim never brought home his guardian or his clarion now but read them at the office that their contents might not disturb her  no wonder that cynthia was unhappy the letters came almost every day with the postmark of the town in new jersey where mr brokes locomotive works were and she answered them now but oh how scrupulously though not every day if the waters of love rose up through the grains of sand it was at least not cynthias fault hers were the letters of a friend she was reading such and such a bookhad he read it and he must not work too hard how could her letters be otherwise when jethro bass her benefactor was at the capital working to defeat and perhaps to ruin bobs father when bobs father had insulted and persecuted her she ought not to have written at all but the lapses of such a heroine are very rare and very dear  yes cynthias life was very bitter that summer with but little hope on the horizon of it her thoughts were divided between bob and jethro many a night she lay awake resolving to write to jethro even to go to him but when morning came she could not bring herself to do so i do not think it was because she feared that he might believe her appeal would be made in behalf of bobs father knowing jethro as she did she felt that it would be useless and she could not bear to make it in vain if the memory of that evening in the tannery shed would not serve nothing would serve and againhe had gone to avenge her  it was inevitable that she should hear tidings from the capital isaac worthingtons own town was ringing with it and as week after week of that interminable session went by the conviction slowly grew upon brampton that its first citizen had been beaten by jethro bass something of mr worthingtons affairs was known the mills for instance were not being run to their full capacity and then had come the definite news that mr worthington was beaten a local representative having arrived straight from the rotunda cynthia overheard lem hallowell telling it to ephraim and she could not for the life of her help rejoicing though she despised herself for it isaac worthington was humbled now and jethro had humbled him to avenge her despite her grief over his return to that life there was something to compel her awe and admiration in the way he had risen and done this thing after men had fallen from him her mother had had something of these same feelings without knowing why  people who had nothing but praise for him before were saying hard things about isaac worthington that night when the baron is defeated the serfs come out of their holes in the castle rock and fling their curses across the moat cynthia slept but little and was glad when the day came to take her to her scholars to ease her mind of the thoughts which tortured it  and then when she stopped at the postoffice to speak to ephraim on her way homeward in the afternoon she heard men talking behind the partition and she stood as one stricken listening beside the window other tidings had come in the shape of a telegram the first rumor had been false brampton had not yet received the details but the consolidation bill had gone into the house that morning and would be a law before the week was out a part of it was incomprehensible to cynthia but so much she had understood she did not wait to speak to ephraim and she was going out again when a man rushed past her and through the partition door cynthia paused instinctively for she recognized him as one of the frequenters of the station and a bearer of news  jethros come home boys he shouted come in on the four oclock and went right off to coniston guess hes done for this time for certain looks it by godfrey he looks eighty callate his days over from the way the boys talked on the train  cynthia lingered to hear no more and went out dazed into the september sunshine jethro beaten and broken and gone to coniston resolution came to her as she walked arriving home she wrote a little note and left it on the table for ephraim and going out again ran by the back lane to mr shermans livery stable behind the brampton house and in half an hour was driving along that familiar road to coniston alone for she had often driven jethros horses and knew every turn of the way and as she gazed at the purple mountain through the haze and drank in the sweet scents of the years fulness she was strangely happy there was the village green in the cool evening light and the flagstaff with its tip silvered by the departing sun she waved to rias and lem and moses at the store but she drove on to the tannery house and hitched the horse at the rough granite post and went in and through the house softly to the kitchen  jethro was standing in the doorway and did not turn he may have thought she was millicent skinner cynthia could see his face it was older indeed and lined and worn but that fearful look of desolation which she had once surprised upon it and which she in that instant feared to see was not there jethros soul was at peace though cynthia could not understand why it was so she stole to him and flung her arms about his neck and with a cry he seized her and held her against him for i know not how long had it been possible to have held her there always he would never have let her go at last he looked down into her tearwet face into her eyes that were shining with tears  ddone wrong cynthy  cynthia did not answer that for she remembered how she too had exulted when she had believed him to have accomplished isaac worthingtons downfall now that he had failed and she was in his arms it was not for her to judgeonly to rejoice  didnt look for you to come backdidnt expect it  uncle jethro she faltered love for her had made him go and she would not say that either  ddont hate me cynthydont hate me  she shook her head  love mea little  she reached up her hands and brushed back his hair tenderly from his forehead sucha loving gesture was her answer  you are going to stay here always now she said in a low voice you are never going away again  ggoin to stay always he answered perhaps he was thinking of the hillside clearing in the forestwho knows youll comesometime cynthysometime  ill come every saturday and sunday uncle jethro she said smiling up at him saturday is only two days away now i can hardly wait  yyoull come sometime  uncle jethro do you think ill be away from you exceptexcept when i have to  ccome and read to mewont youcome and read  of course i will  ccall to mind the first book you read to me cynthy  it was robinson crusoe she said  rrobinson crusoe often thought of that book know some of it by heart rread it again sometime cynthy  she looked up at him a little anxiously his eyes were on the great hill opposite across coniston water  i will indeed uncle jethro if we can find it she answered  guess i can find it said jethro rremember when you saw him makin a ship  yes said cynthia and i had my feet in the pool  the book had made a profound impression upon jethro partly because cynthia had first read it to him and partly for another reason the isolation of crusoe depicted by defoes genius had been comparable to his own isolation and he had pondered upon it much of late yes and upon a certain part of another book which he had read earlier in life napoleon had ended his days on st helena  they walked out under the trees to the brookside and stood listening to the tinkling of the cowbells in the wood lot beyond the light faded early on these september evenings and the smoky mist had begun to rise from the water when they turned back again the kitchen windows were already growing yellow and through them the faithful millicent could be seen bustling about in her preparations for supper but cynthia having accomplished her errand would not go in she could not have borne to have any one drive back with her to brampton then and she must not be late upon the road  i will come friday evening uncle jethro she said as she kissed him and gave one last lingering look at his face had it been possible she would not have left him and on her way to brampton through the gathering darkness she mused anxiously upon that strange calmness he had shown after defeat  she drove her horse on to the floor of mr shermans stable that gentleman himself gallantly assisting her to alight and walked homeward through the lane ephraim had not yet returned from the postoffice which did not close until eight and cynthia smiled when she saw the utensils of his cookingkit strewn on the hearth in her absence he invariably unpacked and used it and of course cynthia at once set herself to cleaning and packing it again after that she got her own suppera very simple affairand was putting the sitting room to rights when ephraim came thumping in  well i swan he exclaimed when he saw her i didnt look for you to come back so soon cynthy put up the kithev you he stood in front of the fireplace staring with apparent interest at the place where the kit had been and added in a voice which he strove to make quite casual how be jethro  he looks older cousin eph she answered after a pause and i think he is very tired but he seems he seems more tranquil and contented than i hoped to find him  i want to know said ephraim i am glad to hear it glad you went up cynthyyou done right to go  id have gone with you if youd only told me ill git a chance to go up sunday  there was an air of repressed excitement about the veteran which did not escape cynthia he held two letters in his hand and being a postmaster he knew the handwriting on both one had come from that place in new jersey and drew no comment but the other that one had been postmarked at the capital and as he had sat at his counter at the postoffice waiting for closing time he had turned it over and over with many ejaculations and futile guesses past master of dissimulation that he was he had made up his mindif he should find cynthia at hometo lay the letters indifferently on the table and walk into his bedroom this campaign he now proceeded to carry out  cynthia smiled again when he was gone and shook her head and picked up the letters bobs was uppermost and she read that first without a thought of the other one and she smiled as she read for bob had had a promotion he was not yet at the head of the locomotive works he hastened to add for fear that cynthia might think that mr broke had resigned the presidency in his favor and cynthia never failed to laugh at these little facetious asides he was now earning the princely sum of ninety dollars a monthnot enough to marry on alas on saturday nights he and percy broke scrubbed as much as possible of the grime from their hands and faces and went to spend sunday at elberon the broke place on the hudson from whence miss sally broke if she happened to be at home always sent cynthia her love as cynthia is still a heroine i shall not describe how she felt about sally brokes love there was plenty of bobs own in the letter cynthia would got have blamed him if he bad fallen in love with miss broke it seemed to her little short of miraculous that amidst such surroundings he could be true to her  after a period which was no briefer than that usually occupied by bobs letters cynthia took the other one from her lap and stared at it in much perplexity before she tore it open we have seen its contents over mr worthingtons shoulder and our hearts will not stop beatingas cynthias did she read it twice before the full meaning of it came to her and after that she could not well mistake itthe language being so admirable in every way she sat very still for a long while and presently she heard ephraim go out but cynthia did not move mr worthington relented and bob recalled the vista of happiness suddenly opened up widened and widened until it was too bright for cynthias vision and she would compel her mind to dwell on another prospectthat of the father and son reconciled although her temples throbbed she tried to analyze the letter it implied that mr worthington had allowed bob to remain away on a sort of probation it implied that it had been dictated by a strong paternal love mingled with a strong paternal justice and then there was the appeal to her you will look with indulgence upon any acts of mine which sprang from a natural solicitation for the welfare and happiness of my only child a terrible insight is theirs to whom it is given to love as cynthia loved  suddenly there came a knock which frightened her for her mind was running on swiftly from point to point had indeed flown as far as coniston by now and she was thinking of that strange look of peace on jethros face which had troubled her one letter she thrust into her dress but the other she laid aside and her knees trembled under her as she rose and went into the entry and raised the latch and opened the door there was a moon and the figure in the frock coat and the silk hat was the one which she expected to see the silk hat came off very promptly  i hope i am not disturbing you miss wetherell said the owner of it  no answered cynthia faintly  may i come in  cynthia held open the door a little wider and mr worthington walked in he seemed very majestic and out of place in the little house which gabriel post had built and he carried into it some of the atmosphere of the walnut and high ceilings of his own mansion his manner of laying his hat bottom up on the table and of unbuttoning his coat subtly indicated the honor which he was conferring upon the place and he eyed cynthia standing before him in the lamplight with a modification of the hawklike look which was meant to be at once condescending and conciliatory he did not imprint a kiss upon her brow as some prospective fathersinlaw would have done but his eyes perhaps involuntarily paid a tribute to her personal appearance which heightened her color she might not after all be such a discredit to the worthington family  wont you sit down she asked  thank you cynthia he said i hope i may now be allowed to call you cynthia  she did not answer him but sat down herself and he followed her example with his eyes still upon her  you have doubtless received my letter began mr worthington i only arrived in brampton an hour ago but i thought it best to come to you at once under the circumstances  yes replied cynthia i received the letter  i am glad said mr worthington he was beginning to be a little taken aback by her calmness and her apparent absence of joy it was scarcely the way in which a schoolteacher should receive the advances of the first citizen come to give a gracious consent to her marriage with his son had he known it cynthia was anything but calm i am glad he said because i took pains to explain the exact situation in that letter and to set forth my own sentiments i hope you understood them  yes i understood them said cynthia in a low tone  this was enigmatical to say the least but mr worthington had come with such praiseworthy intentions that he was disposed to believe that the girl was overwhelmed by the good fortune which had suddenly overtaken her he was therefore disposed to be a little conciliatory  my conduct may have appeared harsh to you he continued i will not deny that i opposed the matter at first robert was still in college and he has a generous impressionable nature which he inherits from his poor motherthe kind of nature likely to commit a rash act which would ruin his career i have since become convinced that he hasaheminherited likewise a determination of purpose and an ability to get on in the world which i confess i had underestimated my friend mr broke has written me a letter about him and tells me that he has already promoted him  yes said cynthia  you hear from him inquired mr worthington giving her a quick glance  yes said cynthia her color rising a little  and yet said mr worthington slowly i have been under the impression that you have persistently refused to marry him  that is true she answered  i cannot refrain from complimenting you cynthia upon such rare conduct said he you will be glad to know that it has contributed more than anything else toward my estimation of your character and has strengthened me in my resolution that i am now doing right it may be difficult for you to understand a fathers feelings the complete separation from my only son was telling on me severely and i could not forget that you were the cause of that separation i knew nothing about you except he hesitated for she had turned to him  except what she asked  mr worthington coughed mr flint had told him that very morning of her separation from jethro and of the reasons which people believed had caused it unfortunately we have not time to go into that conversation with mr flint who had given a very good account of cynthia indeed after all mr worthington reflected he had consented to the marriage and there was no use in bringing jethros name into the conversation jethro would be forgotten soon  i will not deny to you that i had other plans for my son he said i had hoped that he would marry a daughter of a friend of mine you must be a little indulgent with parents cynthia he added with a little smile we have our castles in the air too sometimes as in this case by a wise provision of providence they go astray i suppose you have heard of miss duncans marriage  no said cynthia  she ran off with a worthless italian nobleman i believe on the whole he said with what was an extreme complaisance for the first citizen that i have reason to congratulate myself upon roberts choice i have made inquiries about you and i find that i have had the pleasure of knowing your mother whom i respected very much and your father i understand came of very good people and was forced by circumstances to adopt the means of livelihood he did my attention has been called to the letters he wrote to the guardian which i hear have been highly praised by competent critics and i have ordered a set of them for the files of the library you yourself i find are highly thought of in brampton a not unimportant factor by the way you have been splendidly educated and are a lady in short cynthia i have come to give my formal consent to your engagement to my son robert  but i am not engaged to him said cynthia  he will be here shortly i imagine said mr worthington  cynthia was trembling more than ever by this time she was very angry and she had found it very difficult to repress the things which she had been impelled to speak she did not hate isaac worthington nowshe despised him he had not dared to mention jethro who had been her benefactor though he had done his best to have her removed from the school because of her connection with jethro  mr worthington she said i have not yet made up my mind whether i shall marry your son  to say that mr worthingtons breath was taken away when he heard these words would be to use a mild expression he doubted his senses  what he exclaimed starting forward what do you mean  cynthia hesitated a moment she was not frightened but she was trying to choose her words without passion  i refused to marry him she said because you withheld your consent and i did not wish to be the cause of a quarrel between you it was not difficult to guess your feelings toward me even before certain things occurred of which i will not speak i did my best from the very first to make bob give up the thought of marrying me although i loved and honored him loving him as i do i do not want to be the cause of separating him from his father and of depriving him of that which is rightfully his but something was due to myself if i should ever make up my mind to marry him continued cynthia looking at mr worthington steadfastly it will not be because your consent is given or withheld  do you tell me this to my face exclaimed mr worthington now in a rage himself at such unheardof presumption  to your face said cynthia who got more selfcontrolled as he grew angry i believe that that consent which you say you have given freely was wrung from you  it was unfortunate that the first citizen might not always have mr flint by him to restrain and caution him but mr flint could have no command over his masters sensations and anger and apprehension goaded mr worthington to indiscretion  jethro bass told you this he cried out  no cynthia answered not in the least surprised by the admission he did not tell mebut he will if i ask him i guessed it from your letter i heard that he had come back today and i went to coniston to see him and he told mehe had been defeated  tears came into her eyes at the remembrance of the scene in the tannery house that afternoon and she knew now why jethros face had worn that look of peace he had made his supreme sacrificefor her no he had told her nothing and she might never have known she sat thinking of the magnitude of this thing jethro had done and she ceased to speak and the tears coursed down her cheeks unheeded  isaac worthington had a habit of clutching things when he was in a rage and now he clutched the arms of the chair he had grown white he was furious with her furious with himself for having spoken that which might be construed into a confession he had not finished writing the letters before he had stood selfjustified and he had been selfjustified ever since where now were these arguments so wonderfully plausible where were the refutations which he had made ready in case of a barely possible need he had gone into the pelican house intending to tell jethro of his determination to agree to the marriage that was one he had done sothat was anotherand he had written the letters that jethro might be convinced of his good will there were still more involving jethros character for veracity and other things summoning these he waited for cynthia to have done speaking but when she had finishedhe said nothing he looked a her and saw the tears on her face and he saw that she had completely forgotten his presence  for the life of him isaac worthington could not utter a word he was a man as we know who did not talk idly and he knew that cynthia would not hear what he said and arguments and denunciations lose their effect when repeated again he knew that she would not believe him never in his life had isaac worthington been so ignored so put to shame as by this schoolteacher of brampton before selfesteem and sophistry had always carried him off between them sometimes in truth with a woundthe wound had always healed but he had a feeling tonight that this woman had glanced into his soul and had turned away from it as he looked at her the texture of his anger changed he forgot for the first time that which he had been pleased to think of as her position in life and he feared her he had matched his spirit against hers  before long the situation became intolerable to him for cynthia still sat silent she was thinking of how she had blamed jethro for going back to that life even though his love for her had made him do it but isaac worthington did not know of what she was thinkinghe thought only of himself and his predicament he could not remain and yet he could not gowith dignity he who had come to bestow could not depart like a whipped dog  suddenly a fear transfixed him suppose that this woman from whom he could not hide the truth should tell his son what he had done bob would believe her could he isaac worthington humble his pride and ask her to keep her suspicions to herself he would then be acknowledging that they were more than suspicions if he did so he would have to appear to forgive her in spite of what she had said to him and bob was coming home could he tell bob that he had changed his mind and withdrawn his consent to the marriage there world be the reason and again bob would believe her and again if he withdrew his consent there was jethro to reckon with jethro must have a weapon still mr worthington thought although he could not imagine what it might be as isaac worthington sat there thinking it grew clear to him at last that there was but one exit out of a very desperate situation  he glanced at cynthia again this time appraisingly she had dried her eyes but she made no effort to speak after all she would make such a wife for his son as few men possessed he thought of sarah hollingsworth she had been a good woman but there had been many times when he had deploredespecially in his travels the lack of other qualities in his wife cynthia he thought had these qualitiesso necessary for the wife of one who would succeed to powerthough whence she had got them isaac worthington could not imagine she would become a personage she was a woman of whom they had no need to be ashamed at home or abroad having completed these reflections he broke the silence  i am sorry that you should have been misled into thinking such a thing as you have expressed cynthia he said but i believe that i can understand something of the feelings which prompted you it is natural that you should have a resentment against me after everything that has happened it is perhaps natural too that i should lose my temper under the circumstances let us forget it and i trust that in the future we shall grow into the mutual respect and affection which our nearer relationship will demand  he rose and took up his hat and cynthia rose too there was something very fine he thought about her carriage and expression as she stood in front of him  there is my hand he saidwill you take it  i will take it cynthia answered because you are bobs father  and then mr worthington went away     chapter xx  i am able to cite one notable instance at least to disprove the saying a part of which is written above and i have yet to hear of a case in which a gentleman ever hesitated a single instant on account of the first letter of a ladys last name i know indeed of an occasion when locomotives could not go fast enough when thirty miles an hour seemed a snails pace to a young main who sat by the open window of a train that crept northward on a certain hazy september morning up the beautiful valley of a broad river which we know  it was after three oclock before he caught sight of the familiar crest of farewell mountain and the train ran into harwich how glad he was to see everybody there whether he knew them or not he came near hugging the conductor of the truro accommodation who needless to say did not ask him for a ticket or even a pass and then the young man went forward and almost shook the arms off of the engineer and the fireman and climbed into the cab and actually drove the engine himself as far as brampton where it arrived somewhat ahead of schedule having taken some of the curves and bridges at a speed a little beyond the law the engineer was richer by five dollars and the son of a railroad president is a privileged character anyway  yes here was brampton and in spite of the haze the sun had never shone so brightly on the terraced steeple of the meetinghouse he leaped out of the cab almost before the engine had stopped and beamed upon everybody on the platformeven upon mr dodd who chanced to be there in a twinkling the young man is in mr shermans hack and mr sherman galloping his horse down brampton street the young man with his head out of the window smiling grinning would be a better word here are the iron mastiffs and they seem to be grinning too the young man flings open the carriage door and leaps out and the door is almost broken from its hinges by the maple tree he rushes up the steps and through the hall and into the library where the first citizen and his seneschal are sitting  hello father you see i didnt waste any time he cried grasping his fathers hand in a grip that made mr worthington wince well you are a trump after all were both a little hotheaded i guess and do things were sorry forbut thats all over now isnt it im sorry i might have known youd come round when you found out for yourself what kind of a girl cynthia was did you ever see anybody like her  mr flint turned his back and started to walk out of the room  dont go flint old boy bob called out seizing mr flints hand too i cant stay but a minute now how are you  all right bob answered mr flint with a curious kindly look in his eyes that was not often there im glad to see you home i have to go to the bank  well father said bob school must be out and i imagine you know where im going i just thought id stop in toto thank you and get a benediction  i am very happy to have you back robert replied mr worthington and it was true it would have been strange indeed if some tremor of sentiment had not been in his voice and some gleam of pride in his eye as he looked upon his son  so you saw her and couldnt resist her said bob wasnt that how it happened  mr worthington sat down again at the desk and his hand began to stray among the papers he was thinking of mr flints exit  i do not arrive at my decisions quite in that way robert he answered  but you have seen her  yes i have seen her  there was a hesitation an uneasiness in his fathers tone for which bob could not account and which he attributed to emotion he did not guess that this hour of supreme joy could hold for isaac worthington another sensation  isnt she the finest girl in the world he demanded how does she seem how does she look  she looks extremely well said mr worthington who had now schooled his voice in fact i am quite ready to admit that cynthia wetherell possesses the qualifications necessary for your wife if she had not i should never have written you  bob walked to the window  father he said speaking with a little difficulty i cant tell you how much i appreciate youryour coming round i wanted to do the right thing but i just couldnt give up such a girl as that  we shall let bygones be bygones robert answered mr worthington clearing his throat  she never would have me without your consent by the way he cried turning suddenly did she say shed have me now  i believe said mr worthington clearing his throat again i believe she reserved her decision  i must be off said bob she goes to coniston on fridays ill drive her out goodby father  he flew out of the room ran into mrs holden whom he astonished by saluting on the cheek and astonished even more by asking her to tell silas to drive his black horses to gabriel posts houseas the cottage was still known in brampton and having hastily removed some of the cinders he flew out of the door and reached the parklike space in the middle of brampton street then he tried to walk decorously but it was hard work what if she should not be in  the door and windows of the little house were open that balmy afternoon and the bees were buzzing among the flowers which cynthia had planted on either side of the step bob went up the path and caught a glimpse of her through the entry standing in the sitting room she was indeed waiting for the coniston stage and she did not see him shall i destroy the mental image of the reader who has known her so long by trying to tell what she looked like some heroines grow thin and worn by the troubles which they are forced to go through cynthia was not this kind of a heroine she was neither tall nor short and the dark blue gown which she wore set off so bob thought the curves of her figure to perfection her face had become a little more graveyes and more noble and the eyes and mouth had an indescribable womanly sweetness  he stood for a moment outside the doorway gazing at her hesitating to desecrate that revery which seemed to him to have a touch of sadness in it and then she turned her head slowly and saw him and her lips parted and a startled look came into her eyes but she did not move he came quickly into the room and stopped again quivering from head to foot with the passion which the sight of her never failed to unloose within him still she did not speak but her lip trembled and the love leaping in his eyes kindled a yearning in hersa yearning she was powerless to resist he may by that strange power have drawn her toward himhe never knew neither of them could have given evidence on that marvellous instant when the current bridged the space between them he could not say whether this woman whom he had seized by force before had shown alike vitality in her surrender he only knew that her arms were woven about his neck and that the kiss of which he had dreamed was again on his lips and that he felt once more her wonderful supple body pressed against his and her heart beating and her breast heaving and he knew that the strength of the love in her which he had gained was beyond estimation  thus for a time they swung together in ethereal space breathless with the motion of their flight the duration of such moments isin wordslimitless now he held her against him and again he held her away that his eyes might feast upon hers until she dropped her lashes and the crimson tide flooded into her face and she hid it again in the refuge she had longed formurmuring his name but at last startled by some sound without and so brought back to earth she led him gently to the window at the side and looked up at him searchingly he was tanned no longer  i was afraid you had been working too hard she said  so you do love me was bobs answer to this remark  cynthia smiled at him with her eyes gravely if such a thing may be said of a smile  bob how can you ask  oh cynthia he cried if you knew what i have been through you wouldnt have held out i know it i began to think i should never have you  but you have me now she said and was silent  why do you look like that he asked  she smiled up at him again  i too have suffered bob she said and i have thought of you night and day  god bless you sweetheart he cried and kissed her againmany times its all right now isnt it i knew my father would give his consent when he found out what you were  the expression of pain which had troubled him crossed her face again and she put her hand on his shoulder  listen dearest she said i love you i am doing this for you you must understand that  why yes cynthia i understand itof course i do he answered perplexed i understand it but i dont deserve it  i want you to know she continued in a low voice that i should have married you anyway ii could not have helped it  cynthia  if you were to go back to the locomotive works tomorrow i would marry you  on ninety dollars a month exclaimed bob  if you wanted me she said  wanted you i could live in a log cabin with you the rest of my life  she drew down his face to hers and kissed him  but i wished you to be reconciled with your father she said i could not bear to come between you youyou are reconciled arent you  indeed we are he said  i am glad bob she answered simply i should not have been happy if i had driven you away from the place where you should be which is your home  wherever you are will be my home sweetheart he said and pressed her to him once more  at length looking past his shoulder into the street she saw lem hallowell pulling up the brampton stage before the door  bob she said i must go to coniston and see uncle jethro i promised him  bobs answer was to walk into the entry where he stood waving the most joyous of greetings at the surprised stage driver  i guess you wont get anybody here lem he called out  but bob protested cynthia from within afraid to show her face just then i have to go i promised andand i want to go she added when he turned  im running a stage to coniston today myself lem said he and im going to steal your best passenger  lemuel immediately flung down his reins and jumped out of the stage and came up the path and into the entry where he stood confronting cynthia  hev you took him cynthy he demanded  yes lem she answered wont you congratulate me  the warmhearted stage driver did congratulate her in a most unmistakable manner  i think a sight of her bob he said after he had shaken both of bobs hands and brushed his own eyes with his coat sleeve ive knowed her so long whereupon utterance failed him and he ran down the path and jumped into his stage again and drove off  and then cynthia sent bob on an errandnot a very long one and while he was gone she sat down at the table and tried to realize her happiness and failed in less than ten minutes bob had come back with cousin ephraim as fast as he could hobble he flung his arms around her stick and all and he was crying it is a fact that old soldiers sometimes cry but his tears did not choke his utterance  great tecumseh said cousin ephraim so youve went and done it cynthy siege got a little mite too hot i callated shed capitulate in the end but she held out uncommon long  that she did exclaimed bob feelingly  ii was tellin bob i haint got nothin against him continued ephraim  oh cousin eph said cynthia laughing in spite of herself and glancing at bob is that all you can say  cousin ephs all right said bob laughing too we understand each other  callate we do answered ephraim ill go so far as to say there haint nobody id ruther see you marry guess ill hev to go back to the kit now whats to become of the old pensioner cynthy  the old pensioner neednt worry said cynthia  then drove up silas the silent with bobs buggy and his black trotters all of brampton might see them now and all of brampton did see them silas got outhis presence not being requiredand cynthia was helped in and bob got in beside her and away they went leaving ephraim waving his stick after them from the doorstep  it is recorded against the black trotters that they made very poor time to coniston that day though i cannot discover that either of them was lame lem hallowell who was there nearly an hour ahead of them declares that the off horse had a bunch of branches in his mouth perhaps bob held them in on account of the scenery that september afternoon incomparable scenery i doubt if two lovers of the renaissance ever wandered through a more wondrous realm of pleasanceto quote the words of the poet spots in it are like a park laid out by that peerless landscape gardener nature dark symmetrical pine trees on the sward and maples in the fulness of their leaf and great oaks on the hillsides and coppices and beyond the mountain the evergreens massed like cloudshadows on its slopes and alltrees and coppice and mountainflattened by the haze until they seemed woven in the softest of blues and blue greens into one exquisite picture of an ancient tapestry i myself have seen these pictures in that country and marvelled  so they drove on through that realm which was to be their realm and came all too soon to coniston green lem hallowell had spread the wellnigh incredible news that cynthia wetherell was to marry the son of the millowner and railroad president of brampton and it seemed to cynthia that every man and woman and child of the village was gathered at the store although she loved them every one she whispered something to bob when she caught sight of that group on the platform and he spoke to the trotters thus it happened that they flew by and were at the tannery house before they knew it and cynthia all unaided sprang out of the buggy and ran in alone she found jethro sitting outside of the kitchen door with a volume on his knee and she saw that the print of it was large and she knew that the book was robinson crusoe  cynthia knelt down on the grass beside him and caught his hands in hers  uncle jethro she said i am going to marry bob worthington  yes cynthy he answered and taking the initiative for the first time in his life he stooped down and kissed her  i knewyou would be happyin my happiness she said the tears brimming in her eyes  nnever have been so happy cynthynever have  uncle jethro i never will desert you i shall always take care of you  rread to me sometimes cynthyrread to me  but she could not answer him she was sobbing on the pages of that book he had given herlong ago  i like to dwell on happiness and i am reluctant to leave these people whom i have grown to love jethro bass lived to take cynthias children down by the brook and to show them the pictures at least in that wonderful edition of robinson crusoe he would never depart from the tannery house but cynthia went to him there many times a week there is a spot not far from the coniston road and five miles distant alike from brampton and coniston where bob worthington built his house and where he and cynthia dwelt many years and they go there to this day in the summertime it stands in the midst of broad lands and the ground in front of it slopes down to coniston water artificially widened here by a stone dam into a little lake from the balcony of the summerhouse which overhangs the lake there is a wonderful view of coniston mountain and cynthia worthington often sits there with her sewing or her book listening to the laughter of her children and thinking sometimes of bygone days     afterword  the reality of the foregoing pages has to the author at least become so vivid that he regrets the necessity of having to add an afterword every novel is to some extent a compound of truth and fiction and he has done his best to picture conditions as they were and to make the spirit of his book true certain people who were living in st louis during the civil war have been mentioned as the originals of characters in the crisis and there are houses in that city which have been pointed out as fitting descriptions in that novel an author has frequently people houses and localities in mind when he writes but he changes them sometimes very materially in the process of literary construction  it is inevitable perhaps that many people of a certain new england state will recognize jethro bass there are different opinions extant concerning the remarkable original of this character ardent defenders and detractors of his are still living but all agree that he was a strange man of great power the author disclaims any intention of writing a biography of him some of the things set down in this book he did and others he did not do some of the anecdotes here related concerning him are in the main true and for this material the author acknowledges his indebtedness particularly to colonel thomas b cheney of ashland new hampshire and to other friends who have helped him jethro bass was typical of his era and it is of the era that this book attempts to treat  concerning the locality where jethro bass was born and lived it will and will not be recognized it would have been the extreme of bad taste to have put into these pages any portraits which might have offended families or individuals and in order that it may be known that the author has not done so he has written this afterword nor has he particularly chosen for the field of this novel a state of which he is a citizen and for which he has a sincere affection the conditions here depicted while retaining the characteristics of the locality he believes to be typical of the era over a large part of the united states  many of the puritans who came to new england were impelled to emigrate from the old country no doubt by an aversion to pulling the forelock as well as by religious principles and the spirit of these men prevailed for a certain time after the revolution was fought such men lived and ruled in coniston before the rise of jethro bass  selfexamination is necessary for the moral health of nations as well as men and it is the most hopeful of signs that in the united states we are today going through a period of selfexamination  we shall do well to ascertain the causes which have led us gradually to stray from the political principles laid down by our forefathers for all the world to see some of us do not even know what those principles were i have met many intelligent men in different states of the union who could not even repeat the names of the senators who sat for them in congress macaulay said in 1852 we now know by the clearest of all proof that universal suffrage even united with secret voting is no security against the establishment of arbitrary power to quote james russell lowell writing a little later we have begun obscurely to recognize that popular government is not in itself a panacea is no better than any other form except as the virtue and wisdom of the people make it so  as americans we cannot but believe that our political creed goes down in its foundations to the solid rock of truth one of the best reasons for our belief lies in the fact that since 1776 government after government has imitated our example we have by our very existence and rise to power made any decided retrogression from these doctrines impossible so many people have tried to rule themselves and are still trying that one begins to believe that the time is not far distant when the united states once the most radical will become the most conservative of nations  thus the duty rests today more heavily than ever upon each american citizen to make good to the world those principles upon which his government was built to use a figure suggested by the calamity which has lately befallen one of the most beloved of our cities there is a theory that earthquakes are caused by a necessary movement on the part of the globe to regain its axis whether or not the theory be true it has its political application in america today we are tryingwhatever the costto regain the true axis established for us by the founders of our republic  harlakenden house may 7 1906       pg
