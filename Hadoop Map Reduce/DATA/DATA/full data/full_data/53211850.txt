                              illustration hollo what do you want he asked staring at her                 page 10   the candy country   i shall take mammas red sun umbrella it is so warm and none of the children at school will have one like it said lily one day as she went through the hall  the wind is very high im afraid youll be blown away if you carry that big thing called nurse from the window as the red umbrella went bobbing down the garden walk with a small girl under it  i wish it would i always wanted to go up in a balloon answered lily as she struggled out of the gate  she got on very well till she came to the bridge and stopped to look over the railing at the water running by so fast and the turtles sunning themselves on the rocks lily was fond of throwing stones at them it was so funny to watch them tumble heels over head splash into the water now when she saw three big fellows close by she stooped for a stone and just at that minute a gale of wind nearly took the umbrella out of her hand she clutched it fast and away she went like a thistledown right up in the air over river and hill houses and trees faster and faster till her head spun round her breath was all gone and she had to let go the dear red umbrella flew away like a leaf and lily fell down down till she went crash into a tree which grew in such a curious place that she forgot her fright as she sat looking about her wondering what part of the world it could be  the tree looked as if made of glass or colored sugar for she could see through the red cherries the green leaves and the brown branches an agreeable smell met her nose and she said at once as any child would i smell candy she picked a cherry and ate it oh how good it wasall sugar and no stone the next discovery was such a delightful one that she nearly fell off her perch for by touching her tongue here and there she found that the whole tree was made of candy think what fun to sit and break off twigs of barley sugar candied cherries and leaves that tasted like peppermint and sassafras  lily rocked and ate till she finished the top of the little tree then she climbed down and strolled along making more surprising and agreeable discoveries as she went  what looked like snow under her feet was white sugar the rocks were lumps of chocolate the flowers of all colors and tastes and every sort of fruit grew on these delightful trees little white houses soon appeared and here lived the dainty candypeople all made of the best sugar and painted to look like real people dear little men and women looking as if they had stepped off of wedding cakes and bonbons went about in their gay sugar clothes laughing and talking in the sweetest voices bits of babies rocked in openwork cradles and sugar boys and girls played with sugar toys in the most natural way carriages rolled along the jujube streets drawn by the red and yellow barley horses we all love so well cows fed in the green fields and sugar birds sang in the trees  lily listened and in a moment she understood what the song said      sweet sweet      come come and eat      dear little girls      with yellow curls      for here youll find      sweets to your mind      on every tree      sugarplums youll see      in every dell      grows the caramel      over every wall      gumdrops fall      molasses flows      where our river goes      under your feet      lies sugar sweet      over your head      grow almonds red      our lily and rose      are not for the nose      our flowers we pluck      to eat or suck      and oh what bliss      when two friends kiss      for they honey sip      from lip to lip      and all you meet      in house or street      at work or play      sweethearts are they      so little dear      pray feel no fear      go where you will      eat eat your fill      here is a feast      from west to east      and you can say      ere you go away      at last i stand      in dear candyland      and no more can stuff      for once ive enough      sweet sweet      tweet tweet      tweedledee      tweedledee  that is the most interesting song i ever heard said lily clapping her sticky hands and dancing along toward a fine palace of white cream candy with pillars of striped peppermint stick and a roof of frosting that made it look like the milan cathedral  ill live here and eat candy all day long with no tiresome school or patchwork to spoil my fun said lily  so she ran up the chocolate steps into the pretty rooms where all the chairs and tables were of different colored candies and the beds of spun sugar a fountain of lemonade supplied drink and floors of icecream that never melted kept people and things from sticking together as they would have done had it been warm  for a long while lily was quite happy going about tasting so many different kinds of sweeties talking to the little people who were very amiable and finding out curious things about them and their country  the babies were made of plain sugar but the grown people had different flavors the young ladies were flavored with violet rose and orange the gentlemen were apt to have cordials of some sort inside of them as she found when she ate one now and then slyly and got her tongue bitten by the hot strong taste as a punishment the old people tasted of peppermint clove and such comfortable things good for pain but the old maids had lemon hoarhound flagroot and all sorts of sour bitter things in them and did not get eaten much lily soon learned to know the characters of her new friends by a single taste and some she never touched but once the dear babies melted in her mouth and the delicately flavored young ladies she was very fond of dr ginger was called to her more than once when so much candy made her teeth ache and she found him a very hottempered little man but he stopped the pain so she was glad to see him  a limedrop boy and a little pink checkerberry girl were her favorite playmates and they had fine times making mudpies by scraping the chocolate rocks and mixing this dust with honey from the wells near by these they could eat and lily thought this much better than throwing away the pies as she had to do at home they had candypulls very often and made swings of long loops of molasses candy and birdsnests with almond eggs out of which came birds who sang sweetly they played football with big bullseyes sailed in sugar boats on lakes of syrup fished in rivers of molasses and rode the barley horses all over the country  lily discovered that it never rained but snowed white sugar there was no sun as it would have been too hot but a large yellow lozenge made a nice moon and red and white comfits were the stars  the people all lived on sugar and never quarrelled no one was ill and if any got broken as sometimes happened with such brittle creatures they just stuck the parts together and were all right again the way they grew old was to get thinner and thinner till there was danger of their vanishing then the friends of the old person put him in a neat coffin and carried him to the great golden urn which stood in their largest temple always full of a certain fine syrup and here he was dipped and dipped till he was stout and strong again and went home to enjoy himself for a long time as good as new  this was very interesting to lily and she went to many funerals but the weddings were better still for the lovely white brides were so sweet lily longed to eat them the feasts were delicious and everybody went in their best clothes and danced at the ball till they got so warm halfadozen would stick together and have to be taken to the icecream room to cool off then the little pair would drive away in a fine carriage with white horses to a new palace in some other part of the country and lily would have another pleasant place to visit  but by and by when she had seen everything and eaten so much sweet stuff that at last she longed for plain bread and butter she began to get cross as children always do when they live on candy and the little people wished she would go away for they were afraid of her no wonder when she would catch up a dear sugar baby and eat him or break some respectable old grandmamma all into bits because she reproved her for naughty ways lily calmly sat down on the biggest church crushing it flat and even tried to poke the moon out of the sky in a pet one day the king ordered her to go home but she said i wont and bit his head off crown and all  such a wail went up at this awful deed that she ran away out of the city fearing some one would put poison in her candy since she had no other food  i suppose i shall get somewhere if i keep walking and i cant starve though i hate the sight of this horrid stuff she said to herself as she hurried over the mountains of gibraltar rock that divided the city of saccharissa from the great desert of brown sugar that lay beyond  lily marched bravely on for a long time and saw at last a great smoke in the sky smelt a spicy smell and felt a hot wind blowing toward her  i wonder if there are sugar savages here roasting and eating some poor traveller like me she said thinking of robinson crusoe and other wanderers in strange lands  she crept carefully along till she saw a settlement of little huts very like mushrooms for they were made of cookies set on lumps of the brown sugar and queer people looking as if made of gingerbread were working very busily round several stoves which seemed to bake at a great rate  ill creep nearer and see what sort of people they are before i show myself said lily going into a grove of spicetrees and sitting down on a stone which proved to be the plummy sort of cake we used to call brighton rock  presently one of the tallest men came striding toward the trees with a pan evidently after spice and before she could run he saw lily  hollo what do you want he asked staring at her with his black currant eyes while he briskly picked the bark off a cinnamontree  im travelling and would like to know what place this is if you please answered lily very politely being a little frightened  cakeland where do you come from asked the gingerbread man in a crisp tone of voice  i was blown into the candy country and have been there a long time but i got tired of it and ran away to find something better  sensible child and the man smiled till lily thought his cheeks would crumble youll get on better here with us brownies than with the lazy bonbons who never work and are all for show they wont own us though we are all related through our grandparents sugar and molasses we are busy folks so they turn up their noses and dont speak when we meet at parties poor creatures silly and sweet and unsubstantial i pity em  could i make you a visit id like to see how you live and what you do im sure it must be interesting said lily picking herself up after a tumble having eaten nearly all the stone she was so hungry  i know you will come on i can talk while i work and the funny gingerbread man trotted off toward his kitchen full of pans rollingpins and molasses jugs  sit down i shall be at leisure as soon as this batch is baked there are still some wise people down below who like gingerbread and i have my hands full he said dashing about stirring rolling out and slapping the brown dough into pans which he whisked into the oven and out again so fast that lily knew there must be magic about it somewhere  every now and then he threw her a delicious cooky warm from the oven she liked the queer fellow and presently began to talk being very curious about this country  what is your name sir  ginger snap  lily thought it a good one for he was very quick and she fancied he could be short and sharp if he liked  where does all this cake go to she asked after watching the other kitchens full of workers who were all of different kinds of cake and each set of cooks made its own sort  ill show you by and by answered snap beginning to pile up the heaps of gingerbread on a little car that ran along a track leading to some unknown storeroom lily thought  dont you get tired of doing this all the time  yes but i want to be promoted and i never shall be till ive done my best and won the prize here  oh tell me about it what is the prize and how are you promoted is this a cookingschool  yes the prize for best gingerbread is a cake of condensed yeast that puts a soul into me and i begin to rise till i am able to go over the hills yonder into the blessed land of bread and be one of the happy creatures who are always wholesome always needed and without which the world below would be in a bad way  bless me that is the queerest thing ive heard yet but i dont wonder you want to go im tired of sweets myself and long for a good piece of bread though i used to want cake and candy at home  ah my dear youll learn a good deal here and you are lucky not to have got into the clutches of giant dyspepsia who always gets people if they eat too much of such rubbish and scorn wholesome bread i leave my ginger behind when i go and get white and round and beautiful as you will see the gingerbread family have never been as foolish as some of the other cakes wedding is the worst such extravagance in the way of wine and spice and fruit i never saw and such a mess to eat when its done i dont wonder people get sick serves em right and snap flung down a pan with such a bang that it made lily jump  sponge cake isnt bad is it mamma lets me eat it but i like frosted pound better she said looking over to the next kitchen where piles of that sort of cake were being iced  poor stuff no substance ladies fingers will do for babies but pound has too much butter ever to be healthy let it alone and eat cookies or seedcakes my dear now come along im ready and snap trundled away his carload at a great pace  lily ran behind to pick up whatever fell and looked about her as she went for this was certainly a very queer country lakes of eggs all beaten up and hot springs of saleratus foamed here and there ready for use the earth was brown sugar or ground spice and the only fruits were raisins dried currants citron and lemon peel it was a very busy place for every one cooked all the time and never failed and never seemed tired though they got so hot that they only wore sheets of paper for clothes there were piles of it to put over the cake so that it shouldnt burn and they made cooks white caps and aprons of it and looked very nice a large clock made of a flat pancake with cloves to mark the hours and two toothpicks for hands showed them how long to bake things and in one place an ice wall was built round a lake of butter which they cut in lumps as they wanted it  here we are now stand away while i pitch em down said snap stopping at last before a hole in the ground where a dumbwaiter hung ready with a name over it  there were many holes all round and many waiters each with its name and lily was amazed when she read weber copeland dooling and others which she knew very well  over snaps place was the name newmarch and lily said why thats where mamma gets her hard gingerbread and webers is where we go for icecream do you make cake for them  yes but no one knows it its one of the secrets of the trade we cook for all the confectioners and people think the good things come out of the cellars under their saloons good joke isnt it and snap laughed till a crack came in his neck and made him cough  lily was so surprised she sat down on a warm queens cake that happened to be near and watched snap send down load after load of gingerbread to be eaten by children who would have liked it much better if they had only known where it came from as she did  as she sat the clatter of many spoons the smell of many dinners and the sound of many voices calling one vanilla two strawberries and a charlotte russe three stews cup coffee dry toast roast chicken and apple without came up the next hole which was marked copeland  dear me it seems as if i was there said lily longing to hop down but afraid of the bump at the other end  im done come along ill ride you back called snap tossing the last cooky after the dumbwaiter as it went slowly out of sight with its spicy load  i wish youd teach me to cook it looks great fun and mamma wants me to learn only our cook hates to have me mess round and is so cross that i dont like to try at home said lily as she went trundling back  better wait till you get to breadland and learn to make that its a great art and worth knowing dont waste your time on cake though plain gingerbread isnt bad to have in the house ill teach you that in a jiffy if the clock doesnt strike my hour too soon answered snap helping her down  what hour  why of my freedom i never know when ive done my task till im called by the chimes and go to get my soul said snap turning his currant eyes anxiously to the clock  i hope you will have time and lily fell to work with all her might after snap had put on her a paper apron and a cap like his  it was not hard for when she was going to make a mistake a spark flew out of the fire and burnt her in time to remind her to look at the receipt which was a sheet of gingerbread in a frame of piecrust hung up before her with the directions written while it was soft and baked in the third sheet she made came out of the oven spicy light and brown and snap giving it one poke said thats all right now you know heres your reward  he handed her a receiptbook made of thin sheets of sugargingerbread held together by a gelatine binding with her name stamped on the back and each leaf crimped with a cakecutter in the most elegant manner  lily was charmed with it but had no time to read all it contained for just then the clock began to strike and a chime of bells to ring      gingerbread      go to the head      your task is done      a soul is won      take it and go      where muffins grow      where sweet loaves rise      to the very skies      and biscuits fair      perfume the air      away away      make no delay      in the sea of flour      plunge this hour      safe in your breast      let the yeastcake rest      till you rise in joy      a white bread boy  ha ha im free im free cried snap catching up the silvercovered square that seemed to fall from heaven and running to a great white sea of flour he went in head first holding the yeastcake clasped to his breast as if his life depended on it  lily watched breathlessly while a curious working and bubbling went on as if snap was tumbling about down there like a small earthquake the other cakefolk stood round the shore with her for it was a great event and all were glad that the dear fellow was promoted so soon suddenly a cry was heard and up rose a beautiful white figure on the farther side of the sea it moved its hand as if saying goodby and ran over the hills so fast they had only time to see how plump and fair he was with a little knob on the top of his head like a crown  hes gone to the happy land and we shall miss him but well follow his example and soon find him again said a gentle sponge cake with a sigh as all went back to their work while lily hurried after snap eager to see the new country which was the best of all  a delicious odor of fresh bread blew up from the valley as she stood on the hilltop and looked down on the peaceful scene below fields of yellow grain waved in the breeze hopvines grew from tree to tree and many windmills whirled their white sails as they ground the different grains into fresh sweet meal for the loaves of bread that built the houses like bricks and paved the streets or in many shapes formed the people furniture and animals a river of milk flowed through the peaceful land and fountains of yeast rose and fell with a pleasant foam and fizz the ground was a mixture of many meals and the paths were golden indian which gave a very gay look to the scene buckwheat flowers bloomed on their rosy stems and tall cornstalks rustled their leaves in the warm air that came from the ovens hidden in the hillsides for bread needs a slow fire and an obliging volcano did the baking here  what a lovely place cried lily feeling the charm of the homelike landscape in spite of the funny plump people moving about  two of these figures came running to meet her as she slowly walked down the yellow path from the hill one was a golden boy with a beaming face the other a little girl in a shiny brown cloak who looked as if she would taste very nice they each put a warm hand into lilys and the boy said  we are glad to see you muffin told us you were coming  thank you who is muffin asked lily feeling as if she had seen both these little people before and liked them  he was ginger snap once but hes a muffin now we begin in that way and work up to the perfect loaf by degrees my name is johnny cake and shes sally lunn you know us so come on and have a race  lily burst out laughing at the idea of playing with these old friends of hers and all three ran away as fast as they could tear down the hill over a bridge into the middle of the village where they stopped panting and sat down on some very soft rolls to rest  what do you all do here asked lily when she got her breath again  we farm we study we bake we brew and are as merry as grigs all day long its schooltime now and we must go will you come said sally jumping up as if she liked it  our schools are not like yours we only study two thingsgrain and yeast i think youll like it we have yeast today and the experiments are very jolly added johnny trotting off to a tall brown tower of rye and indian bread where the school was kept  lily never liked to go to school but she was ashamed to own it so she went along with sally and was so amused with all she saw that she was glad she came the brown loaf was hollow and had no roof and when she asked why they used a ruin sally told her to wait and see why they chose strong walls and plenty of room overhead all round was a circle of very small biscuits like cushions and on these the breadchildren sat a square loaf in the middle was the teachers desk and on it lay an ear of wheat with several bottles of yeast well corked up the teacher was a pleasant plump lady from vienna very wise and so famous for her good bread that she was a professor of grainology  when all were seated she began with the wheat ear and told them all about it in such an interesting way that lily felt as if she had never known anything about the bread she ate before the experiments with the yeast were quite excitingfor fräulein pretzel showed them how it would work till it blew the cork out and go fizzing up to the sky if it was kept too long how it would turn sour or flat and spoil the bread if care was not taken to use it just at the right moment and how too much would cause the loaf to rise till there was no substance to it  the children were very bright for they were fed on the best kinds of oatmeal and graham bread with very little white bread or hot cakes to spoil their young stomachs hearty happy boys and girls they were and their yeasty souls were very lively in them for they danced and sang and seemed as bright and gay as if acidity heaviness and mould were quite unknown  lily was very happy with them and when school was done went home with sally and ate the best bread and milk for dinner that she ever tasted in the afternoon johnny took her to the cornfield and showed her how they kept the growing ears free from mildew and worms then she went to the bakehouse and here she found her old friend muffin hard at work making parker house rolls for he was such a good cook he was set to work at once on the lighter kinds of bread  well isnt this better than candyland or saccharissa he asked as he rolled and folded his bits of dough with a dab of butter tucked inside  ever so much cried lily i feel better already and mean to learn all i can mamma will be so pleased if i can make good bread when i go home she is rather oldfashioned and likes me to be a nice housekeeper i didnt think bread interesting then but i do now and johnnys mother is going to teach me to make indian cakes tomorrow  glad to hear it learn all you can and tell other people how to make healthy bodies and happy souls by eating good plain food not like this though these rolls are better than cake i have to work my way up to the perfect loaf you know and then oh then im a happy thing  what happens then do you go on to some other wonderful place asked lily as muffin paused with a smile on his face  yes i am eaten by some wise good human being and become a part of him or her that is immortality and heaven for i may nourish a poet and help him sing or feed a good woman who makes the world better for being in it or be crumbed into the golden porringer of a baby prince who is to rule a kingdom isnt that a noble way to live and an end worth working for asked muffin in a tone that made lily feel as if some sort of fine yeast had got into her and was setting her brain to work with new thoughts  yes it is i suppose all common things are made for that purpose if we only knew it and people should be glad to do anything to help the world along even making good bread in a kitchen answered lily in a sober way that showed that her little mind was already digesting the new food it had got  she stayed in breadland a long time and enjoyed and learned a great deal that she never forgot but at last when she had made the perfect loaf she wanted to go home that her mother might see and taste it  ive put a good deal of myself into it and id love to think i had given her strength or pleasure by my work she said as she and sally stood looking at the handsome loaf  you can go whenever you like just take the bread in your hands and wish three times and youll be wherever you say im sorry to have you go but i dont wonder you want to see your mother dont forget what you have learned and you will always be glad you came to us said sally kissing her goodby  where is muffin i cant go without seeing him my dear old friend answered lily looking round for him  he is here said sally touching the loaf he was ready to go and chose to pass into your bread rather than any other for he said he loved you and would be glad to help feed so good a little girl  how kind of him i must be careful to grow wise and excellent else he will be disappointed and have died in vain said lily touched by his devotion  then bidding them all farewell she hugged her loaf close wished three times to be in her own home and like a flash she was there  whether her friends believed the wonderful tale of her adventures i cannot tell but i know that she was a nice little housekeeper from that day and made such good bread that other girls came to learn of her she also grew from a sickly fretful child into a fine strong woman because she ate very little cake and candy except at christmas time when the oldest and the wisest love to make a short visit to candyland                                           illustration poor billy dangling from a bough high above the ground                page 43   how they ran away   two little boys sat on the fence whittling arrows one fine day said one little boy to the other little boy  lets do something jolly  all right what will we do  run off to the woods and be hunters  what can we hunt  bears and foxes  mullin says there aint any round here  well we can shoot squirrels and snare woodchucks  havent got any guns and trap  weve got our bows and i found an old trap behind the barn  what will we eat  heres our lunch and when thats gone we can roast the squirrels and cook the fish on a stick i know how  where will you get the fire  got matches in my pocket  ive got a lot of things we could use lets see  and as if satisfied at last cautious billy displayed his treasures while bold tommy did the same  besides the two knives there were strings nails matches a piece of putty fishhooks and two very dirty handkerchiefs  there sir thats a firstrate fitout for hunters and with the jolly basket of lunch mrs mullin gave us we can get on tiptop for two or three days said tommy eager to be off  where shall we sleep asked billy who liked to be comfortable both night and day  oh up in trees or on beds of leaves like the fellows in our books if you are afraid stay at home im going to have no end of a good time and tommy crammed the things back into his pockets as if there were no time to lose  pooh i aint afraid come on and jumping down billy caught up his rod rather ashamed of his many questions  no one was looking at them and they might have walked quietly off but that the running away might be all right both raced down the road tumbled over a wall and dashed into the woods as if a whole tribe of wild indians were after them  do you know the way panted billy when at last they stopped for breath  yes it winds right up the mountain but wed better not keep to it or some one will see us and take us back we are going to be real hunters and have adventures so we must get lost and find our way by the sun and the stars answered tommy who had read so many boys books his little head was a jumble of texan rangers african explorers and buffalo bills and he burned to outdo them all  what will our mothers say if we really get lost asked billy always ready with a question  mine wont fuss she lets me do what i like  that was true for tommys poor mamma was tired of trying to keep the lively little fellow in order and had got used to seeing him come out of all his scrapes without much harm  mine will be scared shes always afraid im going to get hurt so im careful but i guess ill risk it and have some fun to tell about when we go home said billy trudging after captain tommy who always took the lead  these elevenyearold boys were staying with their mothers at a farmhouse up among the mountains and having got tired of the tame bears the big barn the trout brook the thirty colts at pasture and the society of the few little girls and younger boys at the hotel near by these fine fellows longed to break loose and rough it in the bush as the hunters did in their favorite stories  away they went deeper and deeper into the great forest that covered the side of the mountain a pleasant place that august day for it was cool and green with many brooks splashing over the rocks or lying in brown pools under the ferns squirrels chattered and raced in the tall pines now and then a gray rabbit skipped out of sight among the brakes or a strange bird flew by here and there blackberries grew in the open places sassafras bushes were plentiful and blackbirch bark was ready for chewing  dont you call this nice asked tommy pausing at last in a little dell where a noisy brook came tumbling down the mountain side and the pines sung overhead  yes but im awful hungry lets rest and eat our lunch said billy sitting down on a cushion of moss  you always want to be stuffing and resting answered sturdy tommy who liked to be moving all the time  he took the fishingbasket which hung over his shoulder by a strap and opened it carefully for good mrs mullin had packed a nice lunch of bread and butter cake and peaches with a bottle of milk and two large pickles slipped in on the sly to please the boys  tommys face grew very sober as he looked in for all he saw was a box of worms for bait and an old jacket  by george weve got the wrong basket this is mullins and hes gone off with our prog wont he be mad  not as mad as i am why didnt you look you are always in such a hurry to start what shall we do now without anything to eat whined billy for losing his lunch was a dreadful blow to him  we shall have to catch some fish and eat blackberries which will you do old crybaby said tommy laughing at the other boys dismal face  ill fish im so tired i cant go scratching round after berries i dont love em either and billy began to fix his line and bait his hook  lucky we got the worms you can eat em if you cant wait for fish said tommy bustling about to empty the basket and pile up their few possessions in a heap theres a quiet pool below here you go and fish there ill pick the berries and then show you how to get dinner in the woods this is our camp so fly round and do your best  then tommy ran off to a place near by where he had seen the berries while billy found a comfortable nook by the pool and sat scowling at the water so crossly it was a wonder any trout came to his hook but the fat worms tempted several small ones and he cheered up at the prospect of food tommy whistled while he picked and in half an hour came back with two quarts of nice berries and an armful of dry sticks for the fire  well have a jolly dinner after all he said as the flames went crackling up and the dry leaves made a pleasant smell  got four but dont see how well ever cook em no fryingpan grumbled billy throwing down the four little trout which he had half cleaned  dont want any broil em on the coals or toast em on a forked stick ill show you how said cheerful tommy whittling away and feeding his fire as much like a real hunter as a small boy could be  while he worked billy ate berries and sighed for bread and butter at last after much trouble two of the trout were half cooked and eagerly eaten by the hungry boys but they were very different from the nice brown ones mrs mullin gave them for in spite of tommys struggles they would fall in the ashes and there was no salt to eat with them by the time the last were toasted the young hunters were so hungry they could have eaten anything and not a berry was left  i set the trap down there for i saw a hole among the vines and i shouldnt wonder if we got a rabbit or something said tommy when the last bone was polished you go and catch some more fish and ill see if i have caught any old chap as he went home to dinner  off ran tommy and the other boy went slowly back to the brook wishing with all his might he was at home eating sweet corn and berry pie  the trout had evidently gone to their dinners for not one bite did poor billy get and he was just falling asleep when a loud shout gave him such a fright that he tumbled into the brook up to his knees  ive got him come and see hes a bouncer roared tommy from the berry bushes some way off  billy scrambled out and went as fast as his wet boots would let him to see what the prize was he found tommy dancing wildly round a fat gray animal who was fighting to get his paws out of the trap and making a queer noise as he struggled about  what is it asked billy getting behind a tree as fast as possible for the thing looked fierce and he was very timid  a raccoon i guess or a big woodchuck wont his fur make a fine cap i guess the other fellows will wish theyd come with us said tommy prancing to and fro without the least idea what to do with the creature  hell bite wed better run away and wait till hes dead said billy  wish hed got his head in then i could carry him off but he does look savage so well have to leave him awhile and get him when we come back but hes a real beauty and tommy looked proudly at the bunch of gray fur scuffling in the sand  can we ever eat him asked hungry billy ready for a fried crocodile if he could get it  if hes a raccoon we can but i dont know about woodchucks the fellows in my books dont seem to have caught any hes nice and fat we might try him when hes dead said tommy who cared more for the skin to show than the best meal ever cooked  the sound of a gun echoing through the wood gave tommy a good idea  lets find the man and get him to shoot this chap then we neednt wait but skin him right away and eat him too  off they went to the camp and catching up their things the two hunters hurried away in the direction of the sound feeling glad to know that some one was near them for two or three hours of wood life made them a little homesick  they ran and scrambled and listened and called but not until they had gone a long way up the mountain did they find the man resting in an old hut left by the lumbermen the remains of his dinner were spread on the floor and he lay smoking and reading a newspaper while his dog dozed at his feet close to a wellfilled gamebag  he looked surprised when two dirty wet little boys suddenly appeared before himone grinning cheerfully the other looking very dismal and scared as the dog growled and glared at them as if they were two rabbits  hollo said the man  hollo answered tommy  who are you asked the man  hunters said tommy  had good luck and the man laughed  firstrate got a raccoon in our trap and we want you to come and shoot him answered tommy proudly  sure said the man looking interested as well as amused  no but i think so  whats he like  tommy described him and was much disappointed when the man lay down again saying with another laugh  its a woodchuck hes no good  but i want the skin  then dont shoot him let him die thats better for the skin said the man who was tired and didnt want to stop for such poor game  all this time billy had been staring hard at the sandwiches and bread and cheese on the floor and sniffing at them as the dog sniffed at him  want some grub asked the man seeing the hungry look  i just do we left our lunch and ive only had two little trout and some old berries since breakfast answered billy with tears in his eyes and a hand on his stomach  eat away then im done and dont want the stuff and the man took up his paper as if glad to be let alone  it was lucky that the dog had been fed for in ten minutes nothing was left but the napkin and the boys sat picking up the crumbs much refreshed but ready for more  better be going home my lads its pretty cold on the mountain after sunset and you are a long way from town said the man who had peeped at them over his paper now and then and saw in spite of the dirt and rips that they were not farmer boys  we dont live in town we are at mullins in the valley no hurry we know the way and we want to have some sport first you seem to have done well answered tommy looking enviously from the gun to the gamebag out of which hung a rabbits head and a squirrels tail  pretty fair but i want a shot at the bear people tell me there is one up here and im after him for he kills the sheep and might hurt some of the young folks round here said the man loading his gun with a very sober air for he wanted to get rid of the boys and send them home  billy looked alarmed but tommys brown face beamed with joy as he said eagerly  i hope youll get him id rather shoot a bear than any other animal but a lion we dont have those here and bears are scarce mullin said he hadnt heard of one for a long time so this must be a young one for they killed the big one two years ago  that was true and the man knew it he did not really expect or want to meet a bear but thought the idea of one would send the little fellows home at once finding one of them was unscared he laughed and said with a nod to tommy  if i had time id take you along and show you how to hunt but this fat friend of yours couldnt rough it with us and we cant leave him alone so go ahead your own way only i wouldnt climb any higher for among the rocks you are sure to get hurt or lost  oh i say lets go such fun billy i know youll like it a real gun and dog and hunter come on and dont be a mollycoddle cried tommy wild to go  i wont im tired and im going home you can go after your old bears if you want to i dont think much of hunting anyway and wish i hadnt come growled billy very cross at being left out yet with no desire to scramble any more  cant stop goodby get along home and some day ill come and take you out with me little leatherstocking said the man striding off with the dear gun and dog and bag leaving billy to wonder what he meant by that queer name and tommy to console himself with the promise made him  lets go and see how old chucky gets on he said goodnaturedly when the man vanished  not till im rested i can get a good nap on this pile of hay then well go home before its late answered lazy billy settling himself on the rough bed the lumbermen had used  i just wish i had a boy with some go in him you aint much better than a girl sighed tommy walking off to a pinetree where some squirrels seemed to be having a party they chattered and raced up and down at such a rate  he tried his bow and shot all his arrows many times in vain for the lively creatures gave him no chance he had better luck with a brown bird who sat in a bush and was hit full in the breast with the sharpest arrow the poor thing fluttered and fell and its blood wet the green leaves as it lay dying on the grass tommy was much pleased at first but as he stood watching its bright eye grow dim and its pretty brown wings stop fluttering he felt sorry that its happy little life was so cruelly ended and ashamed that his thoughtless fun had given so much pain  ill never shoot another bird except hawks after chickens and i wont brag about this one it was so tame and trusted me i was very mean to kill it  as he thought this tommy smoothed the ruffled feathers of the dead thrush and making a little grave under the pine buried it wrapped in green leaves and left it there where its mate could sing over it and no rude hands disturb its rest  ill tell mamma and she will understand but i wont tell billy he is such a greedy old chap hell say i ought to have kept the poor bird to eat thought tommy as he went back to the hut and sat there restringing his bow till billy woke up much more amiable for his sleep  they tried to find the woodchuck but lost their way and wandered deeper into the great forest till they came to a rocky place and could go no farther they climbed up and tumbled down turned back and went round looked at the sun and knew it was late chewed sassafras bark and checkerberry leaves for supper and grew more and more worried and tired as hour after hour went by and they saw no end to woods and rocks once or twice they heard the hunters gun far away and called and tried to find him  tommy scolded billy for not going with the man who knew his way and was probably safe in the valley when the last faint shot came up to them billy cried and reproached tommy for proposing to run away and both felt very homesick for their mothers and their good safe beds at farmer mullins  the sun set and found them in a dreary place full of rocks and blasted trees halfway up the mountain they were so tired they could hardly walk and longed to lie down anywhere to sleep but remembering the hunters story of the bear they were afraid to do it till tommy suggested climbing a tree after making a fire at the foot of it to scare away the bear lest he climb too and get them  but alas the matches were left in their first camp so they decided to take turns to sleep and watch since it was plain that they must spend the night there billy went up first and creeping into a good notch of the bare tree tried to sleep while brave tommy armed with a big stick marched to and fro below every few minutes a trembling voice would call from above is anything coming and an anxious voice would answer from below not yet hurry up and go to sleep i want my turn  at last billy began to snore and then tommy felt so lonely he couldnt bear it so he climbed to a lower branch and sat nodding and trying to keep watch till he too fell fast asleep and the early moon saw the poor boys roosting there like two little owls  a loud cry a scrambling overhead and then a great shaking and howling waked tommy so suddenly that he lost his wits for a moment and did not know where he was  the bear the bear dont let him get me tommy tommy come and make him let go cried billy filling the quiet night with dismal howls  tommy looked up expecting to behold a large bear eating his unhappy friend but the moonlight showed him nothing but poor billy dangling from a bough high above the ground caught by his belt when he fell he had been dreaming of bears and rolled off his perch so there he hung kicking and wailing half awake and so scared it was long before tommy could make him believe that he was quite safe  how to get him down was the next question the branch was not strong enough to bear tommy though he climbed up and tried to unhook poor billy the belt was firmly twisted at the back and billy could not reach to undo it nor could he get his legs round the branch to pull himself up there seemed no way but to unbuckle the belt and drop that he was afraid to try for the ground was hard and the fall a high one fortunately both belt and buckle were strong so he hung safely though very uncomfortably while tommy racked his boyish brain to find a way to help him  billy had just declared that he should be cut in two very soon if something was not done for him and tommy was in despair when they thought they heard a faroff shout and both answered it till their throats were nearly split with screaming  i seem to see a light moving round down that way cried billy from his hook pointing toward the valley  they are looking for us but they wont hear us ill run and holler louder and bring em up here answered tommy glad to do anything that would put an end to this dreadful state of things  dont leave me i may fall and be killed the bear might come dont go dont go wailed billy longing to drop but afraid  i wont go far and ill come back as quick as i can you are safe up there hold on and well soon get you down answered tommy rushing away helterskelter never minding where he went and too much excited to care for any damage  the moon was bright on the blasted trees but when he came down among the green pines it grew dark and he often stumbled and fell never minding bumps and bruises he scrambled over rocks leaped fallen trunks floundered through brooks and climbed down steep places till with a reckless jump he went heels over head into a deep hole and lay there for a moment stunned by the fall it was an old beartrap long unused and fortunately well carpeted with dead leaves or poor tommy would have broken his bones  when he came to himself he was so used up that he lay still for some time in a sort of daze too tired to know or care about anything only dimly conscious that somebody was lost in a tree or a well and that on the whole running away was not all fun  by and by the sound of a gun roused him and remembering poor billy he tried to get out of the pitfor the moon showed him where he was but it was too deep and he was too stiff with weariness and the fall to be very nimble so he shouted and whistled and raged about very like a little bear caught in the pit  it is very difficult to find a lost person on these great mountains and many wander for hours not far from help bewildered by the thick woods the deep ravines and precipices which shut them in some have lost their lives and as tommy lay on the leaves used up by his various struggles he thought of all the stories he had lately heard at the farm and began to wonder how it would feel to starve to death down there and to wish poor billy could come to share his prison that they might die together like the babes in the wood or better still the boy scouts lost on the prairies in that thrilling story bill boomerang the wild hunter of the west  i guess mother is worried this time because i never stayed out all night before and i never will again without leave its rather good fun though if they only find me i aint afraid and it isnt very cold i always wanted to sleep out and now im doing it wish poor billy was safely down and in this good bed with me wont he be scared all alone there maybe the belt will break and he get hurt bumping down sorry now i left him hes such a fraidcat theres the gun again guess its that man after us hi hollo here i am whoop hurrah hi hi hi  tommys meditations ended in a series of yells as loud as his shrill little voice could make them and he thought some one answered but it must have been an echo for no one came and after another rampage round his prison the poor boy nestled down among the leaves and went fast asleep because there was nothing else to do  so there they were the two young hunters lost at midnight on the mountainone hanging like an apple on the old tree and the other sound asleep in a bearpit their distracted mothers meantime were weeping and wringing their hands at the farm while all the men in the neighborhood were out looking for the lost boys the hunter on his return to the hotel had reported meeting the runaways and his effort to send them home in good season so people knew where to look and led by the man and dog up the mountain went mr mullin with his troop it was a mild night and the moon shone high and clear so the hunt was on the whole rather easy and pleasant at first and lanterns flashed through the dark forest like fireflies the lonely cliffs seemed alive with men and voices echoed in places where usually only the brooks babbled and the hawks screamed but as time went on and no sign of the boys appeared the men grew anxious and began to fear some serious harm had come to the runaways  i cant go home without them little shavers no way specially tommy said mr mullin as they stopped to rest after a hard climb through the blasted grove hes a boy after my own heart spry as a chipmunk smart as a young cockerel and as full of mischief as a monkey he aint afraid of anything and i shouldnt be a mite surprised to find him enjoyin himself firstrate and as cool as a coocumber  the fat boy wont take it so easily i fancy if it hadnt been for him id have kept the lively fellow with me and shown him how to hunt sorry now i didnt take them both home said the man with the gun seeing his mistake too late as people often do  maybe theyve fell down a precipice and got killed like moses warner when he was lost suggested a tall fellow who had shouted himself hoarse  hush up and come on the dog is barkin yonder and he may have found em said the farmer hurrying toward the place where the hound was baying at something in a tree  it was poor billy hanging there still half unconscious with weariness and fear the belt had slipped up under his arms so he could breathe easily and there he was looking like a queer sort of cone on the blasted pine  wal i never exclaimed the farmer as the tall lad climbed up and unhooking billy handed him down like a young bird into the arms held up to catch him  hes all right only scared out of his wits come along and look for the other one ill warrant he went for help and may be halfway home by this time said the hunter who didnt take much interest in the fat boy  tommys hat lay on the ground and showing it to the dog his master told him to find the boy the good hound sniffed about and then set off with his nose to the ground following the zigzag track tommy had taken in his hurry the hunter and several of the men went after him leaving the farmer with the others to take care of billy  presently the dog came to the bearpit and began to bark again  hes got him cried the men much relieved and rushing on soon saw the good beast looking down at a little white object in one corner of the dark hole  it was tommys face in the moonlight for the rest of him was covered up with leaves the little round face seemed very quiet and for a moment the men stood quite still fearing that the fall might have done the boy some harm then the hunter leaped down and gently touched the brown cheek it was warm and a soft snore from the pug nose made the man call out much relieved  hes all right wake up here little chap you are wanted at home had hunting enough for this time  as he spoke tommy opened his eyes gave a stretch and said hollo billy as calmly as if in his own bed at home then the rustle of the leaves the moonlight in his face and the sight of several men staring down at him startled him wide awake  did you shoot the big bear he asked looking up at the hunter with a grin  no but i caught a little one and here he is answered the man giving tommy a roll in the leaves much pleased because he did not whine or make a fuss  got lost didnt we oh i say wheres billy i left him up a tree like a coon and he wouldnt come down laughed tommy kicking off his brown bedclothes and quite ready to get up now  they all laughed with him and presently when the story was told they pulled the boy out of the pit and went back to join the other wanderer who was now sitting up eating the bread and butter mrs mullin sent for their very late supper  the men roared again as the two boys told their various tribulations and when they had been refreshed the party started for home blowing the tin horns and firing shot after shot to let the scattered searchers know that the lost children were found billy was very quiet and gladly rode on the various broad backs offered for his use but tommy stoutly refused to be carried and with an occasional boost over a very rough place walked all the way down on his own sturdy legs he was the hero of the adventure and was never tired of relating how he caught the woodchuck cooked the fish slid down the big rock and went to bed in the old bearpit but in his own little mind he resolved to wait till he was older before he tried to be a hunter and though he caught several woodchucks that summer he never shot another harmless little bird  illustration
