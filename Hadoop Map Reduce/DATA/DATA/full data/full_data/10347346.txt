russian empire     preface   with the possible exceptions of the greek anthology the golden treasury and those which bear the name of e v lucas no selections of poetry or prose have ever given complete satisfaction to anyone except the compiler  but critics derive great satisfaction from pointing out errors of omission and inclusion on the part of the anthologist and all of us have putatively rearranged and reedited even the golden treasury in our leisure moments  in an age when art for arts sake is an exploded doctrine anthologies like everything else must have a purpose  the purpose or object of the present volume is to afford admirers of wildes work the same innocent pleasure obtainable from similar compilations namely that of reconstructing a selection of their own in their minds eyefor copyright considerations would interfere with the materialisation of their dream  a stray observation in an esteemed weekly periodical determined the plan of this anthology and the choice of particular passages  the writer whose name has escaped me opined that the reason the works of pater and wilde were no longer read was owing to both authors having treated english as a dead language  by a singular coincidence i had purchased simultaneously with the newspaper a shilling copy of paters renaissance published by messrs macmillan and a few days afterwards messrs methuen issued at a shilling the twentyeighth edition of de profundis  obviously either messrs macmillan and messrs methuen or the authority on dead languages must have been suffering from hallucinations  it occurred to me that a selection of wildes prose might at least rehabilitate the notorious reputation for common sense enjoyed by all publishers who rarely issue shilling editions of deceased authors for mere aesthetic considerations  and i confess to a hope that this volume may reach the eye or ear of those who have not read wildes books or of those such as mr sydney grundy who are irritated by the revival of his plays and the praise accorded to his works throughout the continent  wildes prose is distinguished by its extraordinary ease and clarity and by the absencevery singular in his caseof the preciosity which he admired too much in other writers and advocated with overemphasis perhaps that is why many of his stories and essays and plays are used as english textbooks in russian and scandinavian and hungarian schools artifice and affectation often assumed to be recurrent defects in his writings by those unacquainted with them are comparatively rare  wilde once boasted in an interview that only flaubert pater keats and maeterlinck had influenced him and then added in a characteristic way but i had already gone more than halfway to meet them  anyone curious as to the origin of wildes style and development should consult the learned treatise 1 of dr ernst bendz whose comprehensive treatment of the subject renders any elucidation of mine superfluous while nothing can be added to mr holbrook jacksons masterly criticism 2 of wilde and his position in literature  in making this selection with the valuable assistance of mr stuart mason i have endeavoured to illustrate and to justify the critical appreciations of both dr bendz and mr holbrook jackson as well as to afford the general reader a fair idea of wildes variety as a prose writer  he is more various than almost any author of the last century though the act of writing was always a burden to him  some critic acutely pointed out that poetry and prose were almost sideissues for him  the resulting faults and weakness of what he left are obvious except in the plays he has no sustained scheme of thought  even de profundis is too desultory  for the purpose of convenient reference i have exercised the prerogative of a literary executor and editor by endowing with special titles some of the pieces quoted in these pages  though unlike one of wildes other friends i cannot claim to have collaborated with him or to have assisted him in any of his plays i was sometimes permitted as wilde acknowledges in different letters to act in the capacity of godfather by suggesting the actual titles by which some of his books are known to the world  i mention the circumstance only as a precedent for my present temerity  to compensate those who disapprove of my choice i have included two unpublished letters  the examples of wildes epistolary style published since his death have been generally associated with disagreeable subjects  those included here will i hope prove a pleasant contrast  robert ross     how they struck a contemporary   there is such a thing as robbing a story of its reality by trying to make it too true and the black arrow is so inartistic as not to contain a single anachronism to boast of while the transformation of dr jekyll reads dangerously like an experiment out of the lancet  as for mr rider haggard who really has or had once the makings of a perfectly magnificent liar he is now so afraid of being suspected of genius that when he does tell us anything marvellous he feels bound to invent a personal reminiscence and to put it into a footnote as a kind of cowardly corroboration  nor are our other novelists much better  mr henry james writes fiction as if it were a painful duty and wastes upon mean motives and imperceptible points of view his neat literary style his felicitous phrases his swift and caustic satire  mr hall caine it is true aims at the grandiose but then he writes at the top of his voice  he is so loud that one cannot bear what he says  mr james payn is an adept in the art of concealing what is not worth finding  he hunts down the obvious with the enthusiasm of a shortsighted detective  as one turns over the pages the suspense of the author becomes almost unbearable  the horses of mr william blacks phaeton do not soar towards the sun  they merely frighten the sky at evening into violent chromolithographic effects  on seeing them approach the peasants take refuge in dialect  mrs oliphant prattles pleasantly about curates lawn tennis parties domesticity and other wearisome things  mr marion crawford has immolated himself upon the altar of local colour  he is like the lady in the french comedy who keeps talking about le beau ciel ditalie  besides he has fallen into the bad habit of uttering moral platitudes  he is always telling us that to be good is to be good and that to be bad is to be wicked  at times he is almost edifying  robert elsmere is of course a masterpiecea masterpiece of the genre ennuyeux the one form of literature that the english people seems thoroughly to enjoy  a thoughtful young friend of ours once told us that it reminded him of the sort of conversation that goes on at a meat tea in the house of a serious nonconformist family and we can quite believe it indeed it is only in england that such a book could be produced  england is the home of lost ideas  as for that great and daily increasing school of novelists for whom the sun always rises in the eastend the only thing that can be said about them is that they find life crude and leave it rawthe decay of lying     the quality of george meredith   ah  meredith  who can define him  his style is chaos illumined by flashes of lightning  as a writer he has mastered everything except language as a novelist he can do everything except tell a story as an artist he is everything except articulate  somebody in shakespearetouchstone i thinktalks about a man who is always breaking his shins over his own wit and it seems to me that this might serve as the basis for a criticism of merediths method  but whatever he is he is not a realist  or rather i would say that he is a child of realism who is not on speaking terms with his father  by deliberate choice he has made himself a romanticist  he has refused to bow the knee to baal and after all even if the mans fine spirit did not revolt against the noisy assertions of realism his style would be quite sufficient of itself to keep life at a respectful distance  by its means he has planted round his garden a hedge full of thorns and red with wonderful roses  as for balzac he was a most remarkable combination of the artistic temperament with the scientific spirit  the latter he bequeathed to his disciples  the former was entirely his own  the difference between such a book as m zolas lassommoir and balzacs illusions perdues is the difference between unimaginative realism and imaginative reality  all balzacs characters said baudelaire are gifted with the same ardour of life that animated himself  all his fictions are as deeply coloured as dreams  each mind is a weapon loaded to the muzzle with will  the very scullions have genius  a steady course of balzac reduces our living friends to shadows and our acquaintances to the shadows of shades  his characters have a kind of fervent fierycoloured existence  they dominate us and defy scepticism one of the greatest tragedies of my life is the death of lucien de rubempre  it is a grief from which i have never been able completely to rid myself  it haunts me in my moments of pleasure  i remember it when i laugh  but balzac is no more a realist than holbein was  he created life he did not copy it  i admit however that he set far too high a value on modernity of form and that consequently there is no book of his that as an artistic masterpiece can rank with salammbo or esmond or the cloister and the hearth or the vicomte de bragelonnethe decay of lying     life the fallacious model   art begins with abstract decoration with purely imaginative and pleasurable work dealing with what is unreal and nonexistent  this is the first stage  then life becomes fascinated with this new wonder and asks to be admitted into the charmed circle  art takes life as part of her rough material recreates it and refashions it in fresh forms is absolutely indifferent to fact invents imagines dreams and keeps between herself and reality the impenetrable barrier of beautiful style of decorative or ideal treatment  the third stage is when life gets the upper hand and drives art out into the wilderness  that is the true decadence and it is from this that we are now suffering  take the case of the english drama  at first in the hands of the monks dramatic art was abstract decorative and mythological  then she enlisted life in her service and using some of lifes external forms she created an entirely new race of beings whose sorrows were more terrible than any sorrow man has ever felt whose joys were keener than lovers joys who had the rage of the titans and the calm of the gods who had monstrous and marvellous sins monstrous and marvellous virtues to them she gave a language different from that of actual use a language full of resonant music and sweet rhythm made stately by solemn cadence or made delicate by fanciful rhyme jewelled with wonderful words and enriched with lofty diction  she clothed her children in strange raiment and gave them masks and at her bidding the antique world rose from its marble tomb  a new caesar stalked through the streets of risen rome and with purple sail and fluteled oars another cleopatra passed up the river to antioch  old myth and legend and dream took shape and substance history was entirely rewritten and there was hardly one of the dramatists who did not recognise that the object of art is not simple truth but complex beauty  in this they were perfectly right  art itself is really a form of exaggeration and selection which is the very spirit of art is nothing more than an intensified mode of overemphasis  but life soon shattered the perfection of the form  even in shakespeare we can see the beginning of the end  it shows itself by the gradual breakingup of the blankverse in the later plays by the predominance given to prose and by the overimportance assigned to characterisation the passages in shakespeareand they are manywhere the language is uncouth vulgar exaggerated fantastic obscene even are entirely due to life calling for an echo of her own voice and rejecting the intervention of beautiful style through which alone should life be suffered to find expression  shakespeare is not by any means a flawless artist  he is too fond of going directly to life and borrowing lifes natural utterance  he forgets that when art surrenders her imaginative medium she surrenders everythingthe decay of lying     life the disciple   we have all seen in our own day in england how a certain curious and fascinating type of beauty invented and emphasised by two imaginative painters has so influenced life that whenever one goes to a private view or to an artistic salon one sees here the mystic eyes of rossettis dream the long ivory throat the strange squarecut jaw the loosened shadowy hair that he so ardently loved there the sweet maidenhood of the golden stair the blossomlike mouth and weary loveliness of the laus amoris the passionpale face of andromeda the thin hands and lithe beauty of the vivian in merlins dream  and it has always been so  a great artist invents a type and life tries to copy it to reproduce it in a popular form like an enterprising publisher  neither holbein nor vandyck found in england what they have given us  they brought their types with them and life with her keen imitative faculty set herself to supply the master with models  the greeks with their quick artistic instinct understood this and set in the brides chamber the statue of hermes or of apollo that she might bear children as lovely as the works of art that she looked at in her rapture or her pain  they knew that life gains from art not merely spirituality depth of thought and feeling soulturmoil or soulpeace but that she can form herself on the very lines and colours of art and can reproduce the dignity of pheidias as well as the grace of praxiteles  hence came their objection to realism  they disliked it on purely social grounds  they felt that it inevitably makes people ugly and they were perfectly right  we try to improve the conditions of the race by means of good air free sunlight wholesome water and hideous bare buildings for the better housing of the lower orders  but these things merely produce health they do not produce beauty  for this art is required and the true disciples of the great artist are not his studioimitators but those who become like his works of art be they plastic as in greek days or pictorial as in modern times in a word life is arts best arts only pupilthe decay of lying     life the plagiarist   i once asked a lady who knew thackeray intimately whether he had had any model for becky sharp  she told me that becky was an invention but that the idea of the character had been partly suggested by a governess who lived in the neighbourhood of kensington square and was the companion of a very selfish and rich old woman  i inquired what became of the governess and she replied that oddly enough some years after the appearance of vanity fair she ran away with the nephew of the lady with whom she was living and for a short time made a great splash in society quite in mrs rawdon crawleys style and entirely by mrs rawdon crawleys methods  ultimately she came to grief disappeared to the continent and used to be occasionally seen at monte carlo and other gambling places  the noble gentleman from whom the same great sentimentalist drew colonel newcome died a few months after the newcomer had reached a fourth edition with the word adsum on his lips  shortly after mr stevenson published his curious psychological story of transformation a friend of mine called mr hyde was in the north of london and being anxious to get to a railway station took what he thought would be a short cut lost his way and found himself in a network of mean evillooking streets  feeling rather nervous he began to walk extremely fast when suddenly out of an archway ran a child right between his legs  it fell on the pavement he tripped over it and trampled upon it  being of course very much frightened and a little hurt it began to scream and in a few seconds the whole street was full of rough people who came pouring out of the houses like ants  they surrounded him and asked him his name  he was just about to give it when he suddenly remembered the opening incident in mr stevensons story  he was so filled with horror at having realised in his own person that terrible and wellwritten scene and at having done accidentally though in fact what the mr hyde of fiction had done with deliberate intent that he ran away as hard as he could go  he was however very closely followed and finally he took refuge in a surgery the door of which happened to be open where he explained to a young assistant who happened to be there exactly what had occurred  the humanitarian crowd were induced to go away on his giving them a small sum of money and as soon as the coast was clear he left  as he passed out the name on the brass doorplate of the surgery caught his eye  it was jekyll  at least it should have beenthe decay of lying     the indispensable east   what is true about the drama and the novel is no less true about those arts that we call the decorative arts  the whole history of these arts in europe is the record of the struggle between orientalism with its frank rejection of imitation its love of artistic convention its dislike to the actual representation of any object in nature and our own imitative spirit  wherever the former has been paramount as in byzantium sicily and spain by actual contact or in the rest of europe by the influence of the crusades we have had beautiful and imaginative work in which the visible things of life are transmuted into artistic conventions and the things that life has not are invented and fashioned for her delight  but wherever we have returned to life and nature our work has always become vulgar common and uninteresting  modern tapestry with its aerial effects its elaborate perspective its broad expanses of waste sky its faithful and laborious realism has no beauty whatsoever  the pictorial glass of germany is absolutely detestable  we are beginning to weave possible carpets in england but only because we have returned to the method and spirit of the east  our rugs and carpets of twenty years ago with their solemn depressing truths their inane worship of nature their sordid reproductions of visible objects have become even to the philistine a source of laughter  a cultured mahomedan once remarked to us you christians are so occupied in misinterpreting the fourth commandment that you have never thought of making an artistic application of the second  he was perfectly right and the whole truth of the matter is this the proper school to learn art in is not life but artthe decay of lying     the influence of the impressionists on climate   where if not from the impressionists do we get those wonderful brown fogs that come creeping down our streets blurring the gaslamps and changing the houses into monstrous shadows  to whom if not to them and their master do we owe the lovely silver mists that brood over our river and turn to faint forms of fading grace curved bridge and swaying barge  the extraordinary change that has taken place in the climate of london during the last ten years is entirely due to a particular school of art  you smile  consider the matter from a scientific or a metaphysical point of view and you will find that i am right  for what is nature  nature is no great mother who has borne us  she is our creation  it is in our brain that she quickens to life  things are because we see them and what we see and how we see it depends on the arts that have influenced us  to look at a thing is very different from seeing a thing  one does not see anything until one sees its beauty then and then only does it come into existence  at present people see fogs not because there are fogs but because poets and painters have taught them the mysterious loveliness of such effects  there may have been fogs for centuries in london  i dare say there were  but no one saw them and so we do not know anything about them  they did not exist till art had invented them  now it must be admitted fogs are carried to excess  they have become the mere mannerism of a clique and the exaggerated realism of their method gives dull people bronchitis  where the cultured catch an effect the uncultured catch cold  and so let us be humane and invite art to turn her wonderful eyes elsewhere  she has done so already indeed  that white quivering sunlight that one sees now in france with its strange blotches of mauve and its restless violet shadows is her latest fancy and on the whole nature reproduces it quite admirably  where she used to give us corots and daubignys she gives us now exquisite monets and entrancing pissaros  indeed there are moments rare it is true but still to be observed from time to time when nature becomes absolutely modern  of course she is not always to be relied upon  the fact is that she is in this unfortunate position  art creates an incomparable and unique effect and having done so passes on to other things  nature upon the other hand forgetting that imitation can be made the sincerest form of insult keeps on repeating this effect until we all become absolutely wearied of it  nobody of any real culture for instance ever talks nowadays about the beauty of a sunset sunsets are quite oldfashioned  they belong to the time when turner was the last note in art  to admire them is a distinct sign of provincialism of temperament  upon the other hand they go onthe decay of lying     an exposure of naturalism   after all what the imitative arts really give us are merely the various styles of particular artists or of certain schools of artists  surely you dont imagine that the people of the middle ages bore any resemblance at all to the figures on mediaeval stained glass or in mediaeval stone and wood carving or on mediaeval metalwork or tapestries or illuminated mss  they were probably very ordinarylooking people with nothing grotesque or remarkable or fantastic in their appearance  the middle ages as we know them in art are simply a definite form of style and there is no reason at all why an artist with this style should not be produced in the nineteenth century  no great artist ever sees things as they really are  if he did he would cease to be an artist  take an example from our own day  i know that you are fond of japanese things now do you really imagine that the japanese people as they are presented to us in art have any existence  if you do you have never understood japanese art at all  the japanese people are the deliberate selfconscious creation of certain individual artists  if you set a picture by hokusai or hokkei or any of the great native painters beside a real japanese gentleman or lady you will see that there is not the slightest resemblance between them  the actual people who live in japan are not unlike the general run of english people that is to say they are extremely commonplace and have nothing curious or extraordinary about them  in fact the whole of japan is a pure invention  there is no such country there are no such people  one of our most charming painters 3 went recently to the land of the chrysanthemum in the foolish hope of seeing the japanese  all he saw all he had the chance of painting were a few lanterns and some fans  he was quite unable to discover the inhabitants as his delightful exhibition at messrs dowdeswells gallery showed only too well  he did not know that the japanese people are as i have said simply a mode of style an exquisite fancy of art  and so if you desire to see a japanese effect you will not behave like a tourist and go to tokio  on the contrary you will stay at home and steep yourself in the work of certain japanese artists and then when you have absorbed the spirit of their style and caught their imaginative manner of vision you will go some afternoon and sit in the park or stroll down piccadilly and if you cannot see an absolutely japanese effect there you will not see it anywhere  or to return again to the past take as another instance the ancient greeks  do you think that greek art ever tells us what the greek people were like  do you believe that the athenian women were like the stately dignified figures of the parthenon frieze or like those marvellous goddesses who sat in the triangular pediments of the same building  if you judge from the art they certainly were so  but read an authority like aristophanes for instance  you will find that the athenian ladies laced tightly wore highheeled shoes dyed their hair yellow painted and rouged their faces and were exactly like any silly fashionable or fallen creature of our own day  the fact is that we look back on the ages entirely through the medium of art and art very fortunately has never once told us the truththe decay of lying     thomas griffiths wainewright   he was taken back to newgate preparatory to his removal to the colonies in a fanciful passage in one of his early essays he had fancied himself lying in horsemonger gaol under sentence of death for having been unable to resist the temptation of stealing some marc antonios from the british museum in order to complete his collection  the sentence now passed on him was to a man of his culture a form of death  he complained bitterly of it to his friends and pointed out with a good deal of reason some people may fancy that the money was practically his own having come to him from his mother and that the forgery such as it was had been committed thirteen years before which to use his own phrase was at least a circonstance attenuante  the permanence of personality is a very subtle metaphysical problem and certainly the english law solves the question in an extremely roughandready manner  there is however something dramatic in the fact that this heavy punishment was inflicted on him for what if we remember his fatal influence on the prose of modern journalism was certainly not the worst of all his sins  while he was in gaol dickens macready and hablot browne came across him by chance  they had been going over the prisons of london searching for artistic effects and in newgate they suddenly caught sight of wainewright  he met them with a defiant stare forster tells us but macready was horrified to recognise a man familiarly known to him in former years and at whose table he had dined  others had more curiosity and his cell was for some time a kind of fashionable lounge  many men of letters went down to visit their old literary comrade  but he was no longer the kind lighthearted janus whom charles lamb admired  he seems to have grown quite cynical  to the agent of an insurance company who was visiting him one afternoon and thought he would improve the occasion by pointing out that after all crime was a bad speculation he replied sir you city men enter on your speculations and take the chances of them  some of your speculations succeed some fail  mine happen to have failed yours happen to have succeeded  that is the only difference sir between my visitor and me  but sir i will tell you one thing in which i have succeeded to the last  i have been determined through life to hold the position of a gentleman  i have always done so  i do so still  it is the custom of this place that each of the inmates of a cell shall take his mornings turn of sweeping it out  i occupy a cell with a bricklayer and a sweep but they never offer me the broom  when a friend reproached him with the murder of helen abercrombie he shrugged his shoulders and said yes it was a dreadful thing to do but she had very thick anklespen pencil and poison     wainewright at hobart town   his love of art however never deserted him  at hobart town he started a studio and returned to sketching and portraitpainting and his conversation and manners seem not to have lost their charm  nor did he give up his habit of poisoning and there are two cases on record in which he tried to make away with people who had offended him  but his hand seems to have lost its cunning  both of his attempts were complete failures and in 1844 being thoroughly dissatisfied with tasmanian society he presented a memorial to the governor of the settlement sir john eardley wilmot praying for a ticketofleave  in it he speaks of himself as being tormented by ideas struggling for outward form and realisation barred up from increase of knowledge and deprived of the exercise of profitable or even of decorous speech  his request however was refused and the associate of coleridge consoled himself by making those marvellous paradis artificiels whose secret is only known to the eaters of opium  in 1852 he died of apoplexy his sole living companion being a cat for which he had evinced at extraordinary affection  his crimes seem to have had an important effect upon his art  they gave a strong personality to his style a quality that his early work certainly lacked  in a note to the life of dickens forster mentions that in 1847 lady blessington received from her brother major power who held a military appointment at hobart town an oil portrait of a young lady from his clever brush and it is said that he had contrived to put the expression of his own wickedness into the portrait of a nice kind hearted girl  m zola in one of his novels tells us of a young man who having committed a murder takes to art and paints greenish impressionist portraits of perfectly respectable people all of which bear a curious resemblance to his victim  the development of mr wainewrights style seems to me far more subtle and suggestive  one can fancy an intense personality being created out of sinpen pencil and poison     cardinal newman and the autobiographers   in literature mere egotism is delightful  it is what fascinates us in the letters of personalities so different as cicero and balzac flaubert and berlioz byron and madame de sevigne  whenever we come across it and strangely enough it is rather rare we cannot but welcome it and do not easily forget it  humanity will always love rousseau for having confessed his sins not to a priest but to the world and the couchant nymphs that cellini wrought in bronze for the castle of king francis the green and gold perseus even that in the open loggia at florence shows the moon the dead terror that once turned life to stone have not given it more pleasure than has that autobiography in which the supreme scoundrel of the renaissance relates the story of his splendour and his shame  the opinions the character the achievements of the man matter very little  he may be a sceptic like the gentle sieur de montaigne or a saint like the bitter son of monica but when he tells us his own secrets he can always charm our ears to listening and our lips to silence  the mode of thought that cardinal newman representedif that can be called a mode of thought which seeks to solve intellectual problems by a denial of the supremacy of the intellectmay not cannot i think survive  but the world will never weary of watching that troubled soul in its progress from darkness to darkness  the lonely church at littlemore where the breath of the morning is damp and worshippers are few will always be dear to it and whenever men see the yellow snapdragon blossoming on the wall of trinity they will think of that gracious undergraduate who saw in the flowers sure recurrence a prophecy that he would abide for ever with the benign mother of his daysa prophecy that faith in her wisdom or her folly suffered not to be fulfilled  yes autobiography is irresistiblethe critic as artist     robert browning   taken as a whole the man was great  he did not belong to the olympians and had all the incompleteness of the titan  he did not survey and it was but rarely that he could sing  his work is marred by struggle violence and effort and he passed not from emotion to form but from thought to chaos  still he was great  he has been called a thinker and was certainly a man who was always thinking and always thinking aloud but it was not thought that fascinated him but rather the processes by which thought moves  it was the machine he loved not what the machine makes  the method by which the fool arrives at his folly was as dear to him as the ultimate wisdom of the wise  so much indeed did the subtle mechanism of mind fascinate him that he despised language or looked upon it as an incomplete instrument of expression  rhyme that exquisite echo which in the muses hollow hill creates and answers its own voice rhyme which in the hands of the real artist becomes not merely a material element of metrical beauty but a spiritual element of thought and passion also waking a new mood it may be or stirring a fresh train of ideas or opening by mere sweetness and suggestion of sound some golden door at which the imagination itself had knocked in vain rhyme which can turn mans utterance to the speech of gods rhyme the one chord we have added to the greek lyre became in robert brownings hands a grotesque misshapen thing which at times made him masquerade in poetry as a low comedian and ride pegasus too often with his tongue in his cheek  there are moments when he wounds us by monstrous music  nay if he can only get his music by breaking the strings of his lute he breaks them and they snap in discord and no athenian tettix making melody from tremulous wings lights on the ivory horn to make the movement perfect or the interval less harsh  yet he was great and though he turned language into ignoble clay he made from it men and women that live  he is the most shakespearian creature since shakespeare  if shakespeare could sing with myriad lips browning could stammer through a thousand mouths  even now as i am speaking and speaking not against him but for him there glides through the room the pageant of his persons  there creeps fra lippo lippi with his cheeks still burning from some girls hot kiss  there stands dread saul with the lordly malesapphires gleaming in his turban  mildred tresham is there and the spanish monk yellow with hatred and blougram and ben ezra and the bishop of st praxeds  the spawn of setebos gibbers in the corner and sebald hearing pippa pass by looks on ottimas haggard face and loathes her and his own sin and himself  pale as the white satin of his doublet the melancholy king watches with dreamy treacherous eyes too loyal strafford pass forth to his doom and andrea shudders as he hears the cousins whistle in the garden and bids his perfect wife go down  yes browning was great  and as what will he be remembered  as a poet  ah not as a poet  he will be remembered as a writer of fiction as the most supreme writer of fiction it may be that we have ever had his sense of dramatic situation was unrivalled and if he could not answer his own problems he could at least put problems forth and what more should an artist do  considered from the point of view of a creator of character he ranks next to him who made hamlet  had he been articulate he might have sat beside him  the only man who can touch the hem of his garment is george meredith  meredith is a prose browning and so is browning he used poetry as a medium for writing in prosethe critic as artist     the two supreme and highest arts   life and literature life and the perfect expression of life  the principles of the former as laid down by the greeks we may not realise in an age so marred by false ideals as our own  the principles of the latter as they laid them down are in many cases so subtle that we can hardly understand them  recognising that the most perfect art is that which most fully mirrors man in all his infinite variety they elaborated the criticism of language considered in the light of the mere material of that art to a point to which we with our accentual system of reasonable or emotional emphasis can barely if at all attain studying for instance the metrical movements of a prose as scientifically as a modern musician studies harmony and counterpoint and i need hardly say with much keener aesthetic instinct  in this they were right as they were right in all things  since the introduction of printing and the fatal development of the habit of reading amongst the middle and lower classes of this country there has been a tendency in literature to appeal more and more to the eye and less and less to the ear which is really the sense which from the standpoint of pure art it should seek to please and by whose canons of pleasure it should abide always  even the work of mr pater who is on the whole the most perfect master of english prose now creating amongst us is often far more like a piece of mosaic than a passage in music and seems here and there to lack the true rhythmical life of words and the fine freedom and richness of effect that such rhythmical life produces  we in fact have made writing a definite mode of composition and have treated it as a form of elaborate design  the greeks upon the other hand regarded writing simply as a method of chronicling  their test was always the spoken word in its musical and metrical relations  the voice was the medium and the ear the critic  i have sometimes thought that the story of homers blindness might be really an artistic myth created in critical days and serving to remind us not merely that the great poet is always a seer seeing less with the eyes of the body than he does with the eyes of the soul but that he is a true singer also building his song out of music repeating each line over and over again to himself till he has caught the secret of its melody chaunting in darkness the words that are winged with light  certainly whether this be so or not it was to his blindness as an occasion if not as a cause that englands great poet owed much of the majestic movement and sonorous splendour of his later verse  when milton could no longer write he began to singthe critic as artist     the secrets of immortality   on the mouldering citadel of troy lies the lizard like a thing of green bronze  the owl has built her nest in the palace of priam  over the empty plain wander shepherd and goatherd with their flocks and where on the winesurfaced oily sea greek text as homer calls it copperprowed and streaked with vermilion the great galleys of the danaoi came in their gleaming crescent the lonely tunnyfisher sits in his little boat and watches the bobbing corks of his net  yet every morning the doors of the city are thrown open and on foot or in horse drawn chariot the warriors go forth to battle and mock their enemies from behind their iron masks  all day long the fight rages and when night comes the torches gleam by the tents and the cresset burns in the hall  those who live in marble or on painted panel know of life but a single exquisite instant eternal indeed in its beauty but limited to one note of passion or one mood of calm  those whom the poet makes live have their myriad emotions of joy and terror of courage and despair of pleasure and of suffering  the seasons come and go in glad or saddening pageant and with winged or leaden feet the years pass by before them they have their youth and their manhood they are children and they grow old  it is always dawn for st helena as veronese saw her at the window  through the still morning air the angels bring her the symbol of gods pain  the cool breezes of the morning lift the gilt threads from her brow  on that little hill by the city of florence where the lovers of giorgione are lying it is always the solstice of noon of noon made so languorous by summer suns that hardly can the slim naked girl dip into the marble tank the round bubble of clear glass and the long fingers of the luteplayer rest idly upon the chords  it is twilight always for the dancing nymphs whom corot set free among the silver poplars of france  in eternal twilight they move those frail diaphanous figures whose tremulous white feet seem not to touch the dewdrenched grass they tread on  but those who walk in epos drama or romance see through the labouring months the young moons wax and wane and watch the night from evening unto morning star and from sunrise unto sunsetting can note the shifting day with all its gold and shadow  for them as for us the flowers bloom and wither and the earth that greentressed goddess as coleridge calls her alters her raiment for their pleasure  the statue is concentrated to one moment of perfection  the image stained upon the canvas possesses no spiritual element of growth or change  if they know nothing of death it is because they know little of life for the secrets of life and death belong to those and those only whom the sequence of time affects and who possess not merely the present but the future and can rise or fall from a past of glory or of shame  movement that problem of the visible arts can be truly realised by literature alone it is literature that shows us the body in its swiftness and the soul in its unrestthe critic as artist     the critic and his material   who cares whether mr ruskins views on turner are sound or not  what does it matter  that mighty and majestic prose of his so fervid and so fierycoloured in its noble eloquence so rich in its elaborate symphonic music so sure and certain at its best in subtle choice of word and epithet is at least as great a work of art as any of those wonderful sunsets that bleach or rot on their corrupted canvases in englands gallery greater indeed one is apt to think at times not merely because its equal beauty is more enduring but on account of the fuller variety of its appeal soul speaking to soul in those longcadenced lines not through form and colour alone though through these indeed completely and without loss but with intellectual and emotional utterance with lofty passion and with loftier thought with imaginative insight and with poetic aim greater i always think even as literature is the greater art  who again cares whether mr pater has put into the portrait of monna lisa something that lionardo never dreamed of  the painter may have been merely the slave of an archaic smile as some have fancied but whenever i pass into the cool galleries of the palace of the louvre and stand before that strange figure set in its marble chair in that cirque of fantastic rocks as in some faint light under sea i murmur to myself she is older than the rocks among which she sits like the vampire she has been dead many times and learned the secrets of the grave and has been a diver in deep seas and keeps their fallen day about her and trafficked for strange webs with eastern merchants and as leda was the mother of helen of troy and as st anne the mother of mary and all this has been to her but as the sound of lyres and flutes and lives only in the delicacy with which it has moulded the changing lineaments and tinged the eyelids and the hands  and i say to my friend the presence that thus so strangely rose beside the waters is expressive of what in the ways of a thousand years man had come to desire and he answers me hers is the head upon which all the ends of the world are come and the eyelids are a little weary  and so the picture becomes more wonderful to us than it really is and reveals to us a secret of which in truth it knows nothing and the music of the mystical prose is as sweet in our ears as was that flute players music that lent to the lips of la gioconda those subtle and poisonous curves  do you ask me what lionardo would have said had any one told him of this picture that all the thoughts and experience of the world had etched and moulded therein that which they had of power to refine and make expressive the outward form the animalism of greece the lust of rome the reverie of the middle age with its spiritual ambition and imaginative loves the return of the pagan world the sins of the borgias  he would probably have answered that he had contemplated none of these things but had concerned himself simply with certain arrangements of lines and masses and with new and curious colourharmonies of blue and green  and it is for this very reason that the criticism which i have quoted is criticism of the highest kind  it treats the work of art simply as a startingpoint for a new creation  it does not confine itselflet us at least suppose so for the momentto discovering the real intention of the artist and accepting that as final and in this it is right for the meaning of any beautiful created thing is at least as much in the soul of him who looks at it as it was in his soul who wrought it  nay it is rather the beholder who lends to the beautiful thing its myriad meanings and makes it marvellous for us and sets it in some new relation to the age so that it becomes a vital portion of our lives and a symbol of what we pray for or perhaps of what having prayed for we fear that we may receivethe critic as artist     dante the living guide   there is no mood or passion that art cannot give us and those of us who have discovered her secret can settle beforehand what our experiences are going to be  we can choose our day and select our hour  we can say to ourselves tomorrow at dawn we shall walk with grave virgil through the valley of the shadow of death and lo the dawn finds us in the obscure wood and the mantuan stands by our side  we pass through the gate of the legend fatal to hope and with pity or with joy behold the horror of another world  the hypocrites go by with their painted faces and their cowls of gilded lead  out of the ceaseless winds that drive them the carnal look at us and we watch the heretic rending his flesh and the glutton lashed by the rain  we break the withered branches from the tree in the grove of the harpies and each dullhued poisonous twig bleeds with red blood before us and cries aloud with bitter cries  out of a horn of fire odysseus speaks to us and when from his sepulchre of flame the great ghibelline rises the pride that triumphs over the torture of that bed becomes ours for a moment  through the dim purple air fly those who have stained the world with the beauty of their sin and in the pit of loathsome disease dropsystricken and swollen of body into the semblance of a monstrous lute lies adamo di brescia the coiner of false coin  he bids us listen to his misery we stop and with dry and gaping lips he tells us how he dreams day and night of the brooks of clear water that in cool dewy channels gush down the green casentine hills  sinon the false greek of troy mocks at him  he smites him in the face and they wrangle  we are fascinated by their shame and loiter till virgil chides us and leads us away to that city turreted by giants where great nimrod blows his horn  terrible things are in store for us and we go to meet them in dantes raiment and with dantes heart we traverse the marshes of the styx and argenti swims to the boat through the slimy waves  he calls to us and we reject him  when we hear the voice of his agony we are glad and virgil praises us for the bitterness of our scorn  we tread upon the cold crystal of cocytus in which traitors stick like straws in glass  our foot strikes against the head of bocca  he will not tell us his name and we tear the hair in handfuls from the screaming skull  alberigo prays us to break the ice upon his face that he may weep a little  we pledge our word to him and when he has uttered his dolorous tale we deny the word that we have spoken and pass from him such cruelty being courtesy indeed for who more base than he who has mercy for the condemned of god  in the jaws of lucifer we see the man who sold christ and in the jaws of lucifer the men who slew caesar  we tremble and come forth to rebehold the starsthe critic as artist     the limitations of genius   the appeal of all art is simply to the artistic temperament  art does not address herself to the specialist  her claim is that she is universal and that in all her manifestations she is one  indeed so far from its being true that the artist is the best judge of art a really great artist can never judge of other peoples work at all and can hardly in fact judge of his own  that very concentration of vision that makes a man an artist limits by its sheer intensity his faculty of fine appreciation  the energy of creation hurries him blindly on to his own goal  the wheels of his chariot raise the dust as a cloud around him  the gods are hidden from each other  they can recognise their worshippers  that is all    wordsworth saw in endymion merely a pretty piece of paganism and shelley with his dislike of actuality was deaf to wordsworths message being repelled by its form and byron that great passionate human incomplete creature could appreciate neither the poet of the cloud nor the poet of the lake and the wonder of keats was hidden from him  the realism of euripides was hateful to sophokles those droppings of warm tears had no music for him  milton with his sense of the grand style could not understand the method of shakespeare any more than could sir joshua the method of gainsborough  bad artists always admire each others work  they call it being largeminded and free from prejudice  but a truly great artist cannot conceive of life being shown or beauty fashioned under any conditions other than those that he has selected  creation employs all its critical faculty within its own sphere  it may not use it in the sphere that belongs to others it is exactly because a man cannot do a thing that he is the proper judge of itthe critic as artist     wanted a new background   he who would stir us now by fiction must either give us an entirely new background or reveal to us the soul of man in its innermost workings the first is for the moment being done for us by mr rudyard kipling  as one turns over the pages of his plain tales from the hills one feels as if one were seated under a palmtree reading life by superb flashes of vulgarity  the bright colours of the bazaars dazzle ones eyes  the jaded secondrate angloindians are in exquisite incongruity with their surroundings  the mere lack of style in the storyteller gives an odd journalistic realism to what he tells us  from the point of view of literature mr kipling is a genius who drops his aspirates  from the point of view of life he is a reporter who knows vulgarity better than any one has ever known it  dickens knew its clothes and its comedy  mr kipling knows its essence and its seriousness  he is our first authority on the secondrate and has seen marvellous things through keyholes and his backgrounds are real works of art  as for the second condition we have had browning and meredith is with us  but there is still much to be done in the sphere of introspection  people sometimes say that fiction is getting too morbid  as far as psychology is concerned it has never been morbid enough  we have merely touched the surface of the soul that is all  in one single ivory cell of the brain there are stored away things more marvellous and more terrible than even they have dreamed of who like the author of le rouge et le noir have sought to track the soul into its most secret places and to make life confess its dearest sins  still there is a limit even to the number of untried backgrounds and it is possible that a further development of the habit of introspection may prove fatal to that creative faculty to which it seeks to supply fresh material  i myself am inclined to think that creation is doomed  it springs from too primitive too natural an impulse  however this may be it is certain that the subjectmatter at the disposal of creation is always diminishing while the subjectmatter of criticism increases daily  there are always new attitudes for the mind and new points of view  the duty of imposing form upon chaos does not grow less as the world advances  there was never a time when criticism was more needed than it is now  it is only by its means that humanity can become conscious of the point at which it has arrivedthe critic as artist     without frontiers   goetheyou will not misunderstand what i saywas a german of the germans  he loved his countryno man more so  its people were dear to him and he led them  yet when the iron hoof of napoleon trampled upon vineyard and cornfield his lips were silent  how can one write songs of hatred without hating he said to eckermann and how could i to whom culture and barbarism are alone of importance hate a nation which is among the most cultivated of the earth and to which i owe so great a part of my own cultivation  this note sounded in the modern world by goethe first will become i think the starting point for the cosmopolitanism of the future  criticism will annihilate raceprejudices by insisting upon the unity of the human mind in the variety of its forms  if we are tempted to make war upon another nation we shall remember that we are seeking to destroy an element of our own culture and possibly its most important element  as long as war is regarded as wicked it will always have its fascination  when it is looked upon as vulgar it will cease to be popular  the change will of course be slow and people will not be conscious of it  they will not say we will not war against france because her prose is perfect but because the prose of france is perfect they will not hate the land intellectual criticism will bind europe together in bonds far closer than those that can be forged by shopman or sentimentalist  it will give us the peace that springs from understandingthe critic as artist     the poetry of archaeology   infessura tells us that in 1485 some workmen digging on the appian way came across an old roman sarcophagus inscribed with the name julia daughter of claudius  on opening the coffer they found within its marble womb the body of a beautiful girl of about fifteen years of age preserved by the embalmers skill from corruption and the decay of time her eyes were half open her hair rippled round her in crisp curling gold and from her lips and cheek the bloom of maidenhood had not yet departed  borne back to the capitol she became at once the centre of a new cult and from all parts of the city crowded pilgrims to worship at the wonderful shrine till the pope fearing lest those who had found the secret of beauty in a pagan tomb might forget what secrets judaeas rough and rockhewn sepulchre contained had the body conveyed away by night and in secret buried  legend though it may be yet the story is none the less valuable as showing us the attitude of the renaissance towards the antique world  archaeology to them was not a mere science for the antiquarian it was a means by which they could touch the dry dust of antiquity into the very breath and beauty of life and fill with the new wine of romanticism forms that else had been old and outworn  from the pulpit of niccola pisano down to mantegnas triumph of caesar and the service cellini designed for king francis the influence of this spirit can be traced nor was it confined merely to the immobile artsthe arts of arrested movementbut its influence was to be seen also in the great graecoroman masques which were the constant amusement of the gay courts of the time and in the public pomps and processions with which the citizens of big commercial towns were wont to greet the princes that chanced to visit them pageants by the way which were considered so important that large prints were made of them and publisheda fact which is a proof of the general interest at the time in matters of such kindthe truth of masks     the art of archaeology   indeed archaeology is only really delightful when transfused into some form of art  i have no desire to underrate the services of laborious scholars but i feel that the use keats made of lemprieres dictionary is of far more value to us than professor max mullers treatment of the same mythology as a disease of language  better endymion than any theory however sound or as in the present instance unsound of an epidemic among adjectives  and who does not feel that the chief glory of piranesis book on vases is that it gave keats the suggestion for his ode on a grecian urn  art and art only can make archaeology beautiful and the theatric art can use it most directly and most vividly for it can combine in one exquisite presentation the illusion of actual life with the wonder of the unreal world  but the sixteenth century was not merely the age of vitruvius it was the age of vecellio also  every nation seems suddenly to have become interested in the dress of its neighbours  europe began to investigate its own clothes and the amount of books published on national costumes is quite extraordinary  at the beginning of the century the nuremberg chronicle with its two thousand illustrations reached its fifth edition and before the century was over seventeen editions were published of munsters cosmography besides these two books there were also the works of michael colyns of hans weigel of amman and of vecellio himself all of them well illustrated some of the drawings in vecellio being probably from the hand of titian  nor was it merely from books and treatises that they acquired their knowledge  the development of the habit of foreign travel the increased commercial intercourse between countries and the frequency of diplomatic missions gave every nation many opportunities of studying the various forms of contemporary dress  after the departure from england for instance of the ambassadors from the czar the sultan and the prince of morocco henry the eighth and his friends gave several masques in the strange attire of their visitors  later on london saw perhaps too often the sombre splendour of the spanish court and to elizabeth came envoys from all lands whose dress shakespeare tells us had an important influence on english costumethe truth of masks     herod suppliant   non non vous ne voulez pas cela  vous me dites cela seulement pour

away many merchants some to traffic for amber with the rough fisherfolk of the north seas some to egypt to look for that curious green turquoise which is found only in the tombs of kings and is said to possess magical properties some to persia for silken carpets and painted pottery and others to india to buy gauze and stained ivory moonstones and bracelets of jade sandalwood and blue enamel and shawls of fine wool  but what had occupied him most was the robe he was to wear at his coronation the robe of tissued gold and the rubystudded crown and the sceptre with its rows and rings of pearls  indeed it was of this that he was thinking tonight as he lay back on his luxurious couch watching the great pinewood log that was burning itself out on the open hearth the designs which were from the hands of the most famous artists of the time had been submitted to him many months before and he had given orders that the artificers were to toil night and day to carry them out and that the whole world was to be searched for jewels that would be worthy of their work  he saw himself in fancy standing at the high altar of the cathedral in the fair raiment of a king and a smile played and lingered about his boyish lips and lit up with a bright lustre his dark woodland eyes  after some time he rose from his seat and leaning against the carved penthouse of the chimney looked round at the dimlylit room  the walls were hung with rich tapestries representing the triumph of beauty  a large press inlaid with agate and lapislazuli filled one corner and facing the window stood a curiously wrought cabinet with lacquer panels of powdered and mosaiced gold on which were placed some delicate goblets of venetian glass and a cup of darkveined onyx  pale poppies were broidered on the silk coverlet of the bed as though they had fallen from the tired hands of sleep and tall reeds of fluted ivory bare up the velvet canopy from which great tufts of ostrich plumes sprang like white foam to the pallid silver of the fretted ceiling  a laughing narcissus in green bronze held a polished mirror above its head  on the table stood a flat bowl of amethyst  outside he could see the huge dome of the cathedral looming like a bubble over the shadowy houses and the weary sentinels pacing up and down on the misty terrace by the river  far away in an orchard a nightingale was singing  a faint perfume of jasmine came through the open window  he brushed his brown curls back from his forehead and taking up a lute let his fingers stray across the cords  his heavy eyelids drooped and a strange languor came over him  never before had he felt so keenly or with such exquisite joy the magic and the mystery of beautiful things  when midnight sounded from the clocktower he touched a bell and his pages entered and disrobed him with much ceremony pouring rosewater over his hands and strewing flowers on his pillow  a few moments after that they had left the room he fell asleepthe young king     a coronation   and when the bishop had heard them he knit his brows and said my son i am an old man and in the winter of my days and i know that many evil things are done in the wide world  the fierce robbers come down from the mountains and carry off the little children and sell them to the moors the lions lie in wait for the caravans and leap upon the camels  the wild boar roots up the corn in the valley and the foxes gnaw the vines upon the hill  the pirates lay waste the seacoast and burn the ships of the fishermen and take their nets from them  in the saltmarshes live the lepers they have houses of wattled reeds and none may come nigh them  the beggars wander through the cities and eat their food with the dogs  canst thou make these things not to be  wilt thou take the leper for thy bedfellow and set the beggar at thy board  shall the lion do thy bidding and the wild boar obey thee  is not he who made misery wiser than thou art  wherefore i praise thee not for this that thou hast done but i bid thee ride back to the palace and make thy face glad and put on the raiment that beseemeth a king and with the crown of gold i will crown thee and the sceptre of pearl will i place in thy hand  and as for thy dreams think no more of them  the burden of this world is too great for one man to bear and the worlds sorrow too heavy for one heart to suffer  sayest thou that in this house said the young king and he strode past the bishop and climbed up the steps of the altar and stood before the image of christ  he stood before the image of christ and on his right hand and on his left were the marvellous vessels of gold the chalice with the yellow wine and the vial with the holy oil  he knelt before the image of christ and the great candles burned brightly by the jewelled shrine and the smoke of the incense curled in thin blue wreaths through the dome  he bowed his head in prayer and the priests in their stiff copes crept away from the altar  and suddenly a wild tumult came from the street outside and in entered the nobles with drawn swords and nodding plumes and shields of polished steel  where is this dreamer of dreams they cried  where is this king who is apparelled like a beggarthis boy who brings shame upon our state  surely we will slay him for he is unworthy to rule over us  and the young king bowed his head again and prayed and when he had finished his prayer he rose up and turning round he looked at them sadly  and lo through the painted windows came the sunlight streaming upon him and the sunbeams wove round him a tissued robe that was fairer than the robe that had been fashioned for his pleasure  the dead staff blossomed and bare lilies that were whiter than pearls  the dry thorn blossomed and bare roses that were redder than rubies  whiter than fine pearls were the lilies and their stems were of bright silver  redder than male rubies were the roses and their leaves were of beaten gold  he stood there in the raiment of a king and the gates of the jewelled shrine flew open and from the crystal of the manyrayed monstrance shone a marvellous and mystical light  he stood there in a kings raiment and the glory of god filled the place and the saints in their carven niches seemed to move  in the fair raiment of a king he stood before them and the organ pealed out its music and the trumpeters blew upon their trumpets and the singing boys sang  and the people fell upon their knees in awe and the nobles sheathed their swords and did homage and the bishops face grew pale and his hands trembled  a greater than i hath crowned thee he cried and he knelt before him  and the young king came down from the high altar and passed home through the midst of the people  but no man dared look upon his face for it was like the face of an angelthe young king     the king of spain   from a window in the palace the sad melancholy king watched them  behind him stood his brother don pedro of aragon whom he hated and his confessor the grand inquisitor of granada sat by his side  sadder even than usual was the king for as he looked at the infanta bowing with childish gravity to the assembling counters or laughing behind her fan at the grim duchess of albuquerque who always accompanied her he thought of the young queen her mother who but a short time beforeso it seemed to himhad come from the gay country of france and had withered away in the sombre splendour of the spanish court dying just six months after the birth of her child and before she had seen the almonds blossom twice in the orchard or plucked the second years fruit from the old gnarled figtree that stood in the centre of the now grassgrown courtyard  so great had been his love for her that he had not suffered even the grave to hide her from him  she had been embalmed by a moorish physician who in return for this service had been granted his life which for heresy and suspicion of magical practices had been already forfeited men said to the holy office and her body was still lying on its tapestried bier in the black marble chapel of the palace just as the monks had borne her in on that windy march day nearly twelve years before  once every month the king wrapped in a dark cloak and with a muffled lantern in his hand went in and knelt by her side calling out mi reina  mi reina and sometimes breaking through the formal etiquette that in spain governs every separate action of life and sets limits even to the sorrow of a king he would clutch at the pale jewelled hands in a wild agony of grief and try to wake by his mad kisses the cold painted face  today he seemed to see her again as he had seen her first at the castle of fontainebleau when he was but fifteen years of age and she still younger  they had been formally betrothed on that occasion by the papal nuncio in the presence of the french king and all the court and he had returned to the escurial bearing with him a little ringlet of yellow hair and the memory of two childish lips bending down to kiss his hand as he stepped into his carriage  later on had followed the marriage hastily performed at burgos a small town on the frontier between the two countries and the grand public entry into madrid with the customary celebration of high mass at the church of la atocha and a more than usually solemn autodafe in which nearly three hundred heretics amongst whom were many englishmen had been delivered over to the secular arm to be burned  certainly he had loved her madly and to the ruin many thought of his country then at war with england for the possession of the empire of the new world  he had hardly ever permitted her to be out of his sight for her he had forgotten or seemed to have forgotten all grave affairs of state and with that terrible blindness that passion brings upon its servants he had failed to notice that the elaborate ceremonies by which he sought to please her did but aggravate the strange malady from which she suffered  when she died he was for a time like one bereft of reason  indeed there is no doubt but that he would have formally abdicated and retired to the great trappist monastery at granada of which he was already titular prior had he not been afraid to leave the little infanta at the mercy of his brother whose cruelty even in spain was notorious and who was suspected by many of having caused the queens death by means of a pair of poisoned gloves that he had presented to her on the occasion of her visiting his castle in aragon  even after the expiration of the three years of public mourning that he had ordained throughout his whole dominions by royal edict he would never suffer his ministers to speak about any new alliance and when the emperor himself sent to him and offered him the hand of the lovely archduchess of bohemia his niece in marriage he bade the ambassadors tell their master that the king of spain was already wedded to sorrow and that though she was but a barren bride he loved her better than beauty an answer that cost his crown the rich provinces of the netherlands which soon after at the emperors instigation revolted against him under the leadership of some fanatics of the reformed churchthe birthday of the infranta     a bull fight   a procession of noble boys fantastically dressed as toreadors came out to meet her and the young count of tierranueva a wonderfully handsome lad of about fourteen years of age uncovering his head with all the grace of a born hidalgo and grandee of spain led her solemnly in to a little gilt and ivory chair that was placed on a raised dais above the arena  the children grouped themselves all round fluttering their big fans and whispering to each other and don pedro and the grand inquisitor stood laughing at the entrance  even the duchessthe camereramayor as she was calleda thin hardfeatured woman with a yellow ruff did not look quite so badtempered as usual and something like a chill smile flitted across her wrinkled face and twitched her thin bloodless lips  it certainly was a marvellous bullfight and much nicer the infanta thought than the real bullfight that she had been brought to see at seville on the occasion of the visit of the duke of parma to her father some of the boys pranced about on richlycaparisoned hobbyhorses brandishing long javelins with gay streamers of bright ribands attached to them others went on foot waving their scarlet cloaks before the bull and vaulting lightly over the barrier when he charged them and as for the bull himself he was just like a live bull though he was only made of wickerwork and stretched hide and sometimes insisted on running round the arena on his hind legs which no live bull ever dreams of doing  he made a splendid fight of it too and the children got so excited that they stood up upon the benches and waved their lace handkerchiefs and cried out bravo toro  bravo toro just as sensibly as if they had been grownup people  at last however after a prolonged combat during which several of the hobbyhorses were gored through and through and their riders dismounted the young count of tierranueva brought the bull to his knees and having obtained permission from the infanta to give the coup de grace he plunged his wooden sword into the neck of the animal with such violence that the head came right off and disclosed the laughing face of little monsieur de lorraine the son of the french ambassador at madrid  the arena was then cleared amidst much applause and the dead hobbyhorses dragged solemnly away by two moorish pages in yellow and black liveries and after a short interlude during which a french posturemaster performed upon the tightrope some italian puppets appeared in the semiclassical tragedy of sophonisba on the stage of a small theatre that had been built up for the purpose  they acted so well and their gestures were so extremely natural that at the close of the play the eyes of the infanta were quite dim with tears  indeed some of the children really cried and had to be comforted with sweetmeats and the grand inquisitor himself was so affected that he could not help saying to don pedro that it seemed to him intolerable that things made simply out of wood and coloured wax and worked mechanically by wires should be so unhappy and meet with such terrible misfortunesthe birthday of the infanta     the throne room   it was a throneroom used for the reception of foreign ambassadors when the king which of late had not been often consented to give them a personal audience the same room in which many years before envoys had appeared from england to make arrangements for the marriage of their queen then one of the catholic sovereigns of europe with the emperors eldest son  the hangings were of gilt cordovan leather and a heavy gilt chandelier with branches for three hundred wax lights hung down from the black and white ceiling  underneath a great canopy of gold cloth on which the lions and towers of castile were broidered in seed pearls stood the throne itself covered with a rich pall of black velvet studded with silver tulips and elaborately fringed with silver and pearls  on the second step of the throne was placed the kneelingstool of the infanta with its cushion of cloth of silver tissue and below that again and beyond the limit of the canopy stood the chair for the papal nuncio who alone had the right to be seated in the kings presence on the occasion of any public ceremonial and whose cardinals hat with its tangled scarlet tassels lay on a purple tabouret in front  on the wall facing the throne hung a lifesized portrait of charles v in hunting dress with a great mastiff by his side and a picture of philip ii receiving the homage of the netherlands occupied the centre of the other wall  between the windows stood a black ebony cabinet inlaid with plates of ivory on which the figures from holbeins dance of death had been gravedby the hand some said of that famous master himself  but the little dwarf cared nothing for all this magnificence  he would not have given his rose for all the pearls on the canopy nor one white petal of his rose for the throne itself  what he wanted was to see the infanta before she went down to the pavilion and to ask her to come away with him when he had finished his dance  here in the palace the air was close and heavy but in the forest the wind blew free and the sunlight with wandering hands of gold moved the tremulous leaves aside there were flowers too in the forest not so splendid perhaps as the flowers in the garden but more sweetly scented for all that hyacinths in early spring that flooded with waving purple the cool glens and grassy knolls yellow primroses that nestled in little clumps round the gnarled roots of the oaktrees bright celandine and blue speedwell and irises lilac and gold  there were grey catkins on the hazels and the foxgloves drooped with the weight of their dappled beehaunted cells  the chestnut had its spires of white stars and the hawthorn its pallid moons of beauty  yes surely she would come if he could only find her  she would come with him to the fair forest and all day long he would dance for her delight  a smile lit up his eyes at the thought and he passed into the next room  of all the rooms this was the brightest and the most beautiful  the walls were covered with a pinkflowered lucca damask patterned with birds and dotted with dainty blossoms of silver the furniture was of massive silver festooned with florid wreaths and swinging cupids in front of the two large fireplaces stood great screens broidered with parrots and peacocks and the floor which was of seagreen onyx seemed to stretch far away into the distance  nor was he alone  standing under the shadow of the doorway at the extreme end of the room he saw a little figure watching him  his heart trembled a cry of joy broke from his lips and he moved out into the sunlight  as he did so the figure moved out also and he saw it plainlythe birthday of the infanta     a protected country   the kings of each city levied tolls on us but would not suffer us to enter their gates  they threw us bread over the walls little maizecakes baked in honey and cakes of fine flour filled with dates  for every hundred baskets we gave them a bead of amber  when the dwellers in the villages saw us coming they poisoned the wells and fled to the hillsummits  we fought with the magadae who are born old and grow younger and younger every year and die when they are little children and with the laktroi who say that they are the sons of tigers and paint themselves yellow and black and with the aurantes who bury their dead on the tops of trees and themselves live in dark caverns lest the sun who is their god should slay them and with the krimnians who worship a crocodile and give it earrings of green glass and feed it with butter and fresh fowls and with the agazonbae who are dogfaced and with the sibans who have horses feet and run more swiftly than horses  a third of our company died in battle and a third died of want the rest murmured against me and said that i had brought them an evil fortune  i took a horned adder from beneath a stone and let it sting me when they saw that i did not sicken they grew afraid  in the fourth month we reached the city of illel  it was nighttime when we came to the grove that is outside the walls and the air was sultry for the moon was travelling in scorpion  we took the ripe pomegranates from the trees and brake them and drank their sweet juices  then we lay down on our carpets and waited for the dawn  and at dawn we rose and knocked at the gate of the city  it was wrought out of red bronze and carved with seadragons and dragons that have wings  the guards looked down from the battlements and asked us our business  the interpreter of the caravan answered that we had come from the island of syria with much merchandise  they took hostages and told us that they would open the gate to us at noon and bade us tarry till then  when it was noon they opened the gate and as we entered in the people came crowding out of the houses to look at us and a crier went round the city crying through a shell  we stood in the marketplace and the negroes uncorded the bales of figured cloths and opened the carved chests of sycamore  and when they had ended their task the merchants set forth their strange wares the waxed linen from egypt and the painted linen from the country of the ethiops the purple sponges from tyre and the blue hangings from sidon the cups of cold amber and the fine vessels of glass and the curious vessels of burnt clay  from the roof of a house a company of women watched us  one of them wore a mask of gilded leather  and on the first day the priests came and bartered with us and on the second day came the nobles and on the third day came the craftsmen and the slaves  and this is their custom with all merchants as long as they tarry in the city  and we tarried for a moon and when the moon was waning i wearied and wandered away through the streets of the city and came to the garden of its god  the priests in their yellow robes moved silently through the green trees and on a pavement of black marble stood the rosered house in which the god had his dwelling  its doors were of powdered lacquer and bulls and peacocks were wrought on them in raised and polished gold the tilted roof was of seagreen porcelain and the jutting eaves were festooned with little bells  when the white doves flew past they struck the bells with their wings and made them tinkle  in front of the temple was a pool of clear water paved with veined onyx i lay down beside it and with my pale fingers i touched the broad leaves  one of the priests came towards me and stood behind me  he had sandals on his feet one of soft serpentskin and the other of birds plumage  on his head was a mitre of black felt decorated with silver crescents  seven yellows were woven into his robe and his frizzed hair was stained with antimony  after a little while he spake to me and asked me my desire  i told him that my desire was to see the godthe fisherman and his soul     the blackmailing of the emperor   as soon as the man was dead the emperor turned to me and when he had wiped away the bright sweat from his brow with a little napkin of purfled and purple silk he said to me art thou a prophet that i may not harm thee or the son of a prophet that i can do thee no hurt  i pray thee leave my city tonight for while thou art in it i am no longer its lord  and i answered him i will go for half of thy treasure  give me half of thy treasure and i will go away  he took me by the hand and led me out into the garden  when the captain of the guard saw me he wondered  when the eunuchs saw me their knees shook and they fell upon the ground in fear  there is a chamber in the palace that has eight walls of red porphyry and a brasssealed ceiling hung with lamps  the emperor touched one of the walls and it opened and we passed down a corridor that was lit with many torches  in niches upon each side stood great winejars filled to the brim with silver pieces  when we reached the centre of the corridor the emperor spake the word that may not be spoken and a granite door swung back on a secret spring and he put his hands before his face lest his eyes should be dazzled  thou couldst not believe how marvellous a place it was  there were huge tortoiseshells full of pearls and hollowed moonstones of great size piled up with red rubies  the gold was stored in coffers of elephant hide and the golddust in leather bottles  there were opals and sapphires the former in cups of crystal and the latter in cups of jade round green emeralds were ranged in order upon thin plates of ivory and in one corner were silk bags filled some with turquoisestones and others with beryls  the ivory horns were heaped with purple amethysts and the horns of brass with chalcedonies and sards  the pillars which were of cedar were hung with strings of yellow lynxstones  in the flat oval shields there were carbuncles both winecoloured and coloured like grass  and yet i have told thee but a tithe of what was there  and when the emperor had taken away his hands from before his face he said to me this is my house of treasure and half that is in it is thine even as i promised to thee  and i will give thee camels and camel drivers and they shall do thy bidding and take thy share of the treasure to whatever part of the world thou desirest to go  and the thing shall be done tonight for i would not that the sun who is my father should see that there is in my city a man whom i cannot slay  but i answered him the gold that is here is thine and the silver also is thine and thine are the precious jewels and the things of price  as for me i have no need of these  nor shall i take aught from thee but that little ring that thou wearest on the finger of thy hand  and the emperor frowned  it is but a ring of lead he cried nor has it any value  therefore take thy half of the treasure and go from my city  nay i answered but i will take nought but that leaden ring for i know what is written within it and for what purpose  and the emperor trembled and besought me and said take all the treasure and go from my city  the half that is mine shall be thine also  and i did a strange thing but what i did matters not for in a cave that is but a days journey from this place have i hidden the ring of riches  it is but a days journey from this place and it waits for thy coming  he who has this ring is richer than all the kings of the world come therefore and take it and the worlds riches shall be thinethe fisherman and his soul     covent garden   where he went he hardly knew  he had a dim memory of wandering through a labyrinth of sordid houses of being lost in a giant web of sombre streets and it was bright dawn when he found himself at last in piccadilly circus  as he strolled home towards belgrave square he met the great waggons on their way to covent garden  the whitesmocked carters with their pleasant sunburnt faces and coarse curly hair strode sturdily on cracking their whips and calling out now and then to each other on the back of a huge grey horse the leader of a jangling team sat a chubby boy with a bunch of primroses in his battered hat keeping tight hold of the mane with his little hands and laughing and the great piles of vegetables looked like masses of jade against the morning sky like masses of green jade against the pink petals of some marvellous rose  lord arthur felt curiously affected he could not tell why  there was something in the dawns delicate loveliness that seemed to him inexpressibly pathetic and he thought of all the days that break in beauty and that set in storm  these rustics too with their rough goodhumoured voices and their nonchalant ways what a strange london they saw  a london free from the sin of night and the smoke of day a pallid ghostlike city a desolate town of tombs  he wondered what they thought of it and whether they knew anything of its splendour and its shame of its fierce fierycoloured joys and its horrible hunger of all it makes and mars from morn to eve  probably it was to them merely a mart where they brought their fruits to sell and where they tarried for a few hours at most leaving the streets still silent the houses still asleep  it gave him pleasure to watch them as they went by  rude as they were with their heavy hobnailed shoes and their awkward gait they brought a little of a ready with them  he felt that they had lived with nature and that she had taught them peace  he envied them all that they did not know  by the time he had reached belgrave square the sky was a faint blue and the birds were beginning to twitter in the gardenslord arthur saviles crime     a letter from miss jane percy to her aunt   the deanery chichester  27th may  my dearest aunt  thank you so much for the flannel for the dorcas society and also for the gingham  i quite agree with you that it is nonsense their wanting to wear pretty things but everybody is so radical and irreligious nowadays that it is difficult to make them see that they should not try and dress like the upper classes  i am sure i dont know what we are coming to  as papa has often said in his sermons we live in an age of unbelief  we have had great fun over a clock that an unknown admirer sent papa last thursday  it arrived in a wooden box from london carriage paid and papa feels it must have been sent by some one who had read his remarkable sermon is licence liberty for on the top of the clock was a figure of a woman with what papa said was the cap of liberty on her head  i didnt think it very becoming myself but papa said it was historical so i suppose it is all right  parker unpacked it and papa put it on the mantelpiece in the library and we were all sitting there on friday morning when just as the clock struck twelve we heard a whirring noise a little puff of smoke came from the pedestal of the figure and the goddess of liberty fell off and broke her nose on the fender  maria was quite alarmed but it looked so ridiculous that james and i went off into fits of laughter and even papa was amused  when we examined it we found it was a sort of alarum clock and that if you set it to a particular hour and put some gunpowder and a cap under a little hammer it went off whenever you wanted  papa said it must not remain in the library as it made a noise so reggie carried it away to the schoolroom and does nothing but have small explosions all day long  do you think arthur would like one for a wedding present  i suppose they are quite fashionable in london  papa says they should do a great deal of good as they show that liberty cant last but must fall down  papa says liberty was invented at the time of the french revolution  how awful it seems  i have now to go to the dorcas where i will read them your most instructive letter  how true dear aunt your idea is that in their rank of life they should wear what is unbecoming  i must say it is absurd their anxiety about dress when there are so many more important things in this world and in the next  i am so glad your flowered poplin turned out so well and that your lace was not torn  i am wearing my yellow satin that you so kindly gave me at the bishops on wednesday and think it will look all right  would you have bows or not  jennings says that every one wears bows now and that the underskirt should be frilled  reggie has just had another explosion and papa has ordered the clock to be sent to the stables  i dont think papa likes it so much as he did at first though he is very flattered at being sent such a pretty and ingenious toy  it shows that people read his sermons and profit by them  papa sends his love in which james and reggie and maria all unite and hoping that uncle cecils gout is better believe me dear aunt ever your affectionate niece  jane percy  psdo tell me about the bows  jennings insists they are the fashionlord arthur saviles crime     the triumph of american humor   at halfpast ten he heard the family going to bed  for some time he was disturbed by wild shrieks of laughter from the twins who with the light hearted gaiety of schoolboys were evidently amusing themselves before they retired to rest but at a quarter past eleven all was still and as midnight sounded he sallied forth  the owl beat against the window panes the raven croaked from the old yewtree and the wind wandered moaning round the house like a lost soul but the otis family slept unconscious of their doom and high above the rain and storm he could hear the steady snoring of the minister for the united states  he stepped stealthily out of the wainscoting with an evil smile on his cruel wrinkled mouth and the moon hid her face in a cloud as he stole past the great oriel window where his own arms and those of his murdered wife were blazoned in azure and gold  on and on he glided like an evil shadow the very darkness seeming to loathe him as he passed  once he thought he heard something call and stopped but it was only the baying of a dog from the red farm and he went on muttering strange sixteenth century curses and ever and anon brandishing the rusty dagger in the midnight air  finally he reached the corner of the passage that led to luckless washingtons room  for a moment he paused there the wind blowing his long grey locks about his head and twisting into grotesque and fantastic folds the nameless horror of the dead mans shroud  then the clock struck the quarter and he felt the time was come  he chuckled to himself and turned the corner but no sooner had he done so than with a piteous wail of terror he fell back and hid his blanched face in his long bony hands  right in front of him was standing a horrible spectre motionless as a carven image and monstrous as a madmans dream its head was bald and burnished its face round and fat and white and hideous laughter seemed to have writhed its features into an eternal grin  from the eyes streamed rays of scarlet light the mouth was a wide well of fire and a hideous garment like to his own swathed with its silent snows the titan form  on its breast was a placard with strange writing in antique characters some scroll of shame it seemed some record of wild sins some awful calendar of crime and with its right hand it bore aloft a falchion of gleaming steel  never having seen a ghost before he naturally was terribly frightened and after a second hasty glance at the awful phantom he fled back to his room tripping up in his long windingsheet as he sped down the corridor and finally dropping the rusty dagger into the ministers jack boots where it was found in the morning by the butler  once in the privacy of his own apartment he flung himself down on a small pallet bed and hid his face under the clothes  after a time however the brave old canterville spirit asserted itself and he determined to go and speak to the other ghost as soon as it was daylight  accordingly just as the dawn was touching the hills with silver he returned towards the spot where he had first laid eyes on the grisly phantom feeling that after all two ghosts were better than one and that by the aid of his new friend he might safely grapple with the twins  on reaching the spot however a terrible sight met his gaze  something had evidently happened to the spectre for the light had entirely faded from its hollow eyes the gleaming falchion had fallen from its hand and it was leaning up against the wall in a strained and uncomfortable attitude  he rushed forward and seized it in his arms when to his horror the head slipped off and rolled on the floor the body assumed a recumbent posture and he found himself clasping a white dimity bedcurtain with a sweepingbrush a kitchen cleaver and a hollow turnip lying at his feetthe canterville ghost     the garden of death   far away beyond the pinewoods he answered in a low dreamy voice there is a little garden  there the grass grows long and deep there are the great white stars of the hemlock flower there the nightingale sings all night long  all night long he sings and the cold crystal moon looks down and the yewtree spreads out its giant arms over the sleepers  virginias eyes grew dim with tears and she hid her face in her hands  you mean the garden of death she whispered  yes death  death must be so beautiful  to lie in the soft brown earth with the grasses waving above ones head and listen to silence to have no yesterday and no tomorrow  to forget time to forgive life to be at peace  you can help me  you can open for me the portals of deaths house for love is always with you and love is stronger than death is  virginia trembled a cold shudder ran through her and for a few moments there was silence  she felt as if she was in a terrible dream  then the ghost spoke again and his voice sounded like the sighing of the wind  have you ever read the old prophecy on the library window  oh often cried the little girl looking up i know it quite well  it is painted in curious black letters and it is difficult to read  there are only six lines     when a golden girl can win    prayer from out the lips of sin    when the barren almond bears    and a little child gives away its tears    then shall all the house be still    and peace come to canterville  but i dont know what they mean  they mean he said sadly that you must weep for me for my sins because i have no tears and pray with me for my soul because i have no faith and then if you have always been sweet and good and gentle the angel of death will have mercy on me  you will see fearful shapes in darkness and wicked voices will whisper in your ear but they will not harm you for against the purity of a little child the powers of hell cannot prevail  virginia made no answer and the ghost wrung his hands in wild despair as he looked down at her bowed golden head  suddenly she stood up very pale and with a strange light in her eyes  i am not afraid she said firmly and i will ask the angel to have mercy on you  he rose from his seat with a faint cry of joy and taking her hand bent over it with oldfashioned grace and kissed it  his fingers were as cold as ice and his lips burned like fire but virginia did not falter as he led her across the dusky room  on the faded green tapestry were broidered little huntsmen  they blew their tasselled horns and with their tiny hands waved to her to go back  go back little virginia they cried go back but the ghost clutched her hand more tightly and she shut her eyes against them  horrible animals with lizard tails and goggle eyes blinked at her from the carven chimneypiece and murmured beware little virginia beware we may never see you again but the ghost glided on more swiftly and virginia did not listen  when they reached the end of the room he stopped and muttered some words she could not understand  she opened her eyes and saw the wall slowly fading away like a mist and a great black cavern in front of her  a bitter cold wind swept round them and she felt something pulling at her dress quick quick cried the ghost or it will be too late and in a moment the wainscoting had closed behind them and the tapestry chamber was emptythe canterville ghost     an eton kitcat   well said erskine lighting a cigarette i must begin by telling you about cyril graham himself  he and i were at the same house at eton  i was a year or two older than he was but we were immense friends and did all our work and all our play together  there was of course a good deal more play than work but i cannot say that i am sorry for that  it is always an advantage not to have received a sound commercial education and what i learned in the playing fields at eton has been quite as useful to me as anything i was taught at cambridge  i should tell you that cyrils father and mother were both dead  they had been drowned in a horrible yachting accident off the isle of wight  his father had been in the diplomatic service and had married a daughter the only daughter in fact of old lord crediton who became cyrils guardian after the death of his parents  i dont think that lord crediton cared very much for cyril  he had never really forgiven his daughter for marrying a man who had not a title  he was an extraordinary old aristocrat who swore like a costermonger and had the manners of a farmer  i remember seeing him once on speechday  he growled at me gave me a sovereign and told me not to grow up a damned radical like my father  cyril had very little affection for him and was only too glad to spend most of his holidays with us in scotland  they never really got on together at all  cyril thought him a bear and he thought cyril effeminate  he was effeminate i suppose in some things though he was a very good rider and a capital fencer  in fact he got the foils before he left eton  but he was very languid in his manner and not a little vain of his good looks and had a strong objection to football  the two things that really gave him pleasure were poetry and acting  at eton he was always dressing up and reciting shakespeare and when he went up to trinity he became a member of the adc his first term  i remember i was always very jealous of his acting  i was absurdly devoted to him i suppose because we were so different in some things  i was a rather awkward weakly lad with huge feet and horribly freckled  freckles run in scotch families just as gout does in english families  cyril used to say that of the two he preferred the gout but he always set an absurdly high value on personal appearance and once read a paper before our debating society to prove that it was better to be goodlooking than to be good  he certainly was wonderfully handsome  people who did not like him philistines and college tutors and young men reading for the church used to say that he was merely pretty but there was a great deal more in his face than mere prettiness  i think he was the most splendid creature i ever saw and nothing could exceed the grace of his movements the charm of his manner he fascinated everybody who was worth fascinating and a great many people who were not  he was often wilful and petulant and i used to think him dreadfully insincere  it was due i think chiefly to his inordinate desire to please  poor cyril  i told him once that he was contented with very cheap triumphs but he only laughed  he was horribly spoiled  all charming people i fancy are spoiled  it is the secret of their attraction  however i must tell you about cyrils acting  you know that no actresses are allowed to play at the adc  at least they were not in my time  i dont know how it is now  well of course cyril was always cast for the girls parts and when as you like it was produced he played rosalind  it was a marvellous performance  in fact cyril graham was the only perfect rosalind i have ever seen  it would be impossible to describe to you the beauty the delicacy the refinement of the whole thing  it made an immense sensation and the horrid little theatre as it was then was crowded every night  even when i read the play now i cant help thinking of cyril  it might have been written for him  the next term he took his degree and came to london to read for the diplomatic  but he never did any work  he spent his days in reading shakespeares sonnets and his evenings at the theatre  he was of course wild to go on the stage  it was all that i and lord crediton could do to prevent him  perhaps if he had gone on the stage he would be alive now  it is always a silly thing to give advice but to give good advice is absolutely fatal  i hope you will never fall into that error if you do you will be sorry for itthe portrait of mr w h     mrs erlynne exercises the prerogative of a grandmother   lady windermere before heaven your husband is guiltless of all offence towards you  and ii tell you that had it ever occurred to me that such a monstrous suspicion would have entered your mind i would have died rather than have crossed your life or hisoh died gladly died  believe what you choose about me  i am not worth a moments sorrow  but dont spoil your beautiful young life on my account  you dont know what may be in store for you unless you leave this house at once  you dont know what it is to fall into the pit to be despised mocked abandoned sneered atto be an outcast to find the door shut against one to have to creep in by hideous byways afraid every moment lest the mask should be stripped from ones face and all the while to hear the

any one alive and boys are careless often and without thinking give pain and we always fancy that when they come to mans estate and know us better they will repay us  but it is not so  the world draws them from our side and they make friends with whom they are happier than they are with us and have amusements from which we are barred and interests that are not ours and they are unjust to us often for when they find life bitter they blame us for it and when they find it sweet we do not taste its sweetness with them    you made many friends and went into their houses and were glad with them and

you thought i didnt care for the pleasant things of life  i tell you i longed for them but did not dare to touch them feeling i had no right  you thought i was happier working amongst the poor  that

shame be still the child of my shamea woman of no importance     the damnable ideal   why cant you women love us faults and all  why do you place us on monstrous pedestals  we have all feet of clay women as well as men but when we men love women we love them knowing their weaknesses their follies their imperfections love them all the more it may be for that reason  it is not the perfect but the imperfect who have need of love it is when we are wounded by our own hands or by the hands of others that love should come to cure uselse what use is love at all  all sins except a sin against itself love should forgive  all lives save loveless lives true love should pardon  a mans love is like that  it is wider larger more human than a womans  women think that they are making ideals of men  what they are making of us are false idols merely you made your false idol of me and i had not the courage to come down show you my wounds tell you my weaknesses  i was afraid that i might lose your love

life a lonely dishonoured death it may be some day  let women make no more ideals of men let them not put them on alters and bow before them or they may ruin other lives as completely as youyou whom i have so wildly lovedhave ruined minean ideal husband     from a rejected prizeessay   nations may not have missions but they certainly have functions  and the function of ancient italy was not merely to give us what is statical in our institutions and rational in our law but to blend into one elemental creed the spiritual aspirations of aryan and of semite  italy was not a pioneer in intellectual progress nor a motive power in the evolution of thought  the owl of the goddess of wisdom traversed over the whole land and found nowhere a restingplace  the dove which is the bird of christ flew straight to the city of rome and the new reign began  it was the fashion of early italian painters to represent in mediaeval costume the soldiers who watched over the tomb of christ and this which was the result of the frank anachronism of all true art may serve to us as an allegory  for it was in vain that the middle ages strove to guard the buried spirit of progress  when the dawn of the greek spirit arose the sepulchre was empty the graveclothes laid aside  humanity had risen from the dead  the study of greek it has been well said implies the birth of criticism comparison and research  at the opening of that education of modern by ancient thought which we call the renaissance it was the words of aristotle which sent columbus sailing to the new world while a fragment of pythagorean astronomy set copernicus thinking on that train of reasoning which has revolutionised the whole position of our planet in the universe  then it was seen that the only meaning of progress is a return to greek modes of thought  the monkish hymns which obscured the pages of greek manuscripts were blotted out the splendours of a new method were unfolded to the world and out of the melancholy sea of mediaevalism rose the free spirit of man in all that splendour of glad adolescence when the bodily powers seem quickened by a new vitality when the eye sees more clearly than its wont and the mind apprehends what was beforetime hidden from it  to herald the opening of the sixteenth century from the little venetian printing press came forth all the great authors of antiquity each bearing on the titlepage the words greek text words which may serve to remind us with what wondrous prescience polybius saw the worlds fate when he foretold the material sovereignty of roman institutions and exemplified in himself the intellectual empire of greece  the course of the study of the spirit of historical criticism has not been a profitless investigation into modes and forms of thought now antiquated and of no account  the only spirit which is entirely removed from us is the mediaeval the greek spirit is essentially modern  the introduction of the comparative method of research which has forced history to disclose its secrets belongs in a measure to us  ours too is a more scientific knowledge of philology and the method of survival nor did the ancients know anything of the doctrine of averages or of crucial instances both of which methods have proved of such importance in modern criticism the one adding a most important proof of the statical elements of history and exemplifying the influences of all physical surroundings on the life of man the other as in the single instance of the moulin quignon skull serving to create a whole new science of prehistoric archaeology and to bring us back to a time when man was coeval with the stone age the mammoth and the woolly rhinoceros but except these we have added no new canon or method to the science of historical criticism  across the drear waste of a thousand years the greek and the modern spirit join hands  in the torch race which the greek boys ran from the cerameician field of death to the home of the goddess of wisdom not merely he who first reached the goal but he also who first started with the torch aflame received a prize  in the lampadephoria of civilisation and free thought let us not forget to render due meed of honour to those who first lit that sacred flame the increasing splendour of which lights our footsteps to the faroff divine event of the attainment of perfect truththe rise of historical criticism     the possibilities of the useful   there are two kinds of men in the world two great creeds two different forms of natures men to whom the end of life is action and men to whom the end of life is thought  as regards the latter who seek for experience itself and not for the fruits of experience who must burn always with one of the passions of this fierycoloured world who find life interesting not for its secret but for its situations for its pulsations and not for its purpose the passion for beauty engendered by the decorative arts will be to them more satisfying than any political or religious enthusiasm any enthusiasm for humanity any ecstasy or sorrow for love  for art comes to one professing primarily to give nothing but the highest quality to ones moments and for those moments sake  so far for those to whom the end of life is thought  as regards the others who hold that life is inseparable from labour to them should this movement be specially dear for if our days are barren without industry industry without art is barbarism  hewers of wood and drawers of water there must be always indeed among us our modern machinery has not much lightened the labour of man after all but at least let the pitcher that stands by the well be beautiful and surely the labour of the day will be lightened let the wood be made receptive of some lovely form some gracious design and there will come no longer discontent but joy to the toiler  for what is decoration but the workers expression of joy in his work  and not joy merelythat is a great thing yet not enoughbut that opportunity of expressing his own individuality which as it is the essence of all life is the source of all art  i have tried i remember william morris saying to me once i have tried to make each of my workers an artist and when i say an artist i mean a man  for the worker then handicraftsman of whatever kind he is art is no longer to be a purple robe woven by a slave and thrown over the whitened body of a leprous king to hide and to adorn the sin of his luxury but rather the beautiful and noble expression of a life that has in it something beautiful and noblethe english renaissance of art     the artist   one evening there came into his soul the desire to fashion an image of the pleasure that abideth for a moment  and he went forth into the world to look for bronze  for he could think only in bronze  but all the bronze of the whole world had disappeared nor anywhere in the whole world was there any bronze to be found save only the bronze of the image of the sorrow that endureth for ever  now this image he had himself and with his own hands fashioned and had set it on the tomb of the one thing he had loved in life  on the tomb of the dead thing he had most loved had he set this image of his own fashioning that it might serve as a sign of the love of man that dieth not and a symbol of the sorrow of man that endureth for ever  and in the whole world there was no other bronze save the bronze of this image  and he took the image he had fashioned and set it in a great furnace and gave it to the fire  and out of the bronze of the image of the sorrow that endureth for ever he fashioned an image of the pleasure that abideth for a momentpoems in prose     the doer of good   it was nighttime and he was alone  and he saw afaroff the walls of a round city and went towards the city  and when he came near he heard within the city the tread of the feet of joy and the laughter of the mouth of gladness and the loud noise of many lutes  and he knocked at the gate and certain of the gatekeepers opened to him  and he beheld a house that was of marble and had fair pillars of marble before it  the pillars were hung with garlands and within and without there were torches of cedar  and he entered the house  and when he had passed through the hall of chalcedony and the hall of jasper and reached the long hall of feasting he saw lying on a couch of seapurple one whose hair was crowned with red roses and whose lips were red with wine  and he went behind him and touched him on the shoulder and said to him why do you live like this  and the young man turned round and recognised him and made answer and said but i was a leper once and you healed me  how else should i live  and he passed out of the house and went again into the street  and after a little while he saw one whose face and raiment were painted and whose feet were shod with pearls  and behind her came slowly as a hunter a young man who wore a cloak of two colours  now the face of the woman was as the fair face of an idol and the eyes of the young man were bright with lust  and he followed swiftly and touched the hand of the young man and said to him why do you look at this woman and in such wise  and the young man turned round and recognised him and said but i was blind once and you gave me sight  at what else should i look  and he ran forward and touched the painted raiment of the woman and said to her is there no other way in which to walk save the way of sin  and the woman turned round and recognised him and laughed and said but you forgave me my sins and the way is a pleasant way  and he passed out of the city  and when he had passed out of the city he saw seated by the roadside a young man who was weeping  and he went towards him and touched the long locks of his hair and said to him why are you weeping  and the young man looked up and recognised him and made answer but i was dead once and you raised me from the dead  what else should i do but weeppoems in prose     the disciple   when narcissus died the pool of his pleasure changed from a cup of sweet waters into a cup of salt tears and the oreads came weeping through the woodland that they might sing to the pool and give it comfort  and when they saw that the pool had changed from a cup of sweet waters into a cup of salt tears they loosened the green tresses of their hair and cried to the pool and said we do not wonder that you should mourn in this manner for narcissus so beautiful was he  but was narcissus beautiful said the pool  who should know that better than you answered the oreads  us did he ever pass by but you he sought for and would lie on your banks and look down at you and in the mirror of your waters he would mirror his own beauty  and the pool answered but i loved narcissus because as he lay on my banks and looked down at me in the mirror of his eyes i saw ever my own beauty mirroredpoems in prose     the master   now when the darkness came over the earth joseph of arimathea having lighted a torch of pinewood passed down from the hill into the valley for he had business in his own home  and kneeling on the flint stones of the valley of desolation he saw a young man who was naked and weeping  his hair was the colour of honey and his body was as a white flower but he had wounded his body with thorns and on his hair had he set ashes as a crown  and he who had great possessions said to the young man who was naked and weeping i do not wonder that your sorrow is so great for surely he was a just man  and the young man answered it is not for him that i am weeping but for myself  i too have changed water into wine and i have healed the leper and given sight to the blind  i have walked upon the waters and from the dwellers in the tombs i have cast out devils  i have fed the hungry in the desert where there was no food and i have raised the dead from their narrow houses and at my bidding and before a great multitude of people a barren figtree withered away  all things that this man has done i have done also  and yet they have not crucified mepoems in prose     the house of judgment   and there was silence in the house of judgment and the man came naked before god  and god opened the book of the life of the man  and god said to the man thy life hath been evil and thou hast shown cruelty to those who were in need of succour and to those who lacked help thou hast been bitter and hard of heart  the poor called to thee and thou didst not hearken and thine ears were closed to the cry of my afflicted  the inheritance of the fatherless thou didst take unto thyself and thou didst send the foxes into the vineyard of thy neighbours field  thou didst take the bread of the children and give it to the dogs to eat and my lepers who lived in the marshes and were at peace and praised me thou didst drive forth on to the highways and on mine earth out of which i made thee thou didst spill innocent blood  and the man made answer and said even so did i  and again god opened the book of the life of the man  and god said to the man thy life hath been evil and the beauty i have shown thou hast sought for and the good i have hidden thou didst pass by  the walls of thy chamber were painted with images and from the bed of thine abominations thou didst rise up to the sound of flutes  thou didst build seven altars to the sins i have suffered and didst eat of the thing that may not be eaten and the purple of thy raiment was broidered with the three signs of shame  thine idols were neither of gold nor of silver that endure but of flesh that dieth  thou didst stain their hair with perfumes and put pomegranates in their hands  thou didst stain their feet with saffron and spread carpets before them  with antimony thou didst stain their eyelids and their bodies thou didst smear with myrrh  thou didst bow thyself to the ground before them and the thrones of thine idols were set in the sun  thou didst show to the sun thy shame and to the moon thy madness  and the man made answer and said even so did i  and a third time god opened the book of the life of the man  and god said to the man evil hath been thy life and with evil didst thou requite good and with wrongdoing kindness  the hands that fed thee thou didst wound and the breasts that gave thee suck thou didst despise he who came to thee with water went away thirsting and the outlawed men who hid thee in their tents at night thou didst betray before dawn  thine enemy who spared thee thou didst snare in an ambush and the friend who walked with thee thou didst sell for a price and to those who brought thee love thou didst ever give lust in thy turn  and the man made answer and said even so did i  and god closed the book of the life of the man and said surely i will send thee into hell  even into hell will i send thee  and the man cried out thou canst not  and god said to the man wherefore can i not send thee to hell and for what reason  because in hell have i always lived answered the man  and there was silence in the house of judgment  and after a space god spake and said to the man seeing that i may not send thee into hell surely i will send thee unto heaven  even unto heaven will i send thee  and the man cried out thou canst not  and god said to the man wherefore can i not send thee unto heaven and for what reason  because never and in no place have i been able to imagine it answered the man  and there was silence in the house of judgmentpoems in prose     the teacher of wisdom   from his childhood he had been as one filled with the perfect knowledge of god and even while he was yet but a lad many of the saints as well as certain holy women who dwelt in the free city of his birth had been stirred to much wonder by the grave wisdom of his answers  and when his parents had given him the robe and the ring of manhood he kissed them and left them and went out into the world that he might speak to the world about god  for there were at that time many in the world who either knew not god at all or had but an incomplete knowledge of him or worshipped the false gods who dwell in groves and have no care of their worshippers  and he set his face to the sun and journeyed walking without sandals as he had seen the saints walk and carrying at his girdle a leathern wallet and a little waterbottle of burnt clay  and as he walked along the highway he was full of the joy that comes from the perfect knowledge of god and he sang praises unto god without ceasing and after a time he reached a strange land in which there were many cities  and he passed through eleven cities  and some of these cities were in valleys and others were by the banks of great rivers and others were set on hills  and in each city he found a disciple who loved him and followed him and a great multitude also of people followed him from each city and the knowledge of god spread in the whole land and many of the rulers were converted and the priests of the temples in which there were idols found that half of their gain was gone and when they beat upon their drums at noon none or but a few came with peacocks and with offerings of flesh as had been the custom of the land before his coming  yet the more the people followed him and the greater the number of his disciples the greater became his sorrow  and he knew not why his sorrow was so great  for he spake ever about god and out of the fulness of that perfect knowledge of god which god had himself given to him  and one evening he passed out of the eleventh city which was a city of armenia and his disciples and a great crowd of people followed after him and he went up on to a mountain and sat down on a rock that was on the mountain and his disciples stood round him and the multitude knelt in the valley  and he bowed his head on his hands and wept and said to his soul why is it that i am full of sorrow and fear and that each of my disciples is an enemy that walks in the noonday  and his soul answered him and said god filled thee with the perfect knowledge of himself and thou hast given this knowledge away to others  the pearl of great price thou hast divided and the vesture without seam thou hast parted asunder  he who giveth away wisdom robbeth himself  he is as one who giveth his treasure to a robber  is not god wiser than thou art  who art thou to give away the secret that god hath told thee  i was rich once and thou hast made me poor  once i saw god and now thou hast hidden him from me  and he wept again for he knew that his soul spake truth to him and that he had given to others the perfect knowledge of god and that he was as one clinging to the skirts of god and that his faith was leaving him by reason of the number of those who believed in him  and he said to himself i will talk no more about god  he who giveth away wisdom robbeth himself  and after the space of some hours his disciples came near him and bowed themselves to the ground and said master talk to us about god for thou hast the perfect knowledge of god and no man save thee hath this knowledge  and he answered them and said i will talk to you about all other things that are in heaven and on earth but about god i will not talk to you neither now nor at any time will i talk to you about god  and they were wroth with him and said to him thou hast led us into the desert that we might hearken to thee  wilt thou send us away hungry and the great multitude that thou hast made to follow thee  and he answered them and said i will not talk to you about god  and the multitude murmured against him and said to him thou hast led us into the desert and hast given us no food to eat  talk to us about god and it will suffice us  but he answered them not a word  for he knew that if he spake to them about god he would give away his treasure  and his disciples went away sadly and the multitude of people returned to their own homes  and many died on the way  and when he was alone he rose up and set his face to the moon and journeyed for seven moons speaking to no man nor making any answer  and when the seventh moon had waned he reached that desert which is the desert of the great river  and having found a cavern in which a centaur had once dwelt he took it for his place of dwelling and made himself a mat of reeds on which to lie and became a hermit  and every hour the hermit praised god that he had suffered him to keep some knowledge of him and of his wonderful greatness  now one evening as the hermit was seated before the cavern in which he had made his place of dwelling he beheld a young man of evil and beautiful face who passed by in mean apparel and with empty hands  every evening with empty hands the young man passed by and every morning he returned with his hands full of purple and pearls  for he was a robber and robbed the caravans of the merchants  and the hermit looked at him and pitied him  but he spake not a word for he knew that he who speaks a word loses his faith  and one morning as the young man returned with his hands full of purple and pearls he stopped and frowned and stamped his foot upon the sand and said to the hermit why do you look at me ever in this manner as i pass by  what is it that i see in your eyes  for no man has looked at me before in this manner  and the thing is a thorn and a trouble to me  and the hermit answered him and said what you see in my eyes is pity pity is what looks out at you from my eyes  and the young man laughed with scorn and cried to the hermit in a bitter voice and said to him i have purple and pearls in my hands and you have but a mat of reeds on which to lie  what pity should you have for me  and for what reason have you this pity  i have pity for you said the hermit because you have no knowledge of god  is this knowledge of god a precious thing asked the young man and he came close to the mouth of the cavern  it is more precious than all the purple and the pearls of the world answered the hermit  and have you got it said the young robber and he came closer still  once indeed answered the hermit i possessed the perfect knowledge of god  but in my foolishness i parted with it and divided it amongst others  yet even now is such knowledge as remains to me more precious than purple or pearls  and when the young robber heard this he threw away the purple and the pearls that he was bearing in his hands and drawing a sharp sword of curved steel he said to the hermit give me forthwith this knowledge of god that you possess or i will surely slay you  wherefore should i not slay him who has a treasure greater than my treasure  and the hermit spread out his arms and said were it not better for me to go unto the uttermost courts of god and praise him than to live in the world and have no knowledge of him  slay me if that be your desire but i will not give away my knowledge of god  and the young robber knelt down and besought him but the hermit would not talk to him about god nor give him his treasure and the young robber rose up and said to the hermit be it as you will  as for myself i will go to the city of the seven sins that is but three days journey from this place and for my purple they will give me pleasure and for my pearls they will sell me joy  and he took up the purple and the pearls and went swiftly away  and the hermit cried out and followed him and besought him  for the space of three days he followed the young robber on the road and entreated him to return nor to enter into the city of the seven sins  and ever and anon the young robber looked back at the hermit and called to him and said will you give me this knowledge of god which is more precious than purple and pearls  if you will give me that i will not enter the city  and ever did the hermit answer all things that i have i will give thee save that one thing only  for that thing it is not lawful for me to give away  and in the twilight of the third day they came nigh to the great scarlet gates of the city of the seven sins  and from the city there came the sound of much laughter  and the young robber laughed in answer and sought to knock at the gate and as he did so the hermit ran forward and caught him by the skirts of his raiment and said to him stretch forth your hands and set your arms around my neck and put your ear close to my lips and i will give you what remains to me of the knowledge of god  and the young robber stopped  and when the hermit had given away his knowledge of god he fell upon the ground and wept and a great darkness hid from him the city and the young robber so that he saw them no more  and as he lay there weeping he was ware of one who was standing beside him and he who was standing beside him had feet of brass and hair like fine wool  and he raised the hermit up and said to him before this time thou hadst the perfect knowledge of god  now thou shalt have the perfect love of god  wherefore art thou weeping  and he kissed himpoems in prose     wilde gives directions about de profundis   hm prison reading  april 1st 1897  my dear robbiei send you a ms separate from this which i hope will arrive safely  as soon as you have read it i want you to have it carefully copied for me  there are many causes why i wish this to be done  one will suffice  i want you to be my literary executor in case of my death and to have complete control of my plays books and papers as soon as i find i have a legal right to make a will i will do so  my wife does not understand my art nor could be expected to have any interest in it and cyril is only a child  so i turn naturally to you as indeed i do for everything and would like you to have all my works the deficit that their sale will produce may be lodged to the credit of cyril and vivian  well if you are my literary executor you must be in possession of the only document that gives any explanation of my extraordinary behaviour    when you have read the letter you will see the psychological explanation of a course of conduct that from the outside seems a combination of absolute idiotcy with vulgar bravado  some day the truth will have to be knownnot necessarily in my lifetime    but i am not prepared to sit in the grotesque pillory they put me into for all time for the simple reason that i inherited from my father and mother a name of high distinction in literature and art and i cannot for eternity allow that name to be degraded  i dont defend my conduct  i explain it  also there are in my letter certain passages which deal with my mental development in prison and the inevitable evolution of my character and intellectual attitude towards life that has taken place and i want you and others who still stand by me and have affection for me to know exactly in what mood and manner i hope to face the world  of course from one point of view i know that on the day of my release i shall be merely passing from one prison into another and there are times when the whole world seems to me no larger than my cell and as full of terror for me  still i believe that at the beginning god made a world for each separate man and in that world which is within us we should seek to live  at any rate you will read those parts of my letter with less pain than the others  of course i need not remind you how fluid a thing thought is with mewith us alland of what an evanescent substance are our emotions made  still i do see a sort of possible goal towards which through art i may progress  it is not unlikely that you may help me  as regards the mode of copying of course it is too long for any amanuensis to attempt and your own handwriting dear robbie in your last letter seems specially designed to remind me that the task is not to be yours  i think that the only thing to do is to be thoroughly modern and to have it typewritten  of course the ms should not pass out of your control but could you not get mrs marshall to send down one of her typewriting girlswomen are the most reliable as they have no memory for the importantto hornton street or phillimore gardens to do it under your supervision  i assure you that the typewriting machine when played with expression is not more annoying than the piano when played by a sister or near relation  indeed many among those most devoted to domesticity prefer it  i wish the copy to be done not on tissue paper but on good paper such as is used for plays and a wide rubricated margin should be left for corrections    if the copy is done at hornton street the lady typewriter might be fed through a lattice in the door like the cardinals when they elect a pope till she comes out on the balcony and can say to the world habet mundus epistolam for indeed it is an encyclical letter and as

from the poet whom you and i once thought of rescuing from the philistines  i need not remind you that mere expression is to an artist the supreme and only mode of life  it is by utterance that we live  of the many many things for which i have to thank the governor there is none for which i am more grateful than for his permission to write fully and at as great a length as i desire  for nearly two years i had within a growing burden of bitterness of much of which i have now got rid  on the other side of the prison wall there are some poor black sootbesmirched trees that are just breaking

wash the feet of the poor or stooped to kiss the leper on the cheek  i have never said one single word to him about what he did  i do not know to the present moment whether he is aware that i was even conscious of his action  it is not a thing for which one can render formal thanks in formal words  i store it in the treasurehouse of my heart  i keep it there as a secret debt that i am glad to think i can never possibly repay  it is embalmed and kept sweet by the myrrh and cassia of many tears  when wisdom has been profitless to me philosophy barren and the proverbs and phrases of those who have sought to give me consolation as dust and ashes in my mouth the memory of that little lovely silent act of love has unsealed for me all the wells of pity made the desert blossom like a rose and brought me out of the bitterness of lonely exile into harmony with the wounded broken and great heart of the world  when people are able to understand not merely how beautiful s action was but why it meant so much to me and always will mean so much then perhaps they will realise how and in what spirit they should approach me     the poor are wise more charitable more kind more sensitive than we are  in their eyes prison is a tragedy in a mans life a misfortune a casuality something that calls for sympathy in others  they speak of one who is in prison as of one who is in trouble simply  it is the phrase they always use and the expression has the perfect wisdom of love in it  with people of our own rank it is different  with us prison makes a man a pariah  i and such as i am have hardly any right to air and sun  our presence taints the pleasures of others  we are unwelcome when we reappear  to revisit the glimpses of the moon is not for us  our very children are taken away  those lovely links with humanity are broken  we are doomed to be solitary while our sons still live  we are denied the one thing that might heal us and keep us that might bring balm to the bruised heart and peace to the soul in painde profundis     sorrow wears no mask   sorrow being the supreme emotion of which man is capable is at once the type and test of all great art  what the artist is always looking for is the mode of existence in which soul and body are one and indivisible in which the outward is expressive of the inward in which form reveals  of such modes of existence there are not a few youth and the arts preoccupied with youth may serve as a model for us at one moment at another we may like to think that in its subtlety and sensitiveness of impression its suggestion of a spirit dwelling in external things and making its raiment of earth and air of mist and city alike and in its morbid sympathy of its moods and tones and colours modern landscape art is realising for us pictorially what was realised in such plastic perfection by the greeks  music in which all subject is absorbed in expression and cannot be separated from it is a complex example and a flower or a child a simple example of what i mean but sorrow is the ultimate type both in life and art  behind joy and laughter there may be a temperament coarse hard and callous  but behind sorrow there is always sorrow  pain unlike pleasure wears no mask  truth in art is not any correspondence between the essential idea and the accidental existence it is not the resemblance of shape to shadow or of the form mirrored in the crystal to the form itself it is no echo coming from a hollow hill any more than it is a silver well of water in the valley that shows the moon to the moon and narcissus to narcissus  truth in art is the unity of a thing with itself the outward rendered expressive of the inward the soul made incarnate the body instinct with spirit  for this reason there is no truth comparable to sorrow  there are times when sorrow seems to me to be the only truth  other things may be illusions of the eye or the appetite made to blind the one and cloy the other but out of sorrow have the worlds been built and at the birth of a child or a star there is pain  more than this there is about sorrow an intense an extraordinary reality  i have said of myself that i was one who stood in symbolic relations to the art and culture of my age  there is not a single wretched man in this wretched place along with me who does not stand in symbolic relation to the very secret of life  for the secret of life is suffering  it is what is hidden behind everything  when we begin to live what is sweet is so sweet to us and what is bitter so bitter that we inevitably direct all our desires towards pleasures and seek not merely for a month or twain to feed on honeycomb but for all our years to taste no other food ignorant all the while that we may really be starving the soulde profundis     vita nuova   far off like a perfect pearl one can see the city of god  it is so wonderful that it seems as if a child could reach it in a summers day and so a child could  but with me and such as me it is different  one can realise a thing in a single moment but one loses it in the long hours that follow with leaden feet  it is so difficult to keep heights that the soul is competent to gain  we think in eternity but we move slowly through time and how slowly time goes with us who lie in prison i need not tell again nor of the weariness and despair that creep back into ones cell and into the cell of ones heart with such strange insistence that one has as it were to garnish and sweep ones house for their coming as for an unwelcome guest or a bitter master or a slave whose slave it is ones chance or choice to be  and though at present my friends may find it a hard thing to believe it is true none the less that for them living in freedom and idleness and comfort it is more easy to learn the lessons of humility than it is for me who begin the day by going down on my knees and washing the floor of my cell  for prison life with its endless privations and restrictions makes one rebellious  the most terrible thing about it is not that it breaks ones hearthearts are made to be brokenbut that it turns ones heart to stone  one sometimes feels that it is only with a front of brass and a lip of scorn that one can get through the day at all  and he who is in a state of rebellion cannot receive grace to use the phrase of which the church is so fondso rightly fond i dare sayfor in life as in art the mood of rebellion closes up the channels of the soul and shuts out the airs of heaven  yet i must learn these lessons here if i am to learn them anywhere and must be filled with joy if my feet are on the right road and my face set towards the gate which is called beautiful though i may fall many times in the mire and often in the mist go astray  this new life as through my love of dante i like sometimes to call it is of course no new life at all but simply the continuance by means of development and evolution of my former life  i remember when i was at oxford saying to one of my friends as we were strolling round magdalens narrow birdhaunted walks one morning in the year before i took my degree that i wanted to eat of the fruit of all the trees in the garden of the world and that i was going out into the world with that passion in my soul  and so indeed i went out and so i lived  my only mistake was that i confined myself so exclusively to the trees of what seemed to me the sunlit side of the garden and shunned the other side for its shadow and its gloom  failure disgrace poverty sorrow despair suffering tears even the broken words that come from lips in pain remorse that makes one walk on thorns conscience that condemns self abasement that punishes the misery that puts ashes on its head the anguish that chooses sackcloth for its raiment and into its own drink puts gallall these were things of which i was afraid  and as i had determined to know nothing of them i was forced to taste each of them in turn to feed on them to have for a season indeed no other food at all  i dont regret for a single moment having lived for pleasure  i did it to the full as one should do everything that one does  there was no pleasure i did not experience  i threw the pearl of my soul into a cup of wine  i went down the primrose path to the sound of flutes  i lived on honeycomb  but to have continued the same life would have been wrong because it would have been limiting  i had to pass on  the other half of the garden had its secrets for me alsode profundis     the grand romantic   it is when he deals with a sinner that christ is most romantic in the sense of most real  the world had always loved the saint as being the nearest possible approach to the perfection of god  christ through some divine instinct in him seems to have always loved the sinner as being the nearest possible approach to the perfection of man  his primary desire was not to reform people any more than his primary desire was to a relieve suffering  to turn an interesting thief into a tedious honest man was not his aim  he would have thought little of the prisoners aid society and other modern movements of the kind  the conversion of a publican into a pharisee would not have seemed to him a great achievement  but in a manner not yet understood of the world he regarded sin and suffering as being in themselves beautiful holy things and modes of perfection  it seems a very dangerous idea  it isall great ideas are dangerous that it was christs creed admits of no doubt  that it is the true creed i dont doubt myself  of course the sinner must repent  but why  simply because otherwise he would be unable to realise what he had done  the moment of repentance is the moment of initiation  more than that it is the means by which one alters ones past  the greeks thought that impossible  they often say in their gnomic aphorisms even the gods cannot alter the past  christ showed that the commonest sinner could do it that it was the one thing he could do  christ had he been asked would have saidi feel quite certain about itthat the moment the prodigal son fell on his knees and wept he made his having wasted his substance with harlots his swine herding and hungering for the husks they ate beautiful and holy moments in his life  it is difficult for most people to grasp the idea  i dare say one has to go to prison to understand it  if so it may be worth while going to prison  there is something so unique about christ  of course just as there are false dawns before the dawn itself and winter days so full of sudden sunlight that they will cheat the wise crocus into squandering its gold before its time and make some foolish bird call to its mate to build on barren boughs so there were christians before christ  for that we should be grateful  the unfortunate thing is that there have been none since  i make one exception st francis of assisi  but then god had given him at his birth the soul of a poet as he himself when quite young had in mystical marriage taken poverty as his bride and with the soul of a poet and the body of a beggar he found the way to perfection not difficult  he understood christ and so he became like him  we do not require the liber conformitatum to teach us that the life of st francis was the true imitatio christi a poem compared to which the book of that name is merely prose  indeed that is the charm about christ when all is said he is just like a work of art  he does not really teach one anything but by being brought into his presence one becomes something  and everybody is predestined to his presence  once at least in his life each man walks with christ to emmausde profundis     clapham junction   my lot has been one of public infamy of long imprisonment of misery of ruin of disgrace but i am not worthy of itnot yet at any rate  i remember that i used to say that i thought i could bear a real tragedy if it came to me with purple pall and a mask of noble sorrow but that the dreadful thing about modernity was that it put tragedy into the raiment of comedy so that the great realities seemed commonplace or grotesque or lacking in style  it is quite true about modernity  it has probably always been true about actual life  it is said that all martyrdoms seemed mean to the looker on  the nineteenth century is no exception to the rule  everything about my tragedy has been hideous mean repellent lacking in style our very dress makes us grotesque  we are the zanies of sorrow we are clowns whose hearts are broken  we are specially designed to appeal to the sense of humour  on november 13th 1895 i was brought down here from london  from two oclock till halfpast two on that day i had to stand on the centre platform of clapham junction in convict dress and handcuffed for the world to look at  i had been taken out of the hospital ward without a moments notice being given to me  of all possible objects i was the most grotesque  when people saw me they laughed  each train as it came up swelled the audience  nothing could exceed their amusement  that was of course before they knew who i was as soon as they had been informed they laughed still more  for half an hour i stood there in the grey november rain surrounded by a jeering mobde profundis     the broken resolution   we call ours a utilitarian age and we do not know the uses of any single thing  we have forgotten that water can cleanse and fire purify and that the earth is mother to us all  as a consequence our art is of the moon and plays with shadows while greek art is of the sun and deals directly with things  i feel sure that in elemental forces there is purification and i want to go back to them and live in their presence  of course to one so modern as i am enfant de mon siecle merely to look at the world will be always lovely  i tremble with pleasure when i think that on the very day of my leaving prison both the laburnum and the lilac will be blooming in the gardens and that i shall see the wind stir into restless beauty the swaying gold of the one and make the other toss the pale purple of its plumes so that all the air shall be arabia for me  linnaeus fell on his knees and wept for joy when he saw for the first time the long heath of some english upland made yellow with the tawny aromatic brooms of the common furze and i know that for me to whom flowers are part of desire there are tears waiting in the petals of some rose  it has always been so with me from my boyhood  there is not a single colour hidden away in the chalice of a flower or the curve of a shell to which by some subtle sympathy with the very soul of things my nature does not answer  like gautier i have always been one of those pour qui le monde visible existe  still i am conscious now that behind all this beauty satisfying though it may be there is some spirit hidden of which the painted forms and shapes are but modes of manifestation and it is with this spirit that i desire to become in harmony  i have grown tired of the articulate utterances of men and things  the mystical in art the mystical in life the mystical in nature this is what i am looking for  it is absolutely necessary for me to find it somewhere  all trials are trials for ones life just as all sentences are sentences of death and three times have i been tried  the first time i left the box to be arrested the second time to be led back to the house of detention the third time to pass into a prison for two years  society as we have constituted it will have no place for me has none to offer but nature whose sweet rains fall on unjust and just alike will have clefts in the rocks where i may hide and secret valleys in whose silence i may weep undisturbed  she will hang the night with stars so that i may walk abroad in the darkness without stumbling and send the wind over my footprints so that none may track me to my hurt she will cleanse me in great waters and with bitter herbs make me wholede profundis     domesticity at berneval   dieppe  june 1st 1897  my dear robbiei propose to live at berneval  i will not live in paris nor in algiers nor in southern italy  surely a house for a year if i choose to continue there at 32 pounds is absurdly cheap  i could not live cheaper at a hotel  you are penny foolish and pound foolisha dreadful state for my financier to be in  i told m bonnet that my bankers were mm ross et cie banquiers celebres de londresand now you suddenly show me that you have no place among the great financial people and are afraid of any investment over 31 pounds 10s  it is merely the extra ten shillings that baffles you  as regards people living on me and the extra bedrooms dear boy there is no one who would stay with me but you and you will pay your own bill at the hotel for meals and as for your room the charge will be nominally 2 francs 50 centimes a night but there will be lots of extras such as bougie bain and hot water and all cigarettes smoked in the bedrooms are charged extra  and if any one does not take the extras of course he is charged more     bain 25 c     pas de bain 50 c     cigarette dans la chambre a coucher 10 c pour chaque cigarette     pas de cigarette dans la chambre a coucher 20 c pour chaque    cigarette  this is the system at all good hotels  if reggie comes of course he will pay a little more i cannot forget that he gave me a dressingcase sphinxes pay a hundred per cent more than any one elsethey always did in ancient egypt  but seriously robbie if people stayed with me of course they would pay their pension at the hotel  they would have to except architects  a modern architect like modern architecture doesnt pay  but then i know only one architect and you are hiding him somewhere from me  i believe that he is as extinct as the dado of which now only fossil remains are found chiefly in the vicinity of brompton where they are sometimes discovered by workmen excavating  they are usually embedded in the old lincrusta walton strata and are rare consequently  i visited m le cure 4 today  he has a charming house and a jardin potager  he showed me over the church  tomorrow i sit in the choir by his special invitation  he showed me all his vestments  tomorrow he really will be charming in red  he knows i am a heretic and believes pusey is still alive  he says that god will convert england on account of englands kindness to les pretres exiles at the time of the revolution  it is to be the reward of that sealashed island  stained glass windows are wanted in the church he has only six fourteen more are needed  he gets them at 300 francs12 poundsa window in paris  i was nearly offering half a dozen but remembered you and so only gave him something pour les pauvres  you had a narrow escape robbie  you should be thankful  i hope the 40 pounds is on its way and that the 60 pounds will follow  i am going to hire a boat  it will save walking and so be an economy in the end  dear robbie i must start well  if the life of st

robbiei simply cannot write  it is too horrid not of me but to me  it is a mode of paralysisa cacoethes tacendithe one form that malady takes in me  well all passed over very successfully  palermo where we stayed eight days was lovely  the most beautifully situated town in the worldit dreams away its life in the concha doro the exquisite valley that lies between two seas  the lemon groves and the orange gardens were so entirely perfect that i became quite a preraphaelite and loathed the ordinary impressionists whose muddly souls and blurred intelligences would have rendered but by mud and blur those golden lamps hung in a green night that filled me with such joy  the elaborate and exquisite detail of the true preraphaelite is the compensation they offer us for the absence of motion literature and motion being the only arts that are not immobile  then nowhere not even at ravenna have i seen such mosaics as in the capella palatine which from pavement to domed ceiling is all gold one really feels as if one was sitting in the heart of a great honeycomb looking at angels singing and looking at angels or indeed at people singing is much nicer than listening to them for this reason the great artists always give to their angels lutes without strings pipes without ventholes and reeds through which no wind can wander or make whistlings  monreale you have heard ofwith its cloisters and cathedral we often drove there  i also made great friends with a young seminarist who lived in the cathedral of palermohe and eleven others in little rooms beneath the roof like birds  every day he showed me all over the cathedral i knelt before the huge porphyry sarcophagus in which frederick the second lies it is a sublime bare monstrous thingbloodcoloured and held up by lions who have caught some of the rage of the great emperors restless soul  at first my young friend giuseppe loverdi gave me information but on the third day i gave information to him and rewrote history as usual and told him all about the supreme king and his court of poets and the terrible book that he never wrote  his reason for entering the church was singularly mediaeval  i asked him why he thought of becoming a clerico and how  he answered my father is a cook and most poor and we are many at home so it seemed to me a good thing that there should be in so small a house as ours one mouth less to feed for though i am slim i eat much too much alas i fear  i told him to be comforted because god used poverty often as a means of bringing people to him and used riches never or rarely so giuseppe was comforted and i gave him a little book of devotion very pretty and with far more pictures than prayers in itso of great service to giuseppe whose eyes are beautiful  i also gave him many lire and prophesied for him a cardinals hat if he remained very good and never forgot me  at naples we stopped three days most of my friends are as you know in prison but i met some of nice memory  we came to rome on holy thursday  h left on saturday for glandand yesterday to the terror of grissell 5 and all the papal court i appeared in the front rank of the pilgrims in the vatican and got the blessing of the holy fathera blessing they would have denied me  he was wonderful as he was carried past me on his thronenot of flesh and blood but a white soul robed in white and an artist as well as a saintthe only instance in history if the newspapers are to be believed  i have seen nothing like the extraordinary grace of his gestures as he rose from moment to moment to blesspossibly the pilgrims but certainly me  tree should see him  it is his only chance  i was deeply impressed and my walkingstick showed signs of budding would have budded indeed only at the door of the chapel it was taken from me by the knave of spades  this strange prohibition is of course in honour of tannhauser  how did i get the ticket  by a miracle of course  i thought it was hopeless and made no effort of any kind  on saturday afternoon at five oclock h and i went to have tea at the hotel de leurope  suddenly as i was eating buttered toast a manor what seemed to be onedressed like a hotel porter entered and asked me would i like to see the pope on easter day  i bowed my head humbly and said non sum dignus or words to that effect  he at once produced a ticket  when i tell you that his countenance was of supernatural ugliness and that the price of the ticket was thirty pieces of silver i need say no more  an equally curious thing is that whenever i pass the hotel which i do constantly i see the same man  scientists call that phenomenon an obsession of the visual nerve  you and i know better  on the afternoon of easter day i heard vespers at the lateran music quite lovely  at the close a bishop in red and with red glovessuch as pater talks of in gaston de latourcame out on the balcony and showed us the relics  he was swarthy and wore a yellow mitre  a sinister mediaeval man but superbly gothic just like the bishops carved on stalls or on portals and when one thinks that once people mocked at stainedglass attitudes they are the only attitudes for the clothes  the sight of the bishop whom i watched with fascination filled me with the great sense of the realism of gothic art  neither in greek art nor in gothic art is there any pose  posing was invented by bad portraitpainters and the first person who posed was a stockbroker and he has gone on posing ever since  i send you a photograph i took on palm sunday at palermo  do send me some of yours and love me always and try to read
