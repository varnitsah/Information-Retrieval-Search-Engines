67963005	the lady or the tiger  by  frank r stockton     in the very olden time there lived a semibarbaric king whose ideas though somewhat polished and sharpened by the progressiveness of distant latin neighbors were still large florid and untrammeled as became the half of him which was barbaric he was a man of exuberant fancy and withal of an authority so irresistible that at his will he turned his varied fancies into facts he was greatly given to selfcommuning and when he and himself agreed upon anything the thing was done  when every member of his domestic and political systems moved smoothly in its appointed course his nature was bland and genial but whenever there was a little hitch and some of his orbs got out of their orbits he was blander and more genial still for nothing pleased him so much as to make the crooked straight and crush down uneven places  among the borrowed notions by which his barbarism had become semified was that of the public arena in which by exhibitions of manly and beastly valor the minds of his subjects were refined and cultured  but even here the exuberant and barbaric fancy asserted itself the arena of the king was built not to give the people an opportunity of hearing the rhapsodies of dying gladiators nor to enable them to view the inevitable conclusion of a conflict between religious opinions and hungry jaws but for purposes far better adapted to widen and develop the mental energies of the people this vast amphitheater with its encircling galleries its mysterious vaults and its unseen passages was an agent of poetic justice in which crime was punished or virtue rewarded by the decrees of an impartial and incorruptible chance  when a subject was accused of a crime of sufficient importance to interest the king public notice was given that on an appointed day the fate of the accused person would be decided in the kings arena a structure which well deserved its name for although its form and plan were borrowed from afar its purpose emanated solely from the brain of this man who every barleycorn a king knew no tradition to which he owed more allegiance than pleased his fancy and who ingrafted on every adopted form of human thought and action the rich growth of his barbaric idealism  when all the people had assembled in the galleries and the king surrounded by his court sat high up on his throne of royal state on one side of the arena he gave a signal a door beneath him opened and the accused subject stepped out into the amphitheater directly opposite him on the other side of the inclosed space were two doors exactly alike and side by side it was the duty and the privilege of the person on trial to walk directly to these doors and open one of them he could open either door he pleased he was subject to no guidance or influence but that of the aforementioned impartial and incorruptible chance if he opened the one there came out of it a hungry tiger the fiercest and most cruel that could be procured which immediately sprang upon him and tore him to pieces as a punishment for his guilt the moment that the case of the criminal was thus decided doleful iron bells were clanged great wails went up from the hired mourners posted on the outer rim of the arena and the vast audience with bowed heads and downcast hearts wended slowly their homeward way mourning greatly that one so young and fair or so old and respected should have merited so dire a fate  but if the accused person opened the other door there came forth from it a lady the most suitable to his years and station that his majesty could select among his fair subjects and to this lady he was immediately married as a reward of his innocence it mattered not that he might already possess a wife and family or that his affections might be engaged upon an object of his own selection the king allowed no such subordinate arrangements to interfere with his great scheme of retribution and reward the exercises as in the other instance took place immediately and in the arena another door opened beneath the king and a priest followed by a band of choristers and dancing maidens blowing joyous airs on golden horns and treading an epithalamic measure advanced to where the pair stood side by side and the wedding was promptly and cheerily solemnized then the gay brass bells rang forth their merry peals the people shouted glad hurrahs and the innocent man preceded by children strewing flowers on his path led his bride to his home  this was the kings semibarbaric method of administering justice its perfect fairness is obvious the criminal could not know out of which door would come the lady he opened either he pleased without having the slightest idea whether in the next instant he was to be devoured or married on some occasions the tiger came out of one door and on some out of the other the decisions of this tribunal were not only fair they were positively determinate the accused person was instantly punished if he found himself guilty and if innocent he was rewarded on the spot whether he liked it or not there was no escape from the judgments of the kings arena  the institution was a very popular one when the people gathered together on one of the great trial days they never knew whether they were to witness a bloody slaughter or a hilarious wedding  this element of uncertainty lent an interest to the occasion which it could not otherwise have attained thus the masses were entertained and pleased and the thinking part of the community could bring no charge of unfairness against this plan for did not the accused person have the whole matter in his own hands  this semibarbaric king had a daughter as blooming as his most florid fancies and with a soul as fervent and imperious as his own as is usual in such cases she was the apple of his eye and was loved by him above all humanity among his courtiers was a young man of that fineness of blood and lowness of station common to the conventional heroes of romance who love royal maidens this royal maiden was well satisfied with her lover for he was handsome and brave to a degree unsurpassed in all this kingdom and she loved him with an ardor that had enough of barbarism in it to make it exceedingly warm and strong this love affair moved on happily for many months until one day the king happened to discover its existence he did not hesitate nor waver in regard to his duty in the premises the youth was immediately cast into prison and a day was appointed for his trial in the kings arena this of course was an especially important occasion and his majesty as well as all the people was greatly interested in the workings and development of this trial never before had such a case occurred never before had a subject dared to love the daughter of the king in after years such things became commonplace enough but then they were in no slight degree novel and startling  the tigercages of the kingdom were searched for the most savage and relentless beasts from which the fiercest monster might be selected for the arena and the ranks of maiden youth and beauty throughout the land were carefully surveyed by competent judges in order that the young man might have a fitting bride in case fate did not determine for him a different destiny of course everybody knew that the deed with which the accused was charged had been done he had loved the princess and neither he she nor any one else thought of denying the fact but the king would not think of allowing any fact of this kind to interfere with the workings of the tribunal in which he took such great delight and satisfaction no matter how the affair turned out the youth would be disposed of and the king would take an aesthetic pleasure in watching the course of events which would determine whether or not the young man had done wrong in allowing himself to love the princess  the appointed day arrived from far and near the people gathered and thronged the great galleries of the arena and crowds unable to gain admittance massed themselves against its outside walls  the king and his court were in their places opposite the twin doors those fateful portals so terrible in their similarity  all was ready the signal was given a door beneath the royal party opened and the lover of the princess walked into the arena  tall beautiful fair his appearance was greeted with a low hum of admiration and anxiety half the audience had not known so grand a youth had lived among them no wonder the princess loved him what a terrible thing for him to be there  as the youth advanced into the arena he turned as the custom was to bow to the king but he did not think at all of that royal personage his eyes were fixed upon the princess who sat to the right of her father had it not been for the moiety of barbarism in her nature it is probable that lady would not have been there but her intense and fervid soul would not allow her to be absent on an occasion in which she was so terribly interested from the moment that the decree had gone forth that her lover should decide his fate in the kings arena she had thought of nothing night or day but this great event and the various subjects connected with it possessed of more power influence and force of character than any one who had ever before been interested in such a case she had done what no other person had doneshe had possessed herself of the secret of the doors she knew in which of the two rooms that lay behind those doors stood the cage of the tiger with its open front and in which waited the lady  through these thick doors heavily curtained with skins on the inside it was impossible that any noise or suggestion should come from within to the person who should approach to raise the latch of one of them but gold and the power of a womans will had brought the secret to the princess  and not only did she know in which room stood the lady ready to emerge all blushing and radiant should her door be opened but she knew who the lady was it was one of the fairest and loveliest of the damsels of the court who had been selected as the reward of the accused youth should he be proved innocent of the crime of aspiring to one so far above him and the princess hated her often had she seen or imagined that she had seen this fair creature throwing glances of admiration upon the person of her lover and sometimes she thought these glances were perceived and even returned now and then she had seen them talking together it was but for a moment or two but much can be said in a brief space it may have been on most unimportant topics but how could she know that the girl was lovely but she had dared to raise her eyes to the loved one of the princess and with all the intensity of the savage blood transmitted to her through long lines of wholly barbaric ancestors she hated the woman who blushed and trembled behind that silent door  when her lover turned and looked at her and his eye met hers as she sat there paler and whiter than any one in the vast ocean of anxious faces about her he saw by that power of quick perception which is given to those whose souls are one that she knew behind which door crouched the tiger and behind which stood the lady he had expected her to know it he understood her nature and his soul was assured that she would never rest until she had made plain to herself this thing hidden to all other lookerson even to the king the only hope for the youth in which there was any element of certainty was based upon the success of the princess in discovering this mystery and the moment he looked upon her he saw she had succeeded as in his soul he knew she would succeed  then it was that his quick and anxious glance asked the question which it was as plain to her as if he shouted it from where he stood there was not an instant to be lost the question was asked in a flash it must be answered in another  her right arm lay on the cushioned parapet before her she raised her hand and made a slight quick movement toward the right no one but her lover saw her every eye but his was fixed on the man in the arena  he turned and with a firm and rapid step he walked across the empty space every heart stopped beating every breath was held every eye was fixed immovably upon that man without the slightest hesitation he went to the door on the right and opened it  now the point of the story is this did the tiger come out of that door or did the lady  the more we reflect upon this question the harder it is to answer it involves a study of the human heart which leads us through devious mazes of passion out of which it is difficult to find our way think of it fair reader not as if the decision of the question depended upon yourself but upon that hotblooded semibarbaric princess her soul at a white heat beneath the combined fires of despair and jealousy she had lost him but who should have him  how often in her waking hours and in her dreams had she started in wild horror and covered her face with her hands as she thought of her lover opening the door on the other side of which waited the cruel fangs of the tiger  but how much oftener had she seen him at the other door how in her grievous reveries had she gnashed her teeth and torn her hair when she saw his start of rapturous delight as he opened the door of the lady how her soul had burned in agony when she had seen him rush to meet that woman with her flushing cheek and sparkling eye of triumph when she had seen him lead her forth his whole frame kindled with the joy of recovered life when she had heard the glad shouts from the multitude and the wild ringing of the happy bells when she had seen the priest with his joyous followers advance to the couple and make them man and wife before her very eyes and when she had seen them walk away together upon their path of flowers followed by the tremendous shouts of the hilarious multitude in which her one despairing shriek was lost and drowned  would it not be better for him to die at once and go to wait for her in the blessed regions of semibarbaric futurity  and yet that awful tiger those shrieks that blood  her decision had been indicated in an instant but it had been made after days and nights of anguished deliberation she had known she would be asked she had decided what she would answer and without the slightest hesitation she had moved her hand to the right  the question of her decision is one not to be lightly considered and it is not for me to presume to set myself up as the one person able to answer it and so i leave it with all of you which came out of the opened doorthe lady or the tiger
