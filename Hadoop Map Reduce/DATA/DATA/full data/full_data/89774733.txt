 nathaniel hawthorne    in the old times of religious gloom and intolerance lived richard digby the gloomiest and most intolerant of a stern brotherhood  his plan of salvation was so narrow that like a plank in a tempestuous sea it could avail no sinner but himself who bestrode it triumphantly and hurled anathemas against the wretches whom he saw struggling with the billows of eternal death  in his view of the matter it was a most abominable crimeas indeed it is a great follyfor men to trust to their own strength or even to grapple to any other fragment of the wreck save this narrow plank which moreover he took special care to keep out of their reach  in other words as his creed was like no mans else and being well pleased that providence had intrusted him alone of mortals with the treasure of a true faith richard digby determined to seclude himself to the sole and constant enjoyment of his happy fortune  and verily thought he i deem it a chief condition of heavens mercy to myself that i hold no communion with those abominable myriads which it hath cast off to perish  peradventure were i to tarry longer in the tents of kedar the gracious boon would be revoked and i also be swallowed up in the deluge of wrath or consumed in the storm of fire and brimstone or involved in whatever new kind of ruin is ordained for the horrible perversity of this generation  so richard digby took an axe to hew space enough for a tabernacle in the wilderness and some few other necessaries especially a sword and gun to smite and slay any intruder upon his hallowed seclusion and plunged into the dreariest depths of the forest  on its verge however he paused a moment to shake off the dust of his feet against the village where he had dwelt and to invoke a curse on the meetinghouse which he regarded as a temple of heathen idolatry  he felt a curiosity also to see whether the fire and brimstone would not rush down from heaven at once now that the one righteous man had provided for his own safety but as the sunshine continued to fall peacefully on the cottages and fields and the husbandmen labored and children played and as there were many tokens of present happiness and nothing ominous of a speedy judgment he turned away somewhat disappointed  the farther he went however and the lonelier he felt himself and the thicker the trees stood along his path and the darker the shadow overhead so much the more did richard digby exult  he talked to himself as he strode onward he read his bible to himself as he sat beneath the trees and as the gloom of the forest hid the blessed sky i had almost added that at morning noon and eventide he prayed to himself  so congenial was this mode of life to his disposition that he often laughed to himself but was displeased when an echo tossed him back the long loud roar  in this manner he journeyed onward three days and two nights and came on the third evening to the mouth of a cave which at first sight reminded him of elijahs cave at horeb though perhaps it more resembled abrahams sepulchral cave at machpelah  it entered into the heart of a rocky hill  there was so dense a veil of tangled foliage about it that none but a sworn lover of gloomy recesses would have discovered the low arch of its entrance or have dared to step within its vaulted chamber where the burning eyes of a panther might encounter him  if nature meant this remote and dismal cavern for the use of man it could only be to bury in its gloom the victims of a pestilence and then to block up its mouth with stones and avoid the spot forever after  there was nothing bright nor cheerful near it except a bubbling fountain some twenty paces off at which richard digby hardly threw away a glance  but he thrust his head into the cave shivered and congratulated himself  the finger of providence hath pointed my way cried he aloud while the tomblike den returned a strange echo as if some one within were mocking him  here my soul will be at peace for the wicked will not find me  here i can read the scriptures and be no more provoked with lying interpretations  here i can offer up acceptable prayers because my voice will not be mingled with the sinful supplications of the multitude  of a truth the only way to heaven leadeth through the narrow entrance of this caveand i alone have found it  in regard to this cave it was observable that the roof so far as the imperfect light permitted it to be seen was hung with substances resembling opaque icicles for the damps of unknown centuries dripping down continually had become as hard as adamant and wherever that moisture fell it seemed to possess the power of converting what it bathed to stone  the fallen leaves and sprigs of foliage which the wind had swept into the cave and the little feathery shrubs rooted near the threshold were not wet with a natural dew but had been embalmed by this wondrous process  and here i am put in mind that richard digby before he withdrew himself from the world was supposed by skilful physicians to have contracted a disease for which no remedy was written in their medical books  it was a deposition of calculous particles within his heart caused by an obstructed circulation of the blood and unless a miracle should be wrought for him there was danger that the malady might act on the entire substance of the organ and change his fleshy heart to stone  many indeed affirmed that the process was already near its consummation  richard digby however could never be convinced that any such direful work was going on within him nor when he saw the sprigs of marble foliage did his heart even throb the quicker at the similitude suggested by these once tender herbs  it may be that this same insensibility was a symptom of the disease  be that as it might richard digby was well contented with his sepulchral cave  so dearly did he love this congenial spot that instead of going a few paces to the bubbling spring for water he allayed his thirst with now and then a drop of moisture from the roof which had it fallen anywhere but on his tongue would have been congealed into a pebble  for a man predisposed to stoniness of the heart this surely was unwholesome liquor  but there he dwelt for three days more eating herbs and roots drinking his own destruction sleeping as it were in a tomb and awaking to the solitude of death yet esteeming this horrible mode of life as hardly inferior to celestial bliss  perhaps superior for above the sky there would be angels to disturb him  at the close of the third day he sat in the portal of his mansion reading the bible aloud because no other ear could profit by it and reading it amiss because the rays of the setting sun did not penetrate the dismal depth of shadow round about him nor fall upon the sacred page  suddenly however a faint gleam of light was thrown over the volume and raising his eyes richard digby saw that a young woman stood before the mouth of the cave and that the sunbeams bathed her white garment which thus seemed to possess a radiance of its own  good evening richard said the girl i have come from afar to find thee  the slender grace and gentle loveliness of this young woman were at once recognized by richard digby  her name was mary goffe  she had been a convert to his preaching of the word in england before he yielded himself to that exclusive bigotry which now enfolded him with such an iron grasp that no other sentiment could reach his bosom  when he came a pilgrim to america she had remained in her fathers hall but now as it appeared had crossed the ocean after him impelled by the same faith that led other exiles hither and perhaps by love almost as holy  what else but faith and love united could have sustained so delicate a creature wandering thus far into the forest with her golden hair dishevelled by the boughs and her feet wounded by the thorns  yet weary and faint though she must have been and affrighted at the dreariness of the cave she looked on the lonely man with a mild and pitying expression such as might beam from an angels eyes towards an afflicted mortal  but the recluse frowning sternly upon her and keeping his finger between the leaves of his halfclosed bible motioned her away with his hand  off  cried he  i am sanctified and thou art sinful  away  o richard said she earnestly i have come this weary way because i heard that a grievous distemper had seized upon thy heart and a great physician hath given me the skill to cure it  there is no other remedy than this which i have brought thee  turn me not away therefore nor refuse my medicine for then must this dismal cave be thy sepulchre  away replied richard digby still with a dark frown  my heart is in better condition than thine own  leave me earthly one for the sun is almost set and when no light reaches the door of the cave then is my prayertime  now great as was her need mary goffe did not plead with this stonyhearted man for shelter and protection nor ask anything whatever for her own sake  all her zeal was for his welfare  come back with me she exclaimed clasping her handscome back to thy fellowmen for they need thee richard and thou hast tenfold need of them  stay not in this evil den for the air is chill and the damps are fatal nor will any that perish within it ever find the path to heaven  hasten hence i entreat thee for thine own souls sake for either the roof will fall upon thy head or some other speedy destruction is at hand  perverse woman answered richard digby laughing aloudfor he was moved to bitter mirth by her foolish vehemencei tell thee that the path to heaven leadeth straight through this narrow portal where i sit and moreover the destruction thou speakest of is ordained not for this blessed cave but for all other habitations of mankind throughout the earth  get thee hence speedily that thou mayst have thy share  so saving he opened his bible again and fixed his eyes intently on the page being resolved to withdraw his thoughts from this child of sin and wrath and to waste no more of his holy breath upon her  the shadow had now grown so deep where he was sitting that he made continual mistakes in what he read converting all that was gracious and merciful to denunciations of vengeance and unutterable woe on every created being but himself  mary goffe meanwhile was leaning against a tree beside the sepulchral cave very sad yet with something heavenly and ethereal in her unselfish sorrow  the light from the setting sun still glorified her form and was reflected a little way within the darksome den discovering so terrible a gloom that the maiden shuddered for its selfdoomed inhabitant  espying the bright fountain near at hand she hastened thither and scooped up a portion of its water in a cup of birchen bark a few tears mingled with the draught and perhaps gave it all its efficacy  she then returned to the mouth of the cave and knelt down at richard digbys feet  richard she said with passionate fervor yet a gentleness in all her passion i pray thee by thy hope of heaven and as thou wouldst not dwell in this tomb forever drink of this hallowed water be it but a single drop  then make room for me by thy side and let us read together one page of that blessed volume and lastly kneel down with me and pray  do this and thy stony heart shall become softer than a babes and all be well  but richard digby in utter abhorrence of the proposal cast the bible at his feet and eyed her with such a fixed and evil frown that he looked less like a living man than a marble statue wrought by some darkimagined sculptor to express the most repulsive mood that human features could assume  and as his look grew even devilish so with an equal change did mary goffe become more sad more mild more pitiful more like a sorrowing angel  but the more heavenly she was the more hateful did she seem to richard digby who at length raised his hand and smote down the cup of hallowed water upon the threshold of the cave thus rejecting the only medicine that could have cured his stony heart  a sweet perfume lingered in the air for a moment and then was gone  tempt me no more accursed woman exclaimed he still with his marble frown lest i smite thee down also  what hast thou to do with my biblewhat with my prayerswhat with my heaven  no sooner had he spoken these dreadful words than richard digbys heart ceased to beat whileso the legend saysthe form of mary goffe melted into the last sunbeams and returned from the sepulchral cave to heaven for mary golfe had been buried in an english churchyard months before and either it was her ghost that haunted the wild forest or else a dreamlike spirit typifying pure religion  above a century afterwards when the trackless forest of richard digbys day had long been interspersed with settlements the children of a neighboring farmer were playing at the foot of a hill  the trees on account of the rude and broken surface of this acclivity had never been felled and were crowded so densely together as to hide all but a few rocky prominences wherever their roots could grapple with the soil  a little boy and girl to conceal themselves from their playmates had crept into the deepest shade where not only the darksome pines but a thick veil of creeping plants suspended from an overhanging rock combined to make a twilight at noonday and almost a midnight at all other seasons  there the children hid themselves and shouted repeating the cry at intervals till the whole party of pursuers were drawn thither and pulling aside the matted foliage let in a doubtful glimpse of daylight  but scarcely was this accomplished when the little group uttered a simultaneous shriek and tumbled headlong down the hill making the best of their way homeward without a second glance into the gloomy recess  their father unable to comprehend what had so startled them took his axe and by felling one or two trees and tearing away the creeping plants laid the mystery open to the day  he had discovered the entrance of a cave closely resembling the mouth of a sepulchre within which sat the figure of a man whose gesture and attitude warned the father and children to stand back while his visage wore a most forbidding frown  this repulsive personage seemed to have been carved in the same gray stone that formed the walls and portal of the cave  on minuter inspection indeed such blemishes were observed as made it doubtful whether the figure were really a statue chiselled by human art and somewhat worn and defaced by the lapse of ages or a freak of nature who might have chosen to imitate in stone her usual handiwork of flesh perhaps it was the least unreasonable idea suggested by this strange spectacle that the moisture of the cave possessed a petrifying quality which had thus awfully embalmed a human corpse  there was something so frightful in the aspect of this man of adamant that the farmer the moment that he recovered from the fascination of his first gaze began to heap stones into the mouth of the cavern  his wife who had followed him to the hill assisted her husbands efforts the children also approached as near as they durst with their little hands full of pebbles and cast them on the pile  earth was then thrown into the crevices and the whole fabric overlaid with sods thus all traces of the discovery were obliterated leaving only a marvellous legend which grew wilder from one generation to another as the children told it to their grandchildren and they to their posterity till few believed that there had ever been a cavern or a statue where now they saw but a grassy patch on the shadowy hillside yet grown people avoid the spot nor do children play there friendship and love and piety all human and celestial sympathies should keep aloof from that hidden cave for there still sits and unless an earthquake crumble down the roof upon his head shall sit forever the shape of richard digby in the attitude of repelling the whole race of mortalsnot from heavenbut from the horrible loneliness of his dark cold sepulchre
