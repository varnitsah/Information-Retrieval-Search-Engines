28022700	lifes handicap  being stories of mine own people  by rudyard kipling  1915   to ekr from rk 188789 cmg     preface  in northern india stood a monastery called the chubara of dhunni bhagat no one remembered who or what dhunni bhagat had been he had lived his life made a little money and spent it all as every good hindu should do on a work of pietythe chubara that was full of brick cells gaily painted with the figures of gods and kings and elephants where wornout priests could sit and meditate on the latter end of things the paths were brick paved and the naked feet of thousands had worn them into gutters clumps of mangoes sprouted from between the bricks great pipal trees overhung the wellwindlass that whined all day and hosts of parrots tore through the trees crows and squirrels were tame in that place for they knew that never a priest would touch them  the wandering mendicants charmsellers and holy vagabonds for a hundred miles round used to make the chubara their place of call and rest mahomedan sikh and hindu mixed equally under the trees they were old men and when man has come to the turnstiles of night all the creeds in the world seem to him wonderfully alike and colourless  gobind the oneeyed told me this he was a holy man who lived on an island in the middle of a river and fed the fishes with little bread pellets twice a day in floodtime when swollen corpses stranded themselves at the foot of the island gobind would cause them to be piously burned for the sake of the honour of mankind and having regard to his own account with god hereafter but when twothirds of the island was torn away in a spate gobind came across the river to dhunni bhagats chubara he and his brass drinking vessel with the wellcord round the neck his short armrest crutch studded with brass nails his roll of bedding his big pipe his umbrella and his tall sugarloaf hat with the nodding peacock feathers in it he wrapped himself up in his patched quilt made of every colour and material in the world sat down in a sunny corner of the very quiet chubara and resting his arm on his shorthandled crutch waited for death the people brought him food and little clumps of marigold flowers and he gave his blessing in return he was nearly blind and his face was seamed and lined and wrinkled beyond belief for he had lived in his time which was before the english came within five hundred miles of dhunni bhagats chubara  when we grew to know each other well gobind would tell me tales in a voice most like the rumbling of heavy guns over a wooden bridge his tales were true but not one in twenty could be printed in an english book because the english do not think as natives do they brood over matters that a native would dismiss till a fitting occasion and what they would not think twice about a native will brood over till a fitting occasion then native and english stare at each other hopelessly across great gulfs of miscomprehension  and what said gobind one sunday evening is your honoured craft and by what manner of means earn you your daily bread  i am said i a keranione who writes with a pen upon paper not being in the service of the government  then what do you write said gobind come nearer for i cannot see your countenance and the light fails  i write of all matters that lie within my understanding and of many that do not but chiefly i write of life and death and men and women and love and fate according to the measure of my ability telling the tale through the mouths of one two or more people then by the favour of god the tales are sold and money accrues to me that i may keep alive  even so said gobind that is the work of the bazar storyteller but he speaks straight to men and women and does not write anything at all only when the tale has aroused expectation and calamities are about to befall the virtuous he stops suddenly and demands payment ere he continues the narration is it so in your craft my son  i have heard of such things when a tale is of great length and is sold as a cucumber in small pieces  ay i was once a famed teller of stories when i was begging on the road between koshin and etra before the last pilgrimage that ever i took to orissa i told many tales and heard many more at the resthouses in the evening when we were merry at the end of the march it is in my heart that grown men are but as little children in the matter of tales and the oldest tale is the most beloved  with your people that is truth said i but in regard to our people they desire new tales and when all is written they rise up and declare that the tale were better told in such and such a manner and doubt either the truth or the invention thereof  but what folly is theirs said gobind throwing out his knotted hand a tale that is told is a true tale as long as the telling lasts and of their talk upon ityou know how bilas khan that was the prince of taletellers said to one who mocked him in the great resthouse on the jhelum road go on my brother and finish that i have begun and he who mocked took up the tale but having neither voice nor manner for the task came to a standstill and the pilgrims at supper made him eat abuse and stick half that night  nay but with our people money having passed it is their right as we should turn against a shoeseller in regard to shoes if those wore out if ever i make a book you shall see and judge  and the parrot said to the falling tree wait brother till i fetch a prop said gobind with a grim chuckle god has given me eighty years and it may be some over i cannot look for more than day granted by day and as a favour at this tide be swift  in what manner is it best to set about the task said i o chiefest of those who string pearls with their tongue  how do i know yethe thought for a littlehow should i not know god has made very many heads but there is only one heart in all the world among your people or my people they are children in the matter of tales  but none are so terrible as the little ones if a man misplace a word or in a second telling vary events by so much as one small devil  ay i also have told tales to the little ones but do thou this his old eyes fell on the gaudy paintings of the wall the blue and red dome and the flames of the poinsettias beyond tell them first of those things that thou hast seen and they have seen together thus their knowledge will piece out thy imperfections tell them of what thou alone hast seen then what thou hast heard and since they be children tell them of battles and kings horses devils elephants and angels but omit not to tell them of love and suchlike all the earth is full of tales to him who listens and does not drive away the poor from his door the poor are the best of taletellers for they must lay their ear to the ground every night  after this conversation the idea grew in my head and gobind was pressing in his inquiries as to the health of the book  later when we had been parted for months it happened that i was to go away and far off and i came to bid gobind goodbye  it is farewell between us now for i go a very long journey i said  and i also a longer one than thou but what of the book said he  it will be born in due season if it is so ordained  i would i could see it said the old man huddling beneath his quilt but that will not be i die three days hence in the night a little before the dawn the term of my years is accomplished  in nine cases out of ten a native makes no miscalculation as to the day of his death he has the foreknowledge of the beasts in this respect  then thou wilt depart in peace and it is good talk for thou hast said that life is no delight to thee  but it is a pity that our book is not born how shall i know that there is any record of my name  because i promise in the forepart of the book preceding everything else that it shall be written gobind sadhu of the island in the river and awaiting god in dhunni bhagats chubara first spoke of the book said i  and gave counselan old mans counsel gobind son of gobind of the chumi village in the karaon tehsil in the district of mooltan will that be written also  that will be written also  and the book will go across the black water to the houses of your people and all the sahibs will know of me who am eighty years old  all who read the book shall know i cannot promise for the rest  that is good talk call aloud to all who are in the monastery and i will tell them this thing  they trooped up faquirs sadhus sunnyasis byragis nihangs and mullahs priests of all faiths and every degree of raggedness and gobind leaning upon his crutch spoke so that they were visibly filled with envy and a whitehaired senior bade gobind think of his latter end instead of transitory repute in the mouths of strangers then gobind gave me his blessing and i came away  these tales have been collected from all places and all sorts of people from priests in the chubara from ala yar the carver jiwun singh the carpenter nameless men on steamers and trains round the world women spinning outside their cottages in the twilight officers and gentlemen now dead and buried and a few but these are the very best my father gave me the greater part of them have been published in magazines and newspapers to whose editors i am indebted but some are new on this side of the water and some have not seen the light before  the most remarkable stories are of course those which do not appear for obvious reasons     contents   the lang men o larut  reingelder and the german flag  the wandering jew  through the fire  the finances of the gods  the amirs homily  jews in shushan  the limitations of pambe serang  little tobrah  bubbling well road  the city of dreadful night  georgie porgie  naboth  the dream of duncan

engineers sleeping suit was of yellow striped with blue and his speech was the speech of aberdeen they sluiced the deck under him and he hopped on to the ornamental capstan a black pipe between his teeth though the hour was not seven of the morn  did you ever hear o the lang men o larut he asked when the man from orizava had finished a story of an aboriginal giant discovered in the wilds of brazil there was never story yet passed the lips of teller but the man from orizava could cap it  no we never did we responded with one voice the man from orizava watched the chief keenly as a possible rival  im not telling the story for the sake of talking merely said the chief but as a warning against betting unless you bet on a perrfect certainty the lang men o larut were just a certainty i have had talk wi them now larut you will understand is a dependency or it may be an outlying possession o the island o penang and there they will get you tin and manganese an it mayhap mica and all manner o meenerals larut is a great place  but what about the population said the man from orizava  the population said the chief slowly were few but enorrmous you must understand that exceptin the tinmines there is no special inducement to europeans to reside in larut the climate is warm and remarkably like the climate o calcutta and in regard to calcutta it cannot have escaped your obsairvation that  calcutta isnt larut and weve only just come from it protested the man from orizava theres a meteorological department in calcutta too  ay but theres no meteorological department in larut each man is a law to himself some drink whisky and some drink brandipanee and some drink cocktailsvara bad for the coats o the stomach is a cocktail and some drink sangaree so i have been credibly informed but one and all they sweat like the packing of pistonhead on a fourrteendays voyage with the screw racing half her time but as i was saying the population o larut was five all told of englishthat is to say scotchan im scotch ye know said the chief  the man from orizava lit another cigarette and waited patiently it was hopeless to hurry the chief engineer  i am not pretending to account for the population o larut being laid down according to such fabulous dimensions o the five white men engaged upon the extraction o tin ore and mercantile pursuits there were three o the sons o anak wait while i remember lammitter was the first by two inchesa giant in the land an a terreefic man to cross in his ways from heel to head he was six feet nine inches and proportionately built across and through the thickness of his body six good feet nine inchesan overbearin man next to him and i have forgotten his precise business was sandy vowle and he was six feet seven but lean and lathy and it was more in the elasteecity of his neck that the height lay than in any honesty o bone and sinew five feet and a few odd inches may have been his real height the remainder came out when he held up his head and six feet seven he was upon the doorsills i took his measure in chalk standin on a chair and next to him but a proportionately made man ruddy and of a fair countenance was jock coanthat they called the fir cone he was but six feet five and a child beside lammitter and vowle when the three walked out together they made a scunner run through the colony o larut the malays ran round them as though they had been the giant trees in the yosemite valleythese three lang men o larut it was perfectly ridiculousa lusus naturaethat one little place should have contained maybe the three tallest ordinar men upon the face o the earth  obsairve now the order o things for it led to the finest big drink in larut and six sore heads the morn that endured for a week i am against immoderate liquor but the event to follow was a justification you must understand that many coasting steamers call at larut wi strangers o the mercantile profession in the spring time when the young cocoanuts were ripening and the trees o the forests were putting forth their leaves there came an american man to larut and he was six foot three or it may have been four in his stockings he came on business from sacramento but he stayed for pleasure wi the lang men o larut less than a half o the population were ordinar in their girth and stature ye will understandhowson and nailor merchants five feet nine or thereabouts he had business with those two and he stood above them from the six feet threedom o his height till they went to drink in the course o conversation he said as tall men will things about his height and the trouble of it to him that was his pride o the flesh  as the longest man in the island he said but there they took him up and asked if he were sure  i say i am the longest man in the island he said and on that ill bet my substance  they laid down the bedplates of a big drink then and there and put it aside while they called jock coan from his house near by among the fireflies winking  hows a wi you said jock and came in by the side o the sacramento profligate two inches or it may have been one taller than he  youre long said the man opening his eyes but i am longer an they sent a whistle through the night an howkit out sandy vowle from his bit bungalow and he came in an stood by the side o jock an the pair just fillit the room to the ceilingcloth  the sacramento man was a euchreplayer and a most profane sweerer you hold both bowers he said but the joker is with me  fair an softly says nailor jock whaurs lang lammitter  here says that man putting his leg through the window and coming in like an anaconda o the desert furlong by furlong one foot in penang and one in batavia and a hand in north borneo it may be  are you suited said nailor when the hinder end o lang lammitter was slidden through the sill an the head of lammitter was lost in the smoke away above  the american man took out his card and put it on the table esdras b longer is my name america is my nation frisco is my restingplace but this here beats creation said he boys giantssideshow giants i minded to slide out of my bet if i had been overtopped on the strength of the riddle on this pasteboard i would have done it if you had topped me even by three inches but when it comes to feetyards miles i am not the man to shirk the biggest drink that ever made the travellersjoy palm blush with virginal indignation or the orang outang and the perambulating dyak howl with envy set them up and continue till the final conclusion  o mon i tell you twas an awful sight to see those four giants threshing about the house and the island and tearin down the pillars thereof an throwing palmtrees broadcast and currling their long legs round the hills o larut an awfu sight i was there i did not mean to tell you but its out now i was not overcome for i een sat me down under the pieces o the table at four the morn an meditated upon the strangeness of things  losh yons the breakfastbell     reingelder and the german flag footnote copyright 1891 by macmillan  co   hans breitmann paddled across the deck in his pink pyjamas a cup of tea

macmillan  co   if you go once round the world in an easterly direction you gain one day said the men of science to john hay in after years john hay went east west north and south transacted business made love and begat a family as have done many men and the scientific information above recorded lay neglected in the deeps of his mind with a thousand other matters of equal importance  when a rich relative died he found himself wealthy beyond any reasonable expectation that he had entertained in his previous career which had been a chequered and evil one indeed long before the legacy came to him there existed in the brain of john hay a little clouda momentary obscuration of thought that came and went almost before he could realize that there was any solution of continuity so do the bats flit round the eaves of a house to show that the darkness is falling he entered upon great possessions in money land and houses but behind his delight stood a ghost that cried out that his enjoyment of these things should not be of long duration it was the ghost of the rich relative who had been permitted to return to earth to torture his nephew into the grave wherefore under the spur of this constant reminder john hay always preserving the air of heavy businesslike stolidity that hid the shadow on his mind turned investments houses and lands into sovereignsrich round red english sovereigns each one worth twenty shillings lands may become valueless and houses fly heavenward on the wings of red flame but till the day of judgment a sovereign will always be a sovereignthat is to say a king of pleasures  possessed of his sovereigns john hay would fain have spent them one by one on such coarse amusements as his soul loved but he was haunted by the instant fear of death for the ghost of his relative stood in the hall of his house close to the hatrack shouting up the stairway that life was short that there was no hope of increase of days and that the undertakers were already roughing out his nephews coffin john hay was generally alone in the house and even when he had company his friends could not hear the clamorous uncle the shadow inside his brain grew larger and blacker his fear of death was driving john hay mad  then from the deeps of his mind where he had stowed away all his discarded information rose to light the scientific fact of the easterly journey on the next occasion that his uncle shouted up the stairway urging him to make haste and live a shriller voice cried who goes round the world once easterly gains one day  his growing diffidence and distrust of mankind made john hay unwilling to give this precious message of hope to his friends they might take it up and analyse it he was sure it was true but it would pain him acutely were rough hands to examine it too closely to him alone of all the toiling generations of mankind had the secret of immortality been vouchsafed it would be impiousagainst all the designs of the creator to set mankind hurrying eastward besides this would crowd the steamers inconveniently and john hay wished of all things to be alone if he could get round the world in two monthssome one of whom he had read he could not remember the name had covered the passage in eighty dayshe would gain a clear day and by steadily continuing to do it for thirty years would gain one hundred and eighty days or nearly the half of a year it would not be much but in course of time as civilisation advanced and the euphrates valley railway was opened he could improve the pace  armed with many sovereigns john hay in the thirtyfifth year of his age set forth on his travels two voices bearing him company from dover as he sailed to calais fortune favoured him the euphrates valley railway was newly opened and he was the first man who took ticket direct from calais to calcuttathirteen days in the train thirteen days in the train are not good for the nerves but he covered the world and returned to calais from america in twelve days over the two months and started afresh with four and twenty hours of precious time to his credit three years passed and john hay religiously went round this earth seeking for more time wherein to enjoy the remainder of his sovereigns he became known on many lines as the man who wanted to go on when people asked him what he was and what he did he answered  im the person who intends to live and i am trying to do it now  his days were divided between watching the white wake spinning behind the stern of the swiftest steamers or the brown earth flashing past the windows of the fastest trains and he noted in a pocketbook every minute that he had railed or screwed out of remorseless eternity  this is better than praying for long life quoth john hay as he turned his face eastward for his twentieth trip the years had done more for him than he dared to hope  by the extension of the brahmaputra valley line to meet the newly developed china midland the calais railway ticket held good via karachi and calcutta to hongkong the round trip could be managed in a fraction over fortyseven days and filled with fatal exultation john hay told the secret of his longevity to his only friend the housekeeper of his rooms in london he spoke and passed but the woman was one of resource and immediately took counsel with the lawyers who had first informed john hay of his golden legacy very many sovereigns still remained and another hay longed to spend them on things more sensible than railway tickets and steamer accommodation  the chase was long for when a man is journeying literally for the dear life he does not tarry upon the road round the world hay swept anew and overtook the wearied doctor who had been sent out to look for him in madras it was there that he found the reward of his toil and the assurance of a blessed immortality in half an hour the doctor watching always the parched lips the shaking hands and the eye that turned eternally to the east won john hay to rest in a little house close to the madras surf all that hay need do was to hang by ropes from the roof of the room and let the round earth swing free beneath him this was better than steamer or train for he gained a day in a day and was thus the equal of the undying sun the other hay would pay his expenses throughout eternity   it is true that we cannot yet take tickets from calais to hongkong though that will come about in fifteen years but men say that if you wander along the southern coast of india you shall find in a neatly whitewashed little bungalow sitting in a chair swung from the roof over a sheet of thin steel which he knows so well destroys the attraction of the earth an old and worn man who for ever faces the rising sun a stopwatch in his hand racing against eternity he cannot drink he does not smoke and his living expenses amount to perhaps twentyfive rupees a month but he is john hay the immortal without he hears the thunder of the wheeling world with which he is careful to explain he has no connection whatever but if you say that it is only the noise of the surf he will cry bitterly for the shadow on his brain is passing away as the brain ceases to work and he doubts sometimes whether the doctor spoke the truth  why does not the sun always remain over my head asks john hay     through the fire footnote copyright 1891 by macmillan  co   the policeman rode through the himalayan forest under the mossdraped oaks and his orderly trotted after him  its an ugly business bhere singh said the policeman where are they  it is a very ugly business said bhere singh and as for them they are doubtless now frying in a hotter fire than was ever made of sprucebranches  let us hope not said the policeman for allowing for the difference between race and race its the story of francesca da rimini bhere singh  bhere singh knew nothing about francesca da rimini so he held his peace until they came to the charcoalburners clearing where the dying flames said whit whit whit as they fluttered and whispered over the white ashes it must have been a great fire when at full height men had seen it at donga pa across the valley winking and blazing through the night and said that the charcoalburners of kodru were getting drunk but it was only suket singh sepoy of the load punjab native infantry and athira a woman burningburningburning  this was how things befell and the policemans diary will bear me out  athira was the wife of madu who was a charcoalburner oneeyed and of a malignant disposition a week after their marriage he beat athira with a heavy stick a month later suket singh sepoy came that way to the cool hills on leave from his regiment and electrified the villagers of kodru with tales of service and glory under the government and the honour in which he suket singh was held by the colonel sahib bahadur and desdemona listened to othello as desdemonas have done all the world over and as she listened she loved  ive a wife of my own said suket singh though that is no matter when you come to think of it i am also due to return to my regiment after a time and i cannot be a deserteri who intend to be havildar there is no himalayan version of i could not love thee dear as much loved i not honour more but suket singh came near to making one  never mind said athira stay with me and if madu tries to beat me you beat him  very good said suket singh and he beat madu severely to the delight of all the charcoalburners of kodru  that is enough said suket singh as he rolled madu down the hillside now we shall have peace but madu crawled up the grass slope again and hovered round his hut with angry eyes  hell kill me dead said athira to suket singh you must take me away  therell be a trouble in the lines my wife will pull out my beard but never mind said suket singh i will take you  there was loud trouble in the lines and suket singhs beard was pulled and suket singhs wife went to live with her mother and took away the children thats all right said athira and suket singh said yes thats all right  so there was only madu left in the hut that looks across the valley to donga pa and since the beginning of time no one has had any sympathy for husbands so unfortunate as madu  he went to juseen daze the wizardman who keeps the talking monkeys head  get me back my wife said madu  i cant said juseen daze until you have made the sutlej in the valley run up the donga pa  no riddles said madu and he shook his hatchet above juseen dazes white head  give all your money to the headmen of the village said juseen daze and they will hold a communal council and the council will send a message that your wife must come back  so madu gave up all his worldly wealth amounting to twentyseven rupees eight annas three pice and a silver chain to the council of kodru and it fell as juseen daze foretold  they sent athiras brother down into suket singhs regiment to call athira home suket singh kicked him once round the lines and then handed him over to the havildar who beat him with a belt  come back yelled athiras brother  where to said athira  to madu said he  never said she  then juseen daze will send a curse and you will wither away like a barked tree in the springtime said athiras brother athira slept over these things  next morning she had rheumatism i am beginning to wither away like a barked tree in the springtime she said that is the curse of juseen daze  and she really began to wither away because her heart was dried up with fear and those who believe in curses die from curses suket singh too was afraid because he loved athira better than his very life two months passed and athiras brother stood outside the regimental lines again and yelped aha you are withering away come back  i will come back said athira  say rather that we will come back said suket singh  ai but when said athiras brother  upon a day very early in the morning said suket singh and he tramped off to apply to the colonel sahib bahadur for one weeks leave  i am withering away like a barked tree in the spring moaned athira  you will be better soon said suket singh and he told her what was in his heart and the two laughed together softly for they loved each other but athira grew better from that hour  they went away together travelling thirdclass by train as the regulations provided and then in a cart to the low hills and on foot to the high ones athira sniffed the scent of the pines of her own hills the wet himalayan hills it is good to be alive said athira  hah said suket singh where is the kodru road and where is the forest rangers house  it cost forty rupees twelve years ago said the forest ranger handing the gun  here are twenty said suket singh and you must give me the best bullets  it is very good to be alive said athira wistfully sniffing the scent of the pinemould and they waited till the night had fallen upon kodru and the donga pa madu had stacked the dry wood for the next days charcoalburning on the spur above his house it is courteous in madu to save us this trouble said suket singh as he stumbled on the pile which was twelve foot square and four high we must wait till the moon rises  when the moon rose athira knelt upon the pile if it were only a government snider said suket singh ruefully squinting down the wire bound barrel of the forest rangers gun  be quick said athira and suket singh was quick but athira was quick no longer then he lit the pile at the four corners and climbed on to it reloading the gun  the little flames began to peer up between the big logs atop of the brushwood the government should teach us to pull the triggers with our toes said suket singh grimly to the moon that was the last public observation of sepoy suket singh   upon a day early in the morning madu came to the pyre and shrieked very grievously and ran away to catch the policeman who was on tour in the district  the baseborn has ruined four rupees worth of charcoal wood madu gasped he has also killed my wife and he has left a letter which i cannot read tied to a pine bough  in the stiff formal hand taught in the regimental school sepoy suket singh had written  let us be burned together if anything remain over for we have made the necessary prayers we have also cursed madu and malak the brother of athiraboth evil men send my service to the colonel sahib bahadur  the policeman looked long and curiously at the marriage bed of red and white ashes on which lay dull black the barrel of the rangers gun he drove his spurred heel absently into a halfcharred log and the chattering sparks flew upwards most extraordinary people said the policeman  whew whew ouiou said the little flames  the policeman entered the dry bones of the case for the punjab government does not approve of romancing in his diary  but who will pay me those four rupees said madu     the finances of the gods footnote copyright 1891 by macmillan  co   the evening meal was ended in dhunni bhagats chubara and the old priests were smoking or counting their beads a little naked child pattered in with its mouth wide open a handful of marigold flowers in one hand and a lump of conserved tobacco in the other it tried to kneel and make obeisance to gobind but it was so fat that it fell forward on its shaven head and rolled on its side kicking and gasping while the marigolds tumbled one way and the tobacco the other gobind laughed set it up again and blessed the marigold flowers as he received the tobacco  from my father said the child he has the fever and cannot come wilt thou pray for him father  surely littlest but the smoke is on the ground and the nightchill is in the airs and it is not good to go abroad naked in the autumn  i have no clothes said the child and all today i have been carrying cowdung cakes to the bazar it was very hot and i am very tired it shivered a little for the twilight was cool  gobind lifted an arm under his vast tattered quilt of many colours and made an inviting little nest by his side the child crept in and gobind filled his brassstudded leather waterpipe with the new tobacco when i came to the chubara the shaven head with the tuft atop and the beady black eyes looked out of the folds of the quilt as a squirrel looks out from his nest and gobind was smiling while the child played with his beard  i would have said something friendly but remembered in time that if the child fell ill afterwards i should be credited with the evil eye and that is a horrible possession  sit thou still thumbling i said as it made to get up and run away where is thy slate and why has the teacher let such an evil character loose on the streets when there are no police to protect us weaklings in which ward dost thou try to break thy neck with flying kites from the housetops  nay sahib nay said the child burrowing its face into gobinds beard and twisting uneasily there was a holiday today among the schools and i do not always fly kites i play kerlikit like the rest  cricket is the national game among the schoolboys of the punjab from the naked hedgeschool children who use an old kerosenetin for wicket to the bas of the university who compete for the championship belt  thou play kerlikit thou art half the height of the bat i said  the child nodded resolutely yea i do play perlayball owat ran ran ran i know it all  but thou must not forget with all this to pray to the gods according to custom said gobind who did not altogether approve of cricket and western innovations  i do not forget said the child in a hushed voice  also to give reverence to thy teacher andgobinds voice softened to abstain from pulling holy men by the beard little badling eh eh eh  the childs face was altogether hidden in the great white beard and it began to whimper till gobind soothed it as children are soothed all the world over with the promise of a story  i did not think to frighten thee senseless little one look up am i angry are are are shall i weep too and of our tears make a great pond and drown us both and then thy father will never get well lacking thee to pull his beard peace peace and i will tell thee of the gods thou hast heard many tales  very many father  now this is a new one which thou hast not heard long and long ago when the gods walked with men as they do today but that we have not faith to see shiv the greatest of gods and parbati his wife were walking in the garden of a temple  which temple that in the nandgaon ward said the child  nay very far away maybe at trimbak or hurdwar whither thou must make pilgrimage when thou art a man now there was sitting in the garden under the jujube trees a mendicant that had worshipped shiv for forty years and he lived on the offerings of the pious and meditated holiness night and day  oh father was it thou said the child looking up with large eyes  nay i have said it was long ago and moreover this mendicant was married  did they put him on a horse with flowers on his head and forbid him to go to sleep all night long thus they did to me when they made my wedding said the child who had been married a few months before  and what didst thou do said i  i wept and they called me evil names and then i smote her and we wept together  thus did not the mendicant said gobind for he was a holy man and very poor parbati perceived him sitting naked by the temple steps where all went up and down and she said to shiv what shall men think of the gods when the gods thus scorn their worshippers for forty years yonder man has prayed to us and yet there be only a few grains of rice and some broken cowries before him after all mens hearts will be hardened by this thing and shiv said it shall be looked to and so he called to the temple which was the temple of his son ganesh of the elephant head saying son there is a mendicant without who is very poor what wilt thou do for him then that great elephantheaded one awoke in the dark and answered in three days if it be thy will he shall have one lakh of rupees then shiv and parbati went away  but there was a moneylender in the garden hidden among the marigolds the child looked at the ball of crumpled blossoms in its handsay among the yellow marigolds and he heard the gods talking he was a covetous man and of a black heart and he desired that lakh of rupees for himself so he went to the mendicant and said o brother how much do the pious give thee daily the mendicant said i cannot tell sometimes a little rice sometimes a little pulse and a few cowries and it has been pickled mangoes and dried fish  that is good said the child smacking its lips  then said the moneylender because i have long watched thee and learned to love thee and thy patience i will give thee now five rupees for all thy earnings of the three days to come there is only a bond to sign on the matter but the mendicant said thou art mad in two months i do not receive the worth of five rupees and he told the thing to his wife that evening she being a woman said when did money lender ever make a bad bargain the wolf runs through the corn for the sake of the fat deer our fate is in the hands of the gods pledge it not even for three days  so the mendicant returned to the moneylender and would not sell then that wicked man sat all day before him offering more and more for those three days earnings first ten fifty and a hundred rupees and then for he did not know when the gods would pour down their gifts rupees by the thousand till he had offered half a lakh of rupees upon this sum the mendicants wife shifted her counsel and the mendicant signed the bond and the money was paid in silver great white bullocks bringing it by the cartload but saving only all that money the mendicant received nothing from the gods at all and the heart of the moneylender was uneasy on account of expectation therefore at noon of the third day the moneylender went into the temple to spy upon the councils of the gods and to learn in what manner that gift might arrive even as he was making his prayers a crack between the stones of the floor gaped and closing caught him by the heel then he heard the gods walking in the temple in the darkness of the columns and shiv called to his son ganesh saying son what hast thou done in regard to the lakh of rupees for the mendicant and ganesh woke for the moneylender heard the dry rustle of his trunk uncoiling and he answered father one half of the money has been paid and the debtor for the other half i hold here fast by the heel  the child bubbled with laughter and the moneylender paid the mendicant it said  surely for he whom the gods hold by the heel must pay to the uttermost the money was paid at evening all silver in great carts and thus ganesh did his work  nathu ohe nathu  a woman was calling in the dusk by the door of the courtyard  the child began to wriggle that is my mother it said  go then littlest answered gobind but stay a moment  he ripped a generous yard from his patchworkquilt put it over the childs shoulders and the child ran away     the amirs homily footnote copyright 1891 by macmillan  co   his royal highness abdur rahman amir of afghanistan gcsi and trusted ally of her imperial majesty the queen of england and empress of india is a gentleman for whom all rightthinking people should have a profound regard like most other rulers he governs not as he would but as he can and the mantle of his authority covers the most turbulent race under the stars to the afghan neither life property law nor kingship are sacred when his own lusts prompt him to rebel he is a thief by instinct a murderer by heredity and training and frankly and bestially immoral by all three none the less he has his own crooked notions of honour and his character is fascinating to study on occasion he will fight without reason given till he is hacked in pieces on other occasions he will refuse to show fight till he is driven into a corner herein he is as unaccountable as the gray wolf who is his bloodbrother  and these men his highness rules by the only weapon that they understandthe fear of death which among some orientals is the beginning of wisdom some say that the amirs authority reaches no farther than a rifle bullet can range but as none are quite certain when their king may be in their midst and as he alone holds every one of the threads of government his respect is increased among men gholam hyder the commanderinchief of the afghan army is feared reasonably for he can impale all kabul city fears the governor of kabul who has power of life and death through all the wards but the amir of afghanistan though outlying tribes pretend otherwise when his back is turned is dreaded beyond chief and governor together his word is red law by the gust of his passion falls the leaf of mans life and his favour is terrible he has suffered many things and been a hunted fugitive before he came to the throne and he understands all the classes of his people by the custom of the east any man or woman having a complaint to make or an enemy against whom to be avenged has the right of speaking face to face with the king at the daily public audience this is personal government as it was in the days of harun al raschid of blessed memory whose times exist still and will exist long after the english have passed away  the privilege of open speech is of course exercised at certain personal risk the king may be pleased and raise the speaker to honour for that very bluntness of speech which three minutes later brings a too imitative petitioner to the edge of the ever ready blade and the people love to have it so for it is their right  it happened upon a day in kabul that the amir chose to do his days work in the baber gardens which lie a short distance from the city of kabul a light table stood before him and round the table in the open air were grouped generals and finance ministers according to their degree the court and the long tail of feudal chiefsmen of blood fed and cowed by bloodstood in an irregular semicircle round the table and the wind from the kabul orchards blew among them all day long sweating couriers dashed in with letters from the outlying districts with rumours of rebellion intrigue famine failure of payments or announcements of treasure on the road and all day long the amir would read the dockets and pass such of these as were less private to the officials whom they directly concerned or call up a waiting chief for a word of explanation it is well to speak clearly to the ruler of afghanistan then the grim head under the black astrachan cap with the diamond star in front would nod gravely and that chief would return to his fellows once that afternoon a woman clamoured for divorce against her husband who was bald and the amir hearing both sides of the case bade her pour curds over the bare scalp and lick them off that the hair might grown again and she be contented here the court laughed and the woman withdrew cursing her king under her breath  but when twilight was falling and the order of the court was a little relaxed there came before the king in custody a trembling haggard wretch sore with much buffeting but of stout enough build who had stolen three rupeesof such small matters does his highness take cognisance  why did you steal said he and when the king asks questions they do themselves service who answer directly  i was poor and no one gave hungry and there was no food  why did you not work  i could find no work protector of the poor and i was starving  you lie you stole for drink for lust for idleness for anything but hunger since any man who will may find work and daily bread  the prisoner dropped his eyes he had attended the court before and he knew the ring of the deathtone  any man may get work who knows this so well as i do for i too have been hungerednot like you bastard scum but as any honest man may be by the turn of fate and the will of god  growing warm the amir turned to his nobles all arow and thrust the hilt of his sabre aside with his elbow  you have heard this son of lies hear me tell a true tale i also was once starved and tightened my belt on the sharp bellypinch nor was i alone for with me was another who did not fail me in my evil days when i was hunted before ever i came to this throne and wandering like a houseless dog by kandahar my money melted melted melted till he flung out a bare palm before the audience and day upon day faint and sick i went back to that one who waited and god knows how we lived till on a day i took our best lihafsilk it was fine work of iran such as no needle now works warm and a coverlet for two and all that we had i brought it to a moneylender in a bylane and i asked for three rupees upon it he said to me who am now the king you are a thief this is worth three hundred i am no thief i answered but a prince of good blood and i am hungryprince of wandering beggars said that moneylender i have no money with me but go to my house with my clerk and he will give you two rupees eight annas for that is all i will lend so i went with the clerk to the house and we talked on the way and he gave me the money we lived on it till it was spent and we fared hard and then that clerk said being a young man of a good heart surely the moneylender will lend yet more on that lihaf and he offered me two rupees these i refused saying nay but get me some work and he got me work and i even i abdur rahman amir of afghanistan wrought day by day as a coolie bearing burdens and labouring of my hands receiving four annas wage a day for my sweat and backache but he this bastard son of naught must steal for a year and four months i worked and none dare say that i lie for i have a witness even that clerk who is now my friend  then there rose in his place among the sirdars and the nobles one clad in silk who folded his hands and said this is the truth of god for i who by the favour of god and the amir am such as you know was once clerk to that moneylender  there was a pause and the amir cried hoarsely to the prisoner throwing scorn upon him till he ended with the dread dar arid which clinches justice  so they led the thief away and the whole of him was seen no more together and the court rustled out of its silence whispering before god and the prophet but this is a man     jews in shushan footnote copyright 1981 by macmillan  co   my newly purchased house furniture was at the least insecure the legs parted from the chairs and the tops from the tables on the slightest provocation but such as it was it was to be paid for and ephraim agent and collector for the local auctioneer waited in the verandah with the receipt he was announced by the mahomedan servant as ephraim yahudiephraim the jew he who believes in the brotherhood of man should hear my elahi bukhsh grinding the second word through his white teeth with all the scorn he dare show before his master ephraim was personally meek in mannerso meek indeed that one could not understand how he had fallen into the profession of billcollecting he resembled an overfed sheep and his voice suited his figure there was a fixed unvarying mask of childish wonder upon his face if you paid him he was as one marvelling at your wealth if you sent him away he seemed puzzled at your hardheartedness never was jew more unlike his dread breed ephraim wore list slippers and coats of dustercloth so preposterously patterned that the most brazen of british subalterns would have shied from them in fear very slow and deliberate was his speech and carefully guarded to give offence to no one after many weeks ephraim was induced to speak to me of his friends  there be eight of us in shushan and we are waiting till there are ten then we shall apply for a synagogue and get leave from calcutta today we have no synagogue and i only i am priest and butcher to our people i am of the tribe of judahi think but i am not sure my father was of the tribe of judah and we wish much to get our synagogue i shall be a priest of that synagogue  shushan is a big city in the north of india counting its dwellers by the ten thousand and these eight of the chosen people were shut up in its midst waiting till time or chance sent them their full congregation  miriam the wife of ephraim two little children an orphan boy of their people epraims uncle jackrael israel a whitehaired old man his wife hester a jew from cutch one hyem benjamin and ephraim priest and butcher made up the list of the jews in shushan they lived in one house on the outskirts of the great city amid heaps of saltpetre rotten bricks herds of kine and a fixed pillar of dust caused by the incessant passing of the beasts to the river to drink in the evening the children of the city came to the waste place to fly their kites and ephraims sons held aloof watching the sport from the roof but never descending to take part in them at the back of the house stood a small brick enclosure in which ephraim prepared the daily meat for his people after the custom of the jews once the rude door of the square was suddenly smashed open by a struggle from inside and showed the meek billcollector at his work nostrils dilated lips drawn back over his teeth and his hands upon a halfmaddened sheep he was attired in strange raiment having no relation whatever to duster coats or list slippers and a knife was in his mouth as he struggled with the animal between the walls the breath came from him in thick sobs and the nature of the man seemed changed when the ordained slaughter was ended he saw that the door was open and shut it hastily his hand leaving a red mark on the timber while his children from the neighbouring house top looked down awestricken and openeyed a glimpse of ephraim busied in one of his religious capacities was no thing to be desired twice  summer came upon shushan turning the trodden wasteground to iron and bringing sickness to the city  it will not touch us said ephraim confidently before the winter we shall have our synagogue my brother and his wife and children are coming up from calcutta and then i shall be the priest of the synagogue  jackrael israel the old man would crawl out in the stifling evenings to sit on the rubbishheap and watch the corpses being borne down to the river  it will not come near us said jackrael israel feebly for we are the people of god and my nephew will be priest of our synagogue let them die he crept back to his house again and barred the door to shut himself off from the world of the gentile  but miriam the wife of ephraim looked out of the window at the dead as the biers passed and said that she was afraid ephraim comforted her with hopes of the synagogue to be and collected bills as was his custom  in one night the two children died and were buried early in the morning by ephraim the deaths never appeared in the city returns the sorrow is my sorrow said ephraim and this to him seemed a sufficient reason for setting at naught the sanitary regulations of a large flourishing and remarkably wellgoverned empire  the orphan boy dependent on the charity of ephraim and his wife could have felt no gratitude and must have been a ruffian he begged for whatever money his protectors would give him and with that fled down country for his life a week after the death of her children miriam left her bed at night and wandered over the country to find them she heard them crying behind every bush or drowning in every pool of water in the fields and she begged the cartmen on the grand trunk road not to steal her little ones from her in the morning the sun rose and beat upon her bare head and she turned into the cool wet crops to lie down and never came back though hyem benjamin and ephraim sought her for two nights  the look of patient wonder on ephraims face deepened but he presently found an explanation there are so few of us here and these people are so many said he that it may be our god has forgotten us  in the house on the outskirts of the city old jackrael israel and hester grumbled that there was no one to wait on them and that miriam had been untrue to her race ephraim went out and collected bills and in the evenings smoked with hyem benjamin till one dawning hyem benjamin died having first paid all his debts to ephraim jackrael israel and hester sat alone in the empty house all day and when ephraim returned wept the easy tears of age till they cried themselves asleep  a week later ephraim staggering under a huge bundle of clothes and cookingpots led the old man and woman to the railway station where the bustle and confusion made them whimper  we are going back to calcutta said ephraim to whose sleeve hester was clinging there are more of us there and here my house is empty  he helped hester into the carriage and turning back said to me i should have been priest of the synagogue if there had been ten of us surely we must have been forgotten by our god  the remnant of the broken colony passed out of the station on their journey south while a subaltern turning over the books on the bookstall was whistling to himself the ten little nigger boys  but the tune sounded as solemn as the dead march  it was the dirge of the jews in shushan     the limitations of pambe serang footnote copyright 1891 by macmillan  co   if you consider the circumstances of the case it was the only thing that he could do but pambe serang has been hanged by the neck till he is dead and nurkeed is dead also  three years ago when the elsasslothringen steamer saarbruck was coaling at aden and the weather was very hot indeed nurkeed the big fat zanzibar stoker who fed the second right furnace thirty feet down in the hold got leave to go ashore he departed a seedee boy as they call the stokers he returned the fullblooded sultan of zanzibarhis highness sayyid burgash with a bottle in each hand then he sat on the forehatch grating eating salt fish and onions and singing the songs of a far country the food belonged to pambe the serang or head man of the lascar sailors he had just cooked it for himself turned to borrow some salt and when he came back nurkeeds dirty black fingers were spading into the rice  a serang is a person of importance far above a stoker though the stoker draws better pay he sets the chorus of hya hulla heeah heh when the captains gig is pulled up to the davits he heaves the lead too and sometimes when all the ship is lazy he puts on his whitest muslin and a big red sash and plays with the passengers children on the quarterdeck then the passengers give him money and he saves it all up for an orgie at bombay or calcutta or pulu penang ho you fat black barrel youre eating my food said pambe in the other lingua franca that begins where the levant tongue stops and runs from port said eastward till east is west and the sealingbrigs of the kurile islands gossip with the strayed hakodate junks  son of eblis monkeyface dried sharks liver pigman i am the sultan sayyid burgash and the commander of all this ship take away your garbage and nurkeed thrust the empty pewter riceplate into pambes hand  pambe beat it into a basin over nurkeeds woolly head nurkeed drew his sheathknife and stabbed pambe in the leg pambe drew his sheathknife but nurkeed dropped down into the darkness of the hold and spat through the grating at pambe who was staining the clean foredeck with his blood  only the white moon saw these things for the officers were looking after the coaling and the passengers were tossing in their close cabins all right said pambeand went forward to tie up his legwe will settle the account later on  he was a malay born in india married once in burma where his wife had a cigarshop on the shwe dagon road once in singapore to a chinese girl and once in madras to a mahomedan woman who sold fowls the english sailor cannot owing to postal and telegraph facilities marry as profusely as he used to do but native sailors can being uninfluenced by the barbarous inventions of the western savage pambe was a good husband when he happened to remember the existence of a wife but he was also a very good malay and it is not wise to offend a malay because he does not forget anything moreover in pambes case blood had been drawn and food spoiled  next morning nurkeed rose with a blank mind he was no longer sultan of zanzibar but a very hot stoker so he went on deck and opened his jacket to the morning breeze till a sheathknife came like a flying fish and stuck into the woodwork of the cooks galley half an inch from his right armpit he ran down below before his time trying to remember what he could have said to the owner of the weapon at noon when all the ships lascars were feeding nurkeed advanced into their midst and being a placid man with a large regard for his own skin he opened negotiations saying men of the ship last night i was drunk and this morning i know that i behaved unseemly to some one or another of you who was that man that i may meet him face to face and say that i was drunk  pambe measured the distance to nurkeeds naked breast if he sprang at him he might be tripped up and a blind blow at the chest sometimes only means a gash on the breastbone ribs are difficult to thrust between unless the subject be asleep so he said nothing nor did the other lascars their faces immediately dropped all expression as is the custom of the oriental when there is killing on the carpet or any chance of trouble nurkeed looked long at the white eyeballs he was only an african and could not read characters a big sighalmost a groan broke from him and he went back to the furnaces the lascars took up the conversation where he had interrupted it they talked of the best methods of cooking rice  nurkeed suffered considerably from lack of fresh air during the run to bombay he only came on deck to breathe when all the world was about and even then a heavy block once dropped from a derrick within a foot of his head and an apparently firmlashed grating on which he set his foot began to turn over with the intention of dropping him on the cased cargo fifteen feet below and one insupportable night the sheathknife dropped from the focsle and this time it drew blood so nurkeed made complaint and when the saarbruck reached bombay fled and buried himself among eight hundred thousand people and did not sign articles till the ship had been a month gone from the port pambe waited too but his bombay wife grew clamorous and he was forced to sign in the spicheren to hongkong because he realised that all play and no work gives jack a ragged shirt in the foggy china seas he thought a great deal of nurkeed and when elsasslothringen steamers lay in port with the spicheren inquired after him and found he had gone to england via the cape on the gravelotte pambe came to england on the worth the spicheren met her by the nore light nurkeed was going out with the spicheren to the calicut coast  want to find a friend my trapmouthed coalscuttle said a gentleman in the mercantile service nothing easier wait at the nyanza docks till he comes every one comes to the nyanza docks wait you poor heathen the gentleman spoke truth there are three great doors in the world where if you stand long enough you shall meet any one you wish the head of the suez canal is one but there death comes also charing cross station is the secondfor inland work and the nyanza docks is the third at each of these places are men and women looking eternally for those who will surely come so pambe waited at the docks time was no object to him and the wives could wait as he did from day to day week to week and month to month by the blue diamond funnels the red dot smokestacks the yellow streaks and the nameless dingy gypsies of the sea that loaded and unloaded jostled whistled and roared in the everlasting fog when money failed a kind gentleman told pambe to become a christian and pambe became one with great speed getting his religious teachings between ship and ships arrival and six or seven shillings a week for distributing tracts to mariners what the faith was pambe did not in the least care but he knew if he said native kilis tian sar to men with long black coats he might get a few coppers and the tracts were vendible at a little publichouse that sold shag by the dottel which is even smaller weight than the halfscrew which is less than the halfounce and a most profitable retail trade  but after eight months pambe fell sick with pneumonia contracted from long standing still in slush and much against his will he was forced to lie down in his twoandsixpenny room raging against fate  the kind gentleman sat by his bedside and grieved to find that pambe talked in strange tongues instead of listening to good books and almost seemed to become a benighted heathen againtill one day he was roused from semistupor by a voice in the street by the dockhead my friendhe whispered pambe call nowcall nurkeed quick god has sent him  he wanted one of his own race said the kind gentleman and going out he called nurkeed at the top of his voice an excessively coloured man in a rasping white shirt and brandnew slops a shining hat and a breastpin turned round many voyages had taught nurkeed how to spend his money and made him a citizen of the world  hi yes said he when the situation was explained command him black niggerwhen i was in the saarbruck ole pambe good ole pambe dam lascar show him up sar and he followed into the room one glance told the stoker what the kind gentleman had overlooked pambe was desperately poor nurkeed drove his hands deep into his pockets then advanced with clenched fists on the sick shouting hya pambe hya heeah hulla heh takilo takilo make fast aft pambe you know pambe you know me dekho jee look dam big fat lazy lascar  pambe beckoned with his left hand his right was under his pillow nurkeed removed his gorgeous hat and stooped over pambe till he could catch a faint whisper how beautiful said the kind gentleman how these orientals love like children  spit him out said nurkeed leaning over pambe yet more closely  touching the matter of that fish and onions said pambeand sent the knife home under the edge of the ribbone upwards and forwards  there was a thick sick cough and the body of the african slid slowly from the bed his clutching hands letting fall a shower of silver pieces that ran across the room  now i can die said pambe  but he did not die he was nursed back to life with all the skill that money could buy for the law wanted him and in the end he grew sufficiently healthy to be hanged in due and proper form  pambe did not care particularly but it was a sad blow to the kind gentleman     little tobrah footnote copyright 1891 by macmillan  co   prisoners head did not reach to the top of the dock as the english newspapers say this case however was not reported because nobody cared by so much as a hempen rope for the life or death of little tobrah the assessors in the red courthouse sat upon him all through the long hot afternoon and whenever they asked him a question he salaamed and whined their verdict was that the evidence was inconclusive and the judge concurred it was true that the dead body of little tobrahs sister had been found at the bottom of the well and little tobrah was the only human being within a half mile radius at the time but the child might have fallen in by accident therefore little tobrah was acquitted and told to go where he pleased this permission was not so generous as it sounds for he had nowhere to go to nothing in particular to eat and nothing whatever to wear  he trotted into the courtcompound and sat upon the wellkerb wondering whether an unsuccessful dive into the black water below would end in a forced voyage across the other black water a groom put down an emptied nosebag on the bricks and little tobrah being hungry set himself to scrape out what wet grain the horse had overlooked  o thiefand but newly set free from the terror of the law come along said the groom and little tobrah was led by the ear to a large and fat englishman who heard the tale of the theft  hah said the englishman three times only he said a stronger word put him into the net and take him home so little tobrah was thrown into the net of the cart and nothing doubting that he should be stuck like a pig was driven to the englishmans house hah said the englishman as before wet grain by jove feed the little beggar some of you and well make a ridingboy of him see wet grain good lord  give an account of yourself said the head of the grooms to little tobrah after the meal had been eaten and the servants lay at ease in their quarters behind the house you are not of the groom caste unless it be for the stomachs sake how came you into the court and why answer little devils spawn  there was not enough to eat said little tobrah calmly this is a good place  talk straight talk said the head groom or i will make you clean out the stable of that large red stallion who bites like a camel  we be telis oilpressers said little tobrah scratching his toes in the dust we were telismy father my mother my brother the elder by four years myself and the sister  she who was found dead in the well said one who had heard something of the trial  even so said little tobrah gravely she who was found dead in the well it befel upon a time which is not in my memory that the sickness came to the village where our oilpress stood and first my sister was smitten as to her eyes and went without sight for it was matathe smallpox thereafter my father and my mother died of that same sickness so we were alonemy brother who had twelve years i who had eight and the sister who could not see yet were there the bullock and the oilpress remaining and we made shift to press the oil as before but surjun dass the grainseller cheated us in his dealings and it was always a stubborn bullock to drive we put marigold flowers for the gods upon the neck of the bullock and upon the great grindingbeam that rose through the roof but we gained nothing thereby and surjun dass was a hard man  bapribap muttered the grooms wives to cheat a child so but we know what the bunniafolk are sisters  the press was an old press and we were not strong menmy brother and i nor could we fix the neck of the beam firmly in the shackle  nay indeed said the gorgeouslyclad wife of the head groom joining the circle that is a strong mans work when i was a maid in my fathers house  peace woman said the head groom go on boy  it is nothing said little tobrah the big beam tore down the roof upon a day which is not in my memory and with the roof fell much of the hinder wall and both together upon our bullock whose back was broken thus we had neither home nor press nor bullockmy brother myself and the sister who was blind we went crying away from that place hand inhand across the fields and our money was seven annas and six pie there was a famine in the land i do not know the name of the land so on a night when we were sleeping my brother took the five annas that remained to us and ran away i do not know whither he went the curse of my father be upon him but i and the sister begged food in the villages and there was none to give only all men saidgo to the englishmen and they will give i did not know what the englishmen were but they said that they were white living in tents i went forward but i cannot say whither i went and there was no more food for myself or the sister and upon a hot night she weeping and calling for food we came to a well and i bade her sit upon the kerb and thrust her in for in truth she could not see and it is better to die than to starve  ai ahi wailed the grooms wives in chorus he thrust her in for it is better to die than to starve  i would have thrown myself in also but that she was not dead and called to me from the bottom of the well and i was afraid and ran and one came out of the crops saying that i had killed her and defiled the well and they took me before an englishman white and terrible living in a tent and me he sent here but there were no witnesses and it is better to die than to starve she furthermore could not see with her eyes and was but a little child  was but a little child echoed the head grooms wife but who art thou weak as a fowl and small as a dayold colt what art thou  i who was empty am now full said little tobrah stretching himself upon the dust and i would sleep  the grooms wife spread a cloth over him while little tobrah slept the sleep of the just     bubbling well road footnote copyright 1891 by macmillan  co   look out on a large scale map the place where the chenab river falls into the indus fifteen miles or so above the hamlet of chachuran five miles west of chachuran lies bubbling well road and the house of the gosain or priest of artigoth it was the priest who showed me the road but it is no thanks to him that i am able to tell this story  five miles west of chachuran is a patch of the plumed junglegrass that turns over in silver when the wind blows from ten to twenty feet high and from three to four miles square in the heart of the patch hides the gosain of bubbling well road the villagers stone him when he peers into the daylight although he is a priest and he runs back again as a strayed wolf turns into tall crops he is a oneeyed man and carries burnt between his brows the impress of two copper coins some say that he was tortured by a native prince in the old days for he is so old that he must have been capable of mischief in the days of runjit singh his most pressing need at present is a halter and the care of the british government  these things happened when the junglegrass was tall and the villagers of chachuran told me that a sounder of pig had gone into the artigoth patch to enter junglegrass is always an unwise proceeding but i went partly because i knew nothing of pighunting and partly because the villagers said that the big boar of the sounder owned foot long tushes therefore i wished to shoot him in order to produce the tushes in after years and say that i had ridden him down in fair chase i took a gun and went into the hot close patch believing that it would be an easy thing to unearth one pig in ten square miles of jungle mr wardle the terrier went with me because he believed that i was incapable of existing for an hour without his advice and countenance he managed to slip in and out between the grass clumps but i had to force my way and in twenty minutes was as completely lost as though i had been in the heart of central africa i did not notice this at first till i had grown wearied of stumbling and pushing through the grass and mr wardle was beginning to sit down very often and hang out his tongue very far there was nothing but grass everywhere and it was impossible to see two yards in any direction the grassstems held the heat exactly as boilertubes do  in halfanhour when i was devoutly wishing that i had left the big boar alone i came to a narrow path which seemed to be a compromise between a native footpath and a pigrun it was barely six inches wide but i could sidle along it in comfort the grass was extremely thick here and where the path was ill defined it was necessary to crush into the tussocks either with both hands before the face or to back into it leaving both hands free to manage the rifle none the less it was a path and valuable because it might lead to a place  at the end of nearly fifty yards of fair way just when i was preparing to back into an unusually stiff tussock i missed mr wardle who for his girth is an unusually frivolous dog and never keeps to heel i called him three times and said aloud where has the little beast gone to then i stepped backwards several paces for almost under my feet a deep voice repeated where has the little beast gone to appreciate an unseen voice thoroughly you should hear it when you are lost in stifling junglegrass i called mr wardle again and the underground echo assisted me at that i ceased calling and listened very attentively because i thought i heard a man laughing in a peculiarly offensive manner the heat made me sweat but the laughter made me shake there is no earthly need for laughter in high grass it is indecent as well as impolite the chuckling stopped and i took courage and continued to call till i thought that i had located the echo somewhere behind and below the tussock into which i was preparing to back just before i lost mr wardle i drove my rifle up to the triggers between the grassstems in a downward and forward direction then i waggled it to and fro but it did not seem to touch ground on the far side of the tussock as it should have done every time that i grunted with the exertion of driving a heavy rifle through thick grass the grunt was faithfully repeated from below and when i stopped to wipe my face the sound of low laughter was distinct beyond doubting  i went into the tussock face first an inch at a time my mouth open and my eyes fine full and prominent when i had overcome the resistance of the grass i found that i was looking straight across a black gap in the groundthat i was actually lying on my chest leaning over the mouth of a well so deep i could scarcely see the water in it  there were things in the waterblack thingsand the water was as black as pitch with blue scum atop the laughing sound came from the noise of a little spring spouting halfway down one side of the well sometimes as the black things circled round the trickle from the spring fell upon their tightlystretched skins and then the laughter changed into a sputter of mirth one thing turned over on its back as i watched and drifted round and round the circle of the mossy brickwork with a hand and half an arm held clear of the water in a stiff and horrible flourish as though it were a very wearied guide paid to exhibit the beauties of the place  i did not spend more than halfanhour in creeping round that well and finding the path on the other side the remainder of the journey i accomplished by feeling every foot of ground in front of me and crawling like a snail through every tussock i carried mr wardle in my arms and he licked my nose he was not frightened in the least nor was i but we wished to reach open ground in order to enjoy the view my knees were loose and the apple in my throat refused to slide up and down the path on the far side of the well was a very good one though boxed in on all sides by grass and it led me in time to a priests hut in the centre of a little clearing when that priest saw my very white face coming through the grass he howled with terror and embraced my boots but when i reached the bedstead set outside his door i sat down quickly and mr wardle mounted guard over me i was not in a condition to take care of myself  when i awoke i told the priest to lead me into the open out of the artigoth patch and to walk slowly in front of me mr wardle hates natives and the priest was more afraid of mr wardle than of me though we were both angry he walked very slowly down a narrow little path from his hut that path crossed three paths such as the one i had come by in the first instance and every one of the three headed towards the bubbling well once when we stopped to draw breath i heard the well laughing to itself alone in the thick grass and only my need for his services prevented my firing both barrels into the priests back  when we came to the open the priest crashed back into cover and i went to the village of artigoth for a drink it was pleasant to be able to see the horizon all round as well as the ground underfoot  the villagers told me that the patch of grass was full of devils and ghosts all in the service of the priest and that men and women and children had entered it and had never returned they said the priest used their livers for purposes of witchcraft when i asked why they had not told me of this at the outset they said that they were afraid they would lose their reward for bringing news of the pig  before i left i did my best to set the patch alight but the grass was too green some fine summer day however if the wind is favourable a file of old newspapers and a box of matches will make clear the mystery of bubbling well road     the city of dreadful night footnote copyright 1891 by macmillan  co   the dense wet heat that hung over the face of land like a blanket prevented all hope of sleep in the first instance the cicalas helped the heat and the yelling jackals the cicalas it was impossible to sit still in the dark empty echoing house and watch the punkah beat the dead air so at ten oclock of the night i set my walkingstick on end in the middle of the garden and waited to see how it would fall it pointed directly down the moonlit road that leads to the city of dreadful night the sound of its fall disturbed a hare she limped from her form and ran across to a disused mahomedan burialground where the jawless skulls and roughbutted shankbones heartlessly exposed by the july rains glimmered like mother o pearl on the rainchannelled soil the heated air and the heavy earth had driven the very dead upward for coolness sake the hare limped on snuffed curiously at a fragment of a smokestained lampshard and died out in the shadow of a clump of tamarisk trees  the matweavers hut under the lee of the hindu temple was full of sleeping men who lay like sheeted corpses overhead blazed the unwinking eye of the moon darkness gives at least a false impression of coolness it was hard not to believe that the flood of light from above was warm not so hot as the sun but still sickly warm and heating the heavy air beyond what was our due straight as a bar of polished steel ran the road to the city of dreadful night and on either side of the road lay corpses disposed on beds in fantastic attitudesone hundred and seventy bodies of men some shrouded all in white with boundup mouths some naked and black as ebony in the strong light and onethat lay face upwards with dropped jaw far away from the otherssilvery white and ashen gray  a leper asleep and the remainder wearied coolies servants small shopkeepers and drivers from the hackstand hard by the scenea main approach to lahore city and the night a warm one in august this was all that there was to be seen but by no means all that one could see the witchery of the moonlight was everywhere and the world was horribly changed the long line of the naked dead flanked by the rigid silver statue was not pleasant to look upon it was made up of men alone were the womenkind then forced to sleep in the shelter of the stifling mud huts as best they might the fretful wail of a child from a low mudroof answered the question where the children are the mothers must be also to look after them they need care on these sweltering nights a black little bullethead peeped over the coping and a thina painfully thin brown leg was slid over on to the gutter pipe there was a sharp clink of glass bracelets a womans arm showed for an instant above the parapet twined itself round the lean little neck and the child was dragged back protesting to the shelter of the bedstead his thin highpitched shriek died out in the thick air almost as soon as it was raised for even the children of the soil found it too hot to weep  more corpses more stretches of moonlit white road a string of sleeping camels at rest by the wayside a vision of scudding jackals ekkaponies asleepthe harness still on their backs and the brass studded country carts winking in the moonlightand again more corpses wherever a grain cart atilt a tree trunk a sawn log a couple of bamboos and a few handfuls of thatch cast a shadow the ground is covered with them they liesome face downwards arms folded in the dust some with clasped hands flung up above their heads some curled up dogwise some thrown like limp gunnybags over the side of the grain carts and some bowed with their brows on their knees in the full glare of the moon it would be a comfort if they were only given to snoring but they are not and the likeness to corpses is unbroken in all respects save one the lean dogs snuff at them and turn away here and there a tiny child lies on his fathers bedstead and a protecting arm is thrown round it in every instance but for the most part the children sleep with their mothers on the housetops yellowskinned whitetoothed pariahs are not to be trusted within reach of brown bodies  a stifling hot blast from the mouth of the delhi gate nearly ends my resolution of entering the city of dreadful night at this hour it is a compound of all evil savours animal and vegetable that a walled city can brew in a day and a night the temperature within the motionless groves of plantain and orangetrees outside the city walls seems chilly by comparison heaven help all sick persons and young children within the city tonight the high housewalls are still radiating heat savagely and from obscure side gullies fetid breezes eddy that ought to poison a buffalo but the buffaloes do not heed a drove of them are parading the vacant main street stopping now and then to lay their ponderous muzzles against the closed shutters of a graindealers shops and to blow thereon like grampuses  then silence followsthe silence that is full of the night noises of a great city a stringed instrument of some kind is just and only just audible high overhead some one throws open a window and the rattle of the woodwork echoes down the empty street on one of the roofs a hookah is in full blast and the men are talking softly as the pipe gutters a little farther on the noise of conversation is more distinct a slit of light shows itself between the sliding shutters of a shop inside a stubblebearded wearyeyed trader is balancing his accountbooks among the bales of cotton prints that surround him three sheeted figures bear him company and throw in a remark from time to time first he makes an entry then a remark then passes the back of his hand across his streaming forehead the heat in the builtin street is fearful inside the shops it must be almost unendurable but the work goes on steadily entry guttural growl and uplifted handstroke succeeding each other with the precision of clockwork  a policemanturbanless and fast asleeplies across the road on the way to the mosque of wazir khan a bar of moonlight falls across the forehead and eyes of the sleeper but he never stirs it is close upon midnight and the heat seems to be increasing the open square in front of the mosque is crowded with corpses and a man must pick his way carefully for fear of treading on them the moonlight stripes the mosques high front of coloured enamel work in broad diagonal bands and each separate dreaming pigeon in the niches and corners of the masonry throws a squab little shadow sheeted ghosts rise up wearily from their pallets and flit into the dark depths of the building is it possible to climb to the top of the great minars and thence to look down on the city at all events the attempt is worth making and the chances are that the door of the staircase will be unlocked unlocked it is but a deeply sleeping janitor lies across the threshold face turned to the moon a rat dashes out of his turban at the sound of approaching footsteps the man grunts opens his eyes for a minute turns round and goes to sleep again all the heat of a decade of fierce indian summers is stored in the pitchblack polished walls of the corkscrew staircase halfway up there is something alive warm and feathery and it snores driven from step to step as it catches the sound of my advance it flutters to the top and reveals itself as a yelloweyed angry kite dozens of kites are asleep on this and the other minars and on the domes below there is the shadow of a cool or at least a less sultry breeze at this height and refreshed thereby turn to look on the city of dreadful night  dore might have drawn it zola could describe itthis spectacle of sleeping thousands in the moonlight and in the shadow of the moon the rooftops are crammed with men women and children and the air is full of undistinguishable noises they are restless in the city of dreadful night and small wonder the marvel is that they can even breathe if you gaze intently at the multitude you can see that they are almost as uneasy as a daylight crowd but the tumult is subdued everywhere in the strong light you can watch the sleepers turning to and fro shifting their beds and again resettling them in the pitlike court yards of the houses there is the same movement  the pitiless moon shows it all shows too the plains outside the city and here and there a handsbreadth of the ravee without the walls shows lastly a splash of glittering silver on a housetop almost directly below the mosque minar some poor soul has risen to throw a jar of water over his fevered body the tinkle of the falling water strikes faintly on the ear two or three other men in faroff corners of the city of dreadful night follow his example and the water flashes like heliographic signals a small cloud passes over the face of the moon and the city and its inhabitantsclear drawn in black and white before fade into masses of black and deeper black still the unrestful noise continues the sigh of a great city overwhelmed with the heat and of a people seeking in vain for rest it is only the lowerclass women who sleep on the housetops what must the torment be in the latticed zenanas where a few lamps are still twinkling there are footfalls in the court below it is the muezzinfaithful minister but he ought to have been here an hour ago to tell the faithful that prayer is better than sleepthe sleep that will not come to the city  the muezzin fumbles for a moment with the door of one of the minars disappears awhile and a bulllike roara magnificent bass thunder tells that he has reached the top of the minar they must hear the cry to the banks of the shrunken ravee itself even across the courtyard it is almost overpowering the cloud drifts by and shows him outlined in black against the sky hands laid upon his ears and broad chest heaving with the play of his lungsallah ho akbar then a pause while another muezzin somewhere in the direction of the golden temple takes up the callallah ho akbar again and again four times in all and from the bedsteads a dozen men have risen up alreadyi bear witness that there is no god but god what a splendid cry it is the proclamation of the creed that brings men out of their beds by scores at midnight once again he thunders through the same phrase shaking with the vehemence of his own voice and then far and near the night air rings with mahomed is the prophet of god it is as though he were flinging his defiance to the faroff horizon where the summer lightning plays and leaps like a bared sword every muezzin in the city is in full cry and some men on the rooftops are beginning to kneel a long pause precedes the last cry la ilaha illallah and the silence closes up on it as the ram on the head of a cottonbale  the muezzin stumbles down the dark stairway grumbling in his beard he passes the arch of the entrance and disappears then the stifling silence settles down over the city of dreadful night the kites on the minar sleep again snoring more loudly the hot breeze comes up in puffs and lazy eddies and the moon slides down towards the horizon seated with both elbows on the parapet of the tower one can watch and wonder over that heattortured hive till the dawn how do they live down there what do they think of when will they awake more tinkling of sluiced waterpots faint jarring of wooden bedsteads moved into or out of the shadows uncouth music of stringed instruments softened by distance into a plaintive wail and one low grumble of faroff thunder in the courtyard of the mosque the janitor who lay across the threshold of the minar when i came up starts wildly in his sleep throws his hands above his head mutters something and falls back again lulled by the snoring of the kitesthey snore like overgorged humansi drop off into an uneasy doze conscious that three oclock has struck and that there is a slighta very slightcoolness in the atmosphere the city is absolutely quiet now but for some vagrant dogs lovesong nothing save dead heavy sleep  several weeks of darkness pass after this for the moon has gone out the very dogs are still and i watch for the first light of the dawn before making my way homeward again the noise of shuffling feet the morning call is about to begin and my night watch is over allah ho akbar allah ho akbar the east grows gray and presently saffron the dawn wind comes up as though the muezzin had summoned it and as one man the city of dreadful night rises from its bed and turns its face towards the dawning day with return of life comes return of sound first a low whisper then a deep bass hum for it must be remembered that the entire city is on the housetops my eyelids weighed down with the arrears of long deferred sleep i escape from the minar through the courtyard and out into the square beyond where the sleepers have risen stowed away the bedsteads and are discussing the morning hookah the minutes freshness of the air has gone and it is as hot as at first  will the sahib out of his kindness make room what is it something borne on mens shoulders comes by in the halflight and i stand back a womans corpse going down to the burningghat and a bystander says she died at midnight from the heat so the city was of death as well as night after all     georgie porgie footnote copyright 1891 by macmillan  co        georgie porgie pudding and pie      kissed the girls and made them cry      when the girls came out to play      georgie porgie ran away  if you will admit that a man has no right to enter his drawingroom early in the morning when the housemaid is setting things right and clearing away the dust you will concede that civilised people who eat out of china and own cardcases have no right to apply their standard of right and wrong to an unsettled land when the place is made fit for their reception by those men who are told off to the work they can come up bringing in their trunks their own society and the decalogue and all the other apparatus where the queens law does not carry it is irrational to expect an observance of other and weaker rules the men who run ahead of the cars of decency and propriety and make the jungle ways straight cannot be judged in the same manner as the stayathome folk of the ranks of the regular tchin  not many months ago the queens law stopped a few miles north of thayetmyo on the irrawaddy there was no very strong public opinion up to that limit but it existed to keep men in order when the government said that the queens law must carry up to bhamo and the chinese border the order was given and some men whose desire was to be ever a little in advance of the rush of respectability flocked forward with the troops these were the men who could never pass examinations and would have been too pronounced in their ideas for the administration of bureauworked provinces the supreme government stepped in as soon as might be with codes and regulations and all but reduced new burma to the dead indian level but there was a short time during which strong men were necessary and ploughed a field for themselves  among the forerunners of civilisation was georgie porgie reckoned by all who knew him a strong man he held an appointment in lower burma when the order came to break the frontier and his friends called him georgie porgie because of the singularly burmeselike manner in which he sang a song whose first line is something like the words georgie porgie most men who have been in burma will know the song it means puff puff puff puff great steamboat georgie sang it to his banjo and his friends shouted with delight so that you could hear them far away in the teakforest  when he went to upper burma he had no special regard for god or man but he knew how to make himself respected and to carry out the mixed militarycivil duties that fell to most mens share in those months he did his office work and entertained now and again the detachments of fevershaken soldiers who blundered through his part of the world in search of a flying party of dacoits sometimes he turned out and dressed down dacoits on his own account for the country was still smouldering and would blaze when least expected he enjoyed these charivaris but the dacoits were not so amused all the officials who came in contact with him departed with the idea that georgie porgie was a valuable person well able to take care of himself and on that belief he was left to his own devices  at the end of a few months he wearied of his solitude and cast about for company and refinement the queens law had hardly begun to be felt in the country and public opinion which is more powerful than the queens law had yet to come also there was a custom in the country which allowed a white man to take to himself a wife of the daughters of heth upon due payment the marriage was not quite so binding as is the nikkah ceremony among mahomedans but the wife was very pleasant  when all our troops are back from burma there will be a proverb in their mouths as thrifty as a burmese wife and pretty english ladies will wonder what in the world it means  the headman of the village next to georgie porgies post had a fair daughter who had seen georgie porgie and loved him from afar when news went abroad that the englishman with the heavy hand who lived in the stockade was looking for a housekeeper the headman came in and explained that for five hundred rupees down he would entrust his daughter to georgie porgies keeping to be maintained in all honour respect and comfort with pretty dresses according to the custom of the country this thing was done and georgie porgie never repented it  he found his roughandtumble house put straight and made comfortable his hitherto unchecked expenses cut down by one half and himself petted and made much of by his new acquisition who sat at the head of his table and sang songs to him and ordered his madrassee servants about and was in every way as sweet and merry and honest and winning a little woman as the most exacting of bachelors could have desired no race men say who know produces such good wives and heads of households as the burmese when the next detachment tramped by on the warpath the subaltern in command found at georgie porgies table a hostess to be deferential to a woman to be treated in every way as one occupying an assured position when he gathered his men together next dawn and replunged into the jungle he thought regretfully of the nice little dinner and the pretty face and envied georgie porgie from the bottom of his heart yet he was engaged to a girl at home and that is how some men are constructed  the burmese girls name was not a pretty one but as she was promptly christened georgina by georgie porgie the blemish did not matter georgie porgie thought well of the petting and the general comfort and vowed that he had never spent five hundred rupees to a better end  after three months of domestic life a great idea struck him matrimony english matrimonycould not be such a bad thing after all if he were so thoroughly comfortable at the back of beyond with this burmese girl who smoked cheroots how much more comfortable would he be with a sweet english maiden who would not smoke cheroots and would play upon a piano instead of a banjo also he had a desire to return to his kind to hear a band once more and to feel how it felt to wear a dresssuit again decidedly matrimony would be a very good thing he thought the matter out at length of evenings while georgina sang to him or asked him why he was so silent and whether she had done anything to offend him as he thought he smoked and as he smoked he looked at georgina and in his fancy turned her into a fair thrifty amusing merry little english girl with hair coming low down on her forehead and perhaps a cigarette between her lips certainly not a big thick burma cheroot of the brand that georgina smoked he would wed a girl with georginas eyes and most of her ways but not all she could be improved upon then he blew thick smokewreaths through his nostrils and stretched himself he would taste marriage georgina had helped him to save money and there were six months leave due to him  see here little woman he said we must put by more money for these next three months i want it that was a direct slur on georginas housekeeping for she prided herself on her thrift but since her god wanted money she would do her best  you want money she said with a little laugh i have money look she ran to her own room and fetched out a small bag of rupees of all that you give me i keep back some see one hundred and seven rupees can you want more money than that take it it is my pleasure if you use it she spread out the money on the table and pushed it towards him with her quick little pale yellow fingers  georgie porgie never referred to economy in the household again  three months later after the dispatch and receipt of several mysterious letters which georgina could not understand and hated for that reason georgie porgie said that he was going away and she must return to her fathers house and stay there  georgina wept she would go with her god from the worlds end to the worlds end why should she leave him she loved him  i am only going to rangoon said georgie porgie i shall be back in a month but it is safer to stay with your father i will leave you two hundred rupees  if you go for a month what need of two hundred fifty are more than enough there is some evil here do not go or at least let me go with you  georgie porgie does not like to remember that scene even at this date in the end he got rid of georgina by a compromise of seventyfive rupees she would not take more then he went by steamer and rail to rangoon  the mysterious letters had granted him six months leave the actual flight and an idea that he might have been treacherous hurt severely at the time but as soon as the big steamer was well out into the blue things were easier and georginas face and the queer little stockaded house and the memory of the rushes of shouting dacoits by night the cry and struggle of the first man that he had ever killed with his own hand and a hundred other more intimate things faded and faded out of georgie porgies heart and the vision of approaching england took its place the steamer was full of men on leave all rampantly jovial souls who had shaken off the dust and sweat of upper burma and were as merry as schoolboys they helped georgie porgie to forget  then came england with its luxuries and decencies and comforts and georgie porgie walked in a pleasant dream upon pavements of which he had nearly forgotten the ring wondering why men in their senses ever left town he accepted his keen delight in his furlough as the reward of his services providence further arranged for him another and greater delightall the pleasures of a quiet english wooing quite different from the brazen businesses of the east when half the community stand back and bet on the result and the other half wonder what mrs soand so will say to it  it was a pleasant girl and a perfect summer and a big countryhouse near petworth where there are acres and acres of purple heather and highgrassed watermeadows to wander through georgie porgie felt that he had at last found something worth the living for and naturally assumed that the next thing to do was to ask the girl to share his life in india she in her ignorance was willing to go on this occasion there was no bartering with a village headman there was a fine middle class wedding in the country with a stout papa and a weeping mamma and a bestman in purple and fine linen and six snubnosed girls from the sunday school to throw roses on the path between the tombstones up to the church door the local paper described the affair at great length even down to giving the hymns in full but that was because the direction were starving for want of material  then came a honeymoon at arundel and the mamma wept copiously before she allowed her one daughter to sail away to india under the care of georgie porgie the bridegroom beyond any question georgie porgie was immensely fond of his wife and she was devoted to him as the best and greatest man in the world when he reported himself at bombay he felt justified in demanding a good station for his wifes sake and because he had made a little mark in burma and was beginning to be appreciated they allowed him nearly all that he asked for and posted him to a station which we will call sutrain it stood upon several hills and was styled officially a sanitarium for the good reason that the drainage was utterly neglected here georgie porgie settled down and found married life come very naturally to him he did not rave as do many bridegrooms over the strangeness and delight of seeing his own true love sitting down to breakfast with him every morning as though it were the most natural thing in the world  he had been there before as the americans say and checking the merits of his own present grace by those of georgina he was more and more inclined to think that he had done well  but there was no peace or comfort across the bay of bengal under the teaktrees where georgina lived with her father waiting for georgie porgie to return the headman was old and remembered the war of 51 he had been to rangoon and knew something of the ways of the kullahs sitting in front of his door in the evenings he taught georgina a dry philosophy which did not console her in the least  the trouble was that she loved georgie porgie just as much as the french girl in the english history books loved the priest whose head was broken by the kings bullies one day she disappeared from the village with all the rupees that georgie porgie had given her and a very small smattering of englishalso gained from georgie porgie  the headman was angry at first but lit a fresh cheroot and said something uncomplimentary about the sex in general georgina had started on a search for georgie porgie who might be in rangoon or across the black water or dead for aught that she knew chance favoured her an old sikh policeman told her that georgie porgie had crossed the black water she took a steeragepassage from rangoon and went to calcutta keeping the secret of her search to herself  in india every trace of her was lost for six weeks and no one knows what trouble of heart she must have undergone  she reappeared four hundred miles north of calcutta steadily heading northwards very worn and haggard but very fixed in her determination to find georgie porgie she could not understand the language of the people but india is infinitely charitable and the womenfolk along the grand trunk gave her food something made her believe that georgie porgie was to be found at the end of that pitiless road she may have seen a sepoy who knew him in burma but of this no one can be certain at last she found a regiment on the line of march and met there one of the many subalterns whom georgie porgie had invited to dinner in the faroff old days of the dacoithunting there was a certain amount of amusement among the tents when georgina threw herself at the mans feet and began to cry there was no amusement when her story was told but a collection was made and that was more to the point one of the subalterns knew of georgie porgies whereabouts but not of his marriage so he told georgina and she went her way joyfully to the north in a railway carriage where there was rest for tired feet and shade for a dusty little head the marches from the train through the hills into sutrain were trying but georgina had money and families journeying in bullockcarts gave her help it was an almost miraculous journey and georgina felt sure that the good spirits of burma were looking after her the hillroad to sutrain is a chilly stretch and georgina caught a bad cold still there was georgie porgie at the end of all the trouble to take her up in his arms and pet her as he used to do in the old days when the stockade was shut for the night and he had approved of the evening meal georgina went forward as fast as she could and her good spirits did her one last favour  an englishman stopped her in the twilight just at the turn of the road into sutrain saying good heavens what are you doing here  he was gillis the man who had been georgie porgies assistant in upper burma and who occupied the next post to georgie porgies in the jungle georgie porgie had applied to have him to work with at sutrain because he liked him  i have come said georgina simply it was such a long way and i have been months in coming where is his house  gillis gasped he had seen enough of georgina in the old times to know that explanations would be useless you cannot explain things to the oriental you must show  ill take you there said gillis and he led georgina off the road up the cliff by a little pathway to the back of a house set on a platform cut into the hillside  the lamps were just lit but the curtains were not drawn now look said gillis stopping in front of the drawingroom window georgina looked and saw georgie porgie and the bride  she put her hand up to her hair which had come out of its topknot and was straggling about her face she tried to set her ragged dress in order but the dress was past pulling straight and she coughed a queer little cough for she really had taken a very bad cold gillis looked too but while georgina only looked at the bride once turning her eyes always on georgie porgie gillis looked at the bride all the time  what are you going to do said gillis who held georgina by the wrist in case of any unexpected rush into the lamplight will you go in and tell that english woman that you lived with her husband  no said georgina faintly let me go i am going away i swear that i am going away she twisted herself free and ran off into the dark  poor little beast said gillis dropping on to the main road id ha given her something to get back to burma with what a narrow shave though and that angel would never have forgiven it  this seems to prove that the devotion of gillis was not entirely due to his affection for georgie porgie  the bride and the bridegroom came out into the verandah after dinner in order that the smoke of georgie porgies cheroots might not hang in the new drawingroom curtains  what is that noise down there said the bride both listened  oh said georgie porgie i suppose some brute of a hillman has been beating his wife  beatinghiswife how ghastly said the bride fancy your beating me she slipped an arm round her husbands waist and leaning her head against his shoulder looked out across the cloudfilled valley in deep content and security  but it was georgina crying all by herself down the hillside among the stones of the watercourse where the washermen wash the clothes     naboth footnote copyright 1891 by macmillan  co   this was how it happened and the truth is also an allegory of empire  i met him at the corner of my garden an empty basket on his head and an unclean cloth round his loins that was all the property to which naboth had the shadow of a claim when i first saw him he opened our acquaintance by begging he was very thin and showed nearly as many ribs as his basket and he told me a long story about fever and a lawsuit and an iron cauldron that had been seized by the court in execution of a decree i put my hand into my pocket to help naboth as kings of the east have helped alien adventurers to the loss of their kingdoms a rupee had hidden in my waistcoat lining i never knew it was there and gave the trove to naboth as a direct gift from heaven he replied that i was the only legitimate protector of the poor he had ever known  next morning he reappeared a little fatter in the round and curled himself into knots in the front verandah he said i was his father and his mother and the direct descendant of all the gods in his pantheon besides controlling the destinies of the universe he himself was but a sweetmeatseller and much less important than the dirt under my feet i had heard this sort of thing before so i asked him what he wanted my rupee quoth naboth had raised him to the everlasting heavens and he wished to prefer a request he wished to establish a sweetmeatpitch near the house of his benefactor to gaze on my revered countenance as i went to and fro illumining the world i was graciously pleased to give permission and he went away with his head between his knees  now at the far end of my garden the ground slopes toward the public road and the slope is crowned with a thick shrubbery there is a short carriageroad from the house to the mall which passes close to the shrubbery next afternoon i saw that naboth had seated himself at the bottom of the slope down in the dust of the public road and in the full glare of the sun with a starved basket of greasy sweets in front of him he had gone into trade once more on the strength of my munificent donation and the ground was as paradise by my honoured favour remember there was only naboth his basket the sunshine and the gray dust when the sap of my empire first began  next day he had moved himself up the slope nearer to my shrubbery and waved a palmleaf fan to keep the flies off the sweets so i judged that he must have done a fair trade  four days later i noticed that he had backed himself and his basket under the shadow of the shrubbery and had tied an isabellacoloured rag between two branches in order to make more shade there were plenty of sweets in his basket i thought that trade must certainly be looking up  seven weeks later the government took up a plot of ground for a chief court close to the end of my compound and employed nearly four hundred coolies on the foundations naboth bought a blue and white striped blanket a brass lampstand and a small boy to cope with the rush of trade which was tremendous  five days later he bought a huge fat redbacked accountbook and a glass inkstand thus i saw that the coolies had been getting into his debt and that commerce was increasing on legitimate lines of credit also i saw that the one basket had grown into three and that naboth had backed and hacked into the shrubbery and made himself a nice little clearing for the proper display of the basket the blanket the books and the boy  one week and five days later he had built a mud fireplace in the clearing and the fat accountbook was overflowing he said that god created few englishmen of my kind and that i was the incarnation of all human virtues he offered me some of his sweets as tribute and by accepting these i acknowledged him as my feudatory under the skirt of my protection  three weeks later i noticed that the boy was in the habit of cooking naboths midday meal for him and naboth was beginning to grow a stomach he had hacked away more of my shrubbery and owned another and a fatter accountbook  eleven weeks later naboth had eaten his way nearly through that shrubbery and there was a reed hut with a bedstead outside it standing in the little glade that he had eroded two dogs and a baby slept on the bedstead so i fancied naboth had taken a wife he said that he had by my favour done this thing and that i was several times finer than krishna six weeks and two days later a mud wall had grown up at the back of the hut there were fowls in front and it smelt a little the municipal secretary said that a cesspool was forming in the public road from the drainage of my compound and that i must take steps to clear it away i spoke to naboth he said i was lord paramount of his earthly concerns and the garden was all my own property and sent me some more sweets in a secondhand duster  two months later a coolie bricklayer was killed in a scuffle that took place opposite naboths vineyard the inspector of police said it was a serious case went into my servants quarters insulted my butlers wife and wanted to arrest my butler the curious thing about the murder was that most of the coolies were drunk at the time naboth pointed out that my name was a strong shield between him and his enemies and he expected that another baby would be born to him shortly  four months later the hut was all mud walls very solidly built and naboth had used most of my shrubbery for his five goats a silver watch and an aluminium chain shone upon his very round stomach my servants were alarmingly drunk several times and used to waste the day with naboth when they got the chance i spoke to naboth he said by my favour and the glory of my countenance he would make all his womenfolk ladies and that if any one hinted that he was running an illicit still under the shadow of the tamarisks why i his suzerain was to prosecute  a week later he hired a man to make several dozen square yards of trelliswork to put around the back of his hut that his womenfolk might be screened from the public gaze the man went away in the evening and left his days work to pave the short cut from the public road to my house i was driving home in the dusk and turned the corner by naboths vineyard quickly the next thing i knew was that the horses of the phaeton were stamping and plunging in the strongest sort of bamboo network both beasts came down one rose with nothing more than chipped knees the other was so badly kicked that i was forced to shoot him  naboth is gone now and his hut is ploughed into its native mud with sweetmeats instead of salt for a sign that the place is accursed i have built a summerhouse to overlook the end of the garden and it is as a fort on my frontier whence i guard my empire  i know exactly how ahab felt he has been shamefully misrepresented in the scriptures     the dream of duncan parrenness footnote copyright 1891 by macmillan  co   like mr bunyan of old i duncan parrenness writer to the most honourable the east india company in this godforgotten city of calcutta have dreamed a dream and never since that kitty my mare fell lame have i been so troubled therefore lest i should forget my dream i have made shift to set it down here though heaven knows how unhandy the pen is to me who was always readier with sword than inkhorn when i left london two long years since  when the governorgenerals great dance that he gives yearly at the latter end of november was finisht i had gone to mine own room which looks over that sullen unenglish stream the hoogly scarce so sober as i might have been now roaring drunk in the west is but fuddled in the east and i was drunk nornor easterly as mr shakespeare might have said yet in spite of my liquor the cool night winds though i have heard that they breed chills and fluxes innumerable sobered me somewhat and i remembered that i had been but a little wrung and wasted by all the sicknesses of the past four months whereas those young bloods that came eastward with me in the same ship had been all a month back planted to eternity in the foul soil north of writers buildings so then i thanked god mistily though to my shame i never kneeled down to do so for license to live at least till march should be upon us again  indeed we that were alive and our number was less by far than those who had gone to their last account in the hot weather late past had made very merry that evening by the ramparts of the fort over this kindness of providence though our jests were neither witty nor such as i should have liked my mother to hear  when i had lain down or rather thrown me on my bed and the fumes of my drink had a little cleared away i found that i could get no sleep for thinking of a thousand things that were better left alone first and it was a long time since i had thought of her the sweet face of kitty somerset drifted as it might have been drawn in a picture across the foot of my bed so plainly that i almost thought she had been present in the body then i remembered how she drove me to this accursed country to get rich that i might the more quickly marry her our parents on both sides giving their consent and then how she thought better or worse may be of her troth and wed tom sanderson but a short three months after i had sailed from kitty i fell amusing on mrs vansuythen a tall pale woman with violet eyes that had come to calcutta from the dutch factory at chinsura and had set all our young men and not a few of the factors by the ears some of our ladies it is true said that she had never a husband or marriagelines at all but women and specially those who have led only indifferent good lives themselves are cruel hard one on another besides mrs vansuythen was far prettier than them all she had been most gracious to me at the governor generals rout and indeed i was looked upon by all as her preux chevalierwhich is french for a much worse word now whether i cared so much as the scratch of a pin for this same mrs vansuythen albeit i had vowed eternal love three days after we met i knew not then nor did till later on but mine own pride and a skill in the small sword that no man in calcutta could equal kept me in her affections so that i believed i worshipt her  when i had dismist her violet eyes from my thoughts my reason reproacht me for ever having followed her at all and i saw how the one year that i had lived in this land had so burnt and seared my mind with the flames of a thousand bad passions and desires that i had aged ten months for each one in the devils school whereat i thought of my mother for a while and was very penitent making in my sinful tipsy mood a thousand vows of reformationall since broken i fear me again and again to morrow says i to myself i will live cleanly for ever and i smiled dizzily the liquor being still strong in me to think of the dangers i had escaped and built all manner of fine castles in spain whereof a shadowy kitty somerset that had the violet eyes and the sweet slow speech of mrs vansuythen was always queen  lastly a very fine and magnificent courage that doubtless had its birth in mr hastings madeira grew upon me till it seemed that i could become governorgeneral nawab prince ay even the great mogul himself by the mere wishing of it wherefore taking my first steps random and unstable enough towards my new kingdom i kickt my servants sleeping without till they howled and ran from me and called heaven and earth to witness that i duncan parrenness was a writer in the service of the company and afraid of no man then seeing that neither the moon nor the great bear were minded to accept my challenge i lay down again and must have fallen asleep  i was waked presently by my last words repeated two or three times and i saw that there had come into the room a drunken man as i thought from mr hastings rout he sate down at the foot of my bed in all the world as it belonged to him and i took note as well as i could that his face was somewhat like mine own grown older save when it changed to the face of the governorgeneral or my father dead these six months but this seemed to me only natural and the due result of too much wine and i was so angered at his entry all unannounced that i told him not over civilly to go to all my words he made no answer whatever only saying slowly as though it were some sweet morsel writer in the companys service and afraid of no man then he stops short and turning round sharp upon me says that one of my kidney need fear neither man nor devil that i was a brave young man and like enough should i live so long to be governorgeneral but for all these things and i suppose that he meant thereby the changes and chances of our shifty life in these parts i must pay my price by this time i had sobered somewhat and being well waked out of my first sleep was disposed to look upon the matter as a tipsy mans jest so says i merrily and what price shall i pay for this palace of mine which is but twelve feet square and my five poor pagodas a month the devil take you and your jesting i have paid my price twice over in sickness at that moment my man turns full towards me so that by the moonlight i could see every line and wrinkle of his face then my drunken mirth died out of me as i have seen the waters of our great rivers die away in one night and i duncan parrenness who was afraid of no man was taken with a more deadly terror than i hold it has ever been the lot of mortal man to know for i saw that his face was my very own but marked and lined and scarred with the furrows of disease and much evil livingas i once when i was lord help me very drunk indeed have seen mine own face all white and drawn and grown old in a mirror i take it that any man would have been even more greatly feared than i for i am in no way wanting in courage  after i had lain still for a little sweating in my agony and waiting until i should awake from this terrible dream for dream i knew it to be he says again that i must pay my price and a little after as though it were to be given in pagodas and sicca rupees what price will you pay says i very softly for gods sake let me be whoever you are and i will mend my ways from tonight says he laughing a little at my words but otherwise making no motion of having heard them nay i would only rid so brave a young ruffler as yourself of much that will be a great hindrance to you on your way through life in the indies for believe me and here he looks full on me once more there is no return at all this rigmarole which i could not then understand i was a good deal put aback and waited for what should come next says he very calmly give me your trust in man at that i saw how heavy would be my price for i never doubted but that he could take from me all that he asked and my head was through terror and wakefulness altogether cleared of the wine i had drunk so i takes him up very short crying that i was not so wholly bad as he would make believe and that i trusted my fellows to the full as much as they were worthy of it it was none of my fault says i if one half of them were liars and the other half deserved to be burnt in the hand and i would once more ask him to have done with his questions then i stopped a little afraid it is true to have let my tongue so run away with me but he took no notice of this and only laid his hand lightly on my left breast and i felt very cold there for a while then he says laughing more give me your faith in women at that i started in my bed as though i had been stung for i thought of my sweet mother in england and for a while fancied that my faith in gods best creatures could neither be shaken nor stolen from me but later myselfs hard eyes being upon me i fell to thinking for the second time that night of kitty she that jilted me and married tom sanderson and of mistress vansuythen whom only my devilish pride made me follow and how she was even worse than kitty and i worst of them allseeing that with my lifes work to be done i must needs go dancing down the devils swept and garnished causeway because forsooth there was a light womans smile at the end of it and i thought that all women in the world were either like kitty or mistress vansuythen as indeed they have ever since been to me and this put me to such an extremity of rage and sorrow that i was beyond word glad when myselfs hand fell again on my left breast and i was no more troubled by these follies  after this he was silent for a little and i made sure that he must go or i awake ere long but presently he speaks again and very softly that i was a fool to care for such follies as those he had taken from me and that ere he went he would only ask me for a few other trifles such as no man or for matter of that boy either would keep about him in this country and so it happened that he took from out of my very heart as it were looking all the time into my face with my own eyes as much as remained to me of my boys soul and conscience this was to me a far more terrible loss than the two that i had suffered before for though lord help me i had travelled far enough from all paths of decent or godly living yet there was in me though i myself write it a certain goodness of heart which when i was sober or sick made me very sorry of all that i had done before the fit came on me and this i lost wholly having in place thereof another deadly coldness at the heart i am not as i have before said ready with my pen so i fear that what i have just written may not be readily understood yet there be certain times in a young mans life when through great sorrow or sin all the boy in him is burnt and seared away so that he passes at one step to the more sorrowful state of manhood as our staring indian day changes into night with never so much as the gray of twilight to temper the two extremes this shall perhaps make my state more clear if it be remembered that my torment was ten times as great as comes in the natural course of nature to any man at that time i dared not think of the change that had come over me and all in one night though i have often thought of it since i have paid the price says i my teeth chattering for i was deadly cold and what is my return at this time it was nearly dawn and myself had begun to grow pale and thin against the white light in the east as my mother used to tell me is the custom of ghosts and devils and the like he made as if he would go but my words stopt him and he laughedas i remember that i laughed when i ran angus macalister through the swordarm last august because he said that mrs vansuythen was no better than she should be what returnsays he catching up my last wordswhy strength to live as long as god or the devil pleases and so long as you live my young master my gift with that he puts something into my hand though it was still too dark to see what it was and when next i lookt up he was gone  when the light came i made shift to behold his gift and saw that it was a little piece of dry bread     the incarnation of krishna mulvaney    wohl auf my bully cavaliers    we ride to church today  the man that hasnt got a horse    must steal one straight away   be reverent men remember    this is a gottes haus  du conrad cut along der aisle    and schenck der whiskey aus                   hans breitmanns ride to church  once upon a time very far from england there lived three men who loved each other so greatly that neither man nor woman could come between them they were in no sense refined nor to be admitted to the outer door mats of decent folk because they happened to be private soldiers in her majestys army and private soldiers of our service have small time for selfculture their duty is to keep themselves and their accoutrements specklessly clean to refrain from getting drunk more often than is necessary to obey their superiors and to pray for a war all these things my friends accomplished and of their own motion threw in some fightingwork for which the army regulations did not call their fate sent them to serve in india which is not a golden country though poets have sung otherwise there men die with great swiftness and those who live suffer many and curious things i do not think that my friends concerned themselves much with the social or political aspects of the east they attended a not unimportant war on the northern frontier another one on our western boundary and a third in upper burma then their regiment sat still to recruit and the boundless monotony of cantonment life was their portion they were drilled morning and evening on the same dusty paradeground they wandered up and down the same stretch of dusty white road attended the same church and the same grog shop and slept in the same limewashed barn of a barrack for two long years there was mulvaney the father in the craft who had served with various regiments from bermuda to halifax old in war scarred reckless resourceful and in his pious hours an unequalled soldier to him turned for help and comfort six and a half feet of slowmoving heavyfooted yorkshireman born on the wolds bred in the dales and educated chiefly among the carriers carts at the back of york railway station his name was learoyd and his chief virtue an unmitigated patience which helped him to win fights how ortheris a foxterrier of a cockney ever came to be one of the trio is a mystery which even to day i cannot explain there was always three av us mulvaney used to say an by the grace av god so long as our service lasts three av us theyll always be tis betther so  they desired no companionship beyond their own and it was evil for any man of the regiment who attempted dispute with them physical argument was out of the question as regarded mulvaney and the yorkshireman and assault on ortheris meant a combined attack from these twaina business which no five men were anxious to have on their hands therefore they flourished sharing their drinks their tobacco and their money good luck and evil battle and the chances of death life and the chances of happiness from calicut in southern to peshawur in northern india  through no merit of my own it was my good fortune to be in a measure admitted to their friendshipfrankly by mulvaney from the beginning sullenly and with reluctance by learoyd and suspiciously by ortheris who held to it that no man not in the army could fraternise with a red coat like to like said he im a bloomin sodgerhes a bloomin civilian taint naturalthats all  but that was not all they thawed progressively and in the thawing told me more of their lives and adventures than i am ever likely to write  omitting all else this tale begins with the lamentable thirst that was at the beginning of first causes never was such a thirstmulvaney told me so they kicked against their compulsory virtue but the attempt was only successful in the case of ortheris he whose talents were many went forth into the highways and stole a dog from a civilian videlicet some one he knew not who not in the army now that civilian was but newly connected by marriage with the colonel of the regiment and outcry was made from quarters least anticipated by ortheris and in the end he was forced lest a worse thing should happen to dispose at ridiculously unremunerative rates of as promising a small terrier as ever graced one end of a leading string the purchasemoney was barely sufficient for one small outbreak which led him to the guardroom he escaped however with nothing worse than a severe reprimand and a few hours of punishment drill not for nothing had he acquired the reputation of being the best soldier of his inches in the regiment mulvaney had taught personal cleanliness and efficiency as the first articles of his companions creed a dhirty man he was used to say in the speech of his kind goes to clink for a weakness in the knees an is coortmartialled for a pair av socks missin but a clane man such as is an ornament to his servicea man whose buttons are gold whose coat is wax upon him an whose coutrements are widout a speck that man may spakin in reason do fwhat he likes an dhrink from day to divil thats the pride av bein dacint  we sat together upon a day in the shade of a ravine far from the barracks where a watercourse used to run in rainy weather behind us was the scrub jungle in which jackals peacocks the gray wolves of the northwestern provinces and occasionally a tiger estrayed from central india were supposed to dwell in front lay the cantonment glaring white under a glaring sun and on either side ran the broad road that led to delhi  it was the scrub that suggested to my mind the wisdom of mulvaney taking a days leave and going upon a shootingtour the peacock is a holy bird throughout india and he who slays one is in danger of being mobbed by the nearest villagers but on the last occasion that mulvaney had gone forth he had contrived without in the least offending local religious susceptibilities to return with six beautiful peacock skins which he sold to profit it seemed just possible then  but fwhat manner av use is ut to me goin out widout a dhrink the grounds powdherdhry underfoot an ut gets unto the throat fit to kill wailed mulvaney looking at me reproachfully an a peacock is not a bird you can catch the tail av onless ye run can a man run on watheran junglewather too  ortheris had considered the question in all its bearings he spoke chewing his pipestem meditatively the while  go forth return in glory  to clusiums royal ome  an round these bloomin temples ang  the bloomin shields o rome  you better go you aint

you kin get one days leave easy as winkin go along an get it an get peacockses or somethin  jock said mulvaney turning to learoyd who was half asleep under the shadow of the bank he roused slowly  sitha mulvaaney go said he  and mulvaney went cursing his allies with irish fluency and barrack room point  take note said he when he had won his holiday and appeared dressed in his roughest clothes with the only other regimental fowlingpiece in his hand take note jock an you orthris i am goin in the face av my own willall for to please you i misdoubt anythin will come av permiscuous huntin

 at twilight long before the appointed hour he returned emptyhanded much begrimed with dirt  peacockses queried ortheris from the safe rest of a barrackroom table whereon he was smoking crosslegged learoyd fast asleep on a bench  jock said mulvaney without answering as he stirred up the sleeper jock can ye fight will ye fight  very slowly the meaning of the words communicated itself to the half roused man he understoodand againwhat might these things mean mulvaney was shaking him savagely meantime the men in the room howled with delight there was war in the confederacy at lastwar and the breaking of bonds  barrackroom etiquette is stringent on the direct challenge must follow the direct reply this is more binding than the ties of tried friendship once again mulvaney repeated the question learoyd answered by the only means in his power and so swiftly that the irishman had barely time to avoid the blow the laughter around increased learoyd looked bewilderedly at his friendhimself as greatly bewildered ortheris dropped from the table because his world was falling  come outside said mulvaney and as the occupants of the barrackroom prepared joyously to follow he turned and said furiously there will be no fight this nightonless any wan av you is wishful to assist the man that does follows on  no man moved the three passed out into the moonlight learoyd fumbling with the buttons of his coat the paradeground was deserted except for the scurrying jackals mulvaneys impetuous rush carried his companions far into the open ere learoyd attempted to turn round and continue the discussion  be still now twas my fault for beginnin things in the middle av an end jock i should ha comminst wid an explanation but jock dear on your sowl are ye fit think you for the finest fight that iver was betther than fightin me considher before ye answer  more than ever puzzled learoyd turned round two or three times felt an arm kicked tentatively and answered ahm fit he was accustomed to fight blindly at the bidding of the superior mind  they sat them down the men looking on from afar and mulvaney untangled himself in mighty words  followin your fools scheme i wint out into the thrackless desert beyond the barricks an there i met a pious hindu dhriving a bullock kyart i tuk ut for granted he wud be delighted for to convoy me a piece an i jumped in  you long

and the jackals howled merrily learoyd bared one arm and contemplated it in the moonlight then he nodded partly to himself and partly to his friends ortheris wriggled with suppressed emotion  i

fwhats a fight afther all he has robbed the naygurman dishonust we rob him honust for the sake av the whisky he gave me  but wotll we do with the bloomin article when weve got it them palanquins are as big as ouses an uncommon ard to sell as mccleary said when ye stole the sentrybox from the curragh  whos goin to do t fightin said learoyd and ortheris subsided the three returned to barracks without a word mulvaneys last argument clinched the matter this palanquin was property vendible and to be attained in the simplest and least embarrassing fashion it would eventually become beer great was mulvaney  next afternoon a procession of three formed itself and disappeared into the scrub in the direction of the new railway line learoyd alone was without care for mulvaney dived darkly into the future and little ortheris feared the unknown what befell at that interview in the lonely payshed by the side of the halfbuilt embankment only a few hundred coolies know and their tale is confusing one running thus  we were at work three men in red coats came they saw the sahib dearsley sahib they made oration and noticeably the small man among the redcoats dearsley sahib also made oration and used many very strong words upon this talk they departed together to an open space and there the fat man in the red coat fought with dearsley sahib after the custom of white menwith his hands making no noise and never at all pulling dearsley sahibs hair such of us as were not afraid beheld these things for just so long a time as a man needs to cook the midday meal the small man in the red coat had possessed himself of dearsley sahibs watch no he did not steal that watch he held it in his hand and at certain seasons made outcry and the twain ceased their combat which was like the combat of young bulls in spring both men were soon all red but dearsley sahib was much more red than the other seeing this and fearing for his lifebecause we greatly loved himsome fifty of us made shift to rush upon the redcoats but a certain manvery black as to the hair and in no way to be confused with the small man or the fat man who foughtthat man we affirm ran upon us and of us he embraced some ten or fifty in both arms and beat our heads together so that our livers turned to water and we ran away it is not good to interfere in the fightings of white men after that dearsley sahib fell and did not rise these men jumped upon his stomach and despoiled him of all his money and attempted to fire the payshed and departed is it true that dearsley sahib makes no complaint of these latter things having been done we were senseless with fear and do not at all remember there was no palanquin near the payshed what do we know about palanquins is it true that dearsley sahib does not return to this place on account of his sickness for ten days this is the fault of those bad men in the red coats who should be severely punished for dearsley sahib is both our father and mother and we love him much yet if dearsley sahib does not return to this place at all we will speak the truth there was a palanquin for the upkeep of which we were forced to pay ninetenths of our monthly wage on such mulctings dearsley sahib allowed us to make obeisance to him before the palanquin what could we do we were poor men he took a full half of our wages will the government repay us those moneys those three men in red coats bore the palanquin upon their shoulders and departed all the money that dearsley sahib had taken from us was in the cushions of that palanquin therefore they stole it thousands of rupees were thereall our money it was our bankbox to fill which we cheerfully contributed to dearsley sahib threesevenths of our monthly wage why does the white man look upon us with the eye of disfavour before god there was a palanquin and now there is no palanquin and if they send the police here to make inquisition we can only say that there never has been any palanquin why should a palanquin be near these works we are poor men and we know nothing  such is the simplest version of the simplest story connected with the descent upon dearsley from the lips of the coolies i received it dearsley himself was in no condition to say anything and mulvaney preserved a massive silence broken only by the occasional licking of the lips he had seen a fight so gorgeous that even his power of speech was taken from him i respected that reserve until three days after the affair i discovered in a disused stable in my quarters a palanquin of unchastened splendourevidently in past days the litter of a queen the pole whereby it swung between the shoulders of the bearers was rich with the painted papiermache of cashmere the shoulderpads were of yellow silk the panels of the litter itself were ablaze with the loves of all the gods and goddesses of the hindu pantheonlacquer on cedar the cedar sliding doors were fitted with hasps of translucent jaipur enamel and ran in grooves shod with silver the cushions were of brocaded delhi silk and the curtains which once hid any glimpse of the beauty of the kings palace were stiff with gold closer investigation showed that the entire fabric was everywhere rubbed and discoloured by time and wear but even thus it was sufficiently gorgeous to deserve housing on the threshold of a royal zenana i found no fault with it except that it was in my stable then trying to lift it by the silvershod shoulder pole i laughed the road from dearsleys payshed to the cantonment was a narrow and uneven one and traversed by three very inexperienced palanquinbearers one of whom was sorely battered about the head must have been a path of torment still i did not quite recognise the right of the three musketeers to turn me into a fence for stolen property  im askin you to warehouse ut said mulvaney when he was brought to consider the question theres no steal in ut dearsley tould us we cud have ut if we fought jock foughtan oh sorr when the throuble was at uts finest an jock was bleedin like a stuck pig an little orthris was shquealin on one leg chewin big bites out av dearsleys watch i wud ha given my place at the fight to have had you see wan round he tuk jock as i suspicioned he would an jock was deceptive nine rouns they were even matched an at the tenthabout that palanquin now theres not the least throuble in the world or we wud not ha brought ut here you will ondherstand that the queengod bless herdoes not reckon for a privit soldier to kape elephints an palanquins an sich in barricks afther we had dhragged ut down from dearsleys through that cruel scrub that near broke orthriss heart we set ut in the ravine for a night an a thief av a porcupine an a civetcat av a jackal roosted in ut as well we knew in the mornin i put ut to you sorr is an elegint palanquin fit for the princess the natural abidin place av all the vermin in cantonmints we brought ut to you afther dhark and put ut in your shtable do not let your conscience prick think av the rejoicin men in the payshed yonder lookin at dearsley wid his head tied up in a towelan well knowin that they can dhraw their pay ivry month widout stoppages for riffles indirectly sorr you have rescued from an onprincipled son av a night hawk the peasanthry av a numerous village an besides will i let that sedanchair rot on our hands not i tis not every day a piece av pure joolry comes into the market theres not a king widin these forty mileshe waved his hand round the dusty horizonnot a king wud not be glad to buy ut some day meself whin i have leisure ill take ut up along the road an dishpose av ut  how said i for i knew the man was capable of anything  get into ut av coorse and keep wan eye open through the curtains whin i see a likely man av the native persuasion i will descind blushin from my canopy and say buy a palanquin ye black scutt i will have to hire four men to carry me first though and thats impossible till next payday  curiously enough learoyd who had fought for the prize and in the winning secured the highest pleasure life had to offer him was altogether disposed to undervalue it while ortheris openly said it would be better to break the thing up dearsley he argued might be a manysided man capable despite his magnificent fighting qualities of setting in motion the machinery of the civil lawa thing much abhorred by the soldier under any circumstances their fun had come and passed the next payday was close at hand when there would be beer for all wherefore longer conserve the painted palanquin  a firstclass rifleshot an a good little man av your inches you are said mulvaney but you niver had a head worth a softboiled egg tis me has to lie awake av nights schamin an plottin for the three av us orthris me son tis no matther av a few gallons av beerno nor twenty gallonsbut tubs an vats an firkins in that sedanchair who ut was an what ut was an how ut got there we do not know but i know in my bones that you an me an jock wid his sprained thumb will get a fortune thereby lave me alone an let me think  meantime the palanquin stayed in my stall the key of which was in mulvaneys hands  payday came and with it beer it was not in experience to hope that mulvaney dried by four weeks drought would avoid excess next morning he and the palanquin had disappeared he had taken the precaution of getting three days leave to see a friend on the railway and the colonel well knowing that the seasonal outburst was near and hoping it would spend its force beyond the limits of his jurisdiction cheerfully gave him all he demanded at this point mulvaneys history as recorded in the messroom stopped  ortheris carried it not much further no e wasnt drunk said the little man loyally the liquor was no more than feelin its way round inside of im but e went an filled that ole bloomin palanquin with bottles fore e went off es gone an ired six men to carry im an i ad to elp im into is nupshal couch cause e wouldnt ear reason es gone off in is shirt an trousies swearin tremenjus gone down the road in the palanquin wavin is legs out o windy  yes said i but where  now you arx me a question e said e was goin to sell that palanquin but from observations what happened when i was stuffin im through the door i fancy es gone to the new embankment to mock at dearsley soon as jocks off duty im goin there to see if es safenot mulvaney but tother man my saints but i pity im as elps terence out o the palanquin when es once fair drunk  hell come back without harm i said  corse e will ony question is what ll e be doin on the road killing dearsley like as not e shouldnt a gone without jock or me  reinforced by learoyd ortheris sought the foreman of the cooliegang dearsleys head was still embellished with towels mulvaney drunk or sober would have struck no man in that condition and dearsley indignantly denied that he would have taken advantage of the intoxicated brave  i had my pick o you two he explained to learoyd and you got my palanquinnot before id made my profit on it whyd i do harm when everythings settled your man did come heredrunk as davys sow on a frosty nightcame apurpose to mock mestuck his head out of the door an called me a crucified hodman i made him drunker an sent him along but i never touched him  to these things learoyd slow to perceive the evidences of sincerity answered only if owt comes to mulvaaney long o you ill gripple you clouts or no clouts on your ugly head an ill draw t throat twistyways man see there now  the embassy removed itself and dearsley the battered laughed alone over his supper that evening  three days passeda fourth and a fifth the week drew to a close and mulvaney did not return he his royal palanquin and his six attendants had vanished into air a very large and very tipsy soldier his feet sticking out of the litter of a reigning princess is not a thing to travel along the ways without comment yet no man of all the country round had seen any such wonder he was and he was not and learoyd suggested the immediate smashment of dearsley as a sacrifice to his ghost ortheris insisted that all was well and in the light of past experience his hopes seemed reasonable  when mulvaney goes up the road said he es like to go a very long ways up specially when es so blue drunk as e is now but what gits me is is not bein eard of pullin wool off the niggers somewheres about that dont look good the drink must ha died out in im by this unless es broke a bank an thenwhy dont e come back e didnt ought to ha gone off without us  even ortheriss heart sank at the end of the seventh day for half the regiment were out scouring the countryside and learoyd had been forced to fight two men who hinted openly that mulvaney had deserted to do him justice the colonel laughed at the notion even when it was put forward by his muchtrusted adjutant  mulvaney would as soon think of deserting as you would said he no hes either fallen into a mischief among the villagersand yet that isnt likely for hed blarney himself out of the pit or else he is engaged on urgent private affairssome stupendous devilment that we shall hear of at mess after it has been the round of the barrackrooms the worst of it is that i shall have to give him twentyeight days confinement at least for being absent without leave just when i most want him to lick the new batch of recruits into shape i never knew a man who could put a polish on young soldiers as quickly as mulvaney can how does he do it  with blarney and the buckleend of a belt sir said the adjutant he is worth a couple of noncommissioned officers when we are dealing with an irish draft and the london lads seem to adore him the worst of it is that if he goes to the cells the other two are neither to hold nor to bind till he comes out again i believe ortheris preaches mutiny on those occasions and i know that the mere presence of learoyd mourning for mulvaney kills all the cheerfulness of his room the sergeants tell me that he allows no man to laugh when he feels unhappy they are a queer gang  for all that i wish we had a few more of them i like a wellconducted regiment but these pastyfaced shiftyeyed mealymouthed young slouchers from the depot worry me sometimes with their offensive virtue they dont seem to have backbone enough to do anything but play cards and prowl round the married quarters i believe id forgive that old villain on the spot if he turned up with any sort of explanation that i could in decency accept  not likely to be much difficulty about that sir said the adjutant mulvaneys explanations are only one degree less wonderful than his performances they say that when he was in the black tyrone before he came to us he was discovered on the banks of the liffey trying to sell his colonels charger to a donegal dealer as a perfect ladys hack shackbolt commanded the tyrone then  shackbolt must have had apoplexy at the thought of his ramping war horses answering to that description he used to buy unbacked devils and tame them on some pet theory of starvation what did mulvaney say  that he was a member of the society for the prevention of cruelty to animals anxious to sell the poor baste where he would get something to fill out his dimples shackbolt laughed but i fancy that was why mulvaney exchanged to ours  i wish he were back said the colonel for i like him and believe he likes me  that evening to cheer our souls learoyd ortheris and i went into the waste to smoke out a porcupine all the dogs attended but even their clamourand they began to discuss the shortcomings of porcupines before they left cantonmentscould not take us out of ourselves a large low moon turned the tops of the plumegrass to silver and the stunted camelthorn bushes and sour tamarisks into the likenesses of trooping devils the smell of the sun had not left the earth and little aimless winds blowing across the rosegardens to the southward brought the scent of dried roses and water our fire once started and the dogs craftily disposed to wait the dash of the porcupine we climbed to the top of a rainscarred hillock of earth and looked across the scrub seamed with cattle paths white with the long grass and dotted with spots of level pondbottom where the snipe would gather in winter  this said ortheris with a sigh as he took in the unkempt desolation of it all this is sanguinary this is unusually sanguinary sort o mad country like a grate when the fires put out by the sun he shaded his eyes against the moonlight an theres a loony dancin in the middle of it all quite right id dance too if i wasnt so downheart  there pranced a portent in the face of the moona huge and ragged spirit of the waste that flapped its wings from afar it had risen out of the earth it was coming towards us and its outline was never twice the same the toga tablecloth or dressinggown whatever the creature wore took a hundred shapes once it stopped on a neighbouring mound and flung all its legs and arms to the winds  my but that scarecrow as got em bad said ortheris seems like if e comes any furder well ave to argify with im  learoyd raised himself from the dirt as a bull clears his flanks of the wallow and as a bull bellows so he after a short minute at gaze gave tongue to the stars  mulvaaney mulvaaney ahoo  oh then it was that we yelled and the figure dipped into the hollow till with a crash of rending grass the lost one strode up to the light of the fire and disappeared to the waist in a wave of joyous dogs then learoyd and ortheris gave greeting bass and falsetto together both swallowing a lump in the throat  you damned fool said they and severally pounded him with their fists  go easy he answered wrapping a huge arm round each i would have you to know that i am a god to be treated as suchtho by my faith i fancy ive got to go to the guardroom just like a privit soldier  the latter part of the sentence destroyed the suspicions raised by the former any one would have been justified in regarding mulvaney as mad he was hatless and shoeless and his shirt and trousers were dropping off him but he wore one wondrous garmenta gigantic cloak that fell from collarbone to heelof pale pink silk wrought all over in cunningest needlework of hands long since dead with the loves of the hindu gods the monstrous figures leaped in and out of the light of the fire as he settled the folds round him  ortheris handled the stuff respectfully for a moment while i was trying to remember where i had seen it before then he screamed what ave you done with the palanquin youre wearin the linin  i am said the irishman an by the same token the broidery is scrapin my hide off ive lived in this sumpshus counterpane for four days me son i begin to ondherstand why the naygur is no use widout me boots an me trousies like an openwork stocking on a gyurls leg at a dance i begin to feel like a naygurmanall fearful an timoreous give me a pipe an ill tell on  he lit a pipe resumed his grip of his two friends and rocked to and fro in a gale of laughter  mulvaney said ortheris sternly taint no time for laughin youve given jock an me more trouble than youre worth you ave been absent without leave an youll go into cells for that an you ave come back disgustinly dressed an most improper in the linin o that bloomin palanquin instid of which you laugh an we thought you was dead all the time  bhoys said the culprit still shaking gently whin ive done my tale you may cry if you like an little orthris here can thrample my inside out ha done an listen my performances have been stupenjus my luck has been the blessed luck av the british armyan theres no betther than that i went out dhrunk an dhrinkin in the palanquin and i have come back a pink god did any of you go to dearsley afther my time was up he was at the bottom of ut all  ah said so murmured learoyd tomorrow ahll smash t face in upon his heead  ye will not dearsleys a jool av a man afther ortheris had put me into the palanquin an the six bearermen were gruntin down the road i tuk thought to mock dearsley for that fight so i tould thim go to the embankmint and there bein most amazin full i shtuck my head out av the concern an passed compliments wid dearsley i must ha miscalled him outrageous for whin i am that way the power av the tongue comes on me i can bare remimber tellin him that his mouth opened endways like the mouth av a skate which was thrue afther learoyd had handled ut an i clear remimber his takin no manner nor matter av offence but givin me a big dhrink of beer twas the beer did the thrick for i crawled back into the palanquin steppin on me right ear wid me left foot an thin i slept like the dead wanst i halfroused an begad the noise in my head was tremenjusroarin and rattlin an poundin such as was quite new to me mother av mercy thinks i phwat a concertina i will have on my shoulders whin i wake an wid that i curls mysilf up to sleep before ut should get hould on me bhoys that noise was not dhrink twas the rattle av a thrain  there followed an impressive pause  yes he had put me on a thrainput me palanquin an all an six black assassins av his own coolies that was in his nefarious confidence on the flat av a ballastthruck and we were rowlin an bowlin along to benares glory be that i did not wake up thin an introjuce mysilf to the coolies as i was sayin i slept for the betther part av a day an a night but remimber you that that man dearsley had packed me off on wan av his materialthrains to benares all for to make me overstay my leave an get me into the cells  the explanation was an eminently rational one benares lay at least ten hours by rail from the cantonments and nothing in the world could have saved mulvaney from arrest as a deserter had he appeared there in the apparel of his orgies dearsley had not forgotten to take revenge learoyd drawing back a little began to place soft blows over selected portions of mulvaneys body his thoughts were away on the embankment and they meditated evil for dearsley mulvaney continued  whin i was full awake the palanquin was set down in a street i suspicioned for i cud hear people passin an talkin but i knew well i was far from home there is a queer smell upon our cantonmentsa smell av dried earth and brickkilns wid whiffs av cavalry stable litter this place smelt marigold flowers an bad water an wanst somethin alive came an blew heavy with his muzzle at the chink av the shutter its in a village i am thinks i to mysilf an the parochial buffalo is investigatin the palanquin but anyways i had no desire to move only lie still whin youre in foreign parts an the standin luck av the british army will carry ye through that is an epigram i made ut  thin a lot av whishperin divils surrounded the palanquin take ut up sez wan man but wholl pay us sez another the maharanees minister av coorse sez the man oho sez i to mysilf im a quane in me own right wid a minister to pay me expenses ill be an emperor if i lie still long enough but this is no village ive found i lay quiet but i gummed me right eye to a crack av the shutters an i saw that the whole street was crammed wid palanquins an horses an a sprinklin av naked priests all yellow powder an tigers tails but i may tell you orthris an you learoyd that av all the palanquins ours was the most imperial an magnificent now a palanquin means a native lady all the world over except whin a soldier av the quane happens to be takin a ride women an priests sez i your fathers son is in the right pew this time terence there will be proceedins six black divils in pink muslin tuk up the palanquin an oh but the rowlin an the rockin made me sick thin we got fair jammed among the palanquinsnot more than fifty av theman we grated an bumped like queenstown potatosmacks in a runnin tide i cud hear the women gigglin and squirkin in their palanquins but mine was the royal equipage they made way for ut an begad the pink muslin men o mine were howlin room for the maharanee av gokralseetarun do you know aught av the lady sorr  yes said i she is a very estimable old queen of the central indian states and they say she is fat how on earth could she go to benares without all the city knowing her palanquin  twas the eternal foolishness av the naygurman they saw the palanquin lying loneful an forlornsome an the beauty av ut after dearsleys men had dhropped ut and gone away an they gave ut the best name that occurred to thim quite right too for aught we know the ould lady was thravellin incoglike me im glad to hear shes fat i was no light weight mysilf an my men were mortial anxious to dhrop me under a great big archway promiscuously ornamented wid the most improper carvins an cuttins i iver saw begad they made me blushlike alike a maharanee  the temple of prithidevi i murmured remembering the monstrous horrors of that sculptured archway at benares  pretty devilskins savin your presence sorr there was nothin pretty about ut except me twas all half dhark an whin the coolies left they shut a big black gate behind av us an half a company av fat yellow priests began pullyhaulin the palanquins into a dharker place yeta big stone hall full av pillars an gods an incense an all manner av similar thruck the gate disconcerted me for i perceived i wud have to go forward to get out my retreat bein cut off by the same token a good priest makes a bad palanquincoolie begad they nearly turned me inside out draggin the palanquin to the temple now the disposishin av the forces inside was this way the maharanee av gokral seetarunthat was melay by the favour av providence on the far left flank behind the dhark av a pillar carved with elephints heads the remainder av the palanquins was in a big half circle facing in to the biggest fattest an most amazin shegod that iver i dreamed av her head ran up into the black above us an her feet stuck out in the light av a little fire av melted butter that a priest was feedin out av a butterdish thin a man began to sing an play on somethin back in the dhark an twas a queer song ut made my hair lift on the back av my neck thin the doors av all the palanquins slid back an the women bundled out i saw what ill niver see again twas more glorious than thransformations at a pantomime for they was in pink an blue an silver an red an grass green wid dimonds an imralds an great red rubies all over thim but that was the least part av the glory o bhoys they were more lovely than the like av any loveliness in hiven ay their little bare feet were betther than the white hands av a lords lady an their mouths were like puckered roses an their eyes were bigger an dharker than the eyes av any livin women ive seen ye may laugh but im speakin truth i niver saw the like an niver i will again  seeing that in all probability you were watching the wives and daughters of most of the kings of india the chances are that you wont i said for it was dawning on me that mulvaney had stumbled upon a big queens praying at benares  i niver will he said mournfully that sight doesnt come twist to any man it made me ashamed to watch a fat priest knocked at my door i didnt think hed have the insolince to disturb the maharanee av gokral seetarun so i lay still the old cows asleep sez he to another let her be sez that twill be long before she has a calf i might ha known before he spoke that all a woman prays for in injiaan for matter o that in england toois childher that made me more sorry id come me bein as you well know a childless man  he was silent for a moment thinking of his little son dead many years ago  they prayed an the butterfires blazed up an the incense turned everything blue an between that an the fires the women looked as tho they were all ablaze an twinklin they took hold av the shegods knees they cried out an they threw themselves about an that world withoutendamen music was dhrivin thim mad mother av hiven how they cried an the ould shegod grinnin above thim all so scornful the dhrink was dyin out in me fast an i was thinkin harder than the thoughts wud go through my headthinkin how to get out an all manner of nonsense as well the women were rockin in rows their dimond belts clickin an the tears runnin out betune their hands an the lights were goin lower an dharker thin there was a blaze like lightnin from the roof an that showed me the inside av the palanquin an at the end where my foot was stood the livin spit an image o mysilf worked on the linin this man here ut was  he hunted in the folds of his pink cloak ran a hand under one and thrust into the firelight a footlong embroidered presentment of the great god krishna playing on a flute the heavy jowl the staring eye and the blueblack moustache of the god made up a faroff resemblance to mulvaney  the blaze was gone in a wink but the whole schame came to me thin i believe i was mad too i slid the offshutter open an rowled out into the dhark behind the elephinthead pillar tucked up my trousies to my knees slipped off my boots an tuk a general hould av all the pink linin av the palanquin glory be ut ripped out like a womans dhriss whin you tread on ut at a sergeants ball an a bottle came with ut i tuk the bottle an the next minut i was out av the dhark av the pillar the pink linin wrapped round me most graceful the music thunderin like kettledrums an a could draft blowin round my bare legs by this hand that did ut i was khrishna tootlin on the flutethe god that the rigmental chaplain talks about a sweet sight i must ha looked i knew my eyes were big and my face was waxwhite an at the worst i must ha looked like a ghost but they took me for the livin god the music stopped and the women were dead dumb an i crooked my legs like a shepherd on a china basin an i did the ghostwaggle with my feet as i had done ut at the rigmental theatre many times an i slid acrost the width av that temple in front av the shegod tootlin on the beer bottle  wot did you toot demanded ortheris the practical  me oh mulvaney sprang up suiting the action to the word and sliding gravely in front of us a dilapidated but imposing deity in the half light i sang      only say      youll be mrs brallaghan      dont say nay      charmin judy callaghan  i didnt know me own voice when i sang an oh twas pitiful to see the women the darlins were down on their faces whin i passed the last wan i cud see her poor little fingers workin one in another as if she wanted to touch my feet so i dhrew the tail av this pink overcoat over her head for the greater honour an i slid into the dhark on the other side av the temple and fetched up in the arms av a big fat priest all i wanted was to get away clear so i tuk him by his greasy throat an shut the speech out av him out sez i which way ye fat heathen oh sez he man sez i white man soldier man common soldier man where in the name av confusion is the back door the women in the temple were still on their faces an a young priest was holdin out his arms above their heads  this way sez my fat friend duckin behind a big bullgod an divin into a passage thin i remimbered that i must ha made the miraculous reputation av that temple for the next fifty years not so fast i sez an i held out both my hands wid a wink that ould thief smiled like a father i tuk him by the back av the neck in case he should be wishful to put a knife into me unbeknownst an i ran him up an down the passage twice to collect his sensibilities be quiet sez he in english now you talk sense i sez fwhat ll you give me for the use av that most iligant palanquin i have no time to take awaydont tell sez he is ut like sez i but ye might give me my railway fare im far from my home an ive done you a service bhoys tis a good thing to be a priest the ould man niver throubled himself to dhraw from a bank as i will prove to you subsequint he philandered all round the slack av his clothes an began dribblin tenrupee notes old gold mohurs and rupees into my hand till i could hould no more  you lie said ortheris youre mad or sunstrook a native dont give coin unless you cut it out o im taint nature  then my lie an my sunstroke is concealed under that lump av sod yonder retorted mulvaney unruffled nodding across the scrub an theres a dale more in nature than your squidgy little legs have iver taken you to orthris me son four hundred an thirtyfour rupees by my reckonin an a big fat gold necklace that i took from him as a remimbrancer was our share in that business  an e give it you for love said ortheris  we were alone in that passage maybe i was a trifle too pressin but considher fwhat i had done for the good av the temple and the iverlastin joy av those women twas cheap at the price i wud ha taken more if i cud ha found ut i turned the ould man upside down at the last but he was milked dhry thin he opened a door in another passage an i found mysilf up to my knees in benares riverwater an bad smellin ut is more by token i had come out on the riverline close to the burnin ghat and contagious to a cracklin corpse this was in the heart av the night for i had been four hours in the temple there was a crowd av boats tied up so i tuk wan an wint across the river thin i came home acrost country lyin up by day  how on earth did you manage i said  how did sir frederick roberts get from cabul to candahar he marched an he niver tould how near he was to breakin down thats why he is fwhat he is an now mulvaney yawned portentously now i will go an give myself up for absince widout leave its eight an twenty days an the rough end of the colonels tongue in orderly room any way you look at ut but tis cheap at the price  mulvaney said i softly if there happens to be any sort of excuse that the colonel can in any way accept i have a notion that youll get nothing more than the dressinggown the new recruits are in and  not a word more sorr is ut excuses the old man wants tis not my way but he shall have thim ill tell him i was engaged in financial operations connected wid a church and he flapped his way to cantonments and the cells singing lustily      so they sent a corprils file      and they put me in the gyardroom      for conduck unbecomin of a soldier  and when he was lost in the midst of the moonlight we could hear the refrain       bang upon the big drum bash upon the cymbals      as we go marchin along boys oh      for although in this campaign      theres no whisky nor champagne      well keep our spirits goin with a song boys  therewith he surrendered himself to the joyful and almost weeping guard and was made much of by his fellows but to the colonel he said that he had been smitten with sunstroke and had lain insensible on a villagers cot for untold hours and between laughter and goodwill the affair was smoothed over so that he could next day teach the new recruits how to fear god honour the queen shoot straight and keep clean     the courting of dinah shadd        what did the colonels lady think        nobody never knew      somebody asked the sergeants wife        an she told em true      when you git to a man in the case        theyre like a row o pins      for the colonels lady an judy ogrady        are sisters under their skins                           barrackroom ballad  al day i had followed at the heels of a pursuing army engaged on one of the finest battles that ever camp of exercise beheld thirty thousand troops had by the wisdom of the government of india been turned loose over a few thousand square miles of country to practise in peace what they would never attempt in war consequently cavalry charged unshaken infantry at the trot infantry captured artillery by frontal attacks delivered in line of quarter columns and mounted infantry skirmished up to the wheels of an armoured train which carried nothing more deadly than a twentyfive pounder armstrong two nordenfeldts and a few score volunteers all cased in threeeighthsinch boilerplate yet it was a very lifelike camp operations did not cease at sundown nobody knew the country and nobody spared man or horse there was unending cavalry scouting and almost unending forced work over broken ground the army of the south had finally pierced the centre of the army of the north and was pouring through the gap hotfoot to capture a city of strategic importance its front extended fanwise the sticks being represented by regiments strung out along the line of route backwards to the divisional transport columns and all the lumber that trails behind an army on the move on its right the broken left of the army of the north was flying in mass chased by the southern horse and hammered by the southern guns till these had been pushed far beyond the limits of their last support then the flying sat down to rest while the elated commandant of the pursuing force telegraphed that he held all in check and observation  unluckily he did not observe that three miles to his right flank a flying column of northern horse with a detachment of ghoorkhas and british troops had been pushed round as fast as the failing light allowed to cut across the entire rear of the southern army to break as it were all the ribs of the fan where they converged by striking at the transport reserve ammunition and artillery supplies their instructions were to go in avoiding the few scouts who might not have been drawn off by the pursuit and create sufficient excitement to impress the southern army with the wisdom of guarding their own flank and rear before they captured cities it was a pretty manoeuvre neatly carried out  speaking for the second division of the southern army our first intimation of the attack was at twilight when the artillery were labouring in deep sand most of the escort were trying to help them out and the main body of the infantry had gone on a noahs ark of elephants camels and the mixed menagerie of an indian transporttrain bubbled and squealed behind the guns when there appeared from nowhere in particular british infantry to the extent of three companies who sprang to the heads of the gunhorses and brought all to a standstill amid oaths and cheers  hows that umpire said the major commanding the attack and with one voice the drivers and limber gunners answered hout while the colonel of artillery sputtered  all your scouts are charging our main body said the major your flanks are unprotected for two miles i think weve broken the back of this division and listenthere go the ghoorkhas  a weak fire broke from the rearguard more than a mile away and was answered by cheerful howlings the ghoorkhas who should have swung clear of the second division had stepped on its tail in the dark but drawing off hastened to reach the next line of attack which lay almost parallel to us five or six miles away  our column swayed and surged irresolutelythree batteries the divisional ammunition reserve the baggage and a section of the hospital and bearer corps the commandant ruefully promised to report himself cut up to the nearest umpire and commending his cavalry and all other cavalry to the special care of eblis toiled on to resume touch with the rest of the division  well bivouac here tonight said the major i have a notion that the ghoorkhas will get caught they may want us to reform on stand easy till the transport gets away  a hand caught my beasts bridle and led him out of the choking dust a larger hand deftly canted me out of the saddle and two of the hugest hands in the world received me sliding pleasant is the lot of the special correspondent who falls into such hands as those of privates mulvaney ortheris and learoyd  an thats all right said the irishman calmly we thought wed find you somewheres here by is there anything av yours in the transport orthris ll fetch ut out  ortheris did fetch ut out from under the trunk of an elephant in the shape of a servant and an animal both laden with medical comforts the little mans eyes sparkled  if the brutil an licentious soldiery av these parts gets sight av the thruck said mulvaney making practised investigations theyll loot evrything theyre bein fed on ironfilins an dogbiscuit these days but glorys no compensation for a bellyache praise be were here to protect you sorr beer sausage bread soft an thats a curosity soup in a tin whisky by the smell av ut an fowls mother av moses but ye take the field like a confectioner tis scandlus  eres a orficer said ortheris significantly when the sergents done lushin the privit may clean the pot  i bundled several things into mulvaneys haversack before the majors hand fell on my shoulder and he said tenderly requisitioned for the queens service wolseley was quite wrong about special correspondents they are the soldiers best friends come and take potluck with us to night  and so it happened amid laughter and shoutings that my wellconsidered commissariat melted away to reappear later at the messtable which was a waterproof sheet spread on the ground the flying column had taken three days rations with it and there be few things nastier than government rationsespecially when government is experimenting with german toys erbsenwurst tinned beef of surpassing tinniness compressed vegetables and meatbiscuits may be nourishing but what thomas atkins needs is bulk in his inside the major assisted by his brother officers purchased goats for the camp and so made the experiment of no effect long before the fatigueparty sent to collect brushwood had returned the men were settled down by their valises kettles and pots had appeared from the surrounding country and were dangling over fires as the kid and the compressed vegetable bubbled together there rose a cheerful clinking of messtins outrageous demands for a little more stuffin with that there liverwing and gust on gust of chaff as pointed as a bayonet and as delicate as a gun butt  the boys are in a good temper said the major theyll be singing presently well a night like this is enough to keep them happy  over our heads burned the wonderful indian stars which are not all pricked in on one plane but preserving an orderly perspective draw the eye through the velvet darkness of the void up to the barred doors of heaven itself the earth was a gray shadow more unreal than the sky we could hear her breathing lightly in the pauses between the howling of the jackals the movement of the wind in the tamarisks and the fitful mutter of musketryfire leagues away to the left a native woman from some unseen hut began to sing the mailtrain thundered past on its way to delhi and a roosting crow cawed drowsily then there was a belt loosening silence about the fires and the even breathing of the crowded earth took up the story  the men full fed turned to tobacco and songtheir officers with them the subaltern is happy who can win the approval of the musical critics in his regiment and is honoured among the more intricate step dancers by him as by him who plays cricket cleverly thomas atkins will stand in time of need when he will let a better officer go on alone the ruined tombs of forgotten mussulman saints heard the ballad of agra town the buffalo battery marching to kabul the long long indian day the place where the punkahcoolie died and that crashing chorus which announces       youths daring spirit manhoods fire        firm hand and eagle eye      must he acquire who would aspire        to see the gray boar die  today of all those jovial thieves who appropriated my commissariat and lay and laughed round that waterproof sheet not one remains they went to camps that were not of exercise and battles without umpires burmah the soudan and the frontierfever and fighttook them in their time  i drifted across to the mens fires in search of mulvaney whom i found strategically greasing his feet by the blaze there is nothing particularly lovely in the sight of a private thus engaged after a long days march but when you reflect on the exact proportion of the might majesty dominion and power of the british empire which stands on those feet you take an interest in the proceedings  theres a blister bad luck to ut on the heel said mulvaney i cant touch ut prick ut out little man  ortheris took out his housewife eased the trouble with a needle stabbed mulvaney in the calf with the same weapon and was swiftly kicked into the fire  ive bruk the best av my toes over you ye grinnin child av disruption said mulvaney sitting crosslegged and nursing his feet then seeing me oh uts you sorr be welkim an take that maraudin scutts place jock hold him down on the cindhers for a bit  but ortheris escaped and went elsewhere as i took possession of the hollow he had scraped for himself and lined with his greatcoat learoyd on the other side of the fire grinned affably and in a minute fell fast asleep  theres the height av politeness for you said mulvaney lighting his pipe with a flaming branch but jocks eaten half a box av your sardines at wan gulp an i think the tin too whats the best wid you sorr an how did you happen to be on the losin side this day whin we captured you  the army of the south is winning all along the line i said  then that lines the hangmans rope savin your presence youll learn tomorrow how we rethreated to dhraw thim on before we made thim trouble an thats what a woman does by the same tokin well be attacked before the dawnin an ut would be betther not to slip your boots how do i know that by the light av pure reason here are three companies av us ever so far inside av the enemys flank an a crowd av roarin tarin squealin cavalry gone on just to turn out the whole hornets nest av them av course the enemy will pursue by brigades like as not an thin well have to run for ut mark my words i am av the opinion av polonius whin he said dont fight wid ivry scutt for the pure joy av fightin but if you do knock the nose av him first an frequint we ought to ha gone on an helped the ghoorkhas  but what do you know about polonius i demanded this was a new side of mulvaneys character  all that shakespeare iver wrote an a dale more that the gallery shouted said the man of war carefully lacing his boots did i not tell you av silvers theatre in dublin whin i was younger than i am now an a patron av the drama ould silver wud never pay actorman or woman their just dues an by consequince his compnies was collapsible at the last minut thin the bhoys wud clamour to take a part an oft as not ould silver made them pay for the fun faith ive seen hamlut played wid a new black eye an the queen as full as a cornucopia i remimber wanst hogin that listed in the black tyrone an was shot in south africa he sejuced ould silver into givin him hamluts part instid av me that had a fine fancy for rhetoric in those days av course i wint into the gallery an began to fill the pit wid other peoples hats an i passed the time av day to hogin walkin through denmark like a hamstrung mule wid a pall on his back hamlut sez i theres a hole in your heel pull up your shtockins hamlut sez i hamlut hamlut for the love av decincy dhrop that skull an pull up your shtockins the whole house begun to tell him that he stopped his soliloquishms midbetween my shtockins may be comin down or they may not sez he screwin his eye into the gallery for well he knew who i was but afther this performince is over me an the ghost ll trample the tripes out av you terence wid your asss bray an thats how i come to know about hamlut eyah those days those days did you iver have onendin devilmint an nothin to pay for it in your life sorr  never without having to pay i said  thats thrue tis mane whin you considher on ut but uts the same wid horse or fut a headache if you dhrink an a bellyache if you eat too much an a heartache to kape all down faith the beast only gets the colic an hes the lucky man  he dropped his head and stared into the fire fingering his moustache the while from the far side of the bivouac the voice of corbetnolan senior subaltern of b company uplifted itself in an ancient and much appreciated song of sentiment the men moaning melodiously behind him       the north wind blew coldly she drooped from that hour      my own little kathleen my sweet little kathleen      kathleen my kathleen kathleen omoore  with fortyfive os in the last word even at that distance you might have cut the soft south irish accent with a shovel  for all we take we must pay but the price is cruel high murmured mulvaney when the chorus had ceased  whats the trouble i said gently for i knew that he was a man of an inextinguishable sorrow  hear now said he ye know what i am now i know what i mint to be at the beginnin av my service ive tould you time an again an what i have not dinah shadd has an what am i oh mary mother av hiven an ould dhrunken untrustable baste av a privit that has seen the regment

regment has to know me for the best soldier in ut better cause have i to know mesilf for the worst man im only fit to tache the new drafts what ill niver learn mesilf an i am sure as tho i heard ut

ye cud say nothin to help me an yet ye niver knew what cause i had to be what i am  begin at the beginning and go on to the end i said royally but rake up the fire a bit first  i passed ortheriss bayonet for a poker  that shows how little we know what we do said mulvaney putting it aside fire takes all the heart out av the steel an the next time may be that our little man is fighting for his life his bradawl ll break an so youll ha killed him manin no more than to kape yourself warm tis a recruitys thrick that pass the claninrod sorr  i snuggled down abased and after an interval the voice of mulvaney began  did i iver tell you how dinah shadd came to be wife av mine  i dissembled a burning anxiety that i had felt for some monthsever since dinah shadd the strong the patient and the infinitely tender had of her own good love and free will washed a shirt for me moving in a barren land where washing was not  i cant remember i said casually was it before or after you made love to annie bragin and got no satisfaction  the story of annie bragin is written in another place it is one of the many less respectable episodes in mulvaneys chequered career  beforebeforelong before was that business av annie bragin an the corprils ghost niver woman was the worse for me whin i had married dinah theres a time for all things an i know how to kape all things in placebarrin the dhrink that kapes me in my place wid no hope av comin to be aught else  begin at the beginning i insisted mrs mulvaney told me that you married her when you were quartered in krab bokhar barracks  an the same is a cesspit said mulvaney piously she spoke thrue did dinah twas this way talkin av that have ye iver fallen in love sorr  i preserved the silence of the damned mulvaney continued  thin i will assume that ye have not i did in the days av my youth as i have more than wanst tould you i was a man that filled the eye an delighted the sowl av women niver man was hated as i have bin niver man was loved as ino not within half a days march av ut for the first five years av my service whin i was what i wud give my sowl to be now i tuk whatever was within my reach an digested utan thats more than

ut is said mesilf to me an wid that i considhered on ut a long while did you iver feel that way sorr  i snored gently knowing that if mulvaney were uninterrupted he would go on the clamour from the bivouac fires beat up to the stars as the rival singers of the companies were pitted against each other  so i felt that way an a bad time ut was wanst bein a fool i wint into the married lines more for the sake av spakin to our ould colour sergint shadd than for any thruck wid womenfolk i was a corpril then rejuced aftherwards but a corpril then ive got a photograft av mesilf to prove ut youll

the compny captain read a prayer an since then ive been a childless man an all else that ould mother sheehy put upon me an dinah shadd what do you think sorr  i thought a good deal but it seemed better then to reach out for mulvaneys hand the demonstration nearly cost me the use of three fingers whatever he knows of his weaknesses mulvaney is entirely ignorant of his strength  but what do you think he repeated as i was straightening out the crushed fingers  my reply was drowned in yells and outcries from the next fire where ten men were shouting for orthris privit orthris mistah orther ris deah boy capn orthris fieldmarshal orthris stanley you pennorth o pop come ere to your own compny and the cockney who had been delighting another audience with recondite and rabelaisian yarns was shot

nevertobeforgotten season when ortheris waded through the deep waters of affliction and behaved abominably but hes talkin bitter truth though eyah     my very worst frind from beginnin to ind     by the blood av a mouse was mesilf  when i woke i saw mulvaney the nightdew gemming his moustache leaning on his rifle at picket lonely as prometheus on his rock with i know not what vultures tearing his liver     on greenhow hill    to loves low voice she lent a careless ear  her hand within his rosy fingers lay  a chilling weight she would not turn or hear  but with averted face went on her way  but when pale death all featureless and grim  lifted his bony hand and beckoning  held out his cypresswreath she followed him  and love was left forlorn and wondering  that she who for his bidding would not stay  at deaths first whisper rose and went away                                  rivals  ohe ahmed din shafiz ullah ahoo bahadur khan where are you come out of the tents as i have done and fight against the english dont kill your own kin come out to me  the deserter from a native corps was crawling round the outskirts of the camp firing at intervals and shouting invitations to his old comrades misled by the rain and the darkness he came to the english wing of the camp and with his yelping and riflepractice disturbed the men they had been making roads all day and were tired  ortheris was sleeping at learoyds feet wots all that he said thickly learoyd snored and a snider bullet ripped its way through the tent wall the men swore its that bloomin deserter from the aurangabadis said ortheris git up some one an tell im es come to the wrong shop  go to sleep little man said mulvaney who was steaming nearest the door i cant arise an expaytiate with him tis rainin entrenchin tools outside  taint because you bloomin cant its cause you bloomin wont ye long limp lousy lazy beggar you ark toim owlin  wots the good of argifying put a bullet into the swine es keepin us awake said another voice  a subaltern shouted angrily and a dripping sentry whined from the darkness  taint no good sir i cant see im es idin somewhere down ill  ortheris tumbled out of his blanket shall i try to get im sir said he  no was the answer lie down i wont have the whole camp shooting all round the clock tell him to go and pot his friends  ortheris considered for a moment then putting his head under the tent wall he called as a bus conductor calls in a block igher up there igher up  the men laughed and the laughter was carried down wind to the deserter who hearing that he had made a mistake went off to worry his own regiment half a mile away he was received with shots the aurangabadis were very angry with him for disgracing their colours  an thats all right said ortheris withdrawing his head as he heard the hiccough of the sniders in the distance selp me gawd tho that mans not fit to livemessin with my beautysleep this way  go out and shoot him in the morning then said the subaltern incautiously silence in the tents now get your rest men  ortheris lay down with a happy little sigh and in two minutes there was no sound except the rain on the canvas and the allembracing and elemental snoring of learoyd  the camp lay on a bare ridge of the himalayas and for a week had been waiting for a flying column to make connection the nightly rounds of the deserter and his friends had become a nuisance  in the morning the men dried themselves in hot sunshine and cleaned their grimy accoutrements the native regiment was to take its turn of roadmaking that day while the old regiment loafed  im goin to lay for a shot at that man said ortheris when he had finished washing out his rifle e comes up the watercourse every evenin about five oclock if we go and lie out on the north ill a bit this afternoon well get im  youre a bloodthirsty little mosquito said mulvaney blowing blue clouds into the air but i suppose i will have to come wid you fwheres jock  gone out with the mixed pickles cause e thinks isself a bloomin marksman said ortheris with scorn  the mixed pickles were a detachment of picked shots generally employed in clearing spurs of hills when the enemy were too impertinent this taught the young officers how to handle men and did not do the enemy much harm mulvaney and ortheris strolled out of camp and passed the aurangabadis going to their roadmaking  youve got to sweat today said ortheris genially were going to get your man you didnt knock im out last night by any chance any of you  no the pig went away mocking us i had one shot at him said a private hes my cousin and i ought to have cleared our dishonour but good luck to you  they went cautiously to the north hill ortheris leading because as he explainedthis is a longrange show an ive got to do it his was an almost passionate devotion to his rifle which by barrackroom report he was supposed to kiss every night before turning in charges and scuffles he held in contempt and when they were inevitable slipped between mulvaney and learoyd bidding them to fight for his skin as well as their own they never failed him he trotted along questing like a hound on a broken trail through the wood of the north hill at last he was satisfied and threw himself down on the soft pineneedled slope that commanded a clear view of the watercourse and a brown bare hillside beyond it the trees made a scented darkness in which an army corps could have hidden from the sunglare without  eres the tail o the wood said ortheris es got to come up the watercourse cause it gives im cover well lay ere taint not arf so bloomin dusty neither  he buried his nose in a clump of scentless white violets no one had come to tell the flowers that the season of their strength was long past and they had bloomed merrily in the twilight of the pines  this is something like he said luxuriously wot a evinly clear drop for a bullet acrost how much dyou make it mulvaney  seven hunder maybe a trifle less bekaze the airs so thin  wop wop wop went a volley of musketry on the rear face of the north hill  curse them mixed pickles firin at nothin theyll scare arf the country  thry a sightin shot in the middle of the row said mulvaney the man of many wiles theres a red rock yonder hell be sure to pass quick  ortheris ran his sight up to six hundred yards and fired the bullet threw up a feather of dust by a clump of gentians at the base of the rock  good enough said ortheris snapping the scale down you snick your sights to mine or a little lower youre always firin high but remember first shot to me o lordy but its a lovely afternoon  the noise of the firing grew louder and there was a tramping of men in the wood the two lay very quiet for they knew that the british soldier is desperately prone to fire at anything that moves or calls then learoyd appeared his tunic ripped across the breast by a bullet looking ashamed of himself he flung down on the pineneedles breathing in snorts  one o them damned gardeners o th pickles said he fingering the rent firin to th right flank when he knowed i was there if i knew who he was id a rippen the hide offan him look at ma tunic  thats the spishil trustability av a marksman train him to hit a fly wid a stiddy rest at seven hunder an he loose on anythin he sees or hears up to th mile youre well out av that fancyfirin gang jock stay here  bin firin at the bloomin wind in the bloomin treetops said ortheris with a chuckle ill show you some firin later on  they wallowed in the pineneedles and the sun warmed them where they lay the mixed pickles ceased firing and returned to camp and left the wood to a few scared apes the watercourse lifted up its voice in the silence and talked foolishly to the rocks now and again the dull thump of a blasting charge three miles away told that the aurangabadis were in difficulties with their roadmaking the men smiled as they listened and lay still soaking in the warm leisure presently learoyd between the whiffs of his pipe  seems queerabout im yonderdesertin at all  ell be a bloomin side queerer when ive done with im said ortheris they were talking in whispers for the stillness of the wood and the desire of slaughter lay heavy upon them  i make no doubt he had his reasons for desertin but my faith i make less doubt ivry man has good reason for killin him said mulvaney  happen there was a lass tewed up wi it men do more than more for th sake of a lass  they make most av us list theyve no manner av right to make us desert  ah they make us list or their fathers do said learoyd softly his helmet over his eyes ortheriss brows contracted savagely he was watching the valley if its a girl ill shoot the beggar twice over an second time for bein a fool youre blasted sentimental all of a sudden thinkin o your last near shave  nay lad ah was but thinkin o what had happened  an fwhat has happened ye lumberin child av calamity that youre lowing like a cowcalf at the back av the pasture an suggestin invidious excuses for the man stanleys goin to kill yell have to wait another hour yet little man spit it out jock an bellow melojus to the moon it takes an earthquake or a bullet graze to fetch aught out av you discourse don juan the amoors av lotharius learoyd stanley kape a rowlin rigmental eye on the valley  its along o yon hill there said learoyd watching the bare sub himalayan spur that reminded him of his yorkshire moors he was speaking more to himself than his fellows ay said he rumbolds moor stands up ower skipton town an greenhow hill stands up ower pately brig i reckon youve never heeard tell o greenhow hill but yon bit o bare stuff if there was nobbut a white road windin is like ut strangely like moors an moors an moors wi never a tree for shelter an gray houses wi flagstone rooves and pewits cryin an a windhover goin to and fro just like these kites and cold a wind that cuts you like a knife you could tell greenhow hill folk by the redapple colour o their cheeks an nose tips and their blue eyes driven into pinpoints by the wind miners mostly burrowin for lead i th hillsides followin the trail of th ore vein same as a fieldrat it was the roughest minin i ever seen yod come on a bit o creakin wood windlass like a wellhead an you was let down i th bight of a rope fendin yoursen off the side wi one hand carryin a candle stuck in a lump o clay with tother an clickin hold of a rope with tother hand  an thats three of them said mulvaney must be a good climate in those parts  learoyd took no heed  an then yo came to a level where you crept on your hands and knees through a mile o windin drift an you come out into a caveplace as big as leeds townhall with a engine pumpin water from workins at went deeper still its a queer country let alone minin for the hill is full of those natural caves an the rivers an the becks drops into what they call potholes an come out again miles away  wot was you doin there said ortheris  i was a young chap then an mostly went wi osses leadin coal and lead ore but at th time im tellin on i was drivin the waggonteam i th big sumph i didnt belong to that countryside by rights i went there because of a little difference at home an at fust i took up wi a rough lot one night wed been drinkin an i must ha hed more than i could stand or happen th ale was none so good though i them days by for god i never seed bad ale he flung his arms over his head and gripped a vast handful of white violets nah said he i never seed the ale i could not drink the bacca i could not smoke nor the lass i could not kiss well we mun have a race home the lot on us i lost all th others an when i was climbin ower one of them walls built o loose stones i comes down into the ditch stones and all an broke my arm not as i knawed

faith its a good thing to be nursed by a woman when youre sick said mulvaney dir cheap at the price av twenty broken heads  ortheris turned to frown across the valley he had not been nursed by many women in his life  an then dr warbottom comes ridin up an jesse roantree along with im he was a highlarned doctor but he talked wi poor folk same as theirsens whats ta big agaate on naa he sings out brekkin tha thick head an he felt me all ovver thats none broken tha nobbut knocked a bit sillier than ordinary an thats daaft eneaf an soa he went on callin me all the names he could think on but

fool id like to know said mulvaney sure follys the only safe way to wisdom for ive thried it  wisdom grinned ortheris scanning his comrades with uplifted chin youre bloomin solomons you two aint you  learoyd went calmly on with a steady eye like an ox chewing the cud  and that was how i come to know liza roantree theres some tunes as she used to singaw she were always singinthat fetches greenhow hill before my eyes as fair as yon brow across there and she would learn me to sing bass an i was to go to th chapel wi em where jesse and she led the singin th old man playin the fiddle he was a strange chap old jesse fair mad wi music an he made me promise to learn the big fiddle when my arm was better it belonged to him and it stood up in a big case alongside o th eightday clock but willie satterthwaite as played it in the chapel had getten deaf as a door post and it vexed jesse as he had to rap him ower his head wi th fiddlestick to make him give ower sawin at th right time  but there was a black drop in it all an it was a man in a black coat that brought it when th primitive methodist preacher came to greenhow he would always stop wi jesse roantree an he laid hold of me from th beginning it seemed i wor a soul to be saved and he meaned to do it at th same time i jealoused at he were keen o savin liza roantrees soul as well and i could ha killed him many a time an this went on till one day i broke out an borrowed th brass for a drink from liza after fower days i come back wi my tail between my legs just to see liza again but jesse were at home an th preacherth reverend amos barraclough liza said naught but a bit o red come into her face as were white of a regular thing says jesse tryin his best to be civil nay lad its like this youve getten to choose which way its goin to be ill ha nobody across ma doorstep as goes adrinkin an borrows my lasss money to spend i their drink hod tha tongue liza sez he when she wanted to put in a word at i were welcome to th brass and she were none afraid that i wouldnt pay it back then the reverend cuts in seein as jesse were losin his temper an they fair beat me among them but it were liza as looked an said naught as did more than either o their tongues an soa i concluded to get converted  fwhat shouted mulvaney then checking himself he said softly let be let be sure the blessed virgin is the mother of all religion an most women an theres a dale av piety in a girl if the men would only let ut stay there id ha been converted myself under the circumstances  nay but pursued learoyd with a blush i meaned it  ortheris laughed as loudly as he dared having regard to his business at the time  ay ortheris you may laugh but you didnt know yon preacher barraclougha little whitefaced chap wi a voice as ud wile a bird off an a bush and a way o layin hold of folks as made them think theyd never had a live man for a friend before you never saw him an anyou never seed liza roantreenever seed liza roantree happen it was as much liza as th preacher and her father but anyways they all meaned it an i was fair shamed o mysen an so i become what they call a changed character and when i think on its hard to believe as yon chap going to prayermeetins chapel and classmeetins were me but i never had naught to say for mysen though there was a deal o shoutin and old sammy strother as were almost clemmed to death and doubled up with the rheumatics would sing out joyful joyful and at it were better to go up to heaven in a coalbasket than down to hell i a coach an six and he would put his poor old claw on my shoulder sayin doesnt tha feel it tha great lump doesnt tha feel it an sometimes i thought i did and then again i thought i didnt an how was that  the iverlastin nature av mankind said mulvaney an furthermore i misdoubt you were built for the primitive methodians theyre a new corps anyways i hold by the ould church for shes the mother of them allay an the father too i like her bekaze shes most remarkable regimental in her fittings i may die in honolulu nova zambra or cape cayenne but wherever i die me bein fwhat i am an a priest handy i go under the same orders an the same words an the same unction as tho the pope himself come down from the roof av st peters to see me off theres neither high nor low nor broad nor deep nor betwixt nor between wid her an thats what i like but mark you shes no manner av church for a wake man bekaze she takes the body and the soul av him onless he has his proper work to do i remember when my father died that was three months comin to his grave begad hed ha sold the shebeen above our heads for ten minutes quittance of purgathory an he did all he could thats why i say ut takes a strong man to deal with the ould church an for that reason youll find so many women go there an that sames a conundrum  wots the use o worritin bout these things said ortheris youre bound to find all out quicker nor you want to anyow he jerked the cartridge out of the breechblock into the palm of his hand eres my chaplain he said and made the venomous blackheaded bullet bow like a marionette es goin to teach a man all about which is which an wots true after all before sundown but wot appened after that jock  there was one thing they boggled at and almost shut th gate i my face for and that were my dog blast th only one saved out o a litter o pups as was blowed up when a keg o minin powder loosed off in th storekeepers hut they liked his name no better than his business which were fightin every dog he comed across a rare good dog wi spots o black and pink on his face one ear gone and lame o one side wi being driven in a basket through an iron roof a matter of half a mile  they said i mun give him up cause he were worldly and low and would i let mysen be shut out of heaven for the sake on a dog nay says i if th door isnt wide enough for th pair on us well stop outside for well none be parted and th preacher spoke up for blast as had a likin for him from th firsti reckon that was why i come to like th preacherand wouldnt hear o changin his name to bless as some o them wanted so th pair on us became reglar chapelmembers but its hard for a young chap o my build to cut traces from the world th flesh an the devil all uv a heap yet i stuck to it for a long time while th lads as used to stand about th townend an lean ower th bridge spittin into th beck o a sunday would call after me sitha learoyd whens ta bean to preach cause were comin to hear tha hod tha jaw he hasnt getten th white choaker on ta morn another lad would say and i had to double my fists hard i th bottom of my sunday coat and say to mysen if twere monday and i warnt a member o the primitive methodists id leather all th lot of yond that was th hardest of allto know that i could fight and i mustnt fight  sympathetic grunts from mulvaney  so what wi singin practising and classmeetins and th big fiddle as he made me take between my knees i spent a deal o time i jesse roantrees houseplace but often as i was there th preacher fared to me to go oftener and both th old man an th young woman were pleased to have him he lived i pately brig as were a goodish step off but he come he come all the same i liked him as well or better as any man id ever seen i one way and yet i hated him wi all my heart i tother and we watched each other like cat and mouse but civil as you please for i was on my best behaviour and he was that fair and open that i was bound to be fair with him rare good company he was if i hadnt wanted to wring his cliver little neck half of the time often and often when he was goin from jesses id set him a bit on the road  see im ome you mean said ortheris  ay its a way we have i yorkshire o seein friends off you was a friend as i didnt want to come back and he didnt want me to come back neither and so wed walk together towards pately and then hed set me back again and there wed be wal two oclock i the mornin settin each other to an fro like a blasted pair o pendulums twixt hill and valley long after th light had gone out i lizas window as both on us had been looking at pretending to watch the moon  ah broke in mulvaney yed no chanst against the maraudin psalm singer theyll take the airs an the graces instid av the man nine times out av ten an they only find the blunder laterthe wimmen  thats just where yore wrong said learoyd reddening under the freckled tan of his cheeks i was th first wi liza an yod think that were enough but th parson were a steadygaited sort o chap and jesse were strong o his side and all th women i the congregation dinned it to liza at she were fair fond to take up wi a wastrel neerdoweel like me as was scarcelins respectable an a fighting dog at his heels it was all very well for her to be doing me good and saving my soul but she must mind as she didnt do herself harm they talk o rich folk bein stuck up an genteel but for castiron pride o respectability theres naught like poor chapel folk its as cold as th wind o greenhow hillay and colder for twill never change and now i come to think on it one at strangest things i know is at they couldnt abide th thought o soldiering theres a vast o fightin i th bible and theres a deal of methodists i th army but to hear chapel folk talk yod think that soldierin were next door an tother side to hangin i their meetins all their talk is o fightin when sammy strother were stuck for summat to say in his prayers hed sing out th sword o th lord and o gideon they were allus at it about puttin on th whole armour o righteousness an fightin the good fight o faith and then atop o t all they held a prayermeetin ower a young chap as wanted to list and nearly deafened him till he picked up his hat and fair ran away and theyd tell tales in th sundayschool o bad lads as had been thumped and brayed for bird nesting o sundays and playin truant o weekdays and how they took to wrestlin dogfightin rabbitrunnin and drinkin till at last as if twere a hepitaph on a gravestone they damned him across th moors wi an then he went and listed for a soldier an theyd all fetch a deep breath and throw up their eyes like a hen drinkin  fwhy is ut said mulvaney bringing down his hand on his thigh with a crack in the name av god fwhy is ut ive seen ut tu they cheat an they swindle an they lie an they slander an fifty things fifty times worse but the last an the worst by their reckonin is to serve the widdy honest its like the talk av childherseein things all round  plucky lot of fightin good fights of whatsername theyd do if we didnt see they had a quiet place to fight in and such fightin as theirs is cats on the tiles tother callin to which to come on id give a months pay to get some o them broadbacked beggars in london sweatin through a days roadmakin an a nights rain theyd carry on a deal afterwardssame as were supposed to carry on ive bin turned out of a measly arflicense pub down lambeth way full o greasy kebmen fore now said ortheris with an oath  maybe you were dhrunk said mulvaney soothingly  worse nor that the forders were drunk i was wearin the queens uniform  id no particular thought to be a soldier i them days said learoyd still keeping his eye on the bare hill opposite but this sort o talk put it i my head they was so good th chapel folk that they tumbled ower tother side but i stuck to it for lizas sake specially as she was learning me to sing the bass part in a horotorio as jesse were gettin up she sung like a throstle hersen and we had practisins night after night for a matter of three months  i know what a horotorio is said ortheris pertly its a sort of chaplains singsongwords all out of the bible and hullabaloojah choruses  most greenhow hill folks played some instrument or tother an they all sung so you might have heard them miles away and they were so pleased wi the noise they made they didnt fair to want anybody to listen the preacher sung high seconds when he wasnt playin the flute an they set me as hadnt got far with big fiddle again willie satterthwaite to jog his elbow when he had to get a gate playin old jesse was happy if ever a man was for he were th conductor an th first fiddle an th leadin singer beatin time wi his fiddlestick till at times hed rap with it on the table and cry out now you mun all stop its my turn and hed face round to his front fair sweating wi pride to sing th tenor solos but he were grandest i th choruses waggin his head flinging his arms round like a windmill and singin hisself black in the face a rare singer were jesse  yo see i was not o much account wi em all exceptin to liza roantree and i had a deal o time settin quiet at meetings and horotorio practises to hearken their talk and if it were strange to me at beginnin it got stranger still at after when i was shut on it and could study what it meaned  just after th horotorios come off liza as had allus been weakly like was took very bad i walked dr warbottoms horse up and down a deal of times while he were inside where they wouldnt let me go though i fair ached to see her  shell be better i noo ladbetter i noo he used to say tha mun ha patience then they said if i was quiet i might go in and th reverend amos barraclough used to read to her lyin propped up among th pillows then she began to mend a bit and they let me carry her on to th settle and when it got warm again she went about same as afore th preacher and me and blast was a deal together i them days and i one way we was rare good comrades but i could ha stretched him time and again with a good will i mind one day he said he would like to go down into th bowels o th earth and see how th lord had builded th framework o th everlastin hills he were one of them chaps as had a gift o sayin things they rolled off the tip of his clever tongue same as mulvaney here as would ha made a rare good preacher if he had nobbut given his mind to it i lent him a suit o miners kit as almost buried th little man and his white face down i th coatcollar and hatflap looked like the face of a boggart and he cowered down i th bottom o the waggon i was drivin a tram as led up a bit of an incline up to th cave where the engine was pumpin and where th ore was brought up and put into th waggons as went down o themselves me puttin th brake on and th horses atrottin after long as it was daylight we were good friends but when we got fair into th dark and could nobbut see th day shinin at the hole like a lamp at a street end i feeled downright wicked ma religion dropped all away from me when i looked back at him as were always comin between me and liza the talk was at they were to be wed when she got better an i couldnt get her to say yes or nay to it he began to sing a hymn in his thin voice and i came out wi a chorus that was all cussin an swearin at my horses an i began to know how i hated him he were such a little chap too i could drop him wi one hand down garstangs copperholea place where th beck slithered ower th edge on a rock and fell wi a bit of a whisper into a pit as no rope i greenhow could plump  again learoyd rooted up the innocent violets ay he should see th bowels o th earth an never naught else i could take him a mile or two along th drift and leave him wi his candle doused to cry hallelujah wi none to hear him and say amen i was to lead him down th ladderway to th drift where jesse roantree was workin and why shouldnt he slip on th ladder wi my feet on his fingers till they loosed grip and i put him down wi my heel if i went fust down th ladder i could click hold on him and chuck him over my head so as he should go squshin down the shaft breakin his bones at evry timberin as bill appleton did when he was fresh and hadnt a bone left when he wrought to th bottom niver a blasted leg to walk from pately niver an arm to put round liza roantrees waist niver no moreniver no more  the thick lips curled back over the yellow teeth and that flushed face was not pretty to look upon mulvaney nodded sympathy and ortheris moved by his comrades passion brought up the rifle to his shoulder and searched the hillside for his quarry muttering ribaldry about a sparrow a spout and a thunderstorm the voice of the watercourse supplied the necessary small talk till learoyd picked up his story  but its none so easy to kill a man like yon when id given up my horses to th lad as took my place and i was showin th preacher th workins shoutin into his ear across th clang o th pumpin engines i saw he were afraid o naught and when the lamplight showed his black eyes i could feel as he was masterin me again i were no better nor blast chained up short and growlin i the depths of him while a strange dog went safe past  thart a coward and a fool i said to mysen an i wrestled i my mind again him till when we come to garstangs copperhole i laid hold o the preacher and lifted him up over my head and held him into the darkest on it now lad i says its to be one or tother on us thee or mefor liza roantree why isnt thee afraid for thysen i says for he were still i my arms as a sack nay im but afraid for thee my poor lad as knows naught says he i set him down on th edge an th beck run stiller an there was no more buzzin in my head like when th bee come through th window o jesses house what dost tha mean says i  ive often thought as thou ought to know says he but twas hard to tell thee liza roantrees for neither on us nor for nobody o this earth dr warbottom saysand he knows her and her mother before her that she is in a decline and she cannot live six months longer hes known it for many a day steady john steady says he and that weak little man pulled me further back and set me again him and talked it all over quiet and still me turnin a bunch o candles in my hand and counting them ower and ower again as i listened a deal on it were th regular preachin talk but there were a vast lot as made me begin to think as he were more of a man than id ever given him credit for till i were cut as deep for him as i were for mysen  six candles we had and we crawled and climbed all that day while they lasted and i said to mysen liza roantree hasnt six months to live and when we came into th daylight again we were like dead men to look at an blast come behind us without so much as waggin his tail when i saw liza again she looked at me a minute and says whos telled tha for i see tha knows and she tried to smile as she kissed me and i fair broke down  yo see i was a young chap i them days and had seen naught o life let alone death as is allus awaitin she telled me as dr warbottom said as greenhow air was too keen and they were goin to bradford to jesses brother david as worked i a mill and i mun hold up like a man and a christian and shed pray for me well and they went away and the preacher that same back end o th year were appointed to another circuit as they call it and i were left alone on greenhow hill  i tried and i tried hard to stick to th chapel but twerent th same thing at after i hadnt lizas voice to follow i th singin nor her eyes ashinin acrost their heads and i th classmeetings they said as i mun have some experiences to tell and i hadnt a word to say for mysen  blast and me moped a good deal and happen we didnt behave ourselves over well for they dropped us and wondered however theyd come to take us up i cant tell how we got through th time while i th winter i gave up my job and went to bradford old jesse were at th door o th house in a long street o little houses hed been sendin th children way as were clatterin their clogs in th causeway for she were asleep  is it thee he says but youre not to see her ill none have her wakened for a nowt like thee shes goin fast and she mun go in peace thoult never be good for naught i th world and as long as thou lives thoull never play the big fiddle get away lad get away so he shut the door softly i my face  nobody never made jesse my master but it seemed to me he was about right and i went away into the town and knocked up against a recruiting sergeant the old tales o th chapel folk came buzzin into my head i was to get away and this were th regular road for the likes o me i listed there and then took th widows shillin and had a bunch o ribbons pinned i my hat  but next day i found my way to david roantrees door and jesse came to open it says he thous come back again wi th devils colours flyinthy true colours as i always telled thee  but i begged and prayed of him to let me see her nobbut to say good bye till a woman calls down th stairway she says john learoyds to come up th old man shifts aside in a flash and lays his hand on my arm quite gentle like but thoult be quiet john says he for shes rare and weak thou was allus a good lad  her eyes were all alive wi light and her hair was thick on the pillow round her but her cheeks were thinthin to frighten a man thats strong nay father yo maynt say th devils colours them ribbons is pretty an she held out her hands for th hat an she put all straight as a woman will wi ribbons nay but what theyre pretty she says eh but id ha liked to see thee i thy red coat john for thou was allus my own ladmy very own lad and none else  she lifted up her arms and they come round my neck i a gentle grip and they slacked away and she seemed fainting now yo mun get away lad says jesse and i picked up my hat and i came downstairs  th recruiting sergeant were waitin for me at th corner publichouse yove seen your sweetheart says he yes ive seen her says i well well have a quart now and youll do your best to forget her says he bein one o them smart bustlin chaps ay sergeant says i forget her and ive been forgettin her ever since  he threw away the wilted clump of white violets as he spoke ortheris suddenly rose to his knees his rifle at his shoulder and peered across the valley in the clear afternoon light his chin cuddled the stock and there was a twitching of the muscles of the right cheek as he sighted private stanley ortheris was engaged on his business a speck of white crawled up the watercourse  see that beggar    got im  seven hundred yards away and a full two hundred down the hillside the deserter of the aurangabadis pitched forward rolled down a red rock and lay very still with his face in a clump of blue gentians while a big raven flapped out of the pine wood to make investigation  thats a clean shot little man said mulvaney  learoyd thoughtfully watched the smoke clear away  happen there was a lass tewed up wi him too said he  ortheris did not reply he was staring across the valley with the smile of the artist who looks on the completed work     the man who was    the earth gave up her dead that tide       into our camp he came  and said his say and went his way       and left our hearts aflame   keep tallyon the gunbutt score       the vengeance we must take  when god shall bring full reckoning       for our dead comrades sake                         ballad  let it be clearly understood that the russian is a delightful person till he tucks in his shirt as an oriental he is charming it is only when he insists upon being treated as the most easterly of western peoples instead of the most westerly of easterns that he becomes a racial anomaly extremely difficult to handle the host never knows which side of his nature is going to turn up next  dirkovitch was a russiana russian of the russianswho appeared to get his bread by serving the czar as an officer in a cossack regiment and corresponding for a russian newspaper with a name that was never twice alike he was a handsome young oriental fond of wandering through unexplored portions of the earth and he arrived in india from nowhere in particular at least no living man could ascertain whether it was by way of balkh badakshan chitral beluchistan or nepaul or anywhere else the indian government being in an unusually affable mood gave orders that he was to be civilly treated and shown everything that was to be seen so he drifted talking bad english and worse french from one city to another till he foregathered with her majestys white hussars in the city of peshawur which stands at the mouth of that narrow swordcut in the hills that men call the khyber pass he was undoubtedly an officer and he was decorated after the manner of the russians with little enamelled crosses and he could talk and though this has nothing to do with his merits he had been given up as a hopeless task or cask by the black tyrone who individually and collectively with hot whisky and honey mulled brandy and mixed spirits of every kind had striven in all hospitality to make him drunk and when the black tyrone who are exclusively irish fail to disturb the peace of head of a foreignerthat foreigner is certain to be a superior man  the white hussars were as conscientious in choosing their wine as in charging the enemy all that they possessed including some wondrous brandy was placed at the absolute disposition of dirkovitch and he enjoyed himself hugelyeven more than among the black tyrones  but he remained distressingly european through it all the white hussars were my dear true friends fellowsoldiers glorious and brothers inseparable he would unburden himself by the hour on the glorious future that awaited the combined arms of england and russia when their hearts and their territories should run side by side and the great mission of civilising asia should begin that was unsatisfactory because asia is not going to be civilised after the methods of the west there is too much asia and she is too old you cannot reform a lady of many lovers and asia has been insatiable in her flirtations aforetime she will never attend sundayschool or learn to vote save with swords for tickets  dirkovitch knew this as well as any one else but it suited him to talk specialcorrespondently and to make himself as genial as he could now and then he volunteered a little a very little information about his own sotnia of cossacks left apparently to look after themselves somewhere at the back of beyond he had done rough work in central asia and had seen rather more helpyourself fighting than most men of his years but he was careful never to betray his superiority and more than careful to praise on all occasions the appearance drill uniform and organisation of her majestys white hussars and indeed they were a regiment to be admired when lady durgan widow of the late sir john durgan arrived in their station and after a short time had been proposed to by every single man at mess she put the public sentiment very neatly when she explained that they were all so nice that unless she could marry them all including the colonel and some majors already married she was not going to content herself with one hussar wherefore she wedded a little man in a rifle regiment being by nature contradictious and the white hussars were going to wear crape on their arms but compromised by attending the wedding in full force and lining the aisle with unutterable reproach she had jilted them allfrom bassetholmer the senior captain to little mildred the junior subaltern who could have given her four thousand a year and a title  the only persons who did not share the general regard for the white hussars were a few thousand gentlemen of jewish extraction who lived across the border and answered to the name of pathan they had once met the regiment officially and for something less than twenty minutes but the interview which was complicated with many casualties had filled them with prejudice they even called the white hussars children of the devil and sons of persons whom it would be perfectly impossible to meet in decent society yet they were not above making their aversion fill their moneybelts the regiment possessed carbinesbeautiful martini henri carbines that would lob a bullet into an enemys camp at one thousand yards and were even handier than the long rifle therefore they were coveted all along the border and since demand inevitably breeds supply they were supplied at the risk of life and limb for exactly their weight in coined silverseven and onehalf pounds weight of rupees or sixteen pounds sterling reckoning the rupee at par they were stolen at night by snakyhaired thieves who crawled on their stomachs under the nose of the sentries they disappeared mysteriously from locked armracks and in the hot weather when all the barrack doors and windows were open they vanished like puffs of their own smoke the border people desired them for family vendettas and contingencies but in the long cold nights of the northern indian winter they were stolen most extensively the traffic of murder was liveliest among the hills at that season and prices ruled high the regimental guards were first doubled and then trebled a trooper does not much care if he loses a weapongovernment must make it goodbut he deeply resents the loss of his sleep the regiment grew very angry and one riflethief bears the visible marks of their anger upon him to this hour that incident stopped the burglaries for a time and the guards were reduced accordingly and the regiment devoted itself to polo with unexpected results for it beat by two goals to one that very terrible polo corps the lushkar light horse though the latter had four ponies apiece for a short hours fight as well as a native officer who played like a lambent flame across the ground  they gave a dinner to celebrate the event the lushkar team came and dirkovitch came in the fullest full uniform of a cossack officer which is as full as a dressinggown and was introduced to the lushkars and opened his eyes as he regarded they were lighter men than the hussars and they carried themselves with the swing that is the peculiar right of the punjab frontier force and all irregular horse like everything else in the service it has to be learnt but unlike many things it is never forgotten and remains on the body till death  the great beamroofed messroom of the white hussars was a sight to be remembered all the mess plate was out on the long tablethe same table that had served up the bodies of five officers after a forgotten fight long and long agothe dingy battered standards faced the door of entrance clumps of winterroses lay between the silver candlesticks and the portraits of eminent officers deceased looked down on their successors from between the heads of sambhur nilghai markhor and pride of all the mess two grinning snowleopards that had cost basset holmer four months leave that he might have spent in england instead of on the road to thibet and the daily risk of his life by ledge snow slide and grassy slope  the servants in spotless white muslin and the crest of their regiments on the brow of their turbans waited behind their masters who were clad in the scarlet and gold of the white hussars and the cream and silver of the lushkar light horse dirkovitchs dull green uniform was the only dark spot at the board but his big onyx eyes made up for it he was fraternising effusively with the captain of the lushkar team who was wondering how many of dirkovitchs cossacks his own dark wiry down countrymen could account for in a fair charge but one does not speak of these things openly  the talk rose higher and higher and the regimental band played between the courses as is the immemorial custom till all tongues ceased for a moment with the removal of the dinnerslips and the first toast of obligation when an officer rising said mr vice the queen and little mildred from the bottom of the table answered the queen god bless her and the big spurs clanked as the big men heaved themselves up and drank the queen upon whose pay they were falsely supposed to settle their messbills that sacrament of the mess never grows old and never ceases to bring a lump into the throat of the listener wherever he be by sea or by land dirkovitch rose with his brothers glorious but he could not understand no one but an officer can tell what the toast means and the bulk have more sentiment than comprehension immediately after the little silence that follows on the ceremony there entered the native officer who had played for the lushkar team he could not of course eat with the mess but he came in at dessert all six feet of him with the blue and silver turban atop and the big black boots below the mess rose joyously as he thrust forward the hilt of his sabre in token of fealty for the colonel of the white hussars to touch and dropped into a vacant chair amid shouts of rung ho hira singh which being translated means go in and win did i whack you over the knee old man ressaidar sahib what the devil made you play that kicking pig of a pony in the last ten minutes shabash ressaidar sahib then the voice of the colonel the health of ressaidar hira singh  after the shouting had died away hira singh rose to reply for he was the cadet of a royal house the son of a kings son and knew what was due on these occasions thus he spoke in the vernacularcolonel sahib and officers of this regiment much honour have you done me this will i remember we came down from afar to play you but we were beaten no fault of yours ressaidar sahib played on our own ground yknow your ponies were cramped from the railway dont apologise therefore perhaps we will come again if it be so ordained hear hear hear indeed bravo hsh then we will play you afresh happy to meet you till there are left no feet upon our ponies thus far for sport he dropped one hand on his swordhilt and his eye wandered to dirkovitch lolling back in his chair but if by the will of god there arises any other game which is not the polo game then be assured colonel sahib and officers that we will play it out side by side though they again his eye sought dirkovitchthough they i say have fifty ponies to our one horse and with a deepmouthed rung ho that sounded like a musketbutt on flagstones he sat down amid leaping glasses  dirkovitch who had devoted himself steadily to the brandythe terrible brandy aforementioneddid not understand nor did the expurgated translations offered to him at all convey the point decidedly hira singhs was the speech of the evening and the clamour might have continued to the dawn had it not been broken by the noise of a shot without that sent every man feeling at his defenceless left side then there was a scuffle and a yell of pain  carbinestealing again said the adjutant calmly sinking back in his chair this comes of reducing the guards i hope the sentries have killed him  the feet of armed men pounded on the verandah flags and it was as though something was being dragged  why dont they put him in the cells till the morning said the colonel testily see if theyve damaged him sergeant  the mess sergeant fled out into the darkness and returned with two troopers and a corporal all very much perplexed  caught a man stealin carbines sir said the corporal leastways e was crawlin towards the barricks sir past the main road sentries an the sentry e sez sir  the limp heap of rags upheld by the three men groaned never was seen so destitute and demoralised an afghan he was turbanless shoeless caked with dirt and all but dead with rough handling hira singh started slightly at the sound of the mans pain dirkovitch took another glass of brandy  what does the sentry say said the colonel  sez e speaks english sir said the corporal  so you brought him into mess instead of handing him over to the sergeant if he spoke all the tongues of the pentecost youve no business  again the bundle groaned and muttered little mildred had risen from his place to inspect he jumped back as though he had been shot  perhaps it would be better sir to send the men away said he to the colonel for he was a much privileged subaltern he put his arms round the ragbound horror as he spoke and dropped him into a chair it may not have been explained that the littleness of mildred lay in his being six feet four and big in proportion the corporal seeing that an officer was disposed to look after the capture and that the colonels eye was beginning to blaze promptly removed himself and his men the mess was left alone with the carbinethief who laid his head on the table and wept bitterly hopelessly and inconsolably as little children weep  hira singh leapt to his feet colonel sahib said he that man is no afghan for they weep ai ai nor is he of hindustan for they weep oh ho he weeps after the fashion of the white men who say ow ow  now where the dickens did you get that knowledge hira singh said the captain of the lushkar team  hear him said hira singh simply pointing at the crumpled figure that wept as though it would never cease  he said my god said little mildred i heard him say it  the colonel and the messroom looked at the man in silence it is a horrible thing to hear a man cry a woman can sob from the top of her palate or her lips or anywhere else but a man must cry from his diaphragm and it rends him to pieces  poor devil said the colonel coughing tremendously we ought to send him to hospital hes been manhandled  now the adjutant loved his carbines they were to him as his grandchildren the men standing in the first place he grunted rebelliously i can understand an afghan stealing because hes built that way but i cant understand his crying that makes it worse  the brandy must have affected dirkovitch for he lay back in his chair and stared at the ceiling there was nothing special in the ceiling beyond a shadow as of a huge black coffin owing to some peculiarity in the construction of the messroom this shadow was always thrown when the candles were lighted it never disturbed the digestion of the white hussars they were in fact rather proud of it  is he going to cry all night said the colonel or are we supposed to sit up with little mildreds guest until he feels better  the man in the chair threw up his head and stared at the mess oh my god he said and every soul in the mess rose to his feet then the lushkar captain did a deed for which he ought to have been given the victoria crossdistinguished gallantry in a fight against overwhelming curiosity he picked up his team with his eyes as the hostess picks up the ladies at the opportune moment and pausing only by the colonels chair to say this isnt our affair you know sir led them into the verandah and the gardens hira singh was the last to go and he looked at dirkovitch but dirkovitch had departed into a brandyparadise of his own his lips moved without sound and he was studying the coffin on the ceiling  whitewhite all over said bassetholmer the adjutant what a pernicious renegade he must be i wonder where he came from  the colonel shook the man gently by the arm and who are you said he  there was no answer the man stared round the messroom and smiled in the colonels face little mildred who was always more of a woman than a man till boot and saddle was sounded repeated the question in a voice that would have drawn confidences from a geyser the man only smiled dirkovitch at the far end of the table slid gently from his chair to the floor  no son of adam in this present imperfect world can mix the hussars champagne with the hussars brandy by five and eight glasses of each without remembering the pit whence he was digged and descending thither the band began to play the tune with which the white hussars from the date of their formation have concluded all their functions they would sooner be disbanded than abandon that tune it is a part of their system the man straightened himself in his chair and drummed on the table with his fingers  i dont see why we should entertain lunatics said the colonel call a guard and send him off to the cells well look into the business in the morning give him a glass of wine first though  little mildred filled a sherryglass with the brandy and thrust it over to the man he drank and the tune rose louder and he straightened himself yet more then he put out his longtaloned hands to a piece of plate opposite and fingered it lovingly there was a mystery connected with that piece of plate in the shape of a spring which converted what was a sevenbranched candlestick three springs on each side and one in the middle into a sort of wheelspoke candelabrum he found the spring pressed it and laughed weakly he rose from his chair and inspected a picture on the wall then moved on to another picture the mess watching him without a word when he came to the mantelpiece he shook his head and seemed distressed a piece of plate representing a mounted hussar in full uniform caught his eye he pointed to it and then to the mantelpiece with inquiry in his eyes  what is itoh what is it said little mildred then as a mother might speak to a child that is a horse yes a horse  very slowly came the answer in a thick passionless gutturalyes i have seen butwhere is the horse  you could have heard the hearts of the mess beating as the men drew back to give the stranger full room in his wanderings there was no question of calling the guard  again he spokevery slowly where is our horse  there is but one horse in the white hussars and his portrait hangs outside the door of the messroom he is the piebald drumhorse the king of the regimental band that served the regiment for sevenand thirty years and in the end was shot for old age half the mess tore the thing down from its place and thrust it into the mans hands he placed it above the mantelpiece it clattered on the ledge as his poor hands dropped it and he staggered towards the bottom of the table falling into mildreds chair then all the men spoke to one another something after this fashion the drumhorse hasnt hung over the mantelpiece since 67 how does he know mildred go and speak to him again colonel what are you going to do oh dry up and give the poor devil a chance to pull himself together it isnt possible anyhow the mans a lunatic  little mildred stood at the colonels side talking in his ear will you be good enough to take your seats please gentlemen he said and the mess dropped into the chairs only dirkovitchs seat next to little mildreds was blank and little mildred himself had found hira singhs place the wideeyed messsergeant filled the glasses in deep silence once more the colonel rose but his hand shook and the port spilled on the table as he looked straight at the man in little mildreds chair and said hoarsely mr vice the queen there was a little pause but the man sprung to his feet and answered without hesitation the queen god bless her and as he emptied the thin glass he snapped the shank between his fingers  long and long ago when the empress of india was a young woman and there were no unclean ideals in the land it was the custom of a few messes to drink the queens toast in broken glass to the vast delight of the messcontractors the custom is now dead because there is nothing to break anything for except now and again the word of a government and that has been broken already  that settles it said the colonel with a gasp hes not a sergeant what in the world is he  the entire mess echoed the word and the volley of questions would have scared any man it was no wonder that the ragged filthy invader could only smile and shake his head  from under the table calm and smiling rose dirkovitch who had been roused from healthful slumber by feet upon his body by the side of the man he rose and the man shrieked and grovelled it was a horrible sight coming so swiftly upon the pride and glory of the toast that had brought the strayed wits together  dirkovitch made no offer to raise him but little mildred heaved him up in an instant it is not good that a gentleman who can answer to the queens toast should lie at the feet of a subaltern of cossacks  the hasty action tore the wretchs upper clothing nearly to the waist and his body was seamed with dry black scars there is only one weapon in the world that cuts in parallel lines and it is neither the cane nor the cat dirkovitch saw the marks and the pupils of his eyes dilated also his face changed he said something that sounded like shto ve takete and the man fawning answered chetyre  whats that said everybody together  his number that is number four you know dirkovitch spoke very thickly  what has a queens officer to do with a qualified number said the colonel and an unpleasant growl ran round the table  how can i tell said the affable oriental with a sweet smile he is ahow you have itescaperunaway from over there he nodded towards the darkness of the night  speak to him if hell answer you and speak to him gently said little mildred settling the man in a chair it seemed most improper to all present that dirkovitch should sip brandy as he talked in purring spitting russian to the creature who answered so feebly and with such evident dread but since dirkovitch appeared to understand no one said a word all breathed heavily leaning forward in the long gaps of the conversation the next time that they have no engagements on hand the white hussars intend to go to st petersburg in a body to learn russian  he does not know how many years ago said dirkovitch facing the mess but he says it was very long ago in a war i think that there was an accident he says he was of this glorious and distinguished regiment in the war  the rolls the rolls holmer get the rolls said little mildred and the adjutant dashed off bareheaded to the orderlyroom where the musterrolls of the regiment were kept he returned just in time to hear dirkovitch conclude therefore my dear friends i am most sorry to say there was an accident which would have been reparable if he had apologised to that our colonel which he had insulted  then followed another growl which the colonel tried to beat down the mess was in no mood just then to weigh insults to russian colonels  he does not remember but i think that there was an accident and so he was not exchanged among the prisoners but he was sent to another place how do you saythe country so he says he came here he does not know how he came eh he was at chepanythe man caught the word nodded and shiveredat zhigansk and irkutsk i cannot understand how he escaped he says too that he was in the forests for many years but how many years he has forgottenthat with many things it was an accident done because he did not apologise to that our colonel ah  instead of echoing dirkovitchs sigh of regret it is sad to record that the white hussars livelily exhibited unchristian delight and other emotions hardly restrained by their sense of hospitality holmer flung the frayed and yellow regimental rolls on the table and the men flung themselves at these  steady fiftysixfiftyfivefiftyfour said holmer here we are lieutenant austin limmason missing that was before sebastopol what an infernal shame insulted one of their colonels and was quietly shipped off thirty years of his life wiped out  but he never apologised said hed see him damned first chorused the mess  poor chap i suppose he never had the chance afterwards how did he come here said the colonel  the dingy heap in the chair could give no answer  do you know who you are  it laughed weakly  do you know that you are limmasonlieutenant limmason of the white hussars  swiftly as a shot came the answer in a slightly surprised tone yes im limmason of course the light died out in his eyes and the man collapsed watching every motion of dirkovitch with terror a flight from siberia may fix a few elementary facts in the mind but it does not seem to lead to continuity of thought the man could not explain how like a homing pigeon he had found his way to his own old mess again of what he had suffered or seen he knew nothing he cringed before dirkovitch as instinctively as he had pressed the spring of the candlestick sought the picture of the drumhorse and answered to the toast of the queen the rest was a blank that the dreaded russian tongue could only in part remove his head bowed on his breast and he giggled and cowered alternately  the devil that lived in the brandy prompted dirkovitch at this extremely inopportune moment to make a speech he rose swaying slightly gripped the tableedge while his eyes glowed like opals and began  fellowsoldiers glorioustrue friends and hospitables it was an accident and deplorablemost deplorable here he smiled sweetly all round the mess but you will think of this little little thing so little is it not the czar posh i slap my fingersi snap my fingers at him do i believe in him no but in us slav who has done nothing him i believe seventyhow muchmillions peoples that have done nothingnot one thing posh napoleon was an episode he banged a hand on the table hear you old peoples we have done nothing in the world out here all our work is to do and it shall be done old peoples get away he waved his hand imperiously and pointed to the man you see him he is not good to see he was just one littleoh so little accident that no one remembered now he is that so will you be brothersoldiers so braveso will you be but you will never come back you will all go where he is gone orhe pointed to the great coffin shadow on the ceiling and muttering seventy millionsget away you old peoples fell asleep  sweet and to the point said little mildred whats the use of getting wroth lets make this poor devil comfortable  but that was a matter suddenly and swiftly taken from the loving hands of the white hussars the lieutenant had returned only to go away again three days later when the wail of the dead march and the tramp of the squadrons told the wondering station who saw no gap in the messtable that an officer of the regiment had resigned his newfound commission  and dirkovitch bland supple and always genial went away too by a night train little mildred and another man saw him off for he was the guest of the mess and even had he smitten the colonel with the open hand the law of that mess allowed no relaxation of hospitality  goodbye dirkovitch and a pleasant journey said little mildred  au revoir said the russian  indeed but we thought you were going home  yes but i will come again my dear friends is that road shut he pointed to where the north star burned over the khyber pass  by jove i forgot of course happy to meet you old man any time you like got everything you want cheroots ice bedding thats all right well au revoir dirkovitch  um said the other man as the taillights of the train grew small ofalltheunmitigated  little mildred answered nothing but watched the north star and hummed a selection from a recent simla burlesque that had much delighted the white hussars it ran       im sorry for mister bluebeard      im sorry to cause him pain      but a terrible spree theres sure to be      when he comes back again     the head of the district       theres a convict more in the central jail        behind the old mud wall      theres a lifter less on the border trail        and the queens peace over all                                     dear boys      the queens peace over all      for we must bear our leaders blame        on us the shame will fall      if we lift our hand from a fettered land        and the queens peace over all                                     dear boys      the queens peace over all                       the running of shindand  i  the indus had risen in flood without warning last night it was a fordable shallow tonight five miles of raving muddy water parted bank and caving bank and the river was still rising under the moon a litter borne by six bearded men all unused to the work stopped in the white sand that bordered the whiter plain  its gods will they said we dare not cross tonight even in a boat let us light a fire and cook food we be tired men  they looked at the litter inquiringly within the deputy commissioner of the kotkumharsen district lay dying of fever they had brought him across country six fightingmen of a frontier clan that he had won over to the paths of a moderate righteousness when he had broken down at the foot of their inhospitable hills and tallantire his assistant rode with them heavyhearted as heavyeyed with sorrow and lack of sleep he had served under the sick man for three years and had learned to love him as men associated in toil of the hardest learn to loveor hate dropping from his horse he parted the curtains of the litter and peered inside  ordeorde old man can you hear we have to wait till the river goes down worse luck  i hear returned a dry whisper wait till the river goes down i thought we should reach camp before the dawn polly knows shell meet me  one of the littermen stared across the river and caught a faint twinkle of light on the far side he whispered to tallantire there are his campfires and his wife they will cross in the morning for they have better boats can he live so long  tallantire shook his head yardleyorde was very near to death what need to vex his soul with hopes of a meeting that could not be the river gulped at the banks brought down a cliff of sand and snarled the more hungrily the littermen sought for fuel in the wastedried camel thorn and refuse of the camps that had waited at the ford their sword belts clinked as they moved softly in the haze of the moonlight and tallantires horse coughed to explain that he would like a blanket  im cold too said the voice from the litter i fancy this is the end poor polly  tallantire rearranged the blankets khoda dad khan seeing this stripped off his own heavywadded sheepskin coat and added it to the pile i shall be warm by the fire presently said he tallantire took the wasted body of his chief into his arms and held it against his breast perhaps if they kept him very warm orde might live to see his wife once more if only blind providence would send a threefoot fall in the river  thats better said orde faintly sorry to be a nuisance but isis there anything to drink  they gave him milk and whisky and tallantire felt a little warmth against his own breast orde began to mutter  it isnt that i mind dying he said its leaving polly and the district thank god we have no children dick you know im dipped awfully dippeddebts in my first five years service it isnt much of a pension but enough for her she has her mother at home getting there is the difficulty andandyou see not being a soldiers wife  well arrange the passage home of course said tallantire quietly  its not nice to think of sending round the hat but good lord how many men i lie here and remember that had to do it mortens deadhe was of my year shaughnessy is dead and he had children i remember he used to read us their schoolletters what a bore we thought him evans is deadkotkumharsen killed him ricketts of myndonie is deadand im going too man that is born of a woman is small potatoes and few in the hill that reminds me dick the four khusru kheyl villages in our border want a onethird remittance this spring thats fair their crops are bad see that they get it and speak to ferris about the canal i should like to have lived till that was finished it means so much for the northindus villagesbut ferris is an idle beggarwake him up youll have charge of the district till my successor comes i wish they would appoint you permanently you know the folk i suppose it will be bullows though good man but too weak for frontier work and he doesnt understand the priests the blind priest at jagai will bear watching youll find it in my papersin the uniformcase i think call the khusru kheyl men up ill hold my last public audience khoda dad khan  the leader of the men sprang to the side of the litter his companions following  men im dying said orde quickly in the vernacular and soon there will be no more orde sahib to twist your tails and prevent you from raiding cattle  god forbid this thing broke out the deep bass chorus the sahib is not going to die  yes he is and then he will know whether mahomed speaks truth or moses but you must be good men when i am not here such of you as live in our borders must pay your taxes quietly as before i have spoken of the villages to be gently treated this year such of you as live in the hills must refrain from cattlelifting and burn no more thatch and turn a deaf ear to the voice of the priests who not knowing the strength of the government would lead you into foolish wars wherein you will surely die and your crops be eaten by strangers and you must not sack any caravans and must leave your arms at the policepost when you come in as has been your custom and my order and tallantire sahib will be with you but i do not know who takes my place i speak now true talk for i am as it were already dead my childrenfor though ye be strong men ye are children  and thou art our father and our mother broke in khoda dad khan with an oath what shall we do now there is no one to speak for us or to teach us to go wisely  there remains tallantire sahib go to him he knows your talk and your heart keep the young men quiet listen to the old men and obey khoda dad khan take my ring the watch and chain go to thy brother keep those things for my sake and i will speak to whatever god i may encounter and tell him that the khusru kheyl are good men ye have my leave to go  khoda dad khan the ring upon his finger choked audibly as he caught the wellknown formula that closed an interview his brother turned to look across the river the dawn was breaking and a speck of white showed on the dull silver of the stream she comes said the man under his breath can he live for another two hours and he pulled the newlyacquired watch out of his belt and looked uncomprehendingly at the dial as he had seen englishmen do  for two hours the bellying sail tacked and blundered up and down the river tallantire still clasping orde in his arms and khoda dad khan chafing his feet he spoke now and again of the district and his wife but as the end neared more frequently of the latter they hoped he did not know that she was even then risking her life in a crazy native boat to regain him but the awful foreknowledge of the dying deceived them wrenching himself forward orde looked through the curtains and saw how near was the sail thats polly he said simply though his mouth was wried with agony polly andthe grimmest practical joke ever played on a man dickyoullhavetoexplain  and an hour later tallantire met on the bank a woman in a gingham ridinghabit and a sunhat who cried out to him for her husbandher boy and her darlingwhile khoda dad khan threw himself facedown on the sand and covered his eyes  ii  the very simplicity of the notion was its charm what more easy to win a reputation for farseeing statesmanship originality and above all deference to the desires of the people than by appointing a child of the country to the rule of that country two hundred millions of the most loving and grateful folk under her majestys dominion would laud the fact and their praise would endure for ever yet he was indifferent to praise or blame as befitted the very greatest of all the viceroys his administration was based upon principle and the principle must be enforced in season and out of season his pen and tongue had created the new india teeming with possibilitiesloudvoiced insistent a nation among nationsall his very own wherefore the very greatest of all the viceroys took another step in advance and with it counsel of those who should have advised him on the appointment of a successor to yardley orde there was a gentleman and a member of the bengal civil service who had won his place and a university degree to boot in fair and open competition with the sons of the english he was cultured of the world and if report spoke truly had wisely and above all sympathetically ruled a crowded district in southeastern bengal he had been to england and charmed many drawingrooms there his name if the viceroy recollected aright was mr grish chunder de m a in short did anybody see any objection to the appointment always on principle of a man of the people to rule the people the district in southeastern bengal might with advantage he apprehended pass over to a younger civilian of mr g c des nationality who had written a remarkably clever pamphlet on the political value of sympathy in administration and mr g c de could be transferred northward to kotkumharsen the viceroy was averse on principle to interfering with appointments under control of the provincial governments he wished it to be understood that he merely recommended and advised in this instance as regarded the mere question of race mr grish chunder de was more english than the english and yet possessed of that peculiar sympathy and insight which the best among the best service in the world could only win to at the end of their service  the stern blackbearded kings who sit about the councilboard of india divided on the step with the inevitable result of driving the very greatest of all the viceroys into the borders of hysteria and a bewildered obstinacy pathetic as that of a child  the principle is sound enough said the wearyeyed head of the red provinces in which kotkumharsen lay for he too held theories the only difficulty is  put the screw on the district officials brigade de with a very strong deputy commissioner on each side of him give him the best assistant in the province rub the fear of god into the people beforehand and if anything goes wrong say that his colleagues didnt back him up all these lovely little experiments recoil on the districtofficer in the end said the knight of the drawn sword with a truthful brutality that made the head of the red provinces shudder and on a tacit understanding of this kind the transfer was accomplished as quietly as might be for many reasons  it is sad to think that what goes for public opinion in india did not generally see the wisdom of the viceroys appointment there were not lacking indeed hireling organs notoriously in the pay of a tyrannous bureaucracy who more than hinted that his excellency was a fool a dreamer of dreams a doctrinaire and worst of all a trifler with the lives of men the viceroys excellence gazette published in calcutta was at pains to thank our beloved viceroy for once more and again thus gloriously vindicating the potentialities of the bengali nations for extended executive and administrative duties in foreign parts beyond our ken we do not at all doubt that our excellent fellowtownsman mr grish chunder de esq m a will uphold the prestige of the bengali notwithstanding what underhand intrigue and peshbundi may be set on foot to insidiously nip his fame and blast his prospects among the proud civilians some of which will now have to serve under a despised native and take orders too how will you like that misters we entreat our beloved viceroy still to substantiate himself superiorly to race prejudice and colourblindness and to allow the flower of this now our civil service all the full pays and allowances granted to his more fortunate brethren  iii  when does this man take over charge im alone just now and i gather that im to stand fast under him  would you have cared for a transfer said bullows keenly then laying his hand on tallantires shoulder were all in the same boat dont desert us and yet why the devil should you stay if you can get another charge  it was ordes said tallantire simply  well its des now hes a bengali of the bengalis crammed with code and case law a beautiful man so far as routine and deskwork go and pleasant to talk to they naturally have always kept him in his own home district where all his sisters and his cousins and his aunts lived somewhere south of dacca he did no more than turn the place into a pleasant little family preserve allowed his subordinates to do what they liked and let everybody have a chance at the shekels consequently hes immensely popular down there  ive nothing to do with that how on earth am i to explain to the district that they are going to be governed by a bengali do youdoes the government i meansuppose that the khusru kheyl will sit quiet when they once know what will the mahomedan heads of villages say how will the policemuzbi sikhs and pathanshow will they work under him we couldnt say anything if the government appointed a sweeper but my people will say a good deal you know that its a piece of cruel folly  my dear boy i know all that and more ive represented it and have been told that i am exhibiting culpable and puerile prejudice by jove if the khusru kheyl dont exhibit something worse than that i dont know the border the chances are that you will have the district alight on your hands and i shall have to leave my work and help you pull through i neednt ask you to stand by the bengali man in every possible way youll do that for your own sake  for ordes i cant say that i care twopence personally  dont be an ass its grievous enough god knows and the government will know later on but thats no reason for your sulking you must try to run the district you must stand between him and as much insult as possible you must show him the ropes you must pacify the khusru kheyl and just warn curbar of the police to look out for trouble by the way im always at the end of a telegraphwire and willing to peril my reputation to hold the district together youll lose yours of course if you keep things straight and he isnt actually beaten with a stick when hes on tour hell get all the credit if anything goes wrong youll be told that you didnt support him loyally  i know what ive got to do said tallantire wearily and im going to do it but its hard  the work is with us the event is with allahas orde used to say when he was more than usually in hot water and bullows rode away  that two gentlemen in her majestys bengal civil service should thus discuss a third also in that service and a cultured and affable man withal seems strange and saddening yet listen to the artless babble of the blind mullah of jagai the priest of the khusru kheyl sitting upon a rock overlooking the border five years before a chancehurled shell from a screwgun battery had dashed earth in the face of the mullah then urging a rush of ghazis against half a dozen british bayonets so he became blind and hated the english none the less for the little accident yardleyorde knew his failing and had many times laughed at him therefor  dogs you are said the blind mullah to the listening tribesmen round the fire whipped dogs because you listened to orde sahib and called him father and behaved as his children the british government have proven how they regard you orde sahib ye know is dead  ai ai ai said half a dozen voices  he was a man comes now in his stead whom think ye a bengali of bengalan eater of fish from the south  a lie said khoda dad khan and but for the small matter of thy priesthood id drive my gun buttfirst down thy throat  oho art thou there lickspittle of the english go in tomorrow across the border to pay service to orde sahibs successor and thou shalt slip thy shoes at the tentdoor of a bengali as thou shalt hand thy offering to a bengalis black fist this i know and in my youth when a young man spoke evil to a mullah holding the doors of heaven and hell the gunbutt was not rammed down the mullahs gullet no  the blind mullah hated khoda dad khan with afghan hatred both being rivals for the headship of the tribe but the latter was feared for bodily as the other for spiritual gifts khoda dad khan looked at ordes ring and grunted i go in tomorrow because i am not an old fool preaching war against the english if the government smitten with madness have done this then  then croaked the mullah thou wilt take out the young men and strike at the four villages within the border  or wring thy neck black raven of jehannum for a bearer of ill tidings  khoda dad khan oiled his long locks with great care put on his best bokhara belt a new turbancap and fine green shoes and accompanied by a few friends came down from the hills to pay a visit to the new deputy commissioner of kotkumharsen also he bore tributefour or five priceless gold mohurs of akbars time in a white handkerchief these the deputy commissioner would touch and remit the little ceremony used to be a sign that so far as khoda dad khans personal influence went the khusru kheyl would be good boystill the next time especially if khoda dad khan happened to like the new deputy commissioner in yardley ordes consulship his visit concluded with a sumptuous dinner and perhaps forbidden liquors certainly with some wonderful tales and great goodfellowship then khoda dad khan would swagger back to his hold vowing that orde sahib was one prince and tallantire sahib another and that whosoever went araiding into british territory would be flayed alive on this occasion he found the deputy commissioners tents looking much as usual regarding himself as privileged he strode through the open door to confont a suave portly bengali in english costume writing at a table unversed in the elevating influence of education and not in the least caring for university degrees khoda dad khan promptly set the man down for a babuthe native clerk of the deputy commissionera hated and despised animal  ugh said he cheerfully wheres your master babujee  i am the deputy commissioner said the gentleman in english now he overvalued the effects of university degrees and stared khoda dad khan in the face but if from your earliest infancy you have been accustomed to look on battle murder and sudden death if spilt blood affects your nerves as much as red paint and above all if you have faithfully believed that the bengali was the servant of all hindustan and that all hindustan was vastly inferior to your own large lustful self you can endure even though uneducated a very large amount of looking over you can even stare down a graduate of an oxford college if the latter has been born in a hothouse of stock bred in a hothouse and fearing physical pain as some men fear sin especially if your opponents mother has frightened him to sleep in his youth with horrible stories of devils inhabiting afghanistan and dismal legends of the black north the eyes behind the gold spectacles sought the floor khoda dad khan chuckled and swung out to find tallantire hard by here said he roughly thrusting the coins before him touch and remit that answers for my good behaviour but o sahib has the government gone mad to send a black bengali dog to us and am i to pay service to such an one and are you to work under him what does it mean it is an order said tallantire he had expected something of this kind he is a very clever ssahib  he a sahib hes a kala admia black manunfit to run at the tail of a potters donkey all the peoples of the earth have harried bengal it is written thou knowest when we of the north wanted women or plunder whither went we to bengalwhere else what childs talk is this of sahibdomafter orde sahib too of a truth the blind mullah was right  what of him asked tallantire uneasily he mistrusted that old man with his dead eyes and his deadly tongue  nay now because of the oath that i sware to orde sahib when we watched him die by the river yonder i will tell in the first place is it true that the english have set the heel of the bengali on their own neck and that there is no more english rule in the land  i am here said tallantire and i serve the maharanee of england  the mullah said otherwise and further that because we loved orde sahib the government sent us a pig to show that we were dogs who till now have been held by the strong hand also that they were taking away the white soldiers that more hindustanis might come and that all was changing  this is the worst of illconsidered handling of a very large country what looks so feasible in calcutta so right in bombay so unassailable in madras is misunderstood by the north and entirely changes its complexion on the banks of the indus khoda dad khan explained as clearly as he could that though he himself intended to be good he really could not answer for the more reckless members of his tribe under the leadership of the blind mullah they might or they might not give trouble but they certainly had no intention whatever of obeying the new deputy commissioner was tallantire perfectly sure that in the event of any systematic borderraiding the force in the district could put it down promptly  tell the mullah if he talks any more fools talk said tallantire curtly that he takes his men on to certain death and his tribe to blockade trespassfine and bloodmoney but why do i talk to one who no longer carries weight in the counsels of the tribe  khoda dad khan pocketed that insult he had learned something that he much wanted to know and returned to his hills to be sarcastically complimented by the mullah whose tongue raging round the campfires was deadlier flame than ever dungcake fed  iv  be pleased to consider here for a moment the unknown district of kot kumharsen it lay cut lengthways by the indus under the line of the khusru hillsramparts of useless earth and tumbled stone it was seventy miles long by fifty broad maintained a population of something less than two hundred thousand and paid taxes to the extent of forty thousand pounds a year on an area that was by rather more than half sheer hopeless waste the cultivators were not gentle people the miners for salt were less gentle still and the cattlebreeders least gentle of all a policepost in the top righthand corner and a tiny mud fort in the top lefthand corner prevented as much saltsmuggling and cattlelifting as the influence of the civilians could not put down and in the bottom righthand corner lay jumala the district headquartersa pitiful knot of limewashed barns facetiously rented as houses reeking with frontier fever leaking in the rain and ovens in the summer  it was to this place that grish chunder de was travelling there formally to take over charge of the district but the news of his coming had gone before bengalis were as scarce as poodles among the simple borderers who cut each others heads open with their long spades and worshipped impartially at hindu and mahomedan shrines they crowded to see him pointing at him and diversely comparing him to a gravid milch buffalo or a brokendown horse as their limited range of metaphor prompted they laughed at his policeguard and wished to know how long the burly sikhs were going to lead bengali apes they inquired whether he had brought his women with him and advised him explicitly not to tamper with theirs it remained for a wrinkled hag by the roadside to slap her lean breasts as he passed crying i have suckled six that could have eaten six thousand of him the government shot them and made this that a king whereat a blueturbaned hugeboned ploughmender shouted have hope mother o mine he may yet go the way of thy wastrels and the children the little brown puffballs regarded curiously it was generally a good thing for infancy to stray into orde sahibs tent where copper coins were to be won for the mere wishing and tales of the most authentic such as even their mothers knew but the first half of no this fat black man could never tell them how pir prith hauled the eyeteeth out of ten devils how the big stones came to lie all in a row on top of the khusru hills and what happened if you shouted through the villagegate to the gray wolf at even badl khas is dead meantime grish chunder de talked hastily and much to tallantire after the manner of those who are more english than the englishof oxford and home with much curious bookknowledge of bumpsuppers cricketmatches huntingruns and other unholy sports of the alien we must get these fellows in hand he said once or twice uneasily get them well in hand and drive them on a tight rein no use you know being slack with your district  and a moment later tallantire heard debendra nath de who brotherliwise had followed his kinsmans fortune and hoped for the shadow of his protection as a pleader whisper in bengali better are dried fish at dacca than drawn swords at delhi brother of mine these men are devils as our mother said and you will always have to ride upon a horse  that night there was a public audience in a brokendown little town thirty miles from jumala when the new deputy commissioner in reply to the greetings of the subordinate native officials delivered a speech it was a carefully thoughtout speech which would have been very valuable had not his third sentence begun with three innocent words hamara hookum haiit is my order then there was a laugh clear and belllike from the back of the big tent where a few border landholders sat and the laugh grew and scorn mingled with it and the lean keen face of debendra nath de paled and grish chunder turning to tallantire spake youyou put up this arrangement upon that instant the noise of hoofs rang without and there entered curbar the district superintendent of police sweating and dusty the state had tossed him into a corner of the province for seventeen weary years there to check smuggling of salt and to hope for promotion that never came he had forgotten how to keep his white uniform clean had screwed rusty spurs into patentleather shoes and clothed his head indifferently with a helmet or a turban soured old worn with heat and cold he waited till he should be entitled to sufficient pension to keep him from starving  tallantire said he disregarding grish chunder de come outside i want to speak to you they withdrew its this continued curbar the khusru kheyl have rushed and cut up half a dozen of the coolies on ferriss new canalembankment killed a couple of men and carried off a woman i wouldnt trouble you about thatferris is after them and hugonin my assistant with ten mounted police but thats only the beginning i fancy their fires are out on the hassan ardeb heights and unless were pretty quick therell be a flareup all along our border they are sure to raid the four khusru villages on our side of the line theres been bad blood between them for years and you know the blind mullah has been preaching a holy war since orde went out whats your notion  damn said tallantire thoughtfully theyve begun quick well it seems to me id better ride off to fort ziar and get what men i can there to picket among the lowland villages if its not too late tommy dodd commands at fort ziar i think ferris and hugonin ought to teach the canalthieves a lesson andno we cant have the head of the police ostentatiously guarding the treasury you go back to the canal ill wire bullows to come into jumala with a strong policeguard and sit on the treasury they wont touch the place but it looks well  iii insist upon knowing what this means said the voice of the deputy commissioner who had followed the speakers  oh said curbar who being in the police could not understand that fifteen years of education must on principle change the bengali into a briton there has been a fight on the border and heaps of men are killed theres going to be another fight and heaps more will be killed  what for  because the teeming millions of this district dont exactly approve of you and think that under your benign rule they are going to have a good time it strikes me that you had better make arrangements i act as you know by your orders what do you advise  ii take you all to witness that i have not yet assumed charge of the district stammered the deputy commissioner not in the tones of the more english  ah i thought so well as i was saying tallantire your plan is sound carry it out do you want an escort  no only a decent horse but how about wiring to headquarters  i fancy from the colour of his cheeks that your superior officer will send some wonderful telegrams before the nights over let him do that and we shall have half the troops of the province coming up to see whats the trouble well run along and take care of yourselfthe khusru kheyl jab upwards from below remember ho mir khan give tallantire sahib the best of the horses and tell five men to ride to jumala with the deputy commissioner sahib bahadur there is a hurry toward  there was and it was not in the least bettered by debendra nath de clinging to a policemans bridle and demanding the shortest the very shortest way to jumala now originality is fatal to the bengali debendra nath should have stayed with his brother who rode steadfastly for jumala on the railwayline thanking gods entirely unknown to the most catholic of universities that he had not taken charge of the district and could stillhappy resource of a fertile racefall sick  and i grieve to say that when he reached his goal two policemen not devoid of rude wit who had been conferring together as they bumped in their saddles arranged an entertainment for his behoof it consisted of first one and then the other entering his room with prodigious details of war the massing of bloodthirsty and devilish tribes and the burning of towns it was almost as good said these scamps as riding with curbar after evasive afghans each invention kept the hearer at work for half an hour on telegrams which the sack of delhi would hardly have justified to every power that could move a bayonet or transfer a terrified man grish chunder de appealed telegraphically he was alone his assistants had fled and in truth he had not taken over charge of the district had the telegrams been despatched many things would have occurred but since the only signaller in jumala had gone to bed and the stationmaster after one look at the tremendous pile of paper discovered that railway regulations forbade the forwarding of imperial messages policemen ram singh and nihal singh were fain to turn the stuff into a pillow and slept on it very comfortably  tallantire drove his spurs into a rampant skewbald stallion with china blue eyes and settled himself for the fortymile ride to fort ziar knowing his district blindfold he wasted no time hunting for short cuts but headed across the richer grazingground to the ford where orde had died and been buried the dusty ground deadened the noise of his horses hoofs the moon threw his shadow a restless goblin before him and the heavy dew drenched him to the skin hillock scrub that brushed against the horses belly unmetalled road where the whiplike foliage of the tamarisks lashed his forehead illimitable levels of lowland furred with bent and speckled with drowsing cattle waste and hillock anew dragged themselves past and the skewbald was labouring in the deep sand of the indusford tallantire was conscious of no distinct thought till the nose of the dawdling ferryboat grounded on the farther side and his horse shied snorting at the white headstone of ordes grave then he uncovered and shouted that the dead might hear theyre out old man wish me luck in the chill of the dawn he was hammering with a stirrupiron at the gate of fort ziar where fifty sabres of that tattered regiment the belooch beshaklis were supposed to guard her majestys interests along a few hundred miles of border this particular fort was commanded by a subaltern who born of the ancient family of the derouletts naturally answered to the name of tommy dodd him tallantire found robed in a sheepskin coat shaking with fever like an aspen and trying to read the native apothecarys list of invalids  so youve come too said he well were all sick here and i dont think i can horse thirty men but were bubbubbub blessed willing stop does this impress you as a trap or a lie he tossed a scrap of paper to tallantire on which was written painfully in crabbed gurmukhi we cannot hold young horses they will feed after the moon goes down in the four border villages issuing from the jagai pass on the next night then in english round handyour sincere friend  good man said tallantire thats khoda dad khans work i know its the only piece of english he could ever keep in his head and he is immensely proud of it he is playing against the blind mullah for his own handthe treacherous young ruffian  dont know the politics of the khusru kheyl but if youre satisfied i am that was pitched in over the gatehead last night and i thought we might pull ourselves together and see what was on oh but were sick with fever here and no mistake is this going to be a big business think you said tommy dodd  tallantire gave him briefly the outlines of the case and tommy dodd whistled and shook with fever alternately that day he devoted to strategy the art of war and the enlivenment of the invalids till at dusk there stood ready fortytwo troopers lean worn and dishevelled whom tommy dodd surveyed with pride and addressed thus o men if you die you will go to hell therefore endeavour to keep alive but if you go to hell that place cannot be hotter than this place and we are not told that we shall there suffer from fever consequently be not afraid of dying file out there they grinned and went  v  it will be long ere the khusru kheyl forget their night attack on the lowland villages the mullah had promised an easy victory and unlimited plunder but behold armed troopers of the queen had risen out of the very earth cutting slashing and riding down under the stars so that no man knew where to turn and all feared that they had brought an army about their ears and ran back to the hills in the panic of that flight more men were seen to drop from wounds inflicted by an afghan knife jabbed upwards and yet more from longrange carbinefire then there rose a cry of treachery and when they reached their own guarded heights they had left with some forty dead and sixty wounded all their confidence in the blind mullah on the plains below they clamoured swore and argued round the fires the women wailing for the lost and the mullah shrieking curses on the returned  then khoda dad khan eloquent and unbreathed for he had taken no part in the fight rose to improve the occasion he pointed out that the tribe owed every item of its present misfortune to the blind mullah who had lied in every possible particular and talked them into a trap it was undoubtedly an insult that a bengali the son of a bengali should presume to administer the border but that fact did not as the mullah pretended herald a general time of license and lifting and the inexplicable madness of the english had not in the least impaired their power of guarding their marches on the contrary the baffled and out generalled tribe would now just when their foodstock was lowest be blockaded from any trade with hindustan until they had sent hostages for good behaviour paid compensation for disturbance and bloodmoney at the rate of thirtysix english pounds per head for every villager that they might have slain and ye know that those lowland dogs will make oath that we have slain scores will the mullah pay the fines or must we sell our guns a low growl ran round the fires now seeing that all this is the mullahs work and that we have gained nothing but promises of paradise thereby it is in my heart that we of the khusru kheyl lack a shrine whereat to pray we are weakened and henceforth how shall we dare to cross into the madar kheyl border as has been our custom to kneel to pir sajjis tomb the madar men will fall upon us and rightly but our mullah is a holy man he has helped two score of us into paradise this night let him therefore accompany his flock and we will build over his body a dome of the blue tiles of mooltan and burn lamps at his feet every friday night he shall be a saint we shall have a shrine and there our women shall pray for fresh seed to fill the gaps in our fightingtale how think you  a grim chuckle followed the suggestion and the soft wheep wheep of unscabbarded knives followed the chuckle it was an excellent notion and met a long felt want of the tribe the mullah sprang to his feet glaring with withered eyeballs at the drawn death he could not see and calling down the curses of god and mahomed on the tribe then began a game of blind mans buff round and between the fires whereof khuruk shah the tribal poet has sung in verse that will not die  they tickled him gently under the armpit with the knifepoint he leaped aside screaming only to feel a cold blade drawn lightly over the back of his neck or a riflemuzzle rubbing his beard he called on his adherents to aid him but most of these lay dead on the plains for khoda dad khan had been at some pains to arrange their decease men described to him the glories of the shrine they would build and the little children clapping their hands cried run mullah run theres a man behind you in the end when the sport wearied khoda dad khans brother sent a knife home between his ribs wherefore said khoda dad khan with charming simplicity i am now chief of the khusru kheyl no man gainsaid him and they all went to sleep very stiff and sore  on the plain below tommy dodd was lecturing on the beauties of a cavalry charge by night and tallantire bowed on his saddle was gasping hysterically because there was a sword dangling from his wrist flecked with the blood of the khusru kheyl the tribe that orde had kept in leash so well when a rajpoot trooper pointed out that the skewbalds right ear had been taken off at the root by some blind slash of its unskilled rider tallantire broke down altogether and laughed and sobbed till tommy dodd made him lie down and rest  we must wait about till the morning said he i wired to the colonel just before we left to send a wing of the beshaklis after us hell be furious with me for monopolising the fun though those beggars in the hills wont give us any more trouble  then tell the beshaklis to go on and see what has happened to curbar on the canal we must patrol the whole line of the border youre quite sure tommy thatthat stuff waswas only the skewbalds ear  oh quite said tommy you just missed cutting off his head i saw you when we went into the mess sleep old man  noon brought two squadrons of beshaklis and a knot of furious brother officers demanding the courtmartial of tommy dodd for spoiling the picnic and a gallop across country to the canalworks where ferris curbar and hugonin were haranguing the terrorstricken coolies on the enormity of abandoning good work and high pay merely because half a dozen of their fellows had been cut down the sight of a troop of the beshaklis restored wavering confidence and the policehunted section of the khusru kheyl had the joy of watching the canalbank humming with life as usual while such of their men as had taken refuge in the watercourses and ravines were being driven out by the troopers by sundown began the remorseless patrol of the border by police and trooper most like the cowboys eternal ride round restless cattle  now said khoda dad khan to his fellows pointing out a line of twinkling fires below ye may see how far the old order changes after their horse will come the little devilguns that they can drag up to the tops of the hills and for aught i know to the clouds when we crown the hills if the tribecouncil thinks good i will go to tallantire sahibwho loves meand see if i can stave off at least the blockade do i speak for the tribe  ay speak for the tribe in gods name how those accursed fires wink do the english send their troops on the wireor is this the work of the bengali  as khoda dad khan went down the hill he was delayed by an interview with a hardpressed tribesman which caused him to return hastily for something he had forgotten then handing himself over to the two troopers who had been chasing his friend he claimed escort to tallantire sahib then with bullows at jumala the border was safe and the time for reasons in writing had begun  thank heaven said bullows that the trouble came at once of course we can never put down the reason in black and white but all india will understand and it is better to have a sharp short outbreak than five years of impotent administration inside the border it costs less grish chunder de has reported himself sick and has been transferred to his own province without any sort of reprimand he was strong on not having taken over the district  of course said tallantire bitterly well what am i supposed to have done that was wrong  oh you will be told that you exceeded all your powers and should have reported and written and advised for three weeks until the khusru kheyl could really come down in force but i dont think the authorities will dare to make a fuss about it theyve had their lesson have you seen curbars version of the affair he cant write a report but he can speak the truth  whats the use of the truth hed much better tear up the report im sick and heartbroken over it all it was so utterly unnecessaryexcept in that it rid us of that babu  entered unabashed khoda dad khan a stuffed foragenet in his hand and the troopers behind him  may you never be tired said he cheerily well sahibs that was a good fight and naim shahs mother is in debt to you tallantire sahib a clean cut they tell me through jaw wadded coat and deep into the collarbone well done but i speak for the tribe there has been a faulta great fault thou knowest that i and mine tallantire sahib kept the oath we sware to orde sahib on the banks of the indus  as an afghan keeps his knifesharp on one side blunt on the other said tallantire  the better swing in the blow then but i speak gods truth only the blind mullah carried the young men on the tip of his tongue and said that there was no more borderlaw because a bengali had been sent and we need not fear the english at all so they came down to avenge that insult and get plunder ye know what befell and how far i helped now five score of us are dead or wounded and we are all shamed and sorry and desire no further war moreover that ye may better listen to us we have taken off the head of the blind mullah whose evil counsels have led us to folly i bring it for proofand he heaved on the floor the head he will give no more trouble for i am chief now and so i sit in a higher place at all audiences yet there is an offset to this head that was another fault one of the men found that black bengali beast through whom this trouble arose wandering on horseback and weeping reflecting that he had caused loss of much good life alla dad khan whom if you choose i will tomorrow shoot whipped off this head and i bring it to you to cover your shame that ye may bury it see no man kept the spectacles though they were of gold  slowly rolled to tallantires feet the crophaired head of a spectacled bengali gentleman openeyed openmouthedthe head of terror incarnate bullows bent down yet another bloodfine and a heavy one khoda dad khan for this is the head of debendra nath the mans brother the babu is safe long since all but the fools of the khusru kheyl know that  well i care not for carrion quick meat for me the thing was under our hills asking the road to jumala and alla dad khan showed him the road to jehannum being as thou sayest but a fool remains now what the government will do to us as to the blockade  who art thou seller of dogs flesh thundered tallantire to speak of terms and treaties get hence to the hillsgo and wait there starving till it shall please the government to call thy people out for punishmentchildren and fools that ye be count your dead and be still best assured that the government will send you a man  ay returned khoda dad khan for we also be men  as he looked tallantire between the eyes he added and by god sahib may thou be that man     without benefit of clergy        before my spring i garnered autumns gain      out of her time my field was white with grain        the year gave up her secrets to my woe      forced and deflowered each sick season lay      in mystery of increase and decay      i saw the sunset ere men saw the day        who am too wise in that i should not know                              bitter waters  i  but if it be a girl  lord of my life it cannot be i have prayed for so many nights and sent gifts to sheikh badls shrine so often that i know god will give us a sona manchild that shall grow into a man think of this and be glad my mother shall be his mother till i can take him again and the mullah of the pattan mosque shall cast his nativitygod send he be born in an auspicious hourand then and then thou wilt never weary of me thy slave  since when hast thou been a slave my queen  since the beginningtill this mercy came to me how could i be sure of thy love when i knew that i had been bought with silver  nay that was the dowry i paid it to thy mother  and she has buried it and sits upon it all day long like a hen what talk is yours of dower i was bought as though i had been a lucknow dancinggirl instead of a child  art thou sorry for the sale  i have sorrowed but today i am glad thou wilt never cease to love me nowanswer my king  nevernever no  not even though the memlogthe white women of thy own bloodlove thee and remember i have watched them driving in the evening they are very fair  i have seen fireballoons by the hundred i have seen the moon and then i saw no more fireballoons  ameera clapped her hands and laughed very good talk she said then with an assumption of great stateliness it is enough thou hast my permission to departif thou wilt  the man did not move he was sitting on a low redlacquered couch in a room furnished only with a blue and white floorcloth some rugs and a very complete collection of native cushions at his feet sat a woman of sixteen and she was all but all the world in his eyes by every rule and law she should have been otherwise for he was an englishman and she a mussulmans daughter bought two years before from her mother who being left without money would have sold ameera shrieking to the prince of darkness if the price had been sufficient  it was a contract entered into with a light heart but even before the girl had reached her bloom she came to fill the greater portion of john holdens life for her and the withered hag her mother he had taken a little house overlooking the great redwalled city and foundwhen the marigolds had sprung up by the well in the courtyard and ameera had established herself according to her own ideas of comfort and her mother had ceased grumbling at the inadequacy of the cookingplaces the distance from the daily market and at matters of housekeeping in generalthat the house was to him his home any one could enter his bachelors bungalow by day or night and the life that he led there was an unlovely one in the house in the city his feet only could pass beyond the outer courtyard to the womens rooms and when the big wooden gate was bolted behind him he was king in his own territory with ameera for queen and there was going to be added to this kingdom a third person whose arrival holden felt inclined to resent it interfered with his perfect happiness it disarranged the orderly peace of the house that was his own but ameera was wild with delight at the thought of it and her mother not less so the love of a man and particularly a white man was at the best an inconstant affair but it might both women argued be held fast by a babys hands and then ameera would always say then he will never care for the white memlog i hate them alli hate them all  he will go back to his own people in time said the mother but by the blessing of god that time is yet afar off  holden sat silent on the couch thinking of the future and his thoughts were not pleasant the drawbacks of a double life are manifold the government with singular care had ordered him out of the station for a fortnight on special duty in the place of a man who was watching by the bedside of a sick wife the verbal notification of the transfer had been edged by a cheerful remark that holden ought to think himself lucky in being a bachelor and a free man he came to break the news to ameera  it is not good she said slowly but it is not all bad there is my mother here and no harm will come to meunless indeed i die of pure joy go thou to thy work and think no troublesome thoughts when the days are done i believe nay i am sure andand then i shall lay him in thy arms and thou wilt love me for ever the train goes tonight at midnight is it not go now and do not let thy heart be heavy by cause of me but thou wilt not delay in returning thou wilt not stay on the road to talk to the bold white memlog come back to me swiftly my life  as he left the courtyard to reach his horse that was tethered to the gatepost holden spoke to the whitehaired old watchman who guarded the house and bade him under certain contingencies despatch the filledup telegraphform that holden gave him it was all that could be done and with the sensations of a man who has attended his own funeral holden went away by the night mail to his exile every hour of the day he dreaded the arrival of the telegram and every hour of the night he pictured to himself the death of ameera in consequence his work for the state was not of firstrate quality nor was his temper towards his colleagues of the most amiable the fortnight ended without a sign from his home and torn to pieces by his anxieties holden returned to be swallowed up for two precious hours by a dinner at the club wherein he heard as a man hears in a swoon voices telling him how execrably he had performed the other mans duties and how he had endeared himself to all his associates then he fled on horseback through the night with his heart in his mouth there was no answer at first to his blows on the gate and he had just wheeled his horse round to kick it in when pir khan appeared with a lantern and held his stirrup  has aught occurred said holden  the news does not come from my mouth protector of the poor but he held out his shaking hand as befitted the bearer of good news who is entitled to a reward  holden hurried through the courtyard a light burned in the upper room his horse neighed in the gateway and he heard a shrill little wail that sent all the blood into the apple of his throat it was a new voice but it did not prove that ameera was alive  who is there he called up the narrow brick staircase  there was a cry of delight from ameera and then the voice of the mother tremulous with old age and pridewe be two women andthe manthyson  on the threshold of the room holden stepped on a naked dagger that was laid there to avert illluck and it broke at the hilt under his impatient heel  god is great cooed ameera in the halflight thou hast taken his misfortunes on thy head  ay but how is it with thee life of my life old woman how is it with her  she has forgotten her sufferings for joy that the child is born there is no harm but speak softly said the mother  it only needed thy presence to make me all well said ameera my king thou hast been very long away what gifts hast thou for me ah ah it is i that bring gifts this time look my life look was there ever such a babe nay i am too weak even to clear my arm from him  rest then and do not talk i am here bachari little woman  well said for there is a bond and a heelrope peecharee between us now that nothing can break lookcanst thou see in this light he is without spot or blemish never was such a manchild ya illah he shall be a punditno a trooper of the queen and my life dost thou love me as well as ever though i am faint and sick and worn answer truly  yea i love as i have loved with all my soul lie still pearl and rest  then do not go sit by my side hereso mother the lord of this house needs a cushion bring it there was an almost imperceptible movement on the part of the new life that lay in the hollow of ameeras arm aho she said her voice breaking with love the babe is a champion from his birth he is kicking me in the side with mighty kicks was there ever such a babe and he is ours to usthine and mine put thy hand on his head but carefully for he is very young and men are unskilled in such matters  very cautiously holden touched with the tips of his fingers the downy head  he is of the faith said ameera for lying here in the nightwatches i whispered the call to prayer and the profession of faith into his ears and it is most marvellous that he was born upon a friday as i was born be careful of him my life but he can almost grip with his hands  holden found one helpless little hand that closed feebly on his finger and the clutch ran through his body till it settled about his heart till then his sole thought had been for ameera he began to realise that there was some one else in the world but he could not feel that it was a veritable son with a soul he sat down to think and ameera dozed lightly  get hence sahib said her mother under her breath it is not good that she should find you here on waking she must be still  i go said holden submissively here be rupees see that my baba gets fat and finds all that he needs  the chink of the silver roused ameera i am his mother and no hireling she said weakly shall i look to him more or less for the sake of money mother give it back i have born my lord a son  the deep sleep of weakness came upon her almost before the sentence was completed holden went down to the courtyard very softly with his heart at ease pir khan the old watchman was chuckling with delight this house is now complete he said and without further comment thrust into holdens hands the hilt of a sabre worn many years ago when he pir khan served the queen in the police the bleat of a tethered goat came from the wellkerb  there be two said pir khan two goats of the best i bought them and they cost much money and since there is no birthparty assembled their flesh will be all mine strike craftily sahib tis an ill balanced sabre at the best wait till they raise their heads from cropping the marigolds  and why said holden bewildered  for the birthsacrifice what else otherwise the child being unguarded from fate may die the protector of the poor knows the fitting words to be said  holden had learned them once with little thought that he would ever speak them in earnest the touch of the cold sabrehilt in his palm turned suddenly to the clinging grip of the child upstairsthe child that was his own sonand a dread of loss filled him  strike said pir khan never life came into the world but life was paid for it see the goats have raised their heads now with a drawing cut  hardly knowing what he did holden cut twice as he muttered the mahomedan prayer that runs almighty in place of this my son i offer life for life blood for blood head for head bone for bone hair for hair skin for skin the waiting horse snorted and bounded in his pickets at the smell of the raw blood that spirted over holdens ridingboots  well smitten said pir khan wiping the sabre a swordsman was lost in thee go with a light heart heavenborn i am thy servant and the servant of thy son may the presence live a thousand years and the flesh of the goats is all mine pir khan drew back richer by a months pay holden swung himself into the saddle and rode off through the low hanging woodsmoke of the evening he was full of riotous exultation alternating with a vast vague tenderness directed towards no particular object that made him choke as he bent over the neck of his uneasy horse i never felt like this in my life he thought ill go to the club and pull myself together  a game of pool was beginning and the room was full of men holden entered eager to get to the light and the company of his fellows singing at the top of his voice      in baltimore awalking a lady i did meet  did you said the clubsecretary from his corner did she happen to tell you that your boots were wringing wet great goodness man its blood  bosh said holden picking his cue from the rack may i cut in its dew ive been riding through high crops my faith my boots are in a mess though      and if it be a girl she shall wear a weddingring      and if it be a boy he shall fight for his king      with his dirk and his cap and his little jacket blue      he shall walk the quarterdeck  yellow on bluegreen next player said the marker monotonously  he shall walk the quarterdeckam i green marker he shall walk the quarterdeckeh thats a bad shotas his daddy used to do  i dont see that you have anything to crow about said a zealous junior civilian acidly the government is not exactly pleased with your work when you relieved sanders  does that mean a wigging from headquarters said holden with an abstracted smile i think i can stand it  the talk beat up round the everfresh subject of each mans work and steadied holden till it was time to go to his dark empty bungalow where his butler received him as one who knew all his affairs holden remained awake for the greater part of the night and his dreams were pleasant ones  ii  how old is he now  ya illah what a mans question he is all but six weeks old and on this night i go up to the housetop with thee my life to count the stars for that is auspicious and he was born on a friday under the sign of the sun and it has been told to me that he will outlive us both and get wealth can we wish for aught better beloved  there is nothing better let us go up to the roof and thou shalt count the starsbut a few only for the sky is heavy with cloud  the winter rains are late and maybe they come out of season come before all the stars are hid i have put on my richest jewels  thou hast forgotten the best of all  ai ours he comes also he has never yet seen the skies  ameera climbed the narrow staircase that led to the flat roof the child placid and unwinking lay in the hollow of her right arm gorgeous in silverfringed muslin with a small skullcap on his head ameera wore all that she valued most the diamond nosestud that takes the place of the western patch in drawing attention to the curve of the nostril the gold ornament in the centre of the forehead studded with tallowdrop emeralds and flawed rubies the heavy circlet of beaten gold that was fastened round her neck by the softness of the pure metal and the chinking curbpatterned silver anklets hanging low over the rosy anklebone she was dressed in jadegreen muslin as befitted a daughter of the faith and from shoulder to elbow and elbow to wrist ran bracelets of silver tied with floss silk frail glass bangles slipped over the wrist in proof of the slenderness of the hand and certain heavy gold bracelets that had no part in her countrys ornaments but since they were holdens gift and fastened with a cunning european snap delighted her immensely  they sat down by the low white parapet of the roof overlooking the city and its lights  they are happy down there said ameera but i do not think that they are as happy as we nor do i think the white memlog are as happy and thou  i know they are not  how dost thou know  they give their children over to the nurses  i have never seen that said ameera with a sigh nor do i wish to see ahishe dropped her head on holdens shoulderi have counted forty stars and i am tired look at the child love of my life he is counting too  the baby was staring with round eyes at the dark of the heavens ameera placed him in holdens arms and he lay there without a cry  what shall we call him among ourselves she said look art thou ever tired of looking he carries thy very eyes but the mouth  is thine most dear who should know better than i  tis such a feeble mouth oh so small and yet it holds my heart between its lips give him to me now he has been too long away  nay let him lie he has not yet begun to cry  when he cries thou wilt give him backeh what a man of mankind thou art if he cried he were only the dearer to me but my life what little name shall we give him  the small body lay close to holdens heart it was utterly helpless and very soft he scarcely dared to breathe for fear of crushing it the caged green parrot that is regarded as a sort of guardianspirit in most native households moved on its perch and fluttered a drowsy wing  there is the answer said holden mian mittu has spoken he shall be the parrot when he is ready he will talk mightily and run about mian mittu is the parrot in thyin the mussulman tongue is it not  why put me so far off said ameera fretfully let it be like unto some english namebut not wholly for he is mine  then call him tota for that is likest english  ay tota and that is still the parrot forgive me my lord for a minute ago but in truth he is too little to wear all the weight of mian mittu for name he shall be totaour tota to us hearest thou o small one littlest thou art tota she touched the childs cheek and he waking wailed and it was necessary to return him to his mother who soothed him with the wonderful rhyme of are koko jare koko which says       oh crow go crow babys sleeping sound      and the wild plums grow in the jungle only a penny a pound      only a penny a pound baba only a penny a pound  reassured many times as to the price of those plums tota cuddled himself down to sleep the two sleek white wellbullocks in the courtyard were steadily chewing the cud of their evening meal old pir khan squatted at the head of holdens horse his police sabre across his knees pulling drowsily at a big waterpipe that croaked like a bull frog in a pond ameeras mother sat spinning in the lower verandah and the wooden gate was shut and barred the music of a marriageprocession came to the roof above the gentle hum of the city and a string of flyingfoxes crossed the face of the low moon  i have prayed said ameera after a long pause i have prayed for two things first that i may die in thy stead if thy death is demanded and in the second that i may die in the place of the child i have prayed to the prophet and to beebee miriam the virgin mary thinkest thou either will hear  from thy lips who would not hear the lightest word  i asked for straight talk and thou hast given me sweet talk will my prayers be heard  how can i say god is very good  of that i am not sure listen now when i die or the child dies what is thy fate living thou wilt return to the bold white memlog for kind calls to kind  not always  with a woman no with a man it is otherwise thou wilt in this life later on go back to thine own folk that i could almost endure for i should be dead but in thy very death thou wilt be taken away to a strange place and a paradise that i do not know  will it be paradise  surely for who would harm thee but we twoi and the childshall be elsewhere and we cannot come to thee nor canst thou come to us in the old days before the child was born i did not think of these things but now i think of them always it is very hard talk  it will fall as it will fall tomorrow we do not know but today and love we know well surely we are happy now  so happy that it were well to make our happiness assured and thy beebee miriam should listen to me for she is also a woman but then she would envy me it is not seemly for men to worship a woman  holden laughed aloud at ameeras little spasm of jealousy  is it not seemly why didst thou not turn me from worship of thee then  thou a worshipper and of me my king for all thy sweet words well i know that i am thy servant and thy slave and the dust under thy feet and i would not have it otherwise see  before holden could prevent her she stooped forward and touched his feet recovering herself with a little laugh she hugged tota closer to her bosom then almost savagely  is it true that the bold white memlog live for three times the length of my life is it true that they make their marriages not before they are old women  they marry as do otherswhen they are women  that i know but they wed when they are twentyfive is that true  that is true  ya illah at twentyfive who would of his own will take a wife even of eighteen she is a womanaging every hour twentyfive i shall be an old woman at that age andthose memlog remain young for ever how i hate them what have they to do with us  i cannot tell i know only that there may now be alive on this earth a woman ten years older than i who may come to thee and take thy love ten years after i am an old woman grayheaded and the nurse of totas son that is unjust and evil they should die too  now for all thy years thou art a child and shalt be picked up and carried down the staircase  tota have a care for tota my lord thou at least art as foolish as any babe ameera tucked tota out of harms way in the hollow of her neck and was carried downstairs laughing in holdens arms while tota opened his eyes and smiled after the manner of the lesser angels  he was a silent infant and almost before holden could realise that he was in the world developed into a small goldcoloured little god and unquestioned despot of the house overlooking the city those were months of absolute happiness to holden and ameerahappiness withdrawn from the world shut in behind the wooden gate that pir khan guarded by day holden did his work with an immense pity for such as were not so fortunate as himself and a sympathy for small children that amazed and amused many mothers at the little stationgatherings at nightfall he returned to ameeraameera full of the wondrous doings of tota how he had been seen to clap his hands together and move his fingers with intention and purposewhich was manifestly a miraclehow later he had of his own initiative crawled out of his low bedstead on to the floor and swayed on both feet for the space of three breaths  and they were long breaths for my heart stood still with delight said ameera  then tota took the beasts into his councilsthe wellbullocks the little gray squirrels the mongoose that lived in a hole near the well and especially mian mittu the parrot whose tail he grievously pulled and mian mittu screamed till ameera and holden arrived  o villain child of strength this to thy brother on the housetop tobah tobah fie fie but i know a charm to make him wise as suleiman and aflatoun solomon and plato now look said ameera she drew from an embroidered bag a handful of almonds see we count seven in the name of god  she placed mian mittu very angry and rumpled on the top of his cage and seating herself between the babe and the bird she cracked and peeled an almond less white than her teeth this is a true charm my life and do not laugh see i give the parrot one half and tota the other mian mittu with careful beak took his share from between ameeras lips and she kissed the other half into the mouth of the child who ate it slowly with wondering eyes this i will do each day of seven and without doubt he who is ours will be a bold speaker and wise eh tota what wilt thou be when thou art a man and i am grayheaded tota tucked his fat legs into adorable creases he could crawl but he was not going to waste the spring of his youth in idle speech he wanted mian mittus tail to tweak  when he was advanced to the dignity of a silver beltwhich with a magic square engraved on silver and hung round his neck made up the greater part of his clothinghe staggered on a perilous journey down the garden to pir khan and proffered him all his jewels in exchange for one little ride on holdens horse having seen his mothers mother chaffering with pedlars in the verandah pir khan wept and set the untried feet on his own gray head in sign of fealty and brought the bold adventurer to his mothers arms vowing that tota would be a leader of men ere his beard was grown  one hot evening while he sat on the roof between his father and mother watching the neverending warfare of the kites that the city boys flew he demanded a kite of his own with pir khan to fly it because he had a fear of dealing with anything larger than himself and when holden called him a spark he rose to his feet and answered slowly in defence of his newfound individuality humpark nahin hai hum admi hai i am no spark but a man  the protest made holden choke and devote himself very seriously to a consideration of totas future he need hardly have taken the trouble the delight of that life was too perfect to endure therefore it was taken away as many things are taken away in indiasuddenly and without warning the little lord of the house as pir khan called him grew sorrowful and complained of pains who had never known the meaning of pain ameera wild with terror watched him through the night and in the dawning of the second day the life was shaken out of him by fever the seasonal autumn fever it seemed altogether impossible that he could die and neither ameera nor holden at first believed the evidence of the little body on the bedstead then ameera beat her head against the wall and would have flung herself down the well in the garden had holden not restrained her by main force  one mercy only was granted to holden he rode to his office in broad daylight and found waiting him an unusually heavy mail that demanded concentrated attention and hard work he was not however alive to this kindness of the gods  iii  the first shock of a bullet is no more than a brisk pinch the wrecked body does not send in its protest to the soul till ten or fifteen seconds later holden realised his pain slowly exactly as he had realised his happiness and with the same imperious necessity for hiding all trace of it in the beginning he only felt that there had been a loss and that ameera needed comforting where she sat with her head on her knees shivering as mian mittu from the housetop called tota tota tota later all his world and the daily life of it rose up to hurt him it was an outrage that any one of the children at the bandstand in the evening should be alive and clamorous when his own child lay dead it was more than mere pain when one of them touched him and stories told by overfond fathers of their childrens latest performances cut him to the quick he could not declare his pain he had neither help comfort nor sympathy and ameera at the end of each weary day would lead him through the hell of selfquestioning reproach which is reserved for those who have lost a child and believe that with a littlejust a littlemore care it might have been saved  perhaps ameera would say i did not take sufficient heed did i or did i not the sun on the roof that day when he played so long alone and i wasahi braiding my hairit may be that the sun then bred the fever if i had warned him from the sun he might have lived but oh my life say that i am guiltless thou knowest that i loved him as i love thee say that there is no blame on me or i shall diei shall die  there is no blamebefore god none it was written and how could we do aught to save what has been has been let it go beloved  he was all my heart to me how can i let the thought go when my arm tells me every night that he is not here ahi ahi o tota come back to mecome back again and let us be all together as it was before  peace peace for thine own sake and for mine also if thou lovest me rest  by this i know thou dost not care and how shouldst thou the white men have hearts of stone and souls of iron oh that i had married a man of mine own peoplethough he beat meand had never eaten the bread of an alien  am i an alienmother of my son  what elsesahib oh forgive meforgive the death has driven me mad thou art the life of my heart and the light of my eyes and the breath of my life andand i have put thee from me though it was but for a moment if thou goest away to whom shall i look for help do not be angry indeed it was the pain that spoke and not thy slave  i know i know we be two who were three the greater need therefore that we should be one  they were sitting on the roof as of custom the night was a warm one in early spring and sheetlightning was dancing on the horizon to a broken tune played by faroff thunder ameera settled herself in holdens arms  the dry earth is lowing like a cow for the rain and ii am afraid it was not like this when we counted the stars but thou lovest me as much as before though a bond is taken away answer  i love more because a new bond has come out of the sorrow that we have eaten together and that thou knowest  yea i knew said ameera in a very small whisper but it is good to hear thee say so my life who art so strong to help i will be a child no more but a woman and an aid to thee listen give me my sitar and i will sing bravely  she took the light silverstudded sitar and began a song of the great hero rajah rasalu the hand failed on the strings the tune halted checked and at a low note turned off to the poor little nurseryrhyme about the wicked crow       and the wild plums grow in the jungle only a penny a pound      only a penny a pound babaonly     then came the tears and the piteous rebellion against fate till she slept moaning a little in her sleep with the right arm thrown clear of the body as though it protected something that was not there it was after this night that life became a little easier for holden the ever present pain of loss drove him into his work and the work repaid him by filling up his mind for nine or ten hours a day ameera sat alone in the house and brooded but grew happier when she understood that holden was more at ease according to the custom of women they touched happiness again but this time with caution  it was because we loved tota that he died the jealousy of god was upon us said ameera i have hung up a large black jar before our window to turn the evil eye from us and we must make no protestations of delight but go softly underneath the stars lest god find us out is that not good talk worthless one  she had shifted the accent on the word that means beloved in proof of the sincerity of her purpose but the kiss that followed the new christening was a thing that any deity might have envied they went about henceforward saying it is naught it is naught and hoping that all the powers heard  the powers were busy on other things they had allowed thirty million people four years of plenty wherein men fed well and the crops were certain and the birthrate rose year by year the districts reported a purely agricultural population varying from nine hundred to two thousand to the square mile of the overburdened earth and the member for lower tooting wandering about india in pothat and frockcoat talked largely of the benefits of british rule and suggested as the one thing needful the establishment of a duly qualified electoral system and a general bestowal of the franchise his longsuffering hosts smiled and made him welcome and when he paused to admire with pretty picked words the blossom of the bloodred dhaktree that had flowered untimely for a sign of what was coming they smiled more than ever  it was the deputy commissioner of kotkumharsen staying at the club for a day who lightly told a tale that made holdens blood run cold as he overheard the end  he wont bother any one any more never saw a man so astonished in my life by jove i thought he meant to ask a question in the house about it fellowpassenger in his shipdined next himbowled over by cholera and died in eighteen hours you neednt laugh you fellows the member for lower tooting is awfully angry about it but hes more scared i think hes going to take his enlightened self out of india  id give a good deal if he were knocked over it might keep a few vestrymen of his kidney to their own parish but whats this about cholera its full early for anything of that kind said the warden of an unprofitable saltlick  dont know said the deputy commissioner reflectively weve got locusts with us theres sporadic cholera all along the northat least were calling it sporadic for decencys sake the spring crops are short in five districts and nobody seems to know where the rains are its nearly march now i dont want to scare anybody but it seems to me that natures going to audit her accounts with a big red pencil this summer  just when i wanted to take leave too said a voice across the room  there wont be much leave this year but there ought to be a great deal of promotion ive come in to persuade the government to put my pet canal on the list of faminerelief works its an illwind that blows no good i shall get that canal finished at last  is it the old programme then said holden famine fever and cholera  oh no only local scarcity and an unusual prevalence of seasonal sickness youll find it all in the reports if you live till next year youre a lucky chap you havent got a wife to send out of harms way the hillstations ought to be full of women this year  i think youre inclined to exaggerate the talk in the bazars said a young civilian in the secretariat now i have observed  i daresay you have said the deputy commissioner but youve a great deal more to observe my son in the meantime i wish to observe to you and he drew him aside to discuss the construction of the canal that was so dear to his heart holden went to his bungalow and began to understand that he was not alone in the world and also that he was afraid for the sake of anotherwhich is the most soulsatisfying fear known to man  two months later as the deputy had foretold nature began to audit her accounts with a red pencil on the heels of the springreapings came a cry for bread and the government which had decreed that no man should die of want sent wheat then came the cholera from all four quarters of the compass it struck a pilgrimgathering of half a million at a sacred shrine many died at the feet of their god the others broke and ran over the face of the land carrying the pestilence with them it smote a walled city and killed two hundred a day the people crowded the trains hanging on to the footboards and squatting on the roofs of the carriages and the cholera followed them for at each station they dragged out the dead and the dying they died by the roadside and the horses of the englishmen shied at the corpses in the grass the rains did not come and the earth turned to iron lest man should escape death by hiding in her the english sent their wives away to the hills and went about their work coming forward as they were bidden to fill the gaps in the fightingline holden sick with fear of losing his chiefest treasure on earth had done his best to persuade ameera to go away with her mother to the himalayas  why should i go said she one evening on the roof  there is sickness and people are dying and all the white memlog have gone  all of them  allunless perhaps there remain some old scaldhead who vexes her husbands heart by running risk of death  nay who stays is my sister and thou must not abuse her for i will be a scaldhead too i am glad all the bold memlog are gone  do i speak to a woman or a babe go to the hills and i will see to it that thou goest like a queens daughter think child in a red lacquered bullockcart veiled and curtained with brass peacocks upon the pole and red cloth hangings i will send two orderlies for guard and  peace thou art the babe in speaking thus what use are those toys to me he would have patted the bullocks and played with the housings for his sake perhapsthou hast made me very englishi might have gone now i will not let the memlog run  their husbands are sending them beloved  very good talk since when hast thou been my husband to tell me what to do i have but borne thee a son thou art only all the desire of my soul to me how shall i depart when i know that if evil befall thee by the breadth of so much as my littlest fingernailis that not smalli should be aware of it though i were in paradise and here this summer thou mayest dieai janee die and in dying they might call to tend thee a white woman and she would rob me in the last of thy love  but love is not born in a moment or on a deathbed  what dost thou know of love stoneheart she would take thy thanks at least and by god and the prophet and beebee miriam the mother of thy prophet that i will never endure my lord and my love let there be no more foolish talk of going away where thou art i am it is enough she put an arm round his neck and a hand on his mouth  there are not many happinesses so complete as those that are snatched under the shadow of the sword they sat together and laughed calling each other openly by every pet name that could move the wrath of the gods the city below them was locked up in its own torments sulphur fires blazed in the streets the conches in the hindu temples screamed and bellowed for the gods were inattentive in those days there was a service in the great mahomedan shrine and the call to prayer from the minarets was almost unceasing they heard the wailing in the houses of the dead and once the shriek of a mother who had lost a child and was calling for its return in the gray dawn they saw the dead borne out through the city gates each litter with its own little knot of mourners wherefore they kissed each other and shivered  it was a red and heavy audit for the land was very sick and needed a little breathingspace ere the torrent of cheap life should flood it anew the children of immature fathers and undeveloped mothers made no resistance they were cowed and sat still waiting till the sword should be sheathed in november if it were so willed there were gaps among the english but the gaps were filled the work of superintending famine relief cholerasheds medicinedistribution and what little sanitation was possible went forward because it was so ordered  holden had been told to keep himself in readiness to move to replace the next man who should fall there were twelve hours in each day when he could not see ameera and she might die in three he was considering what his pain would be if he could not see her for three months or if she died out of his sight he was absolutely certain that her death would be demandedso certain that when he looked up from the telegram and saw pir khan breathless in the doorway he laughed aloud and said he  when there is a cry in the night and the spirit flutters into the throat who has a charm that will restore come swiftly heavenborn it is the black cholera  holden galloped to his home the sky was heavy with clouds for the longdeferred rains were near and the heat was stifling ameeras mother met him in the courtyard whimpering she is dying she is nursing herself into death she is all but dead what shall i do sahib  ameera was lying in the room in which tota had been born she made no sign when holden entered because the human soul is a very lonely thing and when it is getting ready to go away hides itself in a misty borderland where the living may not follow the black cholera does its work quietly and without explanation ameera was being thrust out of life as though the angel of death had himself put his hand upon her the quick breathing seemed to show that she was either afraid or in pain but neither eyes nor mouth gave any answer to holdens kisses there was nothing to be said or done holden could only wait and suffer the first drops of the rain began to fall on the roof and he could hear shouts of joy in the parched city  the soul came back a little and the lips moved holden bent down to listen keep nothing of mine said ameera take no hair from my head she would make thee burn it later on that flame i should feel lower stoop lower remember only that i was thine and bore thee a son though thou wed a white woman tomorrow the pleasure of receiving in thy arms thy first son is taken from thee for ever remember me when thy son is bornthe one that shall carry thy name before all men his misfortunes be on my head i bear witnessi bear witnessthe lips were forming the words on his earthat there is no god butthee beloved  then she died holden sat still and all thought was taken from him till he heard ameeras mother lift the curtain  is she dead sahib  she is dead  then i will mourn and afterwards take an inventory of the furniture in this house for that will be mine the sahib does not mean to resume it it is so little so very little sahib and i am an old woman i would like to lie softly  for the mercy of god be silent a while go out and mourn where i cannot hear  sahib she will be buried in four hours  i know the custom i shall go ere she is taken away that matter is in thy hands look to it that the bed on whichon which she lies  aha that beautiful redlacquered bed i have long desired  that the bed is left here untouched for my disposal all else in the house is thine hire a cart take everything go hence and before sunrise let there be nothing in this house but that which i have ordered thee to respect  i am an old woman i would stay at least for the days of mourning and the rains have just broken whither shall i go  what is that to me my order is that there is a going the housegear is worth a thousand rupees and my orderly shall bring thee a hundred rupees tonight  that is very little think of the carthire  it shall be nothing unless thou goest and with speed o woman get hence and leave me with my dead  the mother shuffled down the staircase and in her anxiety to take stock of the housefittings forgot to mourn holden stayed by ameeras side and the rain roared on the roof he could not think connectedly by reason of the noise though he made many attempts to do so then four sheeted ghosts glided dripping into the room and stared at him through their veils they were the washers of the dead holden left the room and went out to his horse he had come in a dead stifling calm through ankledeep dust he found the courtyard a rainlashed pond alive with frogs a torrent of yellow water ran under the gate and a roaring wind drove the bolts of the rain like buckshot against the mudwalls pir khan was shivering in his little hut by the gate and the horse was stamping uneasily in the water  i have been told the sahibs order said pir khan it is well this house is now desolate i go also for my monkeyface would be a reminder of that which has been concerning the bed i will bring that to thy house yonder in the morning but remember sahib it will be to thee a knife turning in a green wound i go upon a pilgrimage and i will take no money i have grown fat in the protection of the presence whose sorrow is my sorrow for the last time i hold his stirrup  he touched holdens foot with both hands and the horse sprang out into the road where the creaking bamboos were whipping the sky and all the frogs were chuckling holden could not see for the rain in his face he put his hands before his eyes and muttered  oh you brute you utter brute  the news of his trouble was already in his bungalow he read the knowledge in his butlers eyes when ahmed khan brought in food and for the first and last time in his life laid a hand upon his masters shoulder saying eat sahib eat meat is good against sorrow i also have known moreover the shadows come and go sahib the shadows come and go these be curried eggs  holden could neither eat nor sleep the heavens sent down eight inches of rain in that night and washed the earth clean the waters tore down walls broke roads and scoured open the shallow graves on the mahomedan buryingground all next day it rained and holden sat still in his house considering his sorrow on the morning of the third day he received a telegram which said only ricketts myndonie dying holden relieve immediate then he thought that before he departed he would look at the house wherein he had been master and lord there was a break in the weather and the rank earth steamed with vapour  he found that the rains had torn down the mud pillars of the gateway and the heavy wooden gate that had guarded his life hung lazily from one hinge there was grass three inches high in the courtyard pir khans lodge was empty and the sodden thatch sagged between the beams a gray squirrel was in possession of the verandah as if the house had been untenanted for thirty years instead of three days ameeras mother had removed everything except some mildewed matting the ticktick of the little scorpions as they hurried across the floor was the only sound in the house ameeras room and the other one where tota had lived were heavy with mildew and the narrow staircase leading to the roof was streaked and stained with rainborne mud holden saw all these things and came out again to meet in the road durga dass his landlord portly affable clothed in white muslin and driving a ceespring buggy he was overlooking his property to see how the roofs stood the stress of the first rains  i have heard said he you will not take this place any more sahib  what are you going to do with it  perhaps i shall let it again  then i will keep it on while i am away  durga dass was silent for some time you shall not take it on sahib he said when i was a young man i also but today i am a member of the municipality ho ho no when the birds have gone what need to keep the nest i will have it pulled downthe timber will sell for something always it shall be pulled down and the municipality shall make a road across as they desire from the burningghat to the city wall so that no man may say where this house stood     at the end of the passage    the sky is lead and our faces are red  and the gates of hell are opened and riven  and the winds of hell are loosened and driven  and the dust flies up in the face of heaven  and the clouds come down in a fiery sheet  heavy to raise and hard to be borne  and the soul of man is turned from his meat  turned from the trifles for which he has striven  sick in his body and heavy hearted  and his soul flies up like the dust in the sheet  breaks from his flesh and is gone and departed  as the blasts they blow on the cholerahorn                             himalayan  four men each entitled to life liberty and the pursuit of happiness sat at a table playing whist the thermometer markedfor themone hundred and one degrees of heat the room was darkened till it was only just possible to distinguish the pips of the cards and the very white faces of the players a tattered rotten punkah of whitewashed calico was puddling the hot air and whining dolefully at each stroke outside lay gloom of a november day in london there was neither sky sun nor horizonnothing but a brown purple haze of heat it was as though the earth were dying of apoplexy  from time to time clouds of tawny dust rose from the ground without wind or warning flung themselves tableclothwise among the tops of the parched trees and came down again then a whirling dustdevil would scutter across the plain for a couple of miles break and fall outward though there was nothing to check its flight save a long low line of piled railwaysleepers white with the dust a cluster of huts made of mud condemned rails and canvas and the one squat fourroomed bungalow that belonged to the assistant engineer in charge of a section of the gaudhari state line then under construction  the four stripped to the thinnest of sleepingsuits played whist crossly with wranglings as to leads and returns it was not the best kind of whist but they had taken some trouble to arrive at it mottram of the indian survey had ridden thirty and railed one hundred miles from his lonely post in the desert since the night before lowndes of the civil service on special duty in the political department had come as far to escape for an instant the miserable intrigues of an impoverished native state whose king alternately fawned and blustered for more money from the pitiful revenues contributed by hardwrung peasants and despairing camelbreeders spurstow the doctor of the line had left a cholerastricken camp of coolies to look after itself for fortyeight hours while he associated with white men once more hummil the assistant engineer was the host he stood fast and received his friends thus every sunday if they could come in when one of them failed to appear he would send a telegram to his last address in order that he might know whether the defaulter were dead or alive there are very many places in the east where it is not good or kind to let your acquaintances drop out of sight even for one short week  the players were not conscious of any special regard for each other they squabbled whenever they met but they ardently desired to meet as men without water desire to drink they were lonely folk who understood the dread meaning of loneliness they were all under thirty years of agewhich is too soon for any man to possess that knowledge  pilsener said spurstow after the second rubber mopping his forehead  beers out im sorry to say and theres hardly enough sodawater for tonight said hummil  what filthy bad management spurstow snarled  cant help it ive written and wired but the trains dont come through regularly yet last week the ice ran outas lowndes knows  glad i didnt come i could ha sent you some if i had known though phew its too hot to go on playing bumblepuppy this with a savage scowl at lowndes who only laughed he was a hardened offender  mottram rose from the table and looked out of a chink in the shutters  what a sweet day said he  the company yawned all together and betook themselves to an aimless investigation of all hummils possessionsguns tattered novels saddlery spurs and the like they had fingered them a score of times before but there was really nothing else to do  got anything fresh said lowndes  last weeks gazette of india and a cutting from a home paper my father sent it out its rather amusing  one of those vestrymen that call emselves mps again is it said spurstow who read his newspapers when he could get them  yes listen to this its to your address lowndes the man was making a speech to his constituents and he piled it on heres a sample and i assert unhesitatingly that the civil service in india is the preserve the pet preserveof the aristocracy of england what does the democracywhat do the massesget from that country which we have step by step fraudulently annexed i answer nothing whatever it is farmed with a single eye to their own interests by the scions of the aristocracy they take good care to maintain their lavish scale of incomes to avoid or stifle any inquiries into the nature and conduct of their administration while they themselves force the unhappy peasant to pay with the sweat of his brow for all the luxuries in which they are lapped hummil waved the cutting above his head ear ear said his audience  then lowndes meditatively id giveid give three months pay to have that gentleman spend one month with me and see how the free and independent native prince works things old timbersidesthis was his flippant title for an honoured and decorated feudatory princehas been wearing my life out this week past for money by jove his latest performance was to send me one of his women as a bribe  good for you did you accept it said mottram  no i rather wish i had now she was a pretty little person and she yarned away to me about the horrible destitution among the kings women folk the darlings havent had any new clothes for nearly a month and the old man wants to buy a new drag from calcuttasolid silver railings and silver lamps and trifles of that kind ive tried to make him understand that he has played the deuce with the revenues for the last twenty years and must go slow he cant see it  but he has the ancestral treasurevaults to draw on there must be three millions at least in jewels and coin under his palace said hummil  catch a native king disturbing the family treasure the priests forbid it except as the last resort old timbersides has added something like a quarter of a million to the deposit in his reign  where the mischief does it all come from said mottram  the country the state of the people is enough to make you sick ive known the taxmen wait by a milchcamel till the foal was born and then hurry off the mother for arrears and what can i do i cant get the court clerks to give me any accounts i cant raise anything more than a fat smile from the commanderinchief when i find out the troops are three months in arrears and old timbersides begins to weep when i speak to him he has taken to the kings peg heavilyliqueur brandy for whisky and heidsieck for sodawater  thats what the rao of jubela took to even a native cant last long at that said spurstow hell go out  and a good thing too then i suppose well have a council of regency and a tutor for the young prince and hand him back his kingdom with ten years accumulations  whereupon that young prince having been taught all the vices of the english will play ducks and drakes with the money and undo ten years work in eighteen months ive seen that business before said spurstow i should tackle the king with a light hand if i were you lowndes theyll hate you quite enough under any circumstances  thats all very well the man who looks on can talk about the light hand but you cant clean a pigstye with a pen dipped in rosewater i know my risks but nothing has happened yet my servants an old pathan and he cooks for me they are hardly likely to bribe him and i dont accept food from my true friends as they call themselves oh but its weary work id sooner be with you spurstow theres shooting near your camp  would you i dont think it about fifteen deaths a day dont incite a man to shoot anything but himself and the worst of it is that the poor devils look at you as though you ought to save them lord knows ive tried everything my last attempt was empirical but it pulled an old man through he was brought to me apparently past hope and i gave him gin and worcester sauce with cayenne it cured him but i dont recommend it  how do the cases run generally said hummil  very simply indeed chlorodyne opium pill chlorodyne collapse nitre bricks to the feet and thenthe burningghat the last seems to be the only thing that stops the trouble its black cholera you know poor devils but i will say little bunsee lal my apothecary works like a demon ive recommended him for promotion if he comes through it all alive  and what are your chances old man said mottram  dont know dont care much but ive sent the letter in what are you doing with yourself generally  sitting under a table in the tent and spitting on the sextant to keep it cool said the man of the survey washing my eyes to avoid ophthalmia which i shall certainly get and trying to make a sub surveyor understand that an error of five degrees in an angle isnt quite so small as it looks im altogether alone y know and shall be till the end of the hot weather  hummils the lucky man said lowndes flinging himself into a long chair he has an actual rooftorn as to the ceilingcloth but still a roofover his head he sees one train daily he can get beer and soda water and ice em when god is good he has books picturesthey were torn from the graphicand the society of the excellent subcontractor jevins besides the pleasure of receiving us weekly  hummil smiled grimly yes im the lucky man i suppose jevins is luckier  how not  yes went out last monday  by his own hand said spurstow quickly hinting the suspicion that was in everybodys mind there was no cholera near hummils section even fever gives a man at least a weeks grace and sudden death generally implied selfslaughter  i judge no man this weather said hummil he had a touch of the sun i fancy for last week after you fellows had left he came into the verandah and told me that he was going home to see his wife in market street liverpool that evening  i got the apothecary in to look at him and we tried to make him lie down after an hour or two he rubbed his eyes and said he believed he had had a fithoped he hadnt said anything rude jevins had a great idea of bettering himself socially he was very like chucks in his language  well  then he went to his own bungalow and began cleaning a rifle he told the servant that he was going to shoot buck in the morning naturally he fumbled with the trigger and shot himself through the head accidentally the apothecary sent in a report to my chief and jevins is buried somewhere out there id have wired to you spurstow if you could have done anything  youre a queer chap said mottram if youd killed the man yourself you couldnt have been more quiet about the business  good lord what does it matter said hummil calmly ive got to do a lot of his overseeing work in addition to my own im the only person that suffers jevins is out of itby pure accident of course but out of it the apothecary was going to write a long screed on suicide trust a babu to drivel when he gets the chance  why didnt you let it go in as suicide said lowndes  no direct proof a man hasnt many privileges in this country but he might at least be allowed to mishandle his own rifle besides some day i may need a man to smother up an accident to myself live and let live die and let die  you take a pill said spurstow who had been watching hummils white face narrowly take a pill and dont be an ass that sort of talk is skittles anyhow suicide is shirking your work if i were job ten times over i should be so interested in what was going to happen next that id stay on and watch  ah ive lost that curiosity said hummil  liver out of order said lowndes feelingly  no cant sleep thats worse  by jove it is said mottram im that way every now and then and the fit has to wear itself out what do you take for it  nothing whats the use i havent had ten minutes sleep since friday morning  poor chap spurstow you ought to attend to this said mottram now you mention it your eyes are rather gummy and swollen  spurstow still watching hummil laughed lightly ill patch him up later on is it too hot do you think to go for a ride  where to said lowndes wearily we shall have to go away at eight and therell be riding enough for us then i hate a horse when i have to use him as a necessity oh heavens what is there to do  begin whist again at chick points a chick is supposed to be eight shillings and a gold mohur on the rub said spurstow promptly  poker a months pay all round for the poolno limitand fifty rupee raises somebody would be broken before we got up said lowndes  cant say that it would give me any pleasure to break any man in this company said mottram there isnt enough excitement in it and its foolish he crossed over to the worn and battered little camppiano wreckage of a married household that had once held the bungalowand opened the case  its used up long ago said hummil the servants have picked it to pieces  the piano was indeed hopelessly out of order but mottram managed to bring the rebellious notes into a sort of agreement and there rose from the ragged keyboard something that might once have been the ghost of a popular musichall song the men in the long chairs turned with evident interest as mottram banged the more lustily  thats good said lowndes by jove the last time i heard that song was in 79 or thereabouts just before i came out  ah said spurstow with pride i was home in 80 and he mentioned a song of the streets popular at that date  mottram executed it roughly lowndes criticised and volunteered emendations mottram dashed into another ditty not of the musichall character and made as if to rise  sit down said hummil i didnt know that you had any music in your composition go on playing until you cant think of anything more ill have that piano tuned up before you come again play something festive  very simple indeed were the tunes to which mottrams art and the limitations of the piano could give effect but the men listened with pleasure and in the pauses talked all together of what they had seen or heard when they were last at home a dense duststorm sprung up outside and swept roaring over the house enveloping it in the choking darkness of midnight but mottram continued unheeding and the crazy tinkle reached the ears of the listeners above the flapping of the tattered ceilingcloth  in the silence after the storm he glided from the more directly personal songs of scotland half humming them as he played into the evening hymn  sunday said he nodding his head  go on dont apologise for it said spurstow  hummil laughed long and riotously play it by all means youre full of surprises today i didnt know you had such a gift of finished sarcasm how does that thing go  mottram took up the tune  too slow by half you miss the note of gratitude said hummil it ought to go to the grasshoppers polkathis way and he chanted prestissimo  glory to thee my god this night for all the blessings of the light  that shows we really feel our blessings how does it go on  if in the night i sleepless lie my soul with sacred thoughts supply may no ill dreams disturb my rest  quicker mottram  or powers of darkness me molest  bah what an old hypocrite you are  dont be an ass said lowndes you are at full liberty to make fun of anything else you like but leave that hymn alone its associated in my mind with the most sacred recollections  summer evenings in the countrystainedglass windowlight going out and you and she jamming your heads together over one hymnbook said mottram  yes and a fat old cockchafer hitting you in the eye when you walked home smell of hay and a moon as big as a bandbox sitting on the top of a haycock batsrosesmilk and midges said lowndes  also mothers i can just recollect my mother singing me to sleep with that when i was a little chap said spurstow  the darkness had fallen on the room they could hear hummil squirming in his chair  consequently said he testily you sing it when you are seven fathom deep in hell its an insult to the intelligence of the deity to pretend were anything but tortured rebels  take two pills said spurstow thats tortured liver  the usually placid hummil is in a vile bad temper im sorry for his coolies tomorrow said lowndes as the servants brought in the lights and prepared the table for dinner  as they were settling into their places about the miserable goatchops and the smoked tapioca pudding spurstow took occasion to whisper to mottram well done david  look after saul then was the reply  what are you two whispering about said hummil suspiciously  only saying that you are a damned poor host this fowl cant be cut returned spurstow with a sweet smile call this a dinner  i cant help it you dont expect a banquet do you  throughout that meal hummil contrived laboriously to insult directly and pointedly all his guests in succession and at each insult spurstow kicked the aggrieved persons under the table but he dared not exchange a glance of intelligence with either of them hummils face was white and pinched while his eyes were unnaturally large no man dreamed for a moment of resenting his savage personalities but as soon as the meal was over they made haste to get away dont go youre just getting amusing you fellows i hope i havent said anything that annoyed you youre such touchy devils then changing the note into one of almost abject entreaty hummil added i say you surely arent going  in the language of the blessed jorrocks where i dines i sleeps said spurstow i want to have a look at your coolies tomorrow if you dont mind you can give me a place to lie down in i suppose  the others pleaded the urgency of their several duties next day and saddling up departed together hummil begging them to come next sunday as they jogged off lowndes unbosomed himself to mottram   and i never felt so like kicking a man at his own table in my life he said i cheated at whist and reminded me i was in debt told you you were as good as a liar to your face you arent half indignant enough over it  not i said mottram poor devil did you ever know old hummy behave like that before or within a hundred miles of it  thats no excuse spurstow was hacking my shin all the time so i kept a hand on myself else i should have  no you wouldnt youd have done as hummy did about jevins judge no man this weather by jove the buckle of my bridle is hot in my hand trot out a bit and ware ratholes  ten minutes trotting jerked out of lowndes one very sage remark when he pulled up sweating from every pore  good thing spurstows with him tonight  yees good man spurstow our roads turn here see you again next sunday if the sun doesnt bowl me over  spose so unless old timbersides finance minister manages to dress some of my food goodnight andgod bless you  whats wrong now  oh nothing lowndes gathered up his whip and as he flicked mottrams mare on the flank added youre not a bad little chap thats all and the mare bolted half a mile across the sand on the word  in the assistant engineers bungalow spurstow and hummil smoked the pipe of silence together each narrowly watching the other the capacity of a bachelors establishment is as elastic as its arrangements are simple a servant cleared away the diningroom table brought in a couple of rude native bedsteads made of tape strung on a light wood frame flung a square of cool calcutta matting over each set them side by side pinned two towels to the punkah so that their fringes should just sweep clear of the sleepers nose and mouth and announced that the couches were ready  the men flung themselves down ordering the punkahcoolies by all the powers of hell to pull every door and window was shut for the outside air was that of an oven the atmosphere within was only 104 degrees as the thermometer bore witness and heavy with the foul smell of badlytrimmed kerosene lamps and this stench combined with that of native tobacco baked brick and dried earth sends the heart of many a strong man down to his boots for it is the smell of the great indian empire when she turns herself for six months into a house of torment spurstow packed his pillows craftily so that he reclined rather than lay his head at a safe elevation above his feet it is not good to sleep on a low pillow in the hot weather if you happen to be of thicknecked build for you may pass with lively snores and gugglings from natural sleep into the deep slumber of heatapoplexy  pack your pillows said the doctor sharply as he saw hummil preparing to lie down at full length  the nightlight was trimmed the shadow of the punkah wavered across the room and the flick of the punkahtowel and the soft whine of the rope through the wallhole followed it then the punkah flagged almost ceased the sweat poured from spurstows brow should he go out and harangue the coolie it started forward again with a savage jerk and a pin came out of the towels when this was replaced a tomtom in the coolielines began to beat with the steady throb of a swollen artery inside some brainfevered skull spurstow turned on his side and swore gently there was no movement on hummils part the man had composed himself as rigidly as a corpse his hands clinched at his sides the respiration was too hurried for any suspicion of sleep spurstow looked at the set face the jaws were clinched and there was a pucker round the quivering eyelids  hes holding himself as tightly as ever he can thought spurstow what in the world is the matter with himhummil  yes in a thick constrained voice  cant you get to sleep  no  head hot throat feeling bulgy or how  neither thanks i dont sleep much you know  feel pretty bad  pretty bad thanks there is a tomtom outside isnt there i thought it was my head at first oh spurstow for pitys sake give me something that will put me asleepsound asleepif its only for six hours he sprang up trembling from head to foot i havent been able to sleep naturally for days and i cant stand iti cant stand it  poor old chap  thats no use give me something to make me sleep i tell you im nearly mad i dont know what i say half my time for three weeks ive had to think and spell out every word that has come through my lips before i dared say it isnt that enough to drive a man mad i cant see things correctly now and ive lost my sense of touch my skin achesmy skin aches make me sleep oh spurstow for the love of god make me sleep sound it isnt enough merely to let me dream let me sleep  all right old man all right go slow you arent half as bad as you think  the floodgates of reserve once broken hummil was clinging to him like a frightened child youre pinching my arm to pieces  ill break your neck if you dont do something for me no i didnt mean that dont be angry old fellow he wiped the sweat off himself as he fought to regain composure im a bit restless and off my oats and perhaps you could recommend some sort of sleeping mixturebromide of potassium  bromide of skittles why didnt you tell me this before let go of my arm and ill see if theres anything in my cigarettecase to suit your complaint spurstow hunted among his dayclothes turned up the lamp opened a little silver cigarettecase and advanced on the expectant hummil with the daintiest of fairy squirts  the last appeal of civilisation said he and a thing i hate to use hold out your arm well your sleeplessness hasnt ruined your muscle and what a thick hide it is might as well inject a buffalo subcutaneously now in a few minutes the morphia will begin working lie down and wait  a smile of unalloyed and idiotic delight began to creep over hummils face i think he whisperedi think im going off now gad its positively heavenly spurstow you must give me that case to keep you the voice ceased as the head fell back  not for a good deal said spurstow to the unconscious form and now my friend sleeplessness of your kind being very apt to relax the moral fibre in little matters of life and death ill just take the liberty of spiking your guns  he paddled into hummils saddleroom in his bare feet and uncased a twelvebore rifle an express and a revolver of the first he unscrewed the nipples and hid them in the bottom of a saddlerycase of the second he abstracted the lever kicking it behind a big wardrobe the third he merely opened and knocked the dollhead bolt of the grip up with the heel of a ridingboot  thats settled he said as he shook the sweat off his hands these little precautions will at least give you time to turn you have too much sympathy with gunroom accidents  and as he rose from his knees the thick muffled voice of hummil cried in the doorway you fool  such tones they use who speak in the lucid intervals of delirium to their friends a little before they die  spurstow started dropping the pistol hummil stood in the doorway rocking with helpless laughter  that was awfly good of you im sure he said very slowly feeling for his words i dont intend to go out by my own hand at present i say spurstow that stuff wont work what shall i do what shall i do and panic terror stood in his eyes  lie down and give it a chance lie down at once  i darent it will only take me halfway again and i shant be able to get away this time do you know it was all i could do to come out just now generally i am as quick as lightning but you had clogged my feet i was nearly caught  oh yes i understand go and lie down  no it isnt delirium but it was an awfully mean trick to play on me do you know i might have died  as a sponge rubs a slate clean so some power unknown to spurstow had wiped out of hummils face all that stamped it for the face of a man and he stood at the doorway in the expression of his lost innocence he had slept back into terrified childhood  is he going to die on the spot thought spurstow then aloud all right my son come back to bed and tell me all about it you couldnt sleep but what was all the rest of the nonsense  a placea place down there said hummil with simple sincerity the drug was acting on him by waves and he was flung from the fear of a strong man to the fright of a child as his nerves gathered sense or were dulled  good god ive been afraid of it for months past spurstow it has made every night hell to me and yet im not conscious of having done anything wrong  be still and ill give you another dose well stop your nightmares you unutterable idiot  yes but you must give me so much that i cant get away you must make me quite sleepynot just a little sleepy its so hard to run then  i know it i know it ive felt it myself the symptoms are exactly as you describe  oh dont laugh at me confound you before this awful sleeplessness came to me ive tried to rest on my elbow and put a spur in the bed to sting me when i fell back look  by jove the man has been rowelled like a horse ridden by the nightmare with a vengeance and we all thought him sensible enough heaven send us understanding you like to talk dont you  yes sometimes not when im frightened then i want to run dont you  always before i give you your second dose try to tell me exactly what your trouble is  hummil spoke in broken whispers for nearly ten minutes whilst spurstow looked into the pupils of his eyes and passed his hand before them once or twice  at the end of the narrative the silver cigarettecase was produced and the last words that hummil said as he fell back for the second time were put me quite to sleep for if im caught i diei die  yes yes we all do that sooner or laterthank heaven who has set a term to our miseries said spurstow settling the cushions under the head it occurs to me that unless i drink something i shall go out before my time ive stopped sweating andi wear a seventeeninch collar he brewed himself scalding hot tea which is an excellent remedy against heatapoplexy if you take three or four cups of it in time then he watched the sleeper  a blind face that cries and cant wipe its eyes a blind face that chases him down corridors hm decidedly hummil ought to go on leave as soon as possible and sane or otherwise he undoubtedly did rowel himself most cruelly well heaven send us understanding  at midday hummil rose with an evil taste in his mouth but an unclouded eye and a joyful heart  i was pretty bad last night wasnt i said he  i have seen healthier men you must have had a touch of the sun look here if i write you a swingeing medical certificate will you apply for leave on the spot  no  why not you want it  yes but i can hold on till the weathers a little cooler  why should you if you can get relieved on the spot  burkett is the only man who could be sent and hes a born fool  oh never mind about the line you arent so important as all that wire for leave if necessary  hummil looked very uncomfortable  i can hold on till the rains he said evasively  you cant wire to headquarters for burkett  i wont if you want to know why particularly burkett is married and his wifes just had a kid and shes up at simla in the cool and burkett has a very nice billet that takes him into simla from saturday to monday that little woman isnt at all well if burkett was transferred shed try to follow him if she left the baby behind shed fret herself to death if she cameand burketts one of those selfish little beasts who are always talking about a wifes place being with her husbandshed die its murder to bring a woman here just now burkett hasnt the physique of a rat if he came here hed go out and i know she hasnt any money and im pretty sure shed go out too im salted in a sort of way and im not married wait till the rains and then burkett can get thin down here itll do him heaps of good  do you mean to say that you intend to facewhat you have faced till the rains break  oh it wont be so bad now youve shown me a way out of it i can always wire to you besides now ive once got into the way of sleeping itll be all right anyhow i shant put in for leave thats the long and the short of it  my great scott i thought all that sort of thing was dead and done with  bosh youd do the same yourself i feel a new man thanks to that cigarettecase youre going over to camp now arent you  yes but ill try to look you up every other day if i can  im not bad enough for that i dont want you to bother give the coolies gin and ketchup  then you feel all right  fit to fight for my life but not to stand out in the sun talking to you go along old man and bless you  hummil turned on his heel to face the echoing desolation of his bungalow and the first thing he saw standing in the verandah was the figure of himself he had met a similar apparition once before when he was suffering from overwork and the strain of the hot weather  this is badalready he said rubbing his eyes if the thing slides away from me all in one piece like a ghost i shall know it is only my eyes and stomach that are out of order if it walksmy head is going  he approached the figure which naturally kept at an unvarying distance from him as is the use of all spectres that are born of overwork it slid through the house and dissolved into swimming specks within the eyeball as soon as it reached the burning light of the garden hummil went about his business till even when he came in to dinner he found himself sitting at the table the vision rose and walked out hastily except that it cast no shadow it was in all respects real  no living man knows what that week held for hummil an increase of the epidemic kept spurstow in camp among the coolies and all he could do was to telegraph to mottram bidding him go to the bungalow and sleep there but mottram was forty miles away from the nearest telegraph and knew nothing of anything save the needs of the survey till he met early on sunday morning lowndes and spurstow heading towards hummils for the weekly gathering  hope the poor chaps in a better temper said the former swinging himself off his horse at the door i suppose he isnt up yet  ill just have a look at him said the doctor if hes asleep theres no need to wake him  and an instant later by the tone of spurstows voice calling upon them to enter the men knew what had happened there was no need to wake him  the punkah was still being pulled over the bed but hummil had departed this life at least three hours  the body lay on its back hands clinched by the side as spurstow had seen it lying seven nights previously in the staring eyes was written terror beyond the expression of any pen  mottram who had entered behind lowndes bent over the dead and touched the forehead lightly with his lips oh you lucky lucky devil he whispered  but lowndes had seen the eyes and withdrew shuddering to the other side of the room  poor chap poor old chap and the last time i met him i was angry spurstow we should have watched him has he  deftly spurstow continued his investigations ending by a search round the room  no he hasnt he snapped theres no trace of anything call the servants  they came eight or ten of them whispering and peering over each others shoulders  when did your sahib go to bed said spurstow  at eleven or ten we think said hummils personal servant  he was well then but how should you know  he was not ill as far as our comprehension extended but he had slept very little for three nights this i know because i saw him walking much and specially in the heart of the night  as spurstow was arranging the sheet a big straightnecked huntingspur tumbled on the ground the doctor groaned the personal servant peeped at the body  what do you think chuma said spurstow catching the look on the dark face  heavenborn in my poor opinion this that was my master has descended into the dark places and there has been caught because he was not able to escape with sufficient speed we have the spur for evidence that he fought with fear thus have i seen men of my race do with thorns when a spell was laid upon them to overtake them in their sleeping hours and they dared not sleep  chuma youre a mudhead go out and prepare seals to be set on the sahibs property  god has made the heavenborn god has made me who are we to inquire into the dispensations of god i will bid the other servants hold aloof while you are reckoning the tale of the sahibs property they are all thieves and would steal  as far as i can make out he died fromoh anything stoppage of the hearts action heatapoplexy or some other visitation said spurstow to his companions we must make an inventory of his effects and so on  he was scared to death insisted lowndes look at those eyes for pitys sake dont let him be buried with them open  whatever it was hes clear of all the trouble now said mottram softly  spurstow was peering into the open eyes  come here said he can you see anything there  i cant face it whimpered lowndes cover up the face is there any fear on earth that can turn a man into that likeness its ghastly oh spurstow cover it up  no fearon earth said spurstow mottram leaned over his shoulder and looked intently  i see nothing except some gray blurs in the pupil there can be nothing there you know  even so well lets think itll take half a day to knock up any sort of coffin and he must have died at midnight lowndes old man go out and tell the coolies to break ground next to jevinss grave mottram go round the house with chuma and see that the seals are put on things send a couple of men to me here and ill arrange  the strongarmed servants when they returned to their own kind told a strange story of the doctor sahib vainly trying to call their master back to life by magic artsto wit the holding of a little green box that clicked to each of the dead mans eyes and of a bewildered muttering on the part of the doctor sahib who took the little green box away with him  the resonant hammering of a coffinlid is no pleasant thing to hear but those who have experience maintain that much more terrible is the soft swish of the bedlinen the reeving and unreeving of the bedtapes when he who has fallen by the roadside is apparelled for burial sinking gradually as the tapes are tied over till the swaddled shape touches the floor and there is no protest against the indignity of hasty disposal  at the last moment lowndes was seized with scruples of conscience ought you to read the servicefrom beginning to end said he to spurstow  i intend to youre my senior as a civilian you can take it if you like  i didnt mean that for a moment i only thought if we could get a chaplain from somewhereim willing to ride anywhereand give poor hummil a better chance thats all  bosh said spurstow as he framed his lips to the tremendous words that stand at the head of the burial service  after breakfast they smoked a pipe in silence to the memory of the dead then spurstow said absently  tisnt in medical science  what  things in a dead mans eye  for goodness sake leave that horror alone said lowndes ive seen a native die of pure fright when a tiger chivied him i know what killed hummil  the deuce you do im going to try to see and the doctor retreated into the bathroom with a kodak camera after a few minutes there was the sound of something being hammered to pieces and he emerged very white indeed  have you got a picture said mottram what does the thing look like  it was impossible of course you neednt look mottram ive torn up the films there was nothing there it was impossible  that said lowndes very distinctly watching the shaking hand striving to relight the pipe is a damned lie  mottram laughed uneasily spurstows right he said were all in such a state now that wed believe anything for pitys sake lets try to be rational  there was no further speech for a long time the hot wind whistled without and the dry trees sobbed presently the daily train winking brass burnished steel and spouting steam pulled up panting in the intense glare wed better go on on that said spurstow go back to work ive written my certificate we cant do any more good here and workll keep our wits together come on  no one moved it is not pleasant to face railway journeys at midday in june spurstow gathered up his hat and whip and turning in the doorway said  there may be heaventhere must be hell meantime there is our life here weell  neither mottram nor lowndes had any answer to the question     the mutiny of the mavericks   sec 7   cause                      in forces    regular forces i       consipiring                belonging    reserve forces           with other     a mutiny    to her       auxiliary forces           persons to     sedition    majestys    navy           cause          when three obscure gentlemen in san francisco argued on insufficient premises they condemned a fellowcreature to a most unpleasant death in a far country which had nothing whatever to do with the united states they foregathered at the top of a tenementhouse in tehama street an unsavoury quarter of the city and there calling for certain drinks they conspired because they were conspirators by trade officially known as the third three of the iaaan institution for the propagation of pure light not to be confounded with any others though it is affiliated to many the second three live in montreal and work among the poor there the first three have their home in new york not far from castle garden and write regularly once a week to a small house near one of the big hotels at boulogne what happens after that a particular section of scotland yard knows too well and laughs at a conspirator detests ridicule more men have been stabbed with lucrezia borgia daggers and dropped into the thames for laughing at head centres and triangles than for betraying secrets for this is human nature  the third three conspired over whisky cocktails and a clean sheet of notepaper against the british empire and all that lay therein this work is very like what men without discernment call politics before a general election you pick out and discuss in the company of congenial friends all the weak points in your opponents organisation and unconsciously dwell upon and exaggerate all their mishaps till it seems to you a miracle that the hated party holds together for an hour  our principle is not so much active demonstrationthat we leave to othersas passive embarrassment to weaken and unnerve said the first man wherever an organisation is crippled wherever a confusion is thrown into any branch of any department we gain a step for those who take on the work we are but the forerunners he was a german enthusiast and editor of a newspaper from whose leading articles he quoted frequently  that cursed empire makes so many blunders of her own that unless we doubled the years average i guess it wouldnt strike her anything special had occurred said the second man are you prepared to say that all our resources are equal to blowing off the muzzle of a hundred ton gun or spiking a tenthousandton ship on a plain rock in clear daylight they can beat us at our own game better join hands with the practical branches were in funds now try a direct scare in a crowded street they value their greasy hides he was the drag upon the wheel and an americanised irishman of the second generation despising his own race and hating the other he had learned caution  the third man drank his cocktail and spoke no word he was the strategist but unfortunately his knowledge of life was limited he picked a letter from his breastpocket and threw it across the table that epistle to the heathen contained some very concise directions from the first three in new york it said  the boom in black iron has already affected the eastern markets where our agents have been forcing down the englishheld stock among the smaller buyers who watch the turn of shares any immediate operations such as western bears would increase their willingness to unload this however cannot be expected till they see clearly that foreign iron masters are witting to cooperate mulcahy should be dispatched to feel the pulse of the market and act accordingly mavericks are at present the best for our purposepdq  as a message referring to an iron crisis in pennsylvania it was interesting if not lucid as a new departure in organised attack on an outlying english dependency it was more than interesting  the second man read it through and murmured  already surely they are in too great a hurry all that dhulip singh could do in india he has done down to the distribution of his photographs among the peasantry ho ho the paris firm arranged that and he has no substantial money backing from the other power even our agents in india know he hasnt what is the use of our organisation wasting men on work that is already done of course the irish regiments in india are half mutinous as they stand  this shows how near a lie may come to the truth an irish regiment for just so long as it stands still is generally a hard handful to control being reckless and rough when however it is moved in the direction of musketryfiring it becomes strangely and unpatriotically content with its lot it has even been heard to cheer the queen with enthusiasm on these occasions  but the notion of tampering with the army was from the point of view of tehama street an altogether sound one there is no shadow of stability in the policy of an english government and the most sacred oaths of england would even if engrossed on vellum find very few buyers among colonies and dependencies that have suffered from vain beliefs but there remains to england always her army that cannot change except in the matter of uniform and equipment the officers may write to the papers demanding the heads of the horse guards in default of cleaner redress for grievances the men may break loose across a country town and seriously startle the publicans but neither officers nor men have it in their composition to mutiny after the continental manner the english people when they trouble to think about the army at all are and with justice absolutely assured that it is absolutely trustworthy imagine for a moment their emotions on realising that such and such a regiment was in open revolt from causes directly due to englands management of ireland they would probably send the regiment to the polls forthwith and examine their own consciences as to their duty to erin but they would never be easy any more and it was this vague unhappy mistrust that the i a a were labouring to produce  sheer waste of breath said the second man after a pause in the council i dont see the use of tampering with their foolarmy but it has been tried before and we must try it again it looks well in the reports if we send one man from here you may bet your life that other men are going too order up mulcahy  they ordered him upa slim slight darkhaired young man devoured with that blind rancorous hatred of england that only reaches its full growth across the atlantic he had sucked it from his mothers breast in the little cabin at the back of the northern avenues of new york he had been taught his rights and his wrongs in german and irish on the canal fronts of chicago and san francisco held men who told him strange and awful things of the great blind power over the seas once when business took him across the atlantic he had served in an english regiment and being insubordinate had suffered extremely he drew all his ideas of england that were not bred by the cheaper patriotic prints from one ironfisted colonel and an unbending adjutant he would go to the mines if need be to teach his gospel and he went as his instructions advised pdqwhich means with speedto introduce embarrassment into an irish regiment already halfmutinous quartered among sikh peasantry all wearing miniatures of his highness dhulip singh maharaja of the punjab next their hearts and all eagerly expecting his arrival other information equally valuable was given him by his masters he was to be cautious but never to grudge expense in winning the hearts of the men in the regiment his mother in new york would supply funds and he was to write to her once a month life is pleasant for a man who has a mother in new york to send him two hundred pounds a year over and above his regimental pay  in process of time thanks to his intimate knowledge of drill and musketry exercise the excellent mulcahy wearing the corporals stripe went out in a troopship and joined her majestys royal loyal musketeers commonly known as the mavericks because they were masterless and unbranded cattlesons of small farmers in county clare shoeless vagabonds of kerry herders of ballyvegan much wanted moonlighters from the bare rainy headlands of the south coast officered by omores bradys hills kilreas and the like never to outward seeming was there more promising material to work on the first three had chosen their regiment well it feared nothing that moved or talked save the colonel and the regimental roman catholic chaplain the fat father dennis who held the keys of heaven and hell and blared like an angry bull when he desired to be convincing him also it loved because on occasions of stress he was used to tuck up his cassock and charge with the rest into the merriest of the fray where he always found good man that the saints sent him a revolver when there was a fallen private to be protected orbut this came as an afterthoughthis own gray head to be guarded  cautiously as he had been instructed tenderly and with much beer mulcahy opened his projects to such as he deemed fittest to listen and these were one and all of that quaint crooked sweet profoundly irresponsible and profoundly lovable race that fight like fiends argue like children reason like women obey like men and jest like their own goblins of the rath through rebellion loyalty want woe or war the underground work of a conspiracy is always dull and very much the same the world over at the end of six monthsthe seed always falling on good groundmulcahy spoke almost explicitly hinting darkly in the approved fashion at dread powers behind him and advising nothing more nor less than mutiny were they not dogs evilly treated had they not all their own and their national revenges to satisfy who in these days would do aught to nine hundred men in rebellion who again could stay them if they broke for the sea licking up on their way other regiments only too anxious to join and afterwards here followed windy promises of gold and preferment office and honour ever dear to a certain type of irishman  as he finished his speech in the dusk of a twilight to his chosen associates there was a sound of a rapidly unslung belt behind him the arm of one dan grady flew out in the gloom and arrested something then said dan  mulcahy youre a great man an you do credit to whoever sent you walk about a bit while we think of it mulcahy departed elate he knew his words would sink deep  why the tripledashed asterisks did ye not let me belt him grunted a voice  because im not a fatheaded fool boystis what hes been driving at these six monthsour superior corpril with his education and his copies of the irish papers and his everlasting beer hes been sent for the purpose and thats where the money comes from can ye not see that mans a goldmine which horse egan here would have destroyed with a beltbuckle it would be throwing away the gifts of providence not to fall in with his little plans of coorse well mutny till alls dry shoot the colonel on the paradeground massacree the company officers ransack the arsenal and thenboys did he tell you what next he told me the other night when he was beginning to talk wild then were to join with the niggers and look for help from dhulip singh and the russians  and spoil the best campaign that ever was this side of hell danny id have lost the beer to ha given him the belting he requires  oh let him go this awhile man hes got nono constructiveness but thats the eggmeat of his plan and you must understand that im in with it an so are you well want oceans of beer to convince us firmaments full well give him talk for his money and one by one all the boys ll come in and hell have a nest of nine hundred mutineers to squat in an give drink to  what makes me killingmad is his wanting us to do what the niggers did thirty years gone that an his pigs cheek in saying that other regiments would come along said a kerry man  thats not so bad as hintin we should loose off on the colonel  colonel be sugared id as soon as not put a shot through his helmet to see him jump and clutch his old horses head but mulcahy talks o shootin our compny orfcers accidental  he said that did he said horse egan  somethin like that anyways cant ye fancy ould barber brady wid a bullet in his lungs coughin like a sick monkey an sayin bhoys i do not mind your gettin dhrunk but you must hould your liquor like men the man that shot me is dhrunk ill suspend investigations for six hours while i get this bullet cut out an then  an then continued horse egan for the peppery majors peculiarities of speech and manner were as well known as his tanned face an then ye dissolute halfbaked puttyfaced scum o connemara if i find a man so much as lookin confused begad ill coortmartial the whole company a man that cant get over his liquor in six hours is not fit to belong to the mavericks  a shout of laughter bore witness to the truth of the sketch  its pretty to think of said the kerry man slowly mulcahy would have us do all the devilmint and get clear himself someways he wudnt be takin all this fools throuble in shpoilin the reputation of the regiment  reputation of your grandmothers pig said dan  well an he had a good reputation tu so its all right mulcahy must see his way to clear out behind him or hed not ha come so far talkin powers of darkness  did you hear anything of a regimental courtmartial among the black boneens these days half a company of em took one of the new draft an hanged him by his arms with a tentrope from a third story verandah they gave no reason for so doin but he was half dead im thinking that the boneens are shortsighted it was a friend of mulcahys or a man in the same trade theyd a deal better ha taken his beer returned dan reflectively  better still ha handed him up to the colonel said horse egan onlessbut sure the news wud be all over the counthry an give the regment a bad name  an thered be no reward for that manhe but went about talkin said the kerry man artlessly  you speak by your breed said dan with a laugh there was never a kerry man yet that wudnt sell his brother for a pipe o tobacco an a pat on the back from a pliceman  praise god im not a bloomin orangeman was the answer  no nor never will be said dan they breed men in ulster would you like to thry the taste of one  the kerry man looked and longed but forbore the odds of battle were too great  then youll not even give mulcahy aa strike for his money said the voice of horse egan who regarded what he called trouble of any kind as the pinnacle of felicity  dan answered not at all but crept on tiptoe with large strides to the messroom the men following the room was empty in a corner cased like the king of dahomeys state umbrella stood the regimental colours dan lifted them tenderly and unrolled in the light of the candles the record of the maverickstattered worn and hacked the white satin was darkened everywhere with big brown stains the gold threads on the crowned harp were frayed and discoloured and the red bull the totem of the mavericks was coffeehued the stiff embroidered folds whose price is human life rustled down slowly the mavericks keep their colours long and guard them very sacredly  vittoria salamanca toulouse waterloo moodkee ferozshah an sobraonthat was fought close next door here against the very beggars he wants us to join inkermann the alma sebastopol what are those little businesses compared to the campaigns of general mulcahy the mutny think o that the mutny an some dirty little matters in afghanistan an for that an these an thosedan pointed to the names of glorious battlesthat yankee man with the partin in his hair comes an says as easy as have a drink holy moses theres the captain  but it was the messsergeant who came in just as the men clattered out and found the colours uncased  from that day dated the mutiny of the mavericks to the joy of mulcahy and the pride of his mother in new yorkthe good lady who sent the money for the beer never so far as words went was such a mutiny the conspirators led by dan grady and horse egan poured in daily they were sound men men to be trusted and they all wanted blood but first they must have beer they cursed the queen they mourned over ireland they suggested hideous plunder of the indian country side and then alassome of the younger men would go forth and wallow on the ground in spasms of wicked laughter  the genius of the irish for conspiracies is remarkable none the less they would swear no oaths but those of their own making which were rare and curious and they were always at pains to impress mulcahy with the risks they ran naturally the flood of beer wrought demoralisation but mulcahy confused the causes of things and when a very muzzy maverick smote a sergeant on the nose or called his commanding officer a bald headed old lardbladder and even worse names he fancied that rebellion and not liquor was at the bottom of the outbreak other gentlemen who have concerned themselves in larger conspiracies have made the same error  the hot season in which they protested no man could rebel came to an end and mulcahy suggested a visible return for his teachings as to the actual upshot of the mutiny he cared nothing it would be enough if the english infatuatedly trusting to the integrity of their army should be startled with news of an irish regiment revolting from political considerations his persistent demands would have ended at dans instigation in a regimental belting which in all probability would have killed him and cut off the supply of beer had not he been sent on special duty some fifty miles away from the cantonment to cool his heels in a mud fort and dismount obsolete artillery then the colonel of the mavericks reading his newspaper diligently and scenting frontier trouble from afar posted to the army headquarters and pled with the commanderinchief for certain privileges to be granted under certain contingencies which contingencies came about only a week later when the annual little war on the border developed itself and the colonel returned to carry the good news to the mavericks he held the promise of the chief for active service and the men must get ready  on the evening of the same day mulcahy an unconsidered corporalyet great in conspiracyreturned to cantonments and heard sounds of strife and howlings from afar off the mutiny had broken out and the barracks of the mavericks were one whitewashed pandemonium a private tearing through the barracksquare gasped in his ear service active service its a burnin shame oh joy the mavericks had risen on the eve of battle they would notnoble and loyal sons of irelandserve the queen longer the news would flash through the country side and over to england and hemulcahythe trusted of the third three had brought about the crash the private stood in the middle of the square and cursed colonel regiment officers and doctor particularly the doctor by his gods an orderly of the native cavalry regiment clattered through the mob of soldiers he was half lifted half dragged from his horse beaten on the back with mighty handclaps till his eyes watered and called all manner of endearing names yes the mavericks had fraternised with the native troops who then was the agent among the latter that had blindly wrought with mulcahy so well  an officer slunk almost ran from the mess to a barrack he was mobbed by the infuriated soldiery who closed round but did not kill him for he fought his way to shelter flying for the life mulcahy could have wept with pure joy and thankfulness the very prisoners in the guard room were shaking the bars of their cells and howling like wild beasts and from every barrack poured the booming as of a big wardrum  mulcahy hastened to his own barrack he could hardly hear himself speak eighty men were pounding with fist and heel the tables and trestles eighty men flushed with mutiny stripped to their shirt sleeves their knapsacks halfpacked for the march to the sea made the twoinch boards thunder again as they chanted to a tune that mulcahy knew well the sacred war song of the mavericks       listen in the north my boys theres trouble on the wind      tramp o cossack hooves in front gray greatcoats behind      trouble on the frontier of a most amazin kind        trouble on the waters o the oxus  then as a table broke under the furious accompaniment       hurrah hurrah its north by west we go      hurrah hurrah the chance we wanted so      let em hear the chorus from umballa to moscow      as we go marchin to the kremling  mother of all the saints in bliss and all the devils in cinders wheres my fine new sock widout the heel howled horse egan ransacking everybodys valise but his own he was engaged in making up deficiencies of kit preparatory to a campaign and in that work he steals best who steals last ah mulcahy youre in good time he shouted weve got the route and were off on thursday for a picnic wid the lancers next door  an ambulance orderly appeared with a huge basket full of lint rolls provided by the forethought of the queen for such as might need them later on horse egan unrolled his bandage and flicked it under mulcahys nose chanting      sheepskin an bees wax thunder pitch and plaster      the more you try to pull it off the more it sticks the faster      as i was goin to new orleans  you know the rest of it my irish americanjew boy by gad ye have to fight for the queen in the inside av a fortnight my darlin  a roar of laughter interrupted mulcahy looked vacantly down the room bid a boy defy his father when the pantomimecab is at the door or a girl develop a will of her own when her mother is putting the last touches to the first balldress but do not ask an irish regiment to embark upon mutiny on the eve of a campaign when it has fraternised with the native regiment that accompanies it and driven its officers into retirement with ten thousand clamorous questions and the prisoners dance for joy and the sick men stand in the open calling down all known diseases on the head of the doctor who has certified that they are medically unfit for active service at even the mavericks might have been mistaken for mutineers by one so unversed in their natures as mulcahy at dawn a girls school might have learned deportment from them they knew that their colonels hand had closed and that he who broke that iron discipline would not go to the front nothing in the world will persuade one of our soldiers when he is ordered to the north on the smallest of affairs that he is not immediately going gloriously to slay cossacks and cook his kettles in the palace of the czar a few of the younger men mourned for mulcahys beer because the campaign was to be conducted on strict temperance principles but as dan and horse egan said sternly weve got the beerman with us he shall drink now on his own hook  mulcahy had not taken into account the possibility of being sent on active service he had made up his mind that he would not go under any circumstances but fortune was against him  sickyou said the doctor who had served an unholy apprenticeship to his trade in tralee poorhouses youre only homesick and what you call varicose veins come from overeating a little gentle exercise will cure that and later mulcahy my man everybody is allowed to apply for a sickcertificate once if he tries it twice we call him by an ugly name go back to your duty and lets hear no more of your diseases  i am ashamed to say that horse egan enjoyed the study of mulcahys soul in those days and dan took an equal interest together they would communicate to their corporal all the dark lore of death which is the portion of those who have seen men die egan had the larger experience but dan the finer imagination mulcahy shivered when the former spoke of the knife as an intimate acquaintance or the latter dwelt with loving particularity on the fate of those who wounded and helpless had been overlooked by the ambulances and had fallen into the hands of the afghan womenfolk  mulcahy knew that the mutiny for the present at least was dead knew too that a change had come over dans usually respectful attitude towards him and horse egans laughter and frequent allusions to abortive conspiracies emphasised all that the conspirator had guessed the horrible fascination of the deathstories however made him seek the mens society he learnt much more than he had bargained for and in this manner it was on the last night before the regiment entrained to the front the barracks were stripped of everything movable and the men were too excited to sleep the bare walls gave out a heavy hospital smell of chloride of lime  and what said mulcahy in an awestricken whisper after some conversation on the eternal subject are you going to do to me dan this might have been the language of an able conspirator conciliating a weak spirit  youll see said dan grimly turning over in his cot or i rather shud say youll not see  this was hardly the language of a weak spirit mulcahy shook under the bedclothes  be easy with him put in egan from the next cot he has got his chanst o goin clean listen mulcahy all we want is for the good sake of the regiment that you take your death standing up as a man shud there be heaps an heaps of enemyplenshus heaps go there an do all you can and die decent youll die with a good name there tis not a hard thing considerin  again mulcahy shivered  an how could a man wish to die better than fightin added dan consolingly  and if i wont said the corporal in a dry whisper  therell be a dale of smoke returned dan sitting up and ticking off the situation on his fingers sure to be an the noise of the firin ll be tremenjus an well be running about up and down the regiment will but we horse and iwell stay by you mulcahy and never let you go maybe therell be an accident  its playing it low on me let me go for pitys sake let me go i never did you harm andand i stood you as much beer as i could oh dont be hard on me dan you areyou were in it too you wont kill me up there will you  im not thinkin of the treason though you shud be glad any honest boys drank with you its for the regiment we cant have the shame o you bringin shame on us you went to the doctor quiet as a sick cat to get and stay behind an live with the women at the depotyou that wanted us to run to the sea in wolfpacks like the rebels none of your black blood dared to be but we knew about your goin to the doctor for he told in mess and its all over the regiment bein as we are your best friends we didnt allow any one to molest you yet we will see to you ourselves fight which you willus or the enemyyoull never lie in that cot again and theres more glory and maybe less kicks from fightin the enemy thats fair speakin  and he told us by word of mouth to go and join with the niggersyouve forgotten that dan said horse egan to justify sentence  whats the use of plaguin the man one shot pays for all sleep ye sound mulcahy but you onderstand do ye not  mulcahy for some weeks understood very little of anything at all save that ever at his elbow in camp or at parade stood two big men with soft voices adjuring him to commit harikari lest a worse thing should happento die for the honour of the regiment in decency among the nearest knives but mulcahy dreaded death he remembered certain things that priests had said in his infancy and his mothernot the one at new yorkstarting from her sleep with shrieks to pray for a husbands soul in torment it is well to be of a cultured intelligence but in time of trouble the weak human mind returns to the creed it sucked in at the breast and if that creed be not a pretty one trouble follows also the death he would have to face would be physically painful most conspirators have large imaginations mulcahy could see himself as he lay on the earth in the night dying by various causes they were all horrible the mother in new york was very far away and the regiment the engine that once you fall in its grip moves you forward whether you will or wont was daily coming closer to the enemy  they were brought to the field of marzunkatai and with the black boneens to aid they fought a fight that has never been set down in the newspapers in response many believe to the fervent prayers of father dennis the enemy not only elected to fight in the open but made a beautiful fight as many weeping irish mothers knew later they gathered behind walls or flickered across the open in shouting masses and were potvaliant in artillery it was expedient to hold a large reserve and wait for the psychological moment that was being prepared by the shrieking shrapnel therefore the mavericks lay down in open order on the brow of a hill to watch the play till their call should come father dennis whose duty was in the rear to smooth the trouble of the wounded had naturally managed to make his way to the foremost of his boys and lay like a black porpoise at length on the grass to him crawled mulcahy ashengray demanding absolution  wait till youre shot said father dennis sweetly theres a time for everything  dan grady chuckled as he blew for the fiftieth time into the breech of his speckless rifle mulcahy groaned and buried his head in his arms till a stray shot spoke like a snipe immediately above his head and a general heave and tremour rippled the line other shots followed and a few took effect as a shriek or a grunt attested the officers who had been lying down with the men rose and began to walk steadily up and down the front of their companies  this manoeuvre executed not for publication but as a guarantee of good faith to soothe men demands nerve you must not hurry you must not look nervous though you know that you are a mark for every rifle within extreme range and above all if you are smitten you must make as little noise as possible and roll inwards through the files it is at this hour when the breeze brings the first salt whiff of the powder to noses rather cold at the tip and the eye can quietly take in the appearance of each red casualty that the strain on the nerves is strongest scotch regiments can endure for half a day and abate no whit of their zeal at the end english regiments sometimes sulk under punishment while the irish like the french are apt to run forward by ones and twos which is just as bad as running back the truly wise commandant of highly strung troops allows them in seasons of waiting to hear the sound of their own voices uplifted in song there is a legend of an english regiment that lay by its arms under fire chaunting sam hall to the horror of its newly appointed and pious colonel the black boneens who were suffering more than the mavericks on a hill half a mile away began presently to explain to all who cared to listen   well sound the jubilee from the centre to the sea and ireland shall be free says the shanvan vogh  sing boys said father dennis softly it looks as if we cared for their afghan peas  dan grady raised himself to his knees and opened his mouth in a song imparted to him as to most of his comrades in the strictest confidence by mulcahythe mulcahy then lying limp and fainting on the grass the chill fear of death upon him  company after company caught up the words which the i a a say are to herald the general rising of erin and to breathe which except to those duly appointed to hear is death wherefore they are printed in this place       the saxon in heavens just balance is weighed        his doom like belshazzars in death has been cast      and the hand of the venger shall never be stayed        till his race faith and speech are a dream of the past  they were heartfilling lines and they ran with a swirl the i a a are better served by their pens than their petards dan clapped mulcahy merrily on the back asking him to sing up the officers lay down again there was no need to walk any more their men were soothing themselves thunderously thus       st mary in heaven has written the vow        that the land shall not rest till the heretic blood      from the babe at the breast to the hand at the plough        has rolled to the ocean like shannon in flood  ill speak to you after alls over said father dennis authoritatively in dans ear whats the use of confessing to me when you do this foolishness dan youve been playing with fire ill lay you more penance in a week than  come along to purgatory with us father dear the boneens are on the move theyll let us go now  the regiment rose to the blast of the bugle as one man but one man there was who rose more swiftly than all the others for half an inch of bayonet was in the fleshy part of his leg  youve got to do it said dan grimly do it decent anyhow and the roar of the rush drowned his words for the rear companies thrust forward the first still singing as they swung down the slope  from the child at the breast to the hand at the plough shall roll to the ocean like shannon in flood  they should have sung it in the face of england not of the afghans whom it impressed as much as did the wild irish yell  they came down singing said the unofficial report of the enemy borne from village to village the next day they continued to sing and it was written that our men could not abide when they came it is believed that there was magic in the aforesaid song  dan and horse egan kept themselves in the neighbourhood of mulcahy twice the man would have bolted back in the confusion twice he was heaved kicked and shouldered back again into the unpaintable inferno of a hotly contested charge  at the end the panic excess of his fear drove him into madness beyond all human courage his eyes staring at nothing his mouth open and frothing and breathing as one in a cold bath he went forward demented while dan toiled after him the charge checked at a high mud wall it was mulcahy who scrambled up tooth and nail and hurled down among the bayonets the amazed afghan who barred his way it was mulcahy keeping to the straight line of the rabid dog who led a collection of ardent souls at a newly unmasked battery and flung himself on the muzzle of a gun as his companions danced among the gunners it was mulcahy who ran wildly on from that battery into the open plain where the enemy were retiring in sullen groups his hands were empty he had lost helmet and belt and he was bleeding from a wound in the neck dan and horse egan panting and distressed had thrown themselves down on the ground by the captured guns when they noticed mulcahys charge  mad said horse egan critically mad with fear hes going straight to his death an shoutings no use  let him go watch now if we fire well hit him maybe  the last of a hurrying crowd of afghans turned at the noise of shod feet behind him and shifted his knife ready to hand this he saw was no time to take prisoners mulcahy tore on sobbing the straightheld blade went home through the defenceless breast and the body pitched forward almost before a shot from dans rifle brought down the slayer and still further hurried the afghan retreat the two irishmen went out to bring in their dead  he was given the point and that was an easy death said horse egan viewing the corpse but would you ha shot him danny if he had lived  he didnt live so theres no sayin but i doubt i wud have bekase of the fun he gave uslet alone the beer hike up his legs horse and well bring him in perhaps tis better this way  they bore the poor limp body to the mass of the regiment lolling open mouthed on their rifles and there was a general snigger when one of the younger subalterns said that was a good man  phew said horse egan when a burialparty had taken over the burden im powerful dhry and this reminds me therell be no more beer at all  fwhy not said dan with a twinkle in his eye as he stretched himself for rest are we not conspirin all we can an while we conspire are we not entitled to free dhrinks sure his ould mother in new york would not let her sons comrades perish of drouthif she can be reached at the end of a letter  youre a janius said horse egan o coorse she will not i wish this crool war was over an wed get back to canteen faith the commander inchief ought to be hanged in his own little swordbelt for makin us work on wather  the mavericks were generally of horse egans opinion so they made haste to get their work done as soon as possible and their industry was rewarded by unexpected peace we can fight the sons of adam said the tribesmen but we cannot fight the sons of eblis and this regiment never stays still in one place let us therefore come in they came in and this regiment withdrew to conspire under the leadership of dan grady  excellent as a subordinate dan failed altogether as a chiefincommand possibly because he was too much swayed by the advice of the only man in the regiment who could manufacture more than one kind of handwriting the same mail that bore to mulcahys mother in new york a letter from the colonel telling her how valiantly her son had fought for the queen and how assuredly he would have been recommended for the victoria cross had he survived carried a communication signed i grieve to say by that same colonel and all the officers of the regiment explaining their willingness to do anything which is contrary to the regulations and all kinds of revolutions if only a little money could be forwarded to cover incidental expenses daniel grady esquire would receive funds vice mulcahy who was unwell at this present time of writing  both letters were forwarded from new york to tehama street san francisco with marginal comments as brief as they were bitter the third three read and looked at each other then the second conspirator he who believed in joining hands with the practical branchesbegan to laugh and on recovering his gravity said gentlemen i consider this will be a lesson to us were left again those cursed irish have let us down i knew they would buthere he laughed afreshid give considerable to know what was at the back of it all  his curiosity would have been satisfied had he seen dan grady discredited regimental conspirator trying to explain to his thirsty comrades in india the nonarrival of funds from new york     the mark of the beast   your gods and my godsdo you or i know which are the stronger native proverb  east of suez some hold the direct control of providence ceases man being there handed over to the power of the gods and devils of asia and the church of england providence only exercising an occasional and modified supervision in the case of englishmen  this theory accounts for some of the more unnecessary horrors of life in india it may be stretched to explain my story  my friend strickland of the police who knows as much of natives of india as is good for any man can bear witness to the facts of the case dumoise our doctor also saw what strickland and i saw the inference which he drew from the evidence was entirely incorrect he is dead now he died in a rather curious manner which has been elsewhere described  when fleete came to india he owned a little money and some land in the himalayas near a place called dharmsala both properties had been left him by an uncle and he came out to finance them he was a big heavy genial and inoffensive man his knowledge of natives was of course limited and he complained of the difficulties of the language  he rode in from his place in the hills to spend new year in the station and he stayed with strickland on new years eve there was a big dinner at the club and the night was excusably wet when men foregather from the uttermost ends of the empire they have a right to be riotous the frontier had sent down a contingent o catchemaliveos who had not seen twenty white faces for a year and were used to ride fifteen miles to dinner at the next fort at the risk of a khyberee bullet where their drinks should lie they profited by their new security for they tried to play pool with a curledup hedgehog found in the garden and one of them carried the marker round the room in his teeth half a dozen planters had come in from the south and were talking horse to the biggest liar in asia who was trying to cap all their stories at once everybody was there and there was a general closing up of ranks and taking stock of our losses in dead or disabled that had fallen during the past year it was a very wet night and i remember that we sang auld lang syne with our feet in the polo championship cup and our heads among the stars and swore that we were all dear friends then some of us went away and annexed burma and some tried to open up the soudan and were opened up by fuzzies in that cruel scrub outside suakim and some found stars and medals and some were married which was bad and some did other things which were worse and the others of us stayed in our chains and strove to make money on insufficient experiences  fleete began the night with sherry and bitters drank champagne steadily up to dessert then raw rasping capri with all the strength of whisky took benedictine with his coffee four or five whiskies and sodas to improve his pool strokes beer and bones at halfpast two winding up with old brandy consequently when he came out at halfpast three in the morning into fourteen degrees of frost he was very angry with his horse for coughing and tried to leapfrog into the saddle the horse broke away and went to his stables so strickland and i formed a guard of dishonour to take fleete home  our road lay through the bazaar close to a little temple of hanuman the monkeygod who is a leading divinity worthy of respect all gods have good points just as have all priests personally i attach much importance to hanuman and am kind to his peoplethe great gray apes of the hills one never knows when one may want a friend  there was a light in the temple and as we passed we could hear voices of men chanting hymns in a native temple the priests rise at all hours of the night to do honour to their god before we could stop him fleete dashed up the steps patted two priests on the back and was gravely grinding the ashes of his cigarbutt into the forehead of the red stone image of hanuman strickland tried to drag him out but he sat down and said solemnly  shee that mark of the bbeasht i made it ishnt it fine  in half a minute the temple was alive and noisy and strickland who knew what came of polluting gods said that things might occur he by virtue of his official position long residence in the country and weakness for going among the natives was known to the priests and he felt unhappy fleete sat on the ground and refused to move he said that good old hanuman made a very soft pillow  then without any warning a silver man came out of a recess behind the image of the god he was perfectly naked in that bitter bitter cold and his body shone like frosted silver for he was what the bible calls a leper as white as snow also he had no face because he was a leper of some years standing and his disease was heavy upon him we two stooped to haul fleete up and the temple was filling and filling with folk who seemed to spring from the earth when the silver man ran in under our arms making a noise exactly like the mewing of an otter caught fleete round the body and dropped his head on fleetes breast before we could wrench him away then he retired to a corner and sat mewing while the crowd blocked all the doors  the priests were very angry until the silver man touched fleete that nuzzling seemed to sober them  at the end of a few minutes silence one of the priests came to strickland and said in perfect english take your friend away he has done with hanuman but hanurnan has not done with him the crowd gave room and we carried fleete into the road  strickland was very angry he said that we might all three have been knifed and that fleete should thank his stars that he had escaped without injury  fleete thanked no one he said that he wanted to go to bed he was gorgeously drunk  we moved on strickland silent and wrathful until fleete was taken with violent shivering fits and sweating he said that the smells of the bazaar were overpowering and he wondered why slaughterhouses were permitted so near english residences cant you smell the blood said fleete  we put him to bed at last just as the dawn was breaking and strickland invited me to have another whisky and soda while we were drinking he talked of the trouble in the temple and admitted that it baffled him completely strickland hates being mystified by natives because his business in life is to overmatch them with their own weapons he has not yet succeeded in doing this but in fifteen or twenty years he will have made some small progress  they should have mauled us he said instead of mewing at us i wonder what they meant i dont like it one little bit  i said that the managing committee of the temple would in all probability bring a criminal action against us for insulting their religion there was a section of the indian penal code which exactly met fleetes offence strickland said he only hoped and prayed that they would do this before i left i looked into fleetes room and saw him lying on his right side scratching his left breast then i went to bed cold depressed and unhappy at seven oclock in the morning  at one oclock i rode over to stricklands house to inquire after fleetes head i imagined that it would be a sore one fleete was breakfasting and seemed unwell his temper was gone for he was abusing the cook for not supplying him with an underdone chop a man who can eat raw meat after a wet night is a curiosity i told fleete this and he laughed  you breed queer mosquitoes in these parts he said ive been bitten to pieces but only in one place  lets have a look at the bite said strickland it may have gone down since this morning  while the chops were being cooked fleete opened his shirt and showed us just over his left breast a mark the perfect double of the black rosettesthe five or six irregular blotches arranged in a circleon a leopards hide strickland looked and said it was only pink this morning its grown black now  fleete ran to a glass  by jove he said this is nasty what is it  we could not answer here the chops came in all red and juicy and fleete bolted three in a most offensive manner he ate on his right grinders only and threw his head over his right shoulder as he snapped the meat when he had finished it struck him that he had been behaving strangely for he said apologetically i dont think i ever felt so hungry in my life ive bolted like an ostrich  after breakfast strickland said to me dont go stay here and stay for the night  seeing that my house was not three miles from stricklands this request was absurd but strickland insisted and was going to say something when fleete interrupted by declaring in a shamefaced way that he felt hungry again strickland sent a man to my house to fetch over my bedding and a horse and we three went down to stricklands stables to pass the hours until it was time to go out for a ride the man who has a weakness for horses never wearies of inspecting them and when two men are killing time in this way they gather knowledge and lies the one from the other  there were five horses in the stables and i shall never forget the scene as we tried to look them over they seemed to have gone mad they reared and screamed and nearly tore up their pickets they sweated and shivered and lathered and were distraught with fear stricklands horses used to know him as well as his dogs which made the matter more curious we left the stable for fear of the brutes throwing themselves in their panic then strickland turned back and called me the horses were still frightened but they let us gentle and make much of them and put their heads in our bosoms  they arent afraid of us said strickland dyou know id give three months pay if outrage here could talk  but outrage was dumb and could only cuddle up to his master and blow out his nostrils as is the custom of horses when they wish to explain things but cant fleete came up when we were in the stalls and as soon as the horses saw him their fright broke out afresh it was all that we could do to escape from the place unkicked strickland said they dont seem to love you fleete  nonsense said fleetemy mare will follow me like a dog he went to her she was in a loosebox but as he slipped the bars she plunged knocked him down and broke away into the garden i laughed but strickland was not amused he took his moustache in both fists and pulled at it till it nearly came out fleete instead of going off to chase his property yawned saying that he felt sleepy he went to the house to lie down which was a foolish way of spending new years day  strickland sat with me in the stables and asked if i had noticed anything peculiar in fleetes manner i said that he ate his food like a beast but that this might have been the result of living alone in the hills out of the reach of society as refined and elevating as ours for instance strickland was not amused i do not think that he listened to me for his next sentence referred to the mark on fleetes breast and i said that it might have been caused by blisterflies or that it was possibly a birthmark newly born and now visible for the first time we both agreed that it was unpleasant to look at and strickland found occasion to say that i was a fool  i cant tell you what i think now said he because you would call me a madman but you must stay with me for the next few days if you can i want you to watch fleete but dont tell me what you think till i have made up my mind  but i am dining out tonight i said so am i said strickland and so is fleete at least if he doesnt change his mind  we walked about the garden smoking but saying nothingbecause we were friends and talking spoils good tobaccotill our pipes were out then we went to wake up fleete he was wide awake and fidgeting about his room  i say i want some more chops he said can i get them  we laughed and said go and change the ponies will be round in a minute  all right said fleete ill go when i get the chopsunderdone ones mind  he seemed to be quite in earnest it was four oclock and we had had breakfast at one still for a long time he demanded those underdone chops then he changed into riding clothes and went out into the verandah his ponythe mare had not been caughtwould not let him come near all three horses were unmanageablemad with fearand finally fleete said that he would stay at home and get something to eat strickland and i rode out wondering as we passed the temple of hanuman the silver man came out and mewed at us  he is not one of the regular priests of the temple said strickland i think i should peculiarly like to lay my hands on him  there was no spring in our gallop on the racecourse that evening the horses were stale and moved as though they had been ridden out  the fright after breakfast has been too much for them said strickland  that was the only remark he made through the remainder of the ride once or twice i think he swore to himself but that did not count  we came back in the dark at seven oclock and saw that there were no lights in the bungalow careless ruffians my servants are said strickland  my horse reared at something on the carriage drive and fleete stood up under its nose  what are you doing grovelling about the garden said strickland  but both horses bolted and nearly threw us we dismounted by the stables and returned to fleete who was on his hands and knees under the orange bushes  what the devils wrong with you said strickland  nothing nothing in the world said fleete speaking very quickly and thickly ive been gardeningbotanising you know the smell of the earth is delightful i think im going for a walka long walkall night  then i saw that there was something excessively out of order somewhere and i said to strickland i am not dining out  bless you said strickland here fleete get up youll catch fever there come in to dinner and lets have the lamps lit we ll all dine at home  fleete stood up unwillingly and said no lampsno lamps its much nicer here lets dine outside and have some more chopslots of em and underdonebloody ones with gristle  now a december evening in northern india is bitterly cold and fleetes suggestion was that of a maniac  come in said strickland sternly come in at once  fleete came and when the lamps were brought we saw that he was literally plastered with dirt from head to foot he must have been rolling in the garden he shrank from the light and went to his room his eyes were horrible to look at there was a green light behind them not in them if you understand and the mans lower lip hung down  strickland said there is going to be troublebig troubletonight dont you change your ridingthings  we waited and waited for fleetes reappearance and ordered dinner in the meantime we could hear him moving about his own room but there was no light there presently from the room came the longdrawn howl of a wolf  people write and talk lightly of blood running cold and hair standing up and things of that kind both sensations are too horrible to be trifled with my heart stopped as though a knife had been driven through it and strickland turned as white as the tablecloth  the howl was repeated and was answered by another howl far across the fields  that set the gilded roof on the horror strickland dashed into fleetes room i followed and we saw fleete getting out of the window he made beastnoises in the back of his throat he could not answer us when we shouted at him he spat  i dont quite remember what followed but i think that strickland must have stunned him with the long bootjack or else i should never have been able to sit on his chest fleete could not speak he could only snarl and his snarls were those of a wolf not of a man the human spirit must have been giving way all day and have died out with the twilight we were dealing with a beast that had once been fleete  the affair was beyond any human and rational experience i tried to say hydrophobia but the word wouldnt come because i knew that i was lying  we bound this beast with leather thongs of the punkahrope and tied its thumbs and big toes together and gagged it with a shoehorn which makes a very efficient gag if you know how to arrange it then we carried it into the diningroom and sent a man to dumoise the doctor telling him to come over at once after we had despatched the messenger and were drawing breath strickland said its no good this isnt any doctors work i also knew that he spoke the truth  the beasts head was free and it threw it about from side to side any one entering the room would have believed that we were curing a wolfs pelt that was the most loathsome accessory of all  strickland sat with his chin in the heel of his fist watching the beast as it wriggled on the ground but saying nothing the shirt had been torn open in the scuffle and showed the black rosette mark on the left breast it stood out like a blister  in the silence of the watching we heard something without mewing like a sheotter we both rose to our feet and i answer for myself not strickland felt sickactually and physically sick we told each other as did the men in pinafore that it was the cat  dumoise arrived and i never saw a little man so unprofessionally shocked he said that it was a heartrending case of hydrophobia and that nothing could be done at least any palliative measures would only prolong the agony the beast was foaming at the mouth fleete as we told dumoise had been bitten by dogs once or twice any man who keeps half a dozen terriers must expect a nip now and again dumoise could offer no help he could only certify that fleete was dying of hydrophobia the beast was then howling for it had managed to spit out the shoehorn dumoise said that he would be ready to certify to the cause of death and that the end was certain he was a good little man and he offered to remain with us but strickland refused the kindness he did not wish to poison dumoises new year he would only ask him not to give the real cause of fleetes death to the public  so dumoise left deeply agitated and as soon as the noise of the cart wheels had died away strickland told me in a whisper his suspicions they were so wildly improbable that he dared not say them out aloud and i who entertained all stricklands beliefs was so ashamed of owning to them that i pretended to disbelieve  even if the silver man had bewtiched fleete for polluting the image of hanuman the punishment could not have fallen so quickly  as i was whispering this the cry outside the house rose again and the beast fell into a fresh paroxysm of struggling till we were afraid that the thongs that held it would give way  watch said strickland if this happens six times i shall take the law into my own hands i order you to help me  he went into his room and came out in a few minutes with the barrels of an old shotgun a piece of fishingline some thick cord and his heavy wooden bedstead i reported that the convulsions had followed the cry by two seconds in each case and the beast seemed perceptibly weaker  strickland muttered but he cant take away the life he cant take away the life  i said though i knew that i was arguing against myself it may be a cat it must be a cat if the silver man is responsible why does he dare to come here  strickland arranged the wood on the hearth put the gunbarrels into the glow of the fire spread the twine on the table and broke a walking stick in two there was one yard of fishing line gut lapped with wire such as is used for mahseerfishing and he tied the two ends together in a loop  then he said how can we catch him he must be taken alive and unhurt  i said that we must trust in providence and go out softly with polo sticks into the shrubbery at the front of the house the man or animal that made the cry was evidently moving round the house as regularly as a nightwatchman we could wait in the bushes till he came by and knock him over  strickland accepted this suggestion and we slipped out from a bathroom window into the front verandah and then across the carriage drive into the bushes  in the moonlight we could see the leper coming round the corner of the house he was perfectly naked and from time to time he mewed and stopped to dance with his shadow it was an unattractive sight and thinking of poor fleete brought to such degradation by so foul a creature i put away all my doubts and resolved to help strickland from the heated gunbarrels to the loop of twinefrom the loins to the head and back againwith all tortures that might be needful  the leper halted in the front porch for a moment and we jumped out on him with the sticks he was wonderfully strong and we were afraid that he might escape or be fatally injured before we caught him we had an idea that lepers were frail creatures but this proved to be incorrect strickland knocked his legs from under him and i put my foot on his neck he mewed hideously and even through my ridingboots i could feel that his flesh was not the flesh of a clean man  he struck at us with his hand and feetstumps we looped the lash of a dogwhip round him under the armpits and dragged him backwards into the hall and so into the diningroom where the beast lay there we tied him with trunkstraps he made no attempt to escape but mewed  when we confronted him with the beast the scene was beyond description the beast doubled backwards into a bow as though he had been poisoned with strychnine and moaned in the most pitiable fashion several other things happened also but they cannot be put down here  i think i was right said strickland now we will ask him to cure this case  but the leper only mewed strickland wrapped a towel round his hand and took the gunbarrels out of the fire i put the half of the broken walking stick through the loop of fishingline and buckled the leper comfortably to stricklands bedstead i understood then how men and women and little children can endure to see a witch burnt alive for the beast was moaning on the floor and though the silver man had no face you could see horrible feelings passing through the slab that took its place exactly as waves of heat play across redhot irongunbarrels for instance  strickland shaded his eyes with his hands for a moment and we got to work this part is not to be printed  the dawn was beginning to break when the leper spoke his mewings had not been satisfactory up to that point the beast had fainted from exhaustion and the house was very still we unstrapped the leper and told him to take away the evil spirit he crawled to the beast and laid his hand upon the left breast that was all then he fell face down and whined drawing in his breath as he did so  we watched the face of the beast and saw the soul of fleete coming back into the eyes then a sweat broke out on the forehead and the eyesthey were human eyesclosed we waited for an hour but fleete still slept we carried him to his room and bade the leper go giving him the bedstead and the sheet on the bedstead to cover his nakedness the gloves and the towels with which we had touched him and the whip that had been hooked round his body he put the sheet about him and went out into the early morning without speaking or mewing  strickland wiped his face and sat down a nightgong far away in the city made seven oclock  exactly fourandtwenty hours said strickland and ive done enough to ensure my dismissal from the service besides permanent quarters in a lunatic asylum do you believe that we are awake  the redhot gunbarrel had fallen on the floor and was singeing the carpet the smell was entirely real  that morning at eleven we two together went to wake up fleete we looked and saw that the black leopardrosette on his chest had disappeared he was very drowsy and tired but as soon as he saw us he said oh confound you fellows happy new year to you never mix your liquors im nearly dead  thanks for your kindness but youre over time said strickland to day is the morning of the second youve slept the clock round with a vengeance  the door opened and little dumoise put his head in he had come on foot and fancied that we were laving out fleete  ive brought a nurse said dumoise i suppose that she can come in for what is necessary  by all means said fleete cheerily sitting up in bed bring on your nurses  dumoise was dumb strickland led him out and explained that there must have been a mistake in the diagnosis dumoise remained dumb and left the house hastily he considered that his professional reputation had been injured and was inclined to make a personal matter of the recovery strickland went out too when he came back he said that he had been to call on the temple of hanuman to offer redress for the pollution of the god and had been solemnly assured that no white man had ever touched the idol and that he was an incarnation of all the virtues labouring under a delusion  what do you think said strickland  i said there are more things     but strickland hates that quotation he says that i have worn it threadbare  one other curious thing happened which frightened me as much as anything in all the nights work when fleete was dressed he came into the diningroom and sniffed he had a quaint trick of moving his nose when he sniffed horrid doggy smell here said he you should really keep those terriers of yours in better order try sulphur strick  but strickland did not answer he caught hold of the back of a chair and without warning went into an amazing fit of hysterics it is terrible to see a strong man overtaken with hysteria then it struck me that we had fought for fleetes soul with the silver man in that room and had disgraced ourselves as englishmen for ever and i laughed and gasped and gurgled just as shamefully as strickland while fleete thought that we had both gone mad we never told him what we had done  some years later when strickland had married and was a churchgoing member of society for his wifes sake we reviewed the incident dispassionately and strickland suggested that i should put it before the public  i cannot myself see that this step is likely to clear up the mystery because in the first place no one will believe a rather unpleasant story and in the second it is well known to every rightminded man that the gods of the heathen are stone and brass and any attempt to deal with them otherwise is justly condemned     the return of imray    the doors were wide the story saith  out of the night came the patient wraith  he might not speak and he could not stir  a hair of the barons minniver  speechless and strengthless a shadow thin  he roved the castle to seek his kin  and ohtwas a piteous thing to see  the dumb ghost follow his enemy                              the baron  imray achieved the impossible without warning for no conceivable motive in his youth at the threshold of his career he chose to disappear from the worldwhich is to say the little indian station where he lived  upon a day he was alive well happy and in great evidence among the billiardtables at his club upon a morning he was not and no manner of search could make sure where he might be he had stepped out of his place he had not appeared at his office at the proper time and his dogcart was not upon the public roads for these reasons and because he was hampering in a microscopical degree the administration of the indian empire that empire paused for one microscopical moment to make inquiry into the fate of imray ponds were dragged wells were plumbed telegrams were despatched down the lines of railways and to the nearest seaport towntwelve hundred miles away but imray was not at the end of the dragropes nor the telegraph wires he was gone and his place knew him no more  then the work of the great indian empire swept forward because it could not be delayed and imray from being a man became a mysterysuch a thing as men talk over at their tables in the club for a month and then forget utterly his guns horses and carts were sold to the highest bidder his superior officer wrote an altogether absurd letter to his mother saying that imray had unaccountably disappeared and his bungalow stood empty  after three or four months of the scorching hot weather had gone by my friend strickland of the police saw fit to rent the bungalow from the native landlord this was before he was engaged to miss youghalan affair which has been described in another placeand while he was pursuing his investigations into native life his own life was sufficiently peculiar and men complained of his manners and customs there was always food in his house but there were no regular times for meals he ate standing up and walking about whatever he might find at the sideboard and this is not good for human beings his domestic equipment was limited to six rifles three shotguns five saddles and a collection of stiffjointed mahseerrods bigger and stronger than the largest salmonrods these occupied onehalf of his bungalow and the other half was given up to strickland and his dog tietjensan enormous rampur slut who devoured daily the rations of two men she spoke to strickland in a language of her own and whenever walking abroad she saw things calculated to destroy the peace of her majesty the queen empress she returned to her master and laid information strickland would take steps at once and the end of his labours was trouble and fine and imprisonment for other people the natives believed that tietjens was a familiar spirit and treated her with the great reverence that is born of hate and fear one room in the bungalow was set apart for her special use she owned a bedstead a blanket and a drinking trough and if any one came into stricklands room at night her custom was to knock down the invader and give tongue till some one came with a light strickland owed his life to her when he was on the frontier in search of a local murderer who came in the gray dawn to send strickland much farther than the andaman islands tietjens caught the man as he was crawling into stricklands tent with a dagger between his teeth and after his record of iniquity was established in the eyes of the law he was hanged from that date tietjens wore a collar of rough silver and employed a monogram on her nightblanket and the blanket was of double woven kashmir cloth for she was a delicate dog  under no circumstances would she be separated from strickland and once when he was ill with fever made great trouble for the doctors because she did not know how to help her master and would not allow another creature to attempt aid macarnaght of the indian medical service beat her over her head with a gunbutt before she could understand that she must give room for those who could give quinine  a short time after strickland had taken imrays bungalow my business took me through that station and naturally the club quarters being full i quartered myself upon strickland it was a desirable bungalow eightroomed and heavily thatched against any chance of leakage from rain under the pitch of the roof ran a ceilingcloth which looked just as neat as a whitewashed ceiling the landlord had repainted it when strickland took the bungalow unless you knew how indian bungalows were built you would never have suspected that above the cloth lay the dark threecornered cavern of the roof where the beams and the underside of the thatch harboured all manner of rats bats ants and foul things  tietjens met me in the verandah with a bay like the boom of the bell of st pauls putting her paws on my shoulder to show she was glad to see me strickland had contrived to claw together a sort of meal which he called lunch and immediately after it was finished went out about his business i was left alone with tietjens and my own affairs the heat of the summer had broken up and turned to the warm damp of the rains there was no motion in the heated air but the rain fell like ramrods on the earth and flung up a blue mist when it splashed back the bamboos and the custardapples the poinsettias and the mangotrees in the garden stood still while the warm water lashed through them and the frogs began to sing among the aloe hedges a little before the light failed and when the rain was at its worst i sat in the back verandah and heard the water roar from the eaves and scratched myself because i was covered with the thing called pricklyheat tietjens came out with me and put her head in my lap and was very sorrowful so i gave her biscuits when tea was ready and i took tea in the back verandah on account of the little coolness found there the rooms of the house were dark behind me i could smell stricklands saddlery and the oil on his guns and i had no desire to sit among these things my own servant came to me in the twilight the muslin of his clothes clinging tightly to his drenched body and told me that a gentleman had called and wished to see some one very much against my will but only because of the darkness of the rooms i went into the naked drawingroom telling my man to bring the lights there might or might not have been a caller waitingit seemed to me that i saw a figure by one of the windowsbut when the lights came there was nothing save the spikes of the rain without and the smell of the drinking earth in my nostrils i explained to my servant that he was no wiser than he ought to be and went back to the verandah to talk to tietjens she had gone out into the wet and i could hardly coax her back to me even with biscuits with sugar tops strickland came home dripping wet just before dinner and the first thing he said was  has any one called  i explained with apologies that my servant had summoned me into the drawingroom on a false alarm or that some loafer had tried to call on strickland and thinking better of it had fled after giving his name strickiand ordered dinner without comment and since it was a real dinner with a white tablecloth attached we sat down  at nine oclock strickland wanted to go to bed and i was tired too tietjens who had been lying underneath the table rose up and swung into the least exposed verandah as soon as her master moved to his own room which was next to the stately chamber set apart for tietjens if a mere wife had wished to sleep out of doors in that pelting rain it would not have mattered but tietjens was a dog and therefore the better animal i looked at strickland expecting to see him flay her with a whip he smiled queerly as a man would smile after telling some unpleasant domestic tragedy she has done this ever since i moved in here said he let her go  the dog was stricklands dog so i said nothing but i felt all that strickland felt in being thus made light of tietjens encamped outside my bedroom window and storm after storm came up thundered on the thatch and died away the lightning spattered the sky as a thrown egg spatters a barndoor but the light was pale blue not yellow and looking through my split bamboo blinds i could see the great dog standing not sleeping in the verandah the hackles alift on her back and her feet anchored as tensely as the drawn wirerope of a suspension bridge in the very short pauses of the thunder i tried to sleep but it seemed that some one wanted me very urgently he whoever he was was trying to call me by name but his voice was no more than a husky whisper the thunder ceased and tietjens went into the garden and howled at the low moon somebody tried to open my door walked about and about through the house and stood breathing heavily in the verandahs and just when i was falling asleep i fancied that i heard a wild hammering and clamouring above my head or on the door  i ran into stricklands room and asked him whether he was ill and had been calling for me he was lying on his bed half dressed a pipe in his mouth i thought youd come he said have i been walking round the house recently  i explained that he had been tramping in the diningroom and the smokingroom and two or three other places and he laughed and told me to go back to bed i went back to bed and slept till the morning but through all my mixed dreams i was sure i was doing some one an injustice in not attending to his wants what those wants were i could not tell but a fluttering whispering boltfumbling lurking loitering someone was reproaching me for my slackness and half awake i heard the howling of tietjens in the garden and the threshing of the rain  i lived in that house for two days strickland went to his office daily leaving me alone for eight or ten hours with tietjens for my only companion as long as the full light lasted i was comfortable and so was tietjens but in the twilight she and i moved into the back verandah and cuddled each other for company we were alone in the house but none the less it was much too fully occupied by a tenant with whom i did not wish to interfere i never saw him but i could see the curtains between the rooms quivering where he had just passed through i could hear the chairs creaking as the bamboos sprung under a weight that had just quitted them and i could feel when i went to get a book from the diningroom that somebody was waiting in the shadows of the front verandah till i should have gone away tietjens made the twilight more interesting by glaring into the darkened rooms with every hair erect and following the motions of something that i could not see she never entered the rooms but her eyes moved interestedly that was quite sufficient only when my servant came to trim the lamps and make all light and habitable she would come in with me and spend her time sitting on her haunches watching an invisible extra man as he moved about behind my shoulder dogs are cheerful companions  i explained to strickland gently as might be that i would go over to the club and find for myself quarters there i admired his hospitality was pleased with his guns and rods but i did not much care for his house and its atmosphere he heard me out to the end and then smiled very wearily but without contempt for he is a man who understands things stay on he said and see what this thing means all you have talked about i have known since i took the bungalow stay on and wait tietjens has left me are you going too  i had seen him through one little affair connected with a heathen idol that had brought me to the doors of a lunatic asylum and i had no desire to help him through further experiences he was a man to whom unpleasantnesses arrived as do dinners to ordinary people  therefore i explained more clearly than ever that i liked him immensely and would be happy to see him in the daytime but that i did not care to sleep under his roof this was after dinner when tietjens had gone out to lie in the verandah  pon my soul i dont wonder said strickland with his eyes on the ceilingcloth look at that  the tails of two brown snakes were hanging between the cloth and the cornice of the wall they threw long shadows in the lamplight  if you are afraid of snakes of course said strickland  i hate and fear snakes because if you look into the eyes of any snake you will see that it knows all and more of the mystery of mans fall and that it feels all the contempt that the devil felt when adam was evicted from eden besides which its bite is generally fatal and it twists up trouser legs  you ought to get your thatch overhauled i said  give me a mahseerrod and well poke em down  theyll hide among the roofbeams said strickland i cant stand snakes overhead im going up into the roof if i shake em down stand by with a cleaningrod and break their backs  i was not anxious to assist strickland in his work but i took the cleaningrod and waited in the diningroom while strickland brought a gardeners ladder from the verandah and set it against the side of the room  the snaketails drew themselves up and disappeared we could hear the dry rushing scuttle of long bodies running over the baggy ceilingcloth strickland took a lamp with him while i tried to make clear to him the danger of hunting roofsnakes between a ceilingcloth and a thatch apart from the deterioration of property caused by ripping out ceiling cloths  nonsense said strickland theyre sure to hide near the walls by the cloth the bricks are too cold for em and the heat of the room is just what they like he put his hand to the corner of the stuff and ripped it from the cornice it gave with a great sound of tearing and strickland put his head through the opening into the dark of the angle of the roofbeams i set my teeth and lifted the rod for i had not the least knowledge of what might descend  hm said strickland and his voice rolled and rumbled in the roof theres room for another set of rooms up here and by jove some one is occupying em  snakes i said from below  no its a buffalo hand me up the two last joints of a mahseerrod and ill prod it its lying on the main roofbeam  i handed up the rod  what a nest for owls and serpents no wonder the snakes live here said strickland climbing farther into the roof i could see his elbow thrusting with the rod come out of that whoever you are heads below there its falling  i saw the ceilingcloth nearly in the centre of the room bag with a shape that was pressing it downwards and downwards towards the lighted lamp on the table i snatched the lamp out of danger and stood back then the cloth ripped out from the walls tore split swayed and shot down upon the table something that i dared not look at till strickland had slid down the ladder and was standing by my side  he did not say much being a man of few words but he picked up the loose end of the tablecloth and threw it over the remnants on the table  it strikes me said he putting down the lamp our friend imray has come back oh you would would you  there was a movement under the cloth and a little snake wriggled out to be backbroken by the butt of the mahseerrod i was sufficiently sick to make no remarks worth recording  strickland meditated and helped himself to drinks the arrangement under the cloth made no more signs of life  is it imray i said  strickland turned back the cloth for a moment and looked  it is imray he said and his throat is cut from ear to ear  then we spoke both together and to ourselves thats why he whispered about the house  tietjens in the garden began to bay furiously a little later her great nose heaved open the diningroom door  she sniffed and was still the tattered ceilingcloth hung down almost to the level of the table and there was hardly room to move away from the discovery  tietjens came in and sat down her teeth bared under her lip and her forepaws planted she looked at strickland  its a bad business old lady said he men dont climb up into the roofs of their bungalows to die and they dont fasten up the ceiling cloth behind em lets think it out  lets think it out somewhere else i said  excellent idea turn the lamps out well get into my room  i did not turn the lamps out i went into stricklands room first and allowed him to make the darkness then he followed me and we lit tobacco and thought strickland thought i smoked furiously because i was afraid  imray is back said strickland the question iswho killed imray dont talk ive a notion of my own when i took this bungalow i took over most of imrays servants imray was guileless and inoffensive wasnt he  i agreed though the heap under the cloth had looked neither one thing nor the other  if i call in all the servants they will stand fast in a crowd and lie like aryans what do you suggest  call em in one by one i said  theyll run away and give the news to all their fellows said strickland we must segregate em do you suppose your servant knows anything about it  he may for aught i know but i dont think its likely he has only been here two or three days i answered whats your notion  i cant quite tell how the dickens did the man get the wrong side of the ceilingcloth  there was a heavy coughing outside stricklands bedroom door this showed that bahadur khan his bodyservant had waked from sleep and wished to put strickland to bed  come in said strickland its a very warm night isnt it  bahadur khan a great greenturbaned sixfoot mahomedan said that it was a very warm night but that there was more rain pending which by his honours favour would bring relief to the country  it will be so if god pleases said strickland tugging off his boots it is in my mind bahadur khan that i have worked thee remorselessly for many daysever since that time when thou first earnest into my service what time was that  has the heavenborn forgotten it was when imray sahib went secretly to europe without warning given and ieven icame into the honoured service of the protector of the poor  and imray sahib went to europe  it is so said among those who were his servants  and thou wilt take service with him when he returns  assuredly sahib he was a good master and cherished his dependants  that is true i am very tired but i go buckshooting tomorrow give me the little sharp rifle that i use for blackbuck it is in the case yonder  the man stooped over the case handed barrels stock and foreend to strickland who fitted all together yawning dolefully then he reached down to the guncase took a soliddrawn cartridge and slipped it into the breech of the 360 express  and imray sahib has gone to europe secretly that is very strange bahadur khan is it not  what do i know of the ways of the white man heavenborn  very little truly but thou shalt know more anon it has reached me that imray sahib has returned from his so long journeyings and that even now he lies in the next room waiting his servant  sahib  the lamplight slid along the barrels of the rifle as they levelled themselves at bahadur khans broad breast  go and looksaid strickland take a lamp thy master is tired and he waits thee go  the man picked up a lamp and went into the diningroom strickland following and almost pushing him with the muzzle of the rifle he looked for a moment at the black depths behind the ceilingcloth at the writhing snake under foot and last a gray glaze settling on his face at the thing under the tablecloth  hast thou seen said strickland after a pause  i have seen i am clay in the white mans hands what does the presence do  hang thee within the month what else  for killing him nay sahib consider walking among us his servants he cast his eyes upon my child who was four years old him he bewitched and in ten days he died of the fevermy child  what said imray sahib  he said he was a handsome child and patted him on the head wherefore my child died wherefore i killed imray sahib in the twilight when he had come back from office and was sleeping wherefore i dragged him up into the roofbeams and made all fast behind him the heavenborn knows all things i am the servant of the heavenborn  strickland looked at me above the rifle and said in the vernacular thou art witness to this saying he has killed  bahadur khan stood ashen gray in the light of the one lamp the need for justification came upon him very swiftly i am trapped he said but the offence was that mans he cast an evil eye upon my child and i killed and hid him only such as are served by devils he glared at tietjens couched stolidly before him only such could know what i did  it was clever but thou shouldst have lashed him to the beam with a rope now thou thyself wilt hang by a rope orderly  a drowsy policeman answered stricklands call he was followed by another and tietjens sat wondrous still  take him to the policestation said strickland there is a case toward  do i hang then said bahadur khan making no attempt to escape and keeping his eyes on the ground  if the sun shines or the water runsyes said strickland  bahadur khan stepped back one long pace quivered and stood still the two policemen waited further orders  gosaid strickland  nay but i go very swiftly said bahadur khan look i am even now a dead man  he lifted his foot and to the little toe there clung the head of the halfkilled snake firm fixed in the agony of death  i come of landholding stock said bahadur khan rocking where he stood it were a disgrace to me to go to the public scaffold therefore i take this way be it remembered that the sahibs shirts are correctly enumerated and that there is an extra piece of soap in his washbasin my child was bewitched and i slew the wizard why should you seek to slay me with the rope my honour is saved andandi die  at the end of an hour he died as they die who are bitten by the little brown karait and the policemen bore him and the thing under the tablecloth to their appointed places all were needed to make clear the disappearance of imray  this said strickland very calmly as he climbed into bed is called the nineteenth century did you hear what that man said  i heard i answered imray made a mistake  simply and solely through not knowing the nature of the oriental and the coincidence of a little seasonal fever bahadur khan had been with him for four years  i shuddered my own servant had been with me for exactly that length of time when i went over to my own room i found my man waiting impassive as the copper head on a penny to pull off my boots  what has befallen bahadur khan said i  he was bitten by a snake and died the rest the sahib knows was the answer  and how much of this matter hast thou known  as much as might be gathered from one coming in in the twilight to seek satisfaction gently sahib let me pull off those boots  i had just settled to the sleep of exhaustion when i heard strickland shouting from his side of the house  tietjens has come back to her place  and so she had the great deerhound was couched statelily on her own bedstead on her own blanket while in the next room the idle empty ceilingcloth waggled as it trailed on the table     namgay doola    there came to the beach a poor exile of erin  the dew on his wet robe hung heavy and chill  ere the steamer that brought him had passed out of hearin  he was alderman mike inthrojuicin a bill                        american song  once upon a time there was a king who lived on the road to thibet very many miles in the himalayas his kingdom was eleven thousand feet above the sea and exactly four miles square but most of the miles stood on end owing to the nature of the country his revenues were rather less than four hundred pounds yearly and they were expended in the maintenance of one elephant and a standing army of five men he was tributary to the indian government who allowed him certain sums for keeping a section of the himalayathibet road in repair he further increased his revenues by selling timber to the railwaycompanies for he would cut the great deodar trees in his one forest and they fell thundering into the sutlej river and were swept down to the plains three hundred miles away and became railwayties now and again this king whose name does not matter would mount a ringstraked horse and ride scores of miles to simlatown to confer with the lieutenantgovernor on matters of state or to assure the viceroy that his sword was at the service of the queenempress then the viceroy would cause a ruffle of drums to be sounded and the ringstraked horse and the cavalry of the statetwo men in tattersand the herald who bore the silver stick before the king would trot back to their own place which lay between the tail of a heavenclimbing glacier and a dark birchforest  now from such a king always remembering that he possessed one veritable elephant and could count his descent for twelve hundred years i expected when it was my fate to wander through his dominions no more than mere license to live  the night had closed in rain and rolling clouds blotted out the lights of the villages in the valley forty miles away untouched by cloud or storm the white shoulder of donga pathe mountain of the council of the godsupheld the evening star the monkeys sang sorrowfully to each other as they hunted for dry roosts in the fernwreathed trees and the last puff of the daywind brought from the unseen villages the scent of damp woodsmoke hot cakes dripping undergrowth and rotting pine cones that is the true smell of the himalayas and if once it creeps into the blood of a man that man will at the last forgetting all else return to the hills to die the clouds closed and the smell went away and there remained nothing in all the world except chilling white mist and the boom of the sutlej river racing through the valley below a fat tailed sheep who did not want to die bleated piteously at my tent door he was scuffling with the prime minister and the directorgeneral of public education and he was a royal gift to me and my camp servants i expressed my thanks suitably and asked if i might have audience of the king the prime minister readjusted his turban which had fallen off in the struggle and assured me that the king would be very pleased to see me therefore i despatched two bottles as a foretaste and when the sheep had entered upon another incarnation went to the kings palace through the wet he had sent his army to escort me but the army stayed to talk with my cook soldiers are very much alike all the world over  the palace was a fourroomed and whitewashed mud and timber house the finest in all the hills for a days journey the king was dressed in a purple velvet jacket white muslin trousers and a saffronyellow turban of price he gave me audience in a little carpeted room opening off the palace courtyard which was occupied by the elephant of state the great beast was sheeted and anchored from trunk to tail and the curve of his back stood out grandly against the mist  the prime minister and the directorgeneral of public education were present to introduce me but all the court had been dismissed lest the two bottles aforesaid should corrupt their morals the king cast a wreath of heavyscented flowers round my neck as i bowed and inquired how my honoured presence had the felicity to be i said that through seeing his auspicious countenance the mists of the night had turned into sunshine and that by reason of his beneficent sheep his good deeds would be remembered by the gods he said that since i had set my magnificent foot in his kingdom the crops would probably yield seventy per cent more than the average i said that the fame of the king had reached to the four corners of the earth and that the nations gnashed their teeth when they heard daily of the glories of his realm and the wisdom of his moonlike prime minister and lotuslike directorgeneral of public education  then we sat down on clean white cushions and i was at the kings right hand three minutes later he was telling me that the state of the maize crop was something disgraceful and that the railwaycompanies would not pay him enough for his timber the talk shifted to and fro with the bottles and we discussed very many stately things and the king became confidential on the subject of government generally most of all he dwelt on the shortcomings of one of his subjects who from all i could gather had been paralyzing the executive  in the old days said the king i could have ordered the elephant yonder to trample him to death now i must een send him seventy miles across the hills to be tried and his keep would be upon the state the elephant eats everything  what be the mans crimes rajah sahib said i  firstly he is an outlander and no man of mine own people secondly since of my favour i gave him land upon his first coming he refuses to pay revenue am i not the lord of the earth above and below entitled by right and custom to oneeighth of the crop yet this devil establishing himself refuses to pay a single tax and he brings a poisonous spawn of babes  cast him into jail i said  sahib the king answered shifting a little on the cushions once and only once in these forty years sickness came upon me so that i was not able to go abroad in that hour i made a vow to my god that i would never again cut man or woman from the light of the sun and the air of god for i perceived the nature of the punishment how can i break my vow were it only the lopping of a hand or a foot i should not delay but even that is impossible now that the english have rule one or another of my peoplehe looked obliquely at the directorgeneral of public educationwould at once write a letter to the viceroy and perhaps i should be deprived of my ruffle of drums  he unscrewed the mouthpiece of his silver waterpipe fitted a plain amber mouthpiece and passed his pipe to me not content with refusing revenue he continuedthis outlander refuses also the begar this was the corvee or forced labour on the roads and stirs my people up to the like treason yet he is when he wills an expert logsnatcher there is none better or bolder among my people to clear a block of the river when the logs stick fast  but he worships strange gods said the prime minister deferentially  for that i have no concern said the king who was as tolerant as akbar in matters of belief to each man his own god and the fire or mother earth for us all at last it is the rebellion that offends me  the king has an army i suggested has not the king burned the mans house and left him naked to the night dews  nay a hut is a hut and it holds the life of a man but once i sent my army against him when his excuses became wearisome of their heads he brake three across the top with a stick the other two men ran away also the guns would not shoot  i had seen the equipment of the infantry onethird of it was an old muzzleloading fowlingpiece with a ragged rusthole where the nipples should have been onethird a wirebound matchlock with a wormeaten stock and onethird a fourbore flint duckgun without a flint  but it is to be remembered said the king reaching out for the bottle that he is a very expert logsnatcher and a man of a merry face what shall i do to him sahib  this was interesting the timid hillfolk would as soon have refused taxes to their king as revenues to their gods  if it be the kings permission i said i will not strike my tents till the third day and i will see this man the mercy of the king is godlike and rebellion is like unto the sin of witchcraft moreover both the bottles and another be empty  you have my leave to go said the king  next morning a crier went through the state proclaiming that there was a logjam on the river and that it behoved all loyal subjects to remove it the people poured down from their villages to the moist warm valley of poppyfields and the king and i went with them hundreds of dressed deodarlogs had caught on a snag of rock and the river was bringing down more logs every minute to complete the blockade the water snarled and wrenched and worried at the timber and the population of the state began prodding the nearest logs with a pole in the hope of starting a general movement then there went up a shout of namgay doola namgay doola and a large redhaired villager hurried up stripping off his clothes as he ran  that is he that is the rebel said the king now will the dam be cleared  but why has he red hair i asked since red hair among hillfolks is as common as blue or green  he is an outlander said the king well done oh well done  namgay doola had scrambled out on the jam and was clawing out the butt of a log with a rude sort of boathook it slid forward slowly as an alligator moves three or four others followed it and the green water spouted through the gaps they had made then the villagers howled and shouted and scrambled across the logs pulling and pushing the obstinate timber and the red head of namgay doola was chief among them all the logs swayed and chafed and groaned as fresh consignments from upstream battered the now weakening dam all gave way at last in a smother of foam racing logs bobbing black heads and confusion indescribable the river tossed everything before it i saw the red head go down with the last remnants of the jam and disappear between the great grinding tree trunks it rose close to the bank and blowing like a grampus namgay doola wrung the water out of his eyes and made obeisance to the king i had time to observe him closely the virulent redness of his shock head and beard was most startling and in the thicket of hair wrinkled above high cheek bones shone two very merry blue eyes he was indeed an outlander but yet a thibetan in language habit and attire he spoke the lepcha dialect with an indescribable softening of the gutturals it was not so much a lisp as an accent  whence comest thou i asked  from thibet he pointed across the hills and grinned that grin went straight to my heart mechanically i held out my hand and namgay doola shook it no pure thibetan would have understood the meaning of the gesture he went away to look for his clothes and as he climbed back to his village i heard a joyous yell that seemed unaccountably familiar it was the whooping of namgay doola  you see now said the king why i would not kill him he is a bold man among my logs but and he shook his head like a schoolmaster i know that before long there will be complaints of him in the court let us return to the palace and do justice it was that kings custom to judge his subjects every day between eleven and three oclock i saw him decide equitably in weighty matters of trespass slander and a little wifestealing then his brow clouded and he summoned me  again it is namgay doola he said despairingly not content with refusing revenue on his own part he has bound half his village by an oath to the like treason never before has such a thing befallen me nor are my taxes heavy  a rabbitfaced villager with a blushrose stuck behind his ear advanced trembling he had been in the conspiracy but had told everything and hoped for the kings favour  o king said i if it be the kings will let this matter stand over till the morning only the gods can do right swiftly and it may be that yonder villager has lied  nay for i know the nature of namgay doola but since a guest asks let the matter remain wilt thou speak harshly to this redheaded outlander he may listen to thee  i made an attempt that very evening but for the life of me i could not keep my countenance namgay doola grinned persuasively and began to tell me about a big brown bear in a poppyfield by the river would i care to shoot it i spoke austerely on the sin of conspiracy and the certainty of punishment namgay doolas face clouded for a moment shortly afterwards he withdrew from my tent and i heard him singing to himself softly among the pines the words were unintelligible to me but the tune like his liquid insinuating speech seemed the ghost of something strangely familiar  dir hane mardiyemen dir  to weeree ala gee  sang namgay doola again and again and i racked my brain for that lost tune it was not till after dinner that i discovered some one had cut a square foot of velvet from the centre of my best cameracloth this made me so angry that i wandered down the valley in the hope of meeting the big brown bear i could hear him grunting like a discontented pig in the poppyfield and i waited shoulder deep in the dewdripping indian corn to catch him after his meal the moon was at full and drew out the rich scent of the tasselled crop then i heard the anguished bellow of a himalayan cow one of the little black crummies no bigger than newfoundland dogs two shadows that looked like a bear and her cub hurried past me i was in act to fire when i saw that they had each a brilliant red head the lesser animal was trailing some rope behind it that left a dark track on the path they passed within six feet of me and the shadow of the moonlight lay velvetblack on their faces velvet black was exactly the word for by all the powers of moonlight they were masked in the velvet of my cameracloth i marvelled and went to bed  next morning the kingdom was in uproar namgay doola men said had gone forth in the night and with a sharp knife had cut off the tail of a cow belonging to the rabbitfaced villager who had betrayed him it was sacrilege unspeakable against the holy cow the state desired his blood but he had retreated into his hut barricaded the doors and windows with big stones and defied the world  the king and i and the populace approached the hut cautiously there was no hope of capturing the man without loss of life for from a hole in the wall projected the muzzle of an extremely wellcaredfor gunthe only gun in the state that could shoot namgay doola had narrowly missed a villager just before we came up the standing army stood it could do no more for when it advanced pieces of sharp shale flew from the windows to these were added from time to time showers of scalding water we saw red heads bobbing up and down in the hut the family of namgay doola were aiding their sire and bloodcurdling yells of defiance were the only answers to our prayers  never said the king puffing has such a thing befallen my state next year i will certainly buy a little cannon he looked at me imploringly  is there any priest in the kingdom to whom he will listen said i for a light was beginning to break upon me  he worships his own god said the prime minister we can starve him out  let the white man approach said namgay doola from within all others i will kill send me the white man  the door was thrown open and i entered the smoky interior of a thibetan hut crammed with children and every child had flaming red hair a raw cowstail lay on the floor and by its side two pieces of black velvet my black velvetrudely hacked into the semblance of masks  and what is this shame namgay doola said i  he grinned more winningly than ever there is no shame said he i did but cut off the tail of that mans cow he betrayed me i was minded to shoot him sahib but not to death indeed not to death only in the legs  and why at all since it is the custom to pay revenue to the king why at all  by the god of my father i cannot tell said namgay doola  and who was thy father  the same that had this gun he showed me his weapona tower musket bearing date 1832 and the stamp of the honourable east india company  and thy fathers name said i  timlay doola said he at the first i being then a little child it is in my mind that he wore a red coat  of that i have no doubt but repeat the name of thy father thrice or four times  he obeyed and i understood whence the puzzling accent in his speech came thimla dhula said he excitedly to this hour i worship his god  may i see that god  in a little whileat twilight time  rememberest thou aught of thy fathers speech  it is long ago but there is one word which he said often thus shun then i and my brethren stood upon our feet our hands to our sides thus  even so and what was thy mother  a woman of the hills we be lepchas of darjeeling but me they call an outlander because my hair is as thou seest  the thibetan woman his wife touched him on the arm gently the long parley outside the fort had lasted far into the day it was now close upon twilightthe hour of the angelus very solemnly the redheaded brats rose from the floor and formed a semicircle namgay doola laid his gun against the wall lighted a little oil lamp and set it before a recess in the wall pulling aside a curtain of dirty cloth he revealed a worn brass crucifix leaning against the helmetbadge of a long forgotten east india regiment thus did my father he said crossing himself clumsily the wife and children followed suit then all together they struck up the wailing chant that i heard on the hillside   dir bane mardiyemen dir  to weeree ala gee  i was puzzled no longer again and again they crooned as if their hearts would break their version of the chorus of the wearing of the green  theyre hanging men and women too for the wearing of the green  a diabolical inspiration came to me one of the brats a boy about eight years old was watching me as he sang i pulled out a rupee held the coin between finger and thumb and lookedonly lookedat the gun against the wall a grin of brilliant and perfect comprehension overspread the face of the child never for an instant stopping the song he held out his hand for the money and then slid the gun to my hand i might have shot namgay doola as he chanted but i was satisfied the bloodinstinct of the race held true namgay doola drew the curtain across the recess angelus was over  thus my father sang there was much more but i have forgotten and i do not know the purport of these words but it may be that the god will understand i am not of this people and i will not pay revenue  and why  again that soulcompelling grin what occupation would be to me between crop and crop it is better than scaring bears but these people do not understand he picked the masks from the floor and looked in my face as simply as a child  by what road didst thou attain knowledge to make these devilries i said pointing  i cannot tell i am but a lepcha of darjeeling and yet the stuff  which thou hast stolen  nay surely did i steal i desired it so the stuffthe stuffwhat else should i have done with the stuff he twisted the velvet between his fingers  but the sin of maiming the cowconsider that  that is true but oh sahib that man betrayed me and i had no thought but the heifers tail waved in the moonlight and i had my knife what else should i have done the tail came off ere i was aware sahib thou knowest more than i  that is true said i stay within the door i go to speak to the king  the population of the state were ranged on the hillsides i went forth and spoke to the king  o king said i touching this man there be two courses open to thy wisdom thou canst either hang him from a tree he and his brood till there remains no hair that is red within the land  nay said the king why should i hurt the little children  they had poured out of the hut door and were making plump obeisance to everybody namgay doola waited with his gun across his arm  or thou canst discarding the impiety of the cowmaiming raise him to honour in thy army he comes of a race that will not pay revenue a red flame is in his blood which comes out at the top of his head in that glowing hair make him chief of the army give him honour as may befall and full allowance of work but look to it o king that neither he nor his hold a foot of earth from thee henceforward feed him with words and favour and also liquor from certain bottles that thou knowest of and he will be a bulwark of defence but deny him even a tuft of grass for his own this is the nature that god has given him moreover he has brethren  the state groaned unanimously  but if his brethren come they will surely fight with each other till they die or else the one will always give information concerning the other shall he be of thy army o king choose  the king bowed his head and i said come forth namgay doola and command the kings army thy name shall no more be namgay in the mouths of men but patsay doola for as thou hast said i know  then namgay doola new christened patsay doola son of timlay doola which is tim doolan gone very wrong indeed clasped the kings feet cuffed the standing army and hurried in an agony of contrition from temple to temple making offerings for the sin of cattlemaiming  and the king was so pleased with my perspicacity that he offered to sell me a village for twenty pounds sterling but i buy no villages in the himalayas so long as one red head flares between the tail of the heavenclimbing glacier and the dark birchforest  i know that breed     burtran and bimi   the orangoutang in the big iron cage lashed to the sheeppen began the discussion the night was stiflingly hot and as i and hans breitmann the bigbeamed german passed him dragging our bedding to the forepeak of the steamer he roused himself and chattered obscenely he had been caught somewhere in the malayan archipelago and was going to england to be exhibited at a shilling a head for four days he had struggled yelled and wrenched at the heavy bars of his prison without ceasing and had nearly slain a lascar incautious enough to come within reach of the great hairy paw  it would be well for you mine friend if you was a liddle seasick said hans breitmann pausing by the cage you haf too much ego in your cosmos  the orangoutangs arm slid out negligently from between the bars no one would have believed that it would make a sudden snakelike rush at the germans breast the thin silk of the sleepingsuit tore out hans stepped back unconcernedly to pluck a banana from a bunch hanging close to one of the boats  too much ego said he peeling the fruit and offering it to the caged devil who was rending the silk to tatters  then we laid out our bedding in the bows among the sleeping lascars to catch any breeze that the pace of the ship might give us the sea was like smoky oil except where it turned to fire under our forefoot and whirled back into the dark in smears of dull flame there was a thunderstorm some miles away we could see the glimmer of the lightning the ships cow distressed by the heat and the smell of the apebeast in the cage lowed unhappily from time to time in exactly the same key as that in which the lookout man answered the hourly call from the bridge the trampling tune of the engines was very distinct and the jarring of the ashlift as it was tipped into the sea hurt the procession of hushed noise hans lay down by my side and lighted a goodnight cigar this was naturally the beginning of conversation he owned a voice as soothing as the wash of the sea and stores of experiences as vast as the sea itself for his business in life was to wander up and down the world collecting orchids and wild beasts and ethnological specimens for german and american dealers i watched the glowing end of his cigar wax and wane in the gloom as the sentences rose and fell till i was nearly asleep the orangoutang troubled by some dream of the forests of his freedom began to yell like a soul in purgatory and to pluck madly at the bars of the cage  if he was out now dere would not be much of us left hereabout said hans lazily he screams goot see now how i shall tame him when he stops himself  there was a pause in the outcry and from hans mouth came an imitation of a snakes hiss so perfect that i almost sprang to my feet the sustained murderous sound ran along the deck and the wrenching at the bars ceased the orangoutang was quaking in an ecstasy of pure terror  dot stopped him said hans i learned dot trick in mogoung tanjong when i was collecting liddle monkeys for some peoples in berlin efery one in der world is afraid of der monkeysexcept der snake so i blay

und bertran he was her husband goot night undsleep well     moti gujmutineer   once upon a time there was a coffeeplanter in india who wished to clear some forest land for coffeeplanting when he had cut down all the trees and burned the underwood the stumps still remained dynamite is expensive and slowfire slow the happy medium for stumpclearing is the lord of all beats who is the elephant he will either push the stump out of the ground with his tusks if he has any or drag it out with ropes the planter therefore hired elephants by ones and twos and threes and fell to work the very best of all the elephants belonged to the very worst of all the drivers or mahouts and the superior beasts name was moti guj he was the absolute property of his mahout which would never have been the case under native rule for moti guj was a creature to be desired by kings and his name being translated meant the pearl elephant because the british government was in the land deesa the mahout enjoyed his property undisturbed he was dissipated when he had made much money through the strength of his elephant he would get extremely drunk and give moti guj a beating with a tentpeg over the tender nails of the forefeet moti guj never trampled the life out of deesa on these occasions for he knew that after the beating was over deesa would embrace his trunk and weep and call him his love and his life and the liver of his soul and give him some liquor moti guj was very fond of liquorarrack for choice though he would drink palm tree toddy if nothing better offered then deesa would go to sleep between moti gujs forefeet and as deesa generally chose the middle of the public road and as moti guj mounted guard over him and would not permit horse foot or cart to pass by traffic was congested till deesa saw fit to wake up  there was no sleeping in the daytime on the planters clearing the wages were too high to risk deesa sat on moti gujs neck and gave him orders while moti guj rooted up the stumpsfor he owned a magnificent pair of tusks or pulled at the end of a ropefor he had a magnificent pair of shoulders while deesa kicked him behind the ears and said he was the king of elephants at evening time moti guj would wash down his three hundred pounds weight of green food with a quart of arrack and deesa would take a share and sing songs between moti gujs legs till it was time to go to bed once a week deesa led moti guj down to the river and moti guj lay on his side luxuriously in the shallows while deesa went over him with a coirswab and a brick moti guj never mistook the pounding blow of the latter for the smack of the former that warned him to get up and turn over on the other side then deesa would look at his feet and examine his eyes and turn up the fringes of his mighty ears in case of sores or budding ophthalmia after inspection the two would come up with a song from the sea moti guj all black and shining waving a torn tree branch twelve feet long in his trunk and deesa knotting up his own long wet hair  it was a peaceful wellpaid life till deesa felt the return of the desire to drink deep he wished for an orgie the little draughts that led nowhere were taking the manhood out of him  he went to the planter and my mothers dead said he weeping  she died on the last plantation two months ago and she died once before that when you were working for me last year said the planter who knew something of the ways of nativedom  then its my aunt and she was just the same as a mother to me said deesa weeping more than ever she has left eighteen small children entirely without bread and it is i who must fill their little stomachs said deesa beating his head on the floor  who brought you the news said the planter  the post said deesa  there hasnt been a post here for the past week get back to your lines  a devastating sickness has fallen on my village and all my wives are dying yelled deesa really in tears this time  call chihun who comes from deesas village said the planter chihun has this man a wife  he said chihun no not a woman of our village would look at him theyd sooner marry the elephant chihun snorted deesa wept and bellowed  you will get into a difficulty in a minute said the planter go back to your work  now i will speak heavens truth gulped deesa with an inspiration i havent been drunk for two months i desire to depart in order to get properly drunk afar off and distant from this heavenly plantation thus i shall cause no trouble  a flickering smile crossed the planters face deesa said he youve spoken the truth and id give you leave on the spot if anything could be done with moti guj while youre away you know that he will only obey your orders  may the light of the heavens live forty thousand years i shall be absent but ten little days after that upon my faith and honour and soul i return as to the inconsiderable interval have i the gracious permission of the heavenborn to call up moti guj  permission was granted and in answer to deesas shrill yell the lordly tusker swung out of the shade of a clump of trees where he had been squirting dust over himself till his master should return  light of my heart protector of the drunken mountain of might give ear said deesa standing in front of him  moti guj gave ear and saluted with his trunk i am going away said deesa  moti gujs eyes twinkled he liked jaunts as well as his master one could snatch all manner of nice things from the roadside then  but you you fubsy old pig must stay behind and work  the twinkle died out as moti guj tried to look delighted he hated stumphauling on the plantation it hurt his teeth  i shall be gone for ten days o delectable one hold up your near forefoot and ill impress the fact upon it warty toad of a dried mud puddle deesa took a tentpeg and banged moti guj ten times on the nails moti guj grunted and shuffled from foot to foot  ten days said deesa you must work and haul and root trees as chihun here shall order you take up chihun and set him on your neck moti guj curled the tip of his trunk chihun put his foot there and was swung on to the neck deesa handed chihun the heavy ankus the iron elephant goad  chihun thumped moti gujs bald head as a paviour thumps a kerbstone  moti guj trumpeted  be still hog of the backwoods chihuns your mahout for ten days and now bid me goodbye beast after mine own heart oh my lord my king jewel of all created elephants lily of the herd preserve your honoured health be virtuous adieu  moti guj lapped his trunk round deesa and swung him into the air twice that was his way of bidding the man goodbye  hell work now said dessa to the planter have i leave to go  the planter nodded and deesa dived into the woods moti guj went back to haul stumps  chihun was very kind to him but he felt unhappy and forlorn notwithstanding chihun gave him balls of spices and tickled him under the chin and chihuns little baby cooed to him after work was over and chihuns wife called him a darling but moti guj was a bachelor by instinct as deesa was he did not understand the domestic emotions he wanted the light of his universe back againthe drink and the drunken slumber the savage beatings and the savage caresses  none the less he worked well and the planter wondered deesa had vagabonded along the roads till he met a marriage procession of his own caste and drinking dancing and tippling had drifted past all knowledge of the lapse of time  the morning of the eleventh day dawned and there returned no deesa moti guj was loosed from his ropes for the daily stint he swung clear looked round shrugged his shoulders and began to walk away as one having business elsewhere  hi ho come back you shouted chihun come back and put me on your neck misborn mountain return splendour of the hillsides adornment of all india heave to or ill bang every toe off your fat forefoot  moti guj gurgled gently but did not obey chihun ran after him with a rope and caught him up moti guj put his ears forward and chihun knew what that meant though he tried to carry it off with high words  none of your nonsense with me said he to your pickets devilson  hrrump said moti guj and that was allthat and the forebent ears  moti guj put his hands in his pockets chewed a branch for a toothpick and strolled about the clearing making jest of the other elephants who had just set to work  chihun reported the state of affairs to the planter who came out with a dogwhip and cracked it furiously moti guj paid the white man the compliment of charging him nearly a quarter of a mile across the clearing and hrrumping him into the verandah then he stood outside the house chuckling to himself and shaking all over with the fun of it as an elephant will  well thrash him said the planter he shall have the finest thrashing that ever elephant received give kala nag and nazim twelve foot of chain apiece and tell them to lay on twenty blows  kala nagwhich means black snakeand nazim were two of the biggest elephants in the lines and one of their duties was to administer the graver punishments since no man can beat an elephant properly  they took the whippingchains and rattled them in their trunks as they sidled up to moti guj meaning to hustle him between them moti guj had never in all his life of thirtynine years been whipped and he did not intend to open new experiences so he waited weaving his head from right to left and measuring the precise spot in kala nags fat side where a blunt tusk would sink deepest kala nag had no tusks the chain was his badge of authority but he judged it good to swing wide of moti guj at the last minute and seem to appear as if he had brought out the chain for amusement nazim turned round and went home early he did not feel fightingfit that morning and so moti guj was left standing alone with his ears cocked  that decided the planter to argue no more and moti guj rolled back to his inspection of the clearing an elephant who will not work and is not tied up is not quite so manageable as an eightyone ton gun loose in a heavy seaway he slapped old friends on the back and asked them if the stumps were coming away easily he talked nonsense concerning labour and the inalienable rights of elephants to a long nooning and wandering to and fro thoroughly demoralized the garden till sundown when he returned to his pickets for food  if you wont work you shant eat said chihun angrily youre a wild elephant and no educated animal at all go back to your jungle  chihuns little brown baby rolling on the floor of the hut stretched its fat arms to the huge shadow in the doorway moti guj knew well that it was the dearest thing on earth to chihun he swung out his trunk with a fascinating crook at the end and the brown baby threw itself shouting upon it moti guj made fast and pulled up till the brown baby was crowing in the air twelve feet above his fathers head  great chief said chihun flour cakes of the best twelve in number two feet across and soaked in rum shall be yours on the instant and two hundred pounds weight of freshcut young sugarcane therewith deign only to put down safely that insignificant brat who is my heart and my life to me  moti guj tucked the brown baby comfortably between his forefeet that could have knocked into toothpicks all chihuns hut and waited for his food he ate it and the brown baby crawled away moti guj dozed and thought of deesa one of many mysteries connected with the elephant is that his huge body needs less sleep than anything else that lives four or five hours in the night sufficetwo just before midnight lying down on one side two just after one oclock lying down on the other the rest of the silent hours are filled with eating and fidgeting and long grumbling soliloquies  at midnight therefore moti guj strode out of his pickets for a thought had come to him that deesa might be lying drunk somewhere in the dark forest with none to look after him so all that night he chased through the undergrowth blowing and trumpeting and shaking his ears he went down to the river and blared across the shallows where deesa used to wash him but there was no answer he could not find deesa but he disturbed all the elephants in the lines and nearly frightened to death some gypsies in the woods  at dawn deesa returned to the plantation he had been very drunk indeed and he expected to fall into trouble for outstaying his leave he drew a long breath when he saw that the bungalow and the plantation were still uninjured for he knew something of moti gujs temper and reported himself with many lies and salaams moti guj had gone to his pickets for breakfast his night exercise had made him hungry  call up your beast said the planter and deesa shouted in the mysterious elephantlanguage that some mahouts believe came from china at the birth of the world when elephants and not men were masters moti guj heard and came elephants do not gallop they move from spots at varying rates of speed if an elephant wished to catch an express train he could not gallop but he could catch the train thus moti guj was at the planters door almost before chihun noticed that he had left his pickets he fell into deesas arms trumpeting with joy and the man and beast wept and slobbered over each other and handled each other from head to heel to see that no harm had befallen  now we will get to work said deesa lift me up my son and my joy  moti guj swung him up and the two went to the coffeeclearing to look for irksome stumps  the planter was too astonished to be very angry     lenvoi   my newcut
