its simpleness to give lustre to any page  having been requested thus to collect and edit his prose writings by those who hold his mss and are his nearest representatives one little discovery or recovery among these mss suggested your majesty as the one among all others to whom the illustrious author would have chosen to dedicate these works viz a rough transcript of a poem which he had

 and help life onward in its noblest aim  ww  9th january 1846     preface   in response to a request put in the most gratifying way possible of the nearest representatives of wordsworth the editor has prepared this collection of his prose works that this should be done for the first time herein seems somewhat remarkable especially in the knowledge of the permanent value which the illustrious author attached to his prose and that he repeatedly expressed his wish and expectation that it would be thus brought together and published eg in the memoirs speaking of his own prose writings he said that but for coleridges irregularity of purpose he should probably have left much more in that kind behind him when coleridge was proposing to publish his friend he wordsworth had offered contributions coleridge had expressed himself pleased with the offer but said i must arrange my principles for the work and when that is done i shall be glad of your aid but this arrangement of principles never took place wordsworth added i think my nephew dr wordsworth will after my death collect and publish all i have written in prose on another occasion i believe he intimated a desire that his works in prose should be edited by his soninlaw mr quillinan1 similarly he wrote to professor reed in 1840 i am much pleased by what you say in your letter of the 18th may last upon the tract of the convention of cintra and i think myself with some interest upon its being reprinted hereafter along with my other writings in prose but the respect which in common with all the rest of the rational part of the world i bear for the duke of wellington will prevent my reprinting the pamphlet during his lifetime it has not been in my power to read the volumes of his despatches which i hear so highly spoken of but i am convinced that nothing they contain could alter my opinion of the injurious tendency of that or any other convention conducted upon such principles it was i repeat gratifying to me that you should have spoken of that work as you do and particularly that you should have considered it in relation to my poems somewhat in the same manner as you had done in respect to my little volume on the lakes2  1 memoirs vol ii p 466  2 ibid vol i p 420  it is probable that the amount of the prose of wordsworth will come as a surprisesurely a pleasant oneon even his admirers and students his own use of tract to describe a goodly octavo volume and his calling his guide a little volume while it is a somewhat considerable one together with the hiding away of some of his most matterful and weightiest productions in local and fugitive publications and in prefaces and appendices to poems go far to explain the prevailing unacquaintance with even the extent not to speak of the importance of his prose and the light contentment with which it has been permitted so long to remain comparatively out of sight that the interrelation of the poems to the prose and of the prose to the poemsof which above he himself wrotemakes the collection and publication of the prose a duty to all who regard william wordsworth as one of the supreme intellects of the centuryas certainly the glory of the georgian and victorian age as ever shakespeare and raleigh were of the elizabethan and jacobeanwill not be questioned today  the present editor can only express his satisfaction at being called to execute a task which from a variety of circumstances has been too long delayed but only delayed inasmuch as the members of the poets family have always held it as a sacred obligation laid upon them with the additional sanction that wordsworths old and valued friend henry crabb robinson esq had expressed a wish in his last will 1868 that the prose works of his friend should one day be collected and which wish alone from one so discriminating and generouswere there no other grounds for doing sothe family of wordsworth could not but regard as imperative he rejoices that the delayotherwise to be regrettedhas enabled the editor to furnish a much fuller and more complete collection than earlier had perhaps been possible he would now briefly notice the successive portions of these volumes     vol i  i political  a apology for the french revolution 1793   this is from the authors own ms and is published for the first time every reader of the recluse and the excursion and the lines on the french revolution as it appeared to enthusiasts at its commencementto specify only theseis aware that in common with southey and the greater coleridge wordsworth was in sympathy with the uprising of france against its tyrants but it is only now that we are admitted to a full discovery of his youthful convictions and emotion by the publication of this manuscript carefully preserved by him but never given to the world the title on the flyleafapology c being oursin the authors own handwriting is as follows      a     letter     to the     bishop of landaff     on the extraordinary avowal of his     political principles     contained in the     appendix to his late sermon     by a     republican  it is nowhere dated but inasmuch as bishop watsons sermon with the appendix appeared early in 1793 to that year certainly belongs the composition of the letter the titlepage of the sermon and appendix may be here given  a sermon preached before the stewards of the westminster dispensary at their anniversary meeting charlotte street chapel april 1785  with an appendix by r watson dd lord bishop of landaff  london printed for t cadell in the strand and t evans in paternoster row  1793 8vo  in the same year a second edition was published and also separately the appendix thus  strictures on the french revolution and the british constitution as written in 1793 in an appendix to a sermon preached before the stewards of the westminster dispensary at their anniversary meeting charlotte street chapel april 1785  by r watson dd lord bishop of landaff  reprinted at loughborough with his lordships permission by adams jun and recommended by the loughborough association for the support of the constitution to the serious attention of the public  price twopence being one third of the original price  1793 small 8vo  the sermon is a somewhat commonplace dissertation on the wisdom and goodness of god in having made both rich and poor from proverbs xxii 2 the rich and poor meet together the lord is the maker of them all it could not but be most irritating to one such as young wordsworththen in his twentythird yearwho passionately felt as well with as for the poor of his native country and that from an intimacy of knowledge and intercourse and sympathy in striking contrast with the serene optimism of the preacherall the more flagrant in that bishop watson himself sprang from the very humblest ranks but it is on the appendix this letter expends its force and except from burke on the opposite side nothing more forceful or more effectively argumentative or informed with a nobler patriotism is to be found in the english language if it have not the kindling eloquence which is demosthenic and that axiomatic statement of principles which is baconian of the convention every sentence and epithet pulsatesas its very lifebloodwith a manly scorn of the false the base the sordid the merely titularly eminent it may not be assumed that even to old age william wordsworth would have disavowed a syllable of this apology technically he might not have held to the name republican but to the last his heart was with the oppressed the suffering the poor the silent mr h crabb robinson tells us in his diary vol ii p 290 3d edition i recollect once hearing mr wordsworth say half in joke half in earnest i have no respect whatever for whigs but i have a great deal of the chartist in me and his friend adds to be sure he has his earlier poems are full of that intense love of the people as such which becomes chartism when the attempt is formally made to make their interests the especial object of legislation as of deeper importance than the positive rights hitherto accorded to the privileged orders elsewhere the same diarist speaks of the brains of the noblest youths in england being turned i 31 32 including wordsworth there was no such turning of brain with him he was deliberate judicial while at a red heat of indignation to measure the quality of difference intellectually and morally between wordsworth and another noticeable man who entered into controversy with bishop watson it is only necessary to compare the present letter with gilbert wakefields reply to some parts of the bishop of landaffs address to the people of great britain 1798  the manuscript is wholly in the handwriting of its author and is done with uncharacteristic painstaking for later writing was painful and irksome to him and even his letters are in great part illegible one folio is lacking but probably it contained only an additional sentence or two as the examination of the appendix is complete following on our ending are these words besides the names which i  that the reader may see how thorough is the answer of wordsworth to bishop watson the appendix is reprinted in extenso being comparatively brief it was thought expedient not to put the student on a vain search for the longforgotten sermon on the biographic value of this letter and the inevitableness of its inclusion among his prose works it cannot be needful to say a word it is noticedand little morein the memoirs c ix vol i pp 7880 in his letters vol iii will be found incidental allusions and vindications of the principles maintained in the apology  b concerning the relations of great britain spain and portugal to each other and the common enemy at this crisis and specifically as affected by the convention of cintra the whole brought to the test of those principles by which alone the independence and freedom of nations can be preserved or recovered 1809  as stated in its advertisement two portions of this treatise rather than tract extending to p 25 of the completed volume were originally printed in the months of december and january 18089 in the courier newspaper in this shape it attracted the notice of no less a reader than sir walter scott who thus writes of it i have read wordsworths lucubrations3 in the courier and much agree with him alas we want everything but courage and virtue in this desperate contest skill knowledge of mankind ineffable unhesitating villany combination of movement and combination of means are with our adversary we can only fight like mastiffsboldly blindly and faithfully i am almost driven to the pass of the covenanters when they told the almighty in their prayers he should no longer be their god and i really believe a few gazettes more will make me turn turk or infidel4  3 lucubrations  meditative studies it has since deteriorated in meaning  4 lockharts life of scott vol iii pp 2601 edition 1856  what wordsworths own feelings and impulses were in the composition of the convention of cintra are revealed with unwonted as fine passion in his letters and conversations vol iii pp 256261 c whither the reader will do well to turn inasmuch as he returns and rereturns therein to his standingground in this very remarkable and imperishable book the long letters to afterwards sir charles w pasley and anothernever before printedwhich follow the convention of cintra itself are of special interest the appendix of notes a portion of the work which wordsworth regarded as executed in a masterly manner was drawn up by de quincey who revised the proofs of the whole memoirs i 384 of the convention of cintra the now bishop of lincoln wordsworth writes eloquently as follows much of wordsworths life was spent in comparative retirement and a great part of his poetry concerns natural and quiet objects but it would be a great error to imagine that he was not an attentive observer of public events he was an ardent lover of his country and of mankind he watched the progress of civil affairs in england with a vigilant eye and he brought the actions of public men to the test of the great and lasting principles of equity and truth he extended his range of view to events in foreign parts especially on the continent of europe few persons though actually engaged in the great struggle of that period felt more deeply than wordsworth did in his peaceful retreat for the calamities of european nations suffering at that time from the imbecility of their governments and from the withering oppression of a prosperous despotism his heart burned within him when he looked forth upon the contest and impassioned words proceeded from him both in poetry and prose the contemplative calmness of his position and the depth and intensity of his feelings combined together to give a dignity and clearness a vigour and splendour and consequently a lasting value to his writings on measures of domestic and foreign policy qualities that rarely belong to contemporaneous political effusions produced by those engaged in the heat and din of the battle this remark is specially applicable to his tract on the convention of cintra whatever difference of opinion may prevail concerning the relevance of the great principles enunciated in it to the questions at issue but one judgment can exist with respect to the importance of those principles and the vigorous and fervid eloquence with which they are enforced if wordsworth had never written a single verse this essay alone would be sufficient to place him in the highest rank of english poets enough has been quoted to show that the essay on the convention of cintra was not an ephemeral production destined to vanish with the occasion which gave it birth if this were the case the labour bestowed upon it was almost abortive the author composed the work in the discharge of what he regarded a sacred duty and for the permanent benefit of society rather than with a view to any immediate results5 the bishop adds further these details he foresaw and predicted that his words would be to the public ear what midnight storms are to men who sleep  5 memoirs as before vol i pp 383 399      i droppd my pen and listend to the wind     that sang of trees uptorn and vessels tost     a midnight harmony and wholly lost

that of this wild blast     which while it makes the heart with sadness shrink     tells also of bright calms that shall succeed6  it is true that some few readers it had on its first appearance and it is recorded by an earwitness that canning said of this pamphlet that he considered it the most eloquent production since the days of burke7 but by some untoward delays in printing it was not published till the interest in the question under discussion had almost subsided certain it is that an edition consisting only of five hundred copies was not sold off that many copies were disposed of by the publishers as waste paper and went to the trunkmakers and now there is scarcely any volume published in this country which is so difficult to be met with as the tract on the convention of cintra and if it were now reprinted it would come before the public with almost the unimpaired freshness of a new work8 in agreement with the closing statement at the sale of the library of sir james macintosh a copy fetched it has been reported ten guineas curiously enough not a single copy was preserved by the author himself the companion sonnet to the above composed while the author was engaged in writing a tract occasioned by the convention of cintra 1808 must also find a place here      not mid the worlds vain objects that enslave     the freeborn soulthat world whose vaunted skill     in

memoirs vol i pp 40520 in forwarding it to the now bishop of lincoln sir charles thus wrote of it the letter on my military policy is particularly interesting though wordsworth agreed that we ought to step forward with all our military force as principals in the war he objected to any increase of our own power and resources by continental conquest in which i now think he was quite right i am not however by any means shaken in the opinion then advanced that peace with napoleon would lead to the loss of our naval superiority and of our national independence  and i fully believe that the duke of wellingtons campaigns in the spanish peninsula saved the nation though no less credit is due to the ministry of that day for not despairing of eventual success but supporting him under all difficulties in spite of temporary reverses and in opposition to a powerful party and to influential writers the letter transmitting the other has only recently been discovered on a reëxamination of the wordsworth mss both letters have a shakespearianpatriotic ring concerning this england it is inspiring to read in retrospect of the facts such highcouraged writing as in these letters  d two addresses to the freeholders of westmoreland 1818  the mr brougham of these two addresses was as all the world knows the afterwards renowned and manygifted henry lord brougham and vaux in his autobiography he refers very goodhumouredly to his three defeats in contesting the representation of westmoreland but there is no allusion whatever to wordsworth with reference to his final effort he thus informs us parliament was dissolved in 1826 when for the third time i stood for westmoreland and after a hardfought contest was again defeated i have no wish to enter into the local politics of that county but i cannot resist quoting an extract from a letter of my esteemed friend bishop bathurst to mr howard of corby by whose kindness i am enabled to give it mr brougham has struggled nobly for civil and religious liberty and is fully entitled to the celebrated eulogy bestowed by lucan upon cato      victrix causa diis placuit sed victa catoni  how others may feel i know not but for my own part i would much rather be in his situation than in that of the two victorious opponents notwithstanding the cold discouraging maxim of epictetus which is calculated to check every virtuous effortgreek anikêtos einai dunasai ean ouk eis mêdena agôna katabainês ou ouk estin epinikêsai you may be invincible if you never go down into the arena when you are not secure of victory enchiridion cxxv he will not i hope suffer from his exertions extraordinary in every way i respect exceedingly his fine abilities and the purpose to which he applies them norwich july 10 1826 as cato owed lucans panegyric to the firmness he had shown in adhering to the losing cause and to his steadfastness to the principles he had adopted so i considered the bishops application of the lines to me as highly complimentary life and times vol ii pp 4378 it seemed only due to the subject of wordsworths invective and opposition to give his view of the struggle and anothers worthy of all respect unless the writer has been misinformed wordsworth and brougham came to know and worthily estimate each other when the exacerbations and clamours of provincial politics had long passed away and when except the old gray head of wellington none received more reverence from the nation than that of henry brougham in the justissued memoirs of the reigns of george iv and william iv by greville brougham and wordsworth are brought together very pleasingly see these works vol iii p 504  the authors personal relations to the lowthers semiunconsciously coloured his opinions and intensified his partisanship and glorified the commonplace but with all abatements these two addresses supply much material for a right and high estimate of wordsworth as man and thinker as invariably he descends to the roots of things and almost ennobles even his prejudices and alarms and ultracaution there is the same terse compacted pungent style in these two addresses with his general prose bibliographically the two addresses are even rarer and higherpriced than the convention of cintra   e of the catholic relief bill 1829  to the great names of edmund spenser and sir john davies as englishmen who dealt with the problem of the government of ireland and found it as more recent statesmen have done to be in infinite ways englands difficulty has now to be added one not less greatwilliam wordsworth if at this later dayfor even 1829 seems remote nowmuch of the present letter to the bishop of london blomfield is mainly of historical noticeableness as revealing how catholic emancipation looked to one of the foremost minds of his age there are nevertheless expressions of personal opinioneg against the athanasian creed in its cursing clauses and expositions of the papacy regarded politically and ecclesiastically in its domination of ireland that have a message for today strangely congruous with that of the magnificent philippic of the vatican decrees which is thundering across europe as these words are written as a piece of vigorous masculine and otimes eloquent english this letter may take its placenot an inch lowerbeside a view of the state of ireland and the discoverie of the true cavses why ireland was never entirely subdued nor brought under obedience of the crowne of england untill the beginning of his maiesties happie raigne while the conflict with ultramontanism in germany and elsewhere and mr gladstones tractate give new significance to its forecastings and portents  the manuscript unlike most of his is largely in wordsworths own handwritingthe earlier portion in it is believed partly miss wordsworths and partly mrs wordsworths in the memoirs this letter is quoted largely vol ii pp 136140 it is now given completely from the manuscript itself not without significant advantage it does not appear whether this letter were actually sent to the bishop of london there is no mention of it in bishop blomfields life and hence probably it never was sent to him in his letters there are many references to the present topics cf vol iii pp 2589 2634 c   ii ethical  i of legislation for the poor the working classes and the clergy appendix to poems 1835  this formed one of wordsworths most deliberate and powerful appendices to his poems 1835 and has ever since been regarded as of enduring worth it has all the authors characteristics of deep thinking imaginative illustration intense conviction and realness again accept or dissent this state paper so to say is specially wordsworthian  it seems only due to wordsworth to bear in recollection that herein and elsewhere he led the way in indicating cooperation as the remedy for the defects and conflicts in the relations between our capitalists and their operatives or capital and labour see the second section of the postscript and remember its date1835   ii advice to the young  a letter to the editor of the friend signed mathetes  b answer to the letter of mathetes 1809  mathetes proved to be professor john wilson eminent in the various departments of poetry philosophy and criticism memoirs i 423 and here probably was the commencement of the long friendship between him and wordsworth as a student of wilsons the editor remembers vividly how the old man eloquent used to kindle into enthusiasm the entire class as he worked into his extraordinary lectures quotations from the excursion and sonnets and poems of the imagination among the letters vol iii p 263 is an interesting one refering to advice to the young and another to professor wilson vol ii pp 20814   iii of education  a on the

hazlitt in his lectures upon the english poets attacked wordsworth on this letter with characteristic insolence and uncritical shallowness and haste under date feb 24th 1818 mr h crabb robinson thus refers to the thing heard part of a lecture by hazlitt at the surrey institution he was so contemptuous towards wordsworth speaking of his letter about burns that i lost my temper he imputed to wordsworth the desire of representing himself as a superior man vol i p 311 3d ed the lecture is included in hazlitts published lectures in all its ignorance and wrongheadedness but it were a pity to

and successive editions of the poems being found in some and absent in other collections an endeavour has been made to include everything even the briefest for judging by himself the editor believes that to the reverent and thoughtful student of wordsworth the slightest thing is of interest eg one turns to the most commonplace book of topography or contemporary verse in any way noticed by him just because it is wordsworth who has noticed it while an old ballad a legend a bit of rural usage takes a light of glory from the page in which it is found hence as so much diamonddust or filings of gold the published notes are here brought together added and far exceeding in quantity and quality alike it is the privilege of the editor to print completely and in integrity the if mss as written down to the dictation of wordsworth by miss fenwick these have been hitherto given with tantalising and almost provoking fragmentariness in the memoirs and in the centenary edition of the poemsagain withdrawn in the recent rossetti edition in these notesmany of which in both senses are elaborate and fullare some of the deepest and daintiestworded things from wordsworth the if mss are delightfully chatty and informal and ages hence will be treasured and studied in relation to the poems by the then myriad millions of the englishspeaking races  miss fenwick to whom the world is indebted for these mss is immortalised in two sonnets by wordsworth which surely long ere this ought to have been included in the poetical works and they may fitly reappear here from the memoirs     on a portrait of if

matter how so she gets at your mind and lets you into hers a more generous and a tenderer heart i never knew i differ from her on many points of religious faith but on the whole prefer her views to those of most others who differ from her ii 5 again miss fenwick is to me an angel upon earth her being near me now has seemed a special providence god bless her and spare her to us and her many friends she is a noble creature all tenderness and strength when i first became acquainted with her i saw at once that her heart was of the very finest richest quality and her wisdom and insight are as ever must be in such a case exactly correspondent ibid p 397 such words from one so penetrative so indeceivable so great in the fullest sense as was the daughter of the coleridge makes every one long to have the same service done for miss fenwick as has been done for sara coleridge and miss hare and within these weeks for mrs fletcher her diaries and correspondence would be inestimable to lovers of wordsworth for few or none got so near to him or entered so magnetically into his thinking the headings and numberings of the successive noteslesser and largerwill guide to the respective poems and places the numberings accord with rossettis handy onevolume edition of the poems but as a rule will offer no difficulty in any the if mss are marked with an asterisk  they are for the first time furnished in their entirety and accurately   ii letters and extracts of letters  these are arranged as nearly as possible chronologically from the memoirs c c with the benefit as before of collation in many cases of the original mss especially in the sir wr hamilton letters and a number are for the first time printed the editor does not at all like extracts and must be permitted to regret that what in his judgment was an antiquated and mistaken idea of biography led the excellent as learned bishop of lincoln to abridge and mutilate so very manythe places not always marked on this and the principle and motif which approve and vindicate the publication of the letters of every really potential intellect such as wordsworths the accomplished daughter of sara coleridge has remarked a book composed of epistolary extracts can never be a wholly satisfactory one because its contents are not only relative and fragmentary but unauthorised and unrevised to arrest the passing utterances of the hour and reveal to the world that which was spoken either in the innermost circle of home affection or in the outer but still guarded circle of social or friendly intercourse seems almost like a betrayal of confidence and is a step which cannot be taken by survivors without some feelings of hesitation and reluctance that reluctance is only to be overcome by the sense that however natural it is partly founded on delusiona delusion which leads us to personify the world to our imagination as an obtuse and somewhat hostile individual who is certain to take things by the wrong handle and cannot be trusted to make the needful allowance and supply the inevitable omissions whereas it is a more reasonable and a more comfortable belief that the only part of the world which is in the least likely to concern itself with such volumes as these is composed of a number of enlightened and sympathetic persons as before preface vii viii the closing consideration ought to overweigh all scruples and reserve10  10 the charming journal in full of miss wordsworth has only within the past year been published the welcome it has met withhaving bounded into a third edition alreadyis at once proof of the soundness of judgment that at longlast issued it if it be also accusatory that many have gone who yearned to read it the editor ventures to invite special attention to wordsworths own express wish that the foreign journals of miss wordsworth and mrs wordsworth should be published surely his words ought to be imperative vol iii p 77  there is the select circle of lovers of wordsworthyearly wideningand there are the faroff multitudes of the future to whom william wordsworth will be the grand name of the 18th19th century and all that shakespeare and milton are now and consequently the letters of one so chary in letterwriting ought to be put beyond the risks of loss and given to literature in entirety and trueness wordsworth had a morbid dislike of writing letters his weak eyes throughout rendering all penmanship painful but the present editor while conceding that his letters lack the charm of style of cowpers and the vividness and passion of byrons finds in them even the hastiest matter of rarest biographic and interpretative value he was not a great sentencemaker in a way prided himself that his letters were so intentionally poor as sure to be counted unworthy of publication and altogether had the prejudices of an earlier day against the giving of letters to the world but none the less are his letters informed with his intellect and meditative thoughtfulness and exquisiteness of feeling it is earnestly to be hoped that one of the family who is admirably qualified for the task of love will address himself to write adequately and confidingly the life of his immortal relative and toward this every one possessed of anything in the handwriting or from the mind of wordsworth may be appealed to for cooperation the memoirs of the now bishop of lincoln within its own limits was a great gift but it is avowedly not a life and the world wants a life collation of the originals of these letters has restored sentences and words and things of the most characteristic kind very gross mistakes have also been corrected11  11 it may be well to point out here specially a mistake in heading two of the wordsworth letters to sir wr hamilton royal dublin society instead of royal irish academy see vol iii pp 350 and 352 also that at p 394 of the has slipped in from the first of the and so now reads of the heresiarch of the church

angle smiled  these are included in the prose inevitably inasmuch as they preserve opinions and sentiments criticisms and sayings actually spoken by wordsworth of exactly the type of which lord coleridge among other things wrote the editor i hope we shall have a transcript from you of the thoughts and opinions of that very great and noble person of whom as far as i know them it is most true that the very dust of his writings is gold any grave and deliberate opinion of his is entitled to weight and if we have his opinions at all we should have them whole and entire  the editor has studied to give wordsworths own conversations and sayingsnot others concerning him hence such eloquent pseudoenthusiasm as is found in de quinceys recollections of the lakes works vol ii is excluded he dares to call it pseudoenthusiasm for this book of the little alert selfconscious creature with the marvellous brain and more marvellous tonguea monkey with a mans soul somehow transmigrated into itopens and shuts without preserving a solitary saying of the man he professes to honour that is a measure of his admiration as of his insight or no insight there are besides personal impertinencies declarative of essential vulgarity13 smaller men have printed their recollections or rather retailed their gossip but they themselves occupy the foreground much as your chimneysweep introduces himself prominently in front of his signboard presentment of some manychimneyed noble house even emersons english traits a most unenglish book belongs to the same underbred category the new recollections by aubrey de vere esq it is a privilege to publishfull of reverence and love and so daintily and musically worded as they are  13 possibly indignation roused by the recollections has provoked too vehement condemnation let it therefore be noted that it is the recollections that are censured elsewhere de quincey certainly shows a glimmering recognition of wordsworths great qualities and that before they had been fully admitted but everywhere there is an impertinence of familiarity and a patronising selfconsciousness that is irritating to any one who reverences great genius and high rectitude it may be conceded that de quincey so far as he was capable did reverence wordsworth but his exaggerations of awe and delays bear on the face of them unveracity  such is an account of the contents of these volumes and it may be permitted the editor to record his hearty thanks to the sons of the poetwilliam wordsworth esq carlisle and the just dead rev john wordsworth ma brighamand his nephew professor wordsworth of bombay for their so flattering committal of this trust to him and especially to the last for his sympathetic and gladdening counsel throughoutaugury of larger service ultimately it is to be hoped to the coexecutor with william wordsworth esqstrickland cookson esqlike acknowledgment is due he cannot sufficiently thank aubrey de vere esq for his brilliant contribution to the personal reminiscences the rev robert perceval graves ma of dublin formerly of windermere has greatly added to the interest of these volumes by forwarding his further reminiscences of wordsworth and the hamilton letters fifteen of these letters of wordsworth not yet published will be given in a life of the great mathematician of ireland sir wr hamilton towards whom wordsworth felt the warmest friendship and of whose manysided genius he had the most absolute admiration mr graves walking in the footsteps of fulke greville lord brooke who sought that on his tomb should be graven friend of sir philip sidney albeit he would modestly disclaim the lofty comparison regards it as his title to memory that he was called my highly esteemed friend by wordsworth vol iii p 27 for the graveses the poet had much regard and it was mutual a sonnet addressed to wordsworth by the now bishop of limerick was so highly valued by him that it is a pleasure to be able to read it as thus

highest poetical literature knows the lost leader of robert browning esq many have been the speculations and surmises and assertions and contradictions as to who the lost leader was the verdict of one of the immortals on his fellowimmortal concerns us all hence it is with no common thankfulness the editor of wordsworths prose embraces this opportunity of settling the controversy beyond appeal by giving a letter which mr browning has done him the honour to write for publication it is as follows       19 warwickcrescent w feb 24 75       dear mr grosart       i have been asked the question you now address me with and as duly      answered it i cant remember how many times there is no sort of      objection to one more assurance or rather confession on my part      that i did in my hasty youth presume to use the great and      venerated personality of wordsworth as a sort of painters model      one from which this or the other particular feature may be selected      and turned to account had i intended more above all such a      boldness as portraying the entire man i should not have talked      about handfuls of silver and bits of ribbon these never      influenced the change of politics in the great poet whose      defection nevertheless accompanied as it was by a regular face      about of his special party was to my juvenile apprehension and      even mature consideration an event to deplore but just as in the      tapestry on my wall i can recognise figures which have struck out      a fancy on occasion that though truly enough thus derived yet      would be preposterous as a copy so though i dare not deny the      original of my little poem i altogether refuse to have it      considered as the very effigies of such a moral and intellectual      superiority       faithfully yours       robert browning  the editor cannot close this preface without expressing his sense of the greatness of the trust confided to him and the personal benefit it has been to himself to have been brought so near to william wordsworth as he has been in working on this collection of his prose he felt almost awed as he handled the great and good mans mss and found himself behind the screen as it were seeing what he had seen touching what he had touched knowing what he had known feeling what he had felt reverence even veneration is an empty word to utter the emotion excited in such communion these certainly but something tenderer and more human were in head and heart it was a grand highthoughted purelived unique course that was run in those sequestered vales the closer one gets to the man the greater he proves the truer the simpler and it is a benediction to the race amid so many fragmentary and jagged and imperfect lives to have one so rounded and completed so august and so genuine      summon detraction to object the worst     that may be told and utter all it can     it cannot find a blemish to be enforced     against him other than he was a man     and built of flesh and blood and did live here     within the region of infirmity     where all perfections never did appear     to meet in any one so really     but that his frailty ever did

moral life of man alluding to our natural existence addison in a sublime allegory well known to your lordship has represented us as crossing an immense bridge from whose surface from a variety of causes we disappear one after another and are seen no more every one who enters upon public life has such a bridge to pass some slip through at the very commencement of their career from thoughtlessness others pursue their course a little longer till misled by the phantoms of avarice and ambition they fall victims to their delusion your lordship was either seen or supposed to be seen continuing your way for a long time unseduced and undismayed but those who now look for you will look in vain and it is feared you have at last fallen through one of the numerous trapdoors into the tide of contempt to be swept down to the ocean of oblivion  it is not my intention to be illiberal these latter expressions have been forced from me by indignation your lordship has given a proof that even religious controversy may be conducted without asperity i hope i shall profit by your example at the same time with a spirit which you may not approvefor it is a republican spiriti shall not preclude myself from any truths however severe which i may think beneficial to the cause which i have undertaken to defend you will not then be surprised when i inform you that it is only the name of its author which has induced me to notice an appendix to a sermon which you have lately given to the world with a hope that it may have some effect in calming a perturbation which you say has been excited in the minds of the lower orders of the community while with a servility which has prejudiced many people against religion itself the ministers of the church of england have appeared as writers upon public measures only to be the advocates of slavery civil and religious your lordship stood almost alone as the defender of truth and political charity the names of levelling prelate bishop of the dissenters which were intended as a dishonour to your character were looked upon by your friendsperhaps by yourselfas an acknowledgment of your possessing an enlarged and philosophical mind and like the generals in a neighbouring country if it had been equally becoming your profession you might have adopted as an honourable title a denomination intended as a stigma  on opening your appendix your admirers will naturally expect to find an impartial statement of the grievances which harass this nation and a sagacious inquiry into the proper modes of redress they will be disappointed sensible how large a portion of mankind receive opinions upon authority i am apprehensive lest the doctrines which they will there find should derive a weight from your name to which they are by no means intrinsically entitled i will therefore examine what you have advanced from a hope of being able to do away any impression left on the minds of such as may be liable to confound with argument a strong prepossession for your lordships talents experience and virtues  before i take notice of what you appear to have laid down as principles it may not be improper to advert to some incidental opinions found at the commencement of your political confession of faith  at a period big with the fate of the human race i am sorry that you attach so much importance to the personal sufferings of the late royal martyr and that an anxiety for the issue of the present convulsions should not have prevented you from joining in the idle cry of modish lamentation which has resounded from the court to the cottage you wish it to be supposed you are one of those who are unpersuaded of the guilt of louis xvi if you had attended to the history of the french revolution as minutely as its importance demands so far from stopping to bewail his death you would rather have regretted that the blind fondness of his people had placed a human being in that monstrous situation which rendered him unaccountable before a human tribunal a bishop a man of philosophy and humanity15 as distinguished as your lordship declared at the opening of the national conventionand twentyfive millions of men were convinced of the truth of the assertionthat there was not a citizen on the tenth of august who if he could have dragged before the eyes of louis the corpse of one of his murdered brothers might not have exclaimed to him tyran voilà ton ouvrage think of this and you will not want consolation under any depression your spirits may feel at the contrast exhibited by louis on the most splendid throne of the universe and louis alone in the tower of the temple or on the scaffold but there is a class of men who received the news of the late execution with much more heartfelt sorrow than that which you among such a multitude so officiously express the passion of pity is one of which above all others a christian teacher should be cautious of cherishing the abuse when under the influence of reason it is regulated by the disproportion of the pain suffered to the guilt incurred it is from the passion thus directed that the men of whom i have just spoken are afflicted by the catastrophe of the fallen monarch they are sorry that the prejudice and weakness of mankind have made it necessary to force an individual into an unnatural situation which requires more than human talents and human virtues and at the same time precludes him from attaining even a moderate knowledge of common life and from feeling a particular share in the interests of mankind but above all these men lament that any combination of circumstances should have rendered it necessary or advisable to veil for a moment the statues of the laws and that by such emergency the cause of twentyfive millions of people i may say of the whole human race should have been so materially injured any other sorrow for the death of louis is irrational and weak  15 m gregoire  in france royalty is no more the person of the last anointed is no more also and i flatter myself i am not alone even in this kingdom when i wish that it may please the almighty neither by the hands of his priests nor his nobles i allude to a striking passage of racine to raise his posterity to the rank of his ancestors and reillume the torch of extinguished david16  16 see athalie act i scene 2      il faut que sur le trône un roi soit élevé     qui se souvienne un jour quau rang de ses ancêtres  you say i fly with terror and abhorrence even from the altar of liberty when i see it stained with the blood of the aged of the innocent of the defenceless sex of the ministers of religion and of the faithful adherents of a fallen monarch what have you so little knowledge of the nature of man as to be ignorant that a time of revolution is not the season of true liberty alas the obstinacy and perversion of man is such that she is too often obliged to borrow the very arms of despotism to overthrow him and in order to reign in peace must establish herself by violence she deplores such stern necessity but the safety of the people her supreme law is her consolation this apparent contradiction between the principles of liberty and the march of revolutions this spirit of jealousy of severity of disquietude of vexation indispensable from a state of war between the oppressors and oppressed must of necessity confuse the ideas of morality and contract the benign exertion of the best affections of the human heart political virtues are developed at the expense of moral ones and the sweet emotions of compassion evidently dangerous when traitors are to be punished are too often altogether smothered but is this a sufficient reason to reprobate a convulsion from which is to spring a fairer order of things it is the province of education to rectify the erroneous notions which a habit of oppression and even of resistance may have created and to soften this ferocity of character proceeding from a necessary suspension of the mild and social virtues it belongs to her to create a race of men who truly free will look upon their fathers as only enfranchised17  17       dieu la fait remonter par la main de ses prêtres      la tiré par leurs mains de loubli du tombeau      et de david éteint rallumé le flambeau  the conclusion of the same speech applies so strongly to the present period that i cannot forbear transcribing it       daigne daigne mon dieu sur mathan et sur elle      répandre cet esprit dimprudence et derreur      de la chute des rois funeste avantcoureur    i proceed to the sorrow you express for the fate of the french priesthood the measure by which that body was immediately stripped of part of its possessions and a more equal distribution enjoined of the rest does not meet with your lordships approbation you do not question the right of the nation over ecclesiastical wealth you have voluntarily abandoned a ground which you were conscious was altogether untenable having allowed this right can you question the propriety of exerting it at that particular period the urgencies of the state were such as required the immediate application of a remedy even the clergy were conscious of such necessity and aware from the immunities they had long enjoyed that the people would insist upon their bearing some share of the burden offered of themselves a considerable portion of their superfluities the assembly was true to justice and refused to compromise the interests of the nation by accepting as a satisfaction the insidious offerings of compulsive charity they enforced their right they took from the clergy a large share of their wealth and applied it to the alleviation of the national misery experience shows daily the wise employment of the ample provision which yet remains to them while you reflect on the vast diminution which some mens fortunes must have undergone your sorrow for these individuals will be diminished by recollecting the unworthy motives which induced the bulk of them to undertake the office and the scandalous arts which enabled so many to attain the rank and enormous wealth which it has seemed necessary to annex to the charge of a christian pastor you will rather look upon it as a signal act of justice that they should thus unexpectedly be stripped of the rewards of their vices and their crimes if you should lament the sad reverse by which the hero of the necklace18 has been divested of about 1300000 livres of annual revenue you may find some consolation that a part of this prodigious mass of riches is gone to preserve from famine some thousands of curés who were pining in villages unobserved by courts  18 prince de rohan  i now proceed to principles your lordship very properly asserts that the liberty of man in a state of society consists in his being subject to no law but the law enacted by the general will of the society to which he belongs you approved of the object which the french had in view when in the infancy of the revolution they were attempting to destroy arbitrary power and to erect a temple to liberty on its remains it is with surprise then that i find you afterwards presuming to dictate to the world a servile adoption of the british constitution it is with indignation i perceive you reprobate a people for having imagined happiness and liberty more likely to flourish in the open field of a republic than under the shade of monarchy you are therefore guilty of a most glaring contradiction twentyfive millions of frenchmen have felt that they could have no security for their liberties under any modification of monarchical power they have in consequence unanimously chosen a republic you cannot but observe that they have only exercised that right in which by your own confession liberty essentially resides  as to your arguments by which you pretend to justify your anathemas of a republicif arguments they may be calledthey are so concise that i cannot but transcribe them i dislike a republic for this reason because of all forms of government scarcely excepting the most despotic i think a republic the most oppressive to the bulk of the people they are deceived in it with a show of liberty but they live in it under the most odious of all tyranniesthe tyranny of their equals  this passage is a singular proof of that fatality by which the advocates of error furnish weapons for their own destruction while it is merely assertion in respect to a justification of your aversion to republicanism a strong argument may be drawn from it in its favour mr burke in a philosophic lamentation over the extinction of chivalry told us that in those times vice lost half its evil by losing all its grossness infatuated moralist your lordship excites compassion as labouring under the same delusion slavery is a bitter and a poisonous draught we have but one consolation under it that a nation may dash the cup to the ground when she pleases do not imagine that by taking from its bitterness you weaken its deadly quality no by rendering it more palatable you contribute to its power of destruction we submit without repining to the chastisements of providence aware that we are creatures that opposition is vain and remonstrance impossible but when redress is in our own power and resistance is rational we suffer with the same humility from beings like ourselves because we are taught from infancy that we were born in a state of inferiority to our oppressors that they were sent into the world to scourge and we to be scourged accordingly we see the bulk of mankind actuated by these fatal prejudices even more ready to lay themselves under the feet of the great than the great are to trample upon them now taking for granted that in republics men live under the tyranny of what you call their equals the circumstance of this being the most odious of all tyrannies is what a republican would boast of as soon as tyranny becomes odious the principal step is made towards its destruction reflecting on the degraded state of the mass of mankind a philosopher will lament that oppression is not odious to them that the iron while it eats the soul is not felt to enter into it tout homme né dans lesclavage nâit pour lesclavage rien nest plus certain les esclaves perdent tout dans leurs fers jusquau désir den sortir ils aiment leur servitude comme les compagnons dulysse aimaient leur abrutissement  i return to the quotation in which you reprobate republicanism relying upon the temper of the times you have surely thought little argument necessary to content what few will be hardy enough to support the strongest of auxiliaries imprisonment and the pillory has left your arm little to perform but the happiness of mankind is so closely connected with this subject that i cannot suffer such considerations to deter me from throwing out a few hints which may lead to a conclusion that a republic legitimately constructed contains less of an oppressive principle than any other form of government  your lordship will scarcely question that much of human misery that the great evils which desolate states proceed from the governors having an interest distinct from that of the governed it should seem a natural deduction that whatever has a tendency to identify the two must also in the same degree promote the general welfare as the magnitude of almost all states prevents the possibility of their enjoying a pure democracy philosophersfrom a wish as far as is in their power to make the governors and the governed onewill turn their thoughts to the system of universal representation and will annex an equal importance to the suffrage of every individual jealous of giving up no more of the authority of the people than is necessary they will be solicitous of finding out some method by which the office of their delegates may be confined as much as is practicable to the proposing and deliberating upon laws rather than to enacting them reserving to the people the power of finally inscribing them in the national code unless this is attended to as soon as a people has chosen representatives it no longer has a political existence except as it is understood to retain the privilege of annihilating the trust when it shall think proper and of resuming its original power sensible that at the moment of election an interest distinct from that of the general body is created an enlightened legislator will endeavour by every possible method to diminish the operation of such interest the first and most natural mode that presents itself is that of shortening the regular duration of this trust in order that the man who has betrayed it may soon be superseded by a more worthy successor but this is not enough aware of the possibility of imposition and of the natural tendency of power to corrupt the heart of man a sensible republican will think it essential that the office of legislator be not intrusted to the same man for a succession of years he will also be induced to this wise restraint by the grand principle of identification he will be more sure of the virtue of the legislator by knowing that in the capacity of private citizen tomorrow he must either smart under the oppression or bless the justice of the law which he has enacted today  perhaps in the very outset of this inquiry the principle on which i proceed will be questioned and i shall be told that the people are not the proper judges of their own welfare but because under every government of modern times till the foundation of the american republic the bulk of mankind have appeared incapable of discerning their true interests no conclusion can be drawn against my principle at this moment have we not daily the strongest proofs of the success with which in what you call the best of all monarchical governments the popular mind may be debauched left to the quiet exercise of their own judgment do you think that the people would have thought it necessary to set fire to the house of the philosophic priestley and to hunt down his life like that of a traitor or a parricide that deprived almost of the necessaries of existence by the burden of their taxes they would cry out as with one voice for a war from which not a single ray of consolation can visit them to compensate for the additional keenness with which they are about to smart under the scourge of labour of cold and of hunger  appearing as i do the advocate of republicanism let me not be misunderstood i am well aware from the abuse of the executive power in states that there is not a single european nation but what affords a melancholy proof that if at this moment the original authority of the people should be restored all that could be expected from such restoration would in the beginning be but a change of tyranny considering the nature of a republic in reference to the present condition of europe your lordship stops here but a philosopher will extend his views much farther having dried up the source from which flows the corruption of the public opinion he will be sensible that the stream will go on gradually refining itself i must add also that the coercive power is of necessity so strong in all the old governments that a people could not at first make an abuse of that liberty which a legitimate republic supposes the animal just released from its stall will exhaust the overflow of its spirits in a round of wanton vagaries but it will soon return to itself and enjoy its freedom in moderate and regular delight  but to resume the subject of universal representation i ought to have mentioned before that in the choice of its representatives a people will not immorally hold out wealth as a criterion of integrity nor lay down as a fundamental rule that to be qualified for the trying duties of legislation a citizen should be possessed of a certain fixed property virtues talents and acquirements are all that it will look for  having destroyed every external object of delusion let us now see what makes the supposition necessary that the people will mislead themselves your lordship respects peasants and mechanics when they intrude not themselves into concerns for which their education has not fitted them  setting aside the idea of a peasant or mechanic being a legislator what vast education is requisite to enable him to judge amongst his neighbours which is most qualified by his industry and integrity to be intrusted with the care of the interests of himself and of his fellowcitizens but leaving this ground as governments formed on such a plan proceed in a plain and open manner their administration would require much less of what is usually called talents and experience that is of disciplined treachery and hoary machiavelism and at the same time as it would no longer be their interest to keep the mass of the nation in ignorance a moderate portion of useful knowledge would be universally disseminated if your lordship has travelled in the democratic cantons of switzerland you must have seen the herdsman with the staff in one hand and the book in the other in the constituent assembly of france was found a peasant whose sagacity was as distinguished as his integrity whose blunt honesty overawed and baffled the refinements of hypocritical patriots the people of paris followed him with acclamations and the name of père gerard will long be mentioned with admiration and respect through the eightythree departments  from these hints if pursued further might be demonstrated the expediency of the whole people intruding themselves on the office of legislation and the wisdom of putting into force what they may claim as a right but government is divided into two partsthe legislative and executive the executive power you would lodge in the hands of an individual before we inquire into the propriety of this measure it will be necessary to state the proper objects of the executive power in governments where the principle of universal representation is admitted with regard to that portion of this power which is exerted in the application of the laws it may be observed that much of it would be superseded as laws being but the expression of the general will would be enacted only from an almost universal conviction of their utility any resistance to such laws any desire of eluding them must proceed from a few refractory individuals as far then as relates to the internal administration of the country a republic has a manifest advantage over a monarchy inasmuch as less force is requisite to compel obedience to its laws  from the judicial tribunals of our own country though we labour under a variety of partial and oppressive laws we have an evident proof of the nullity of regal interference as the kings name is confessedly a mere fiction and justice is known to be most equitably administered when the judges are least dependent on the crown  i have spoken of laws partial and oppressive our penal code is so crowded with disproportioned penalties and indiscriminate severity that a conscientious man would sacrifice in many instances his respect for the laws to the common feelings of humanity and there must be a strange vice in that legislation from which can proceed laws in whose execution a man cannot be instrumental without forfeiting his selfesteem and incurring the contempt of his fellowcitizens  but to return from this digression with regard to the other branches of the executive government which relate rather to original measures than to administering the law it may be observed that the power exercised in conducting them is distinguished by almost imperceptible shades from the legislative and that all such as admit of open discussion and of the delay attendant on public deliberations are properly the province of the representative assembly if this observation be duly attended to it will appear that this part of the executive power will be extremely circumscribed will be stripped almost entirely of a deliberative capacity and will be reduced to a mere hand or instrument as a republican government would leave this power to a select body destitute of the means of corruption and whom the people continually contributing could at all times bring to account or dismiss will it not necessarily ensue that a body so selected and supported would perform their simple functions with greater efficacy and fidelity than the complicated concerns of royalty can be expected to meet with in the councils of princes of men who from their wealth and interest have forced themselves into trust and of statesmen whose constant object is to exalt themselves by laying pitfalls for their colleagues and for their country  i shall pursue this subject no further but adopting your lordships method of argument instead of continuing to demonstrate the superiority of a republican executive government i will repeat some of the objections which have been often made to monarchy and have not been answered  my first objection to regal government is its instability proceeding from a variety of causes where monarchy is found in its greatest intensity as in morocco and turkey this observation is illustrated in a very pointed manner and indeed is more or less striking as governments are more or less despotic the reason is obvious as the monarch is the chooser of his ministers and as his own passions and caprice are in general the sole guides of his conduct these ministers instead of pursuing directly the one grand object of national welfare will make it their chief study to vary their measures according to his humours but a minister may be refractory his successor will naturally run headlong into plans totally the reverse of the former system for if he treads in the same path he is well aware that a similar fate will attend him this observation will apply to each succession of kings who from vanity and a desire of distinction will in general studiously avoid any step which may lead to a suspicion that they are so spiritless as to imitate their predecessor that a similar instability is not incident to republics is evident from their very constitution  as from the nature of monarchy particularly of hereditary monarchy there must always be a vast disproportion between the duties to be performed and the powers that are to perform them and as the measures of government far from gaining additional vigour are on the contrary enfeebled by being intrusted to one hand what arguments can be used for allowing to the will of a single being a weight which as history shows will subvert that of the whole body politic and this brings me to my grand objection to monarchy which is drawn from the eternal nature of man the office of king is a trial to which human virtue is not equal pure and universal representation by which alone liberty can be secured cannot i think exist together with monarchy it seems madness to expect a manifestation of the general will at the same time that we allow to a particular will that weight which it must obtain in all governments that can with any propriety be called monarchical they must war with each other till one of them is extinguished it was so in france and  i shall not pursue this topic further but as you are a teacher of purity of morals i cannot but remind you of that atmosphere of corruption without which it should seem that courts cannot exist  you seem anxious to explain what ought to be understood by the equality of men in a state of civil society but your lordships success has not answered your trouble if you had looked in the articles of the rights of man you would have found your efforts superseded equality without which liberty cannot exist is to be met with in perfection in that state in which no distinctions are admitted but such as have evidently for their object the general good the end of government cannot be attained without authorising some members of the society to command and of course without imposing on the rest the necessity of obedience  here then is an inevitable inequality which may be denominated that of power in order to render this as small as possible a legislator will be careful not to give greater force to such authority than is essential to its due execution government is at best but a necessary evil compelled to place themselves in a state of subordination men will obviously endeavour to prevent the abuse of that superiority to which they submit accordingly they will cautiously avoid whatever may lead those in whom it is acknowledged to suppose they hold it as a right nothing will more effectually contribute to this than that the person in whom authority has been lodged should occasionally descend to the level of private citizen he will learn from it a wholesome lesson and the people will be less liable to confound the person with the power on this principle hereditary authority will be proscribed and on another alsothat in such a system as that of hereditary authority no security can be had for talents adequate to the discharge of the office and consequently the people can only feel the mortification of being humbled without having protected themselves  another distinction will arise amongst mankind which though it may be easily modified by government exists independent of it i mean the distinction of wealth which always will attend superior talents and industry it cannot be denied that the security of individual property is one of the strongest and most natural motives to induce men to bow their necks to the yoke of civil government in order to attain this end of security to property a legislator will proceed with impartiality he should not suppose that when he has insured to their proprietors the possession of lands and movables against the depredation of the necessitous nothing remains to be done the history of all ages has demonstrated that wealth not only can secure itself but includes even an oppressive principle aware of this and that the extremes of poverty and riches have a necessary tendency to corrupt the human heart he will banish from his code all laws such as the unnatural monster of primogeniture such as encourage associations against labour in the form of corporate bodies and indeed all that monopolising system of legislation whose baleful influence is shown in the depopulation of the country and in the necessity which reduces the sad relicks to owe their very existence to the ostentatious bounty of their oppressors if it is true in common life it is still more true in governments that we should be just before we are generous but our legislators seem to have forgotten or despised this homely maxim they have unjustly left unprotected that most important part of property not less real because it has no material existence that which ought to enable the labourer to provide food for himself and his family i appeal to innumerable statutes whose constant and professed object it is to lower the price of labour to compel the workman to be content with arbitrary wages evidently too small from the necessity of legal enforcement of the acceptance of them even from the astonishing amount of the sums raised for the support of one description of the poor may be concluded the extent and greatness of that oppression whose effects have rendered it possible for the few to afford so much and have shown us that such a multitude of our brothers exist in even helpless indigence your lordship tells us that the science of civil government has received all the perfection of which it is capable for my part i am more enthusiastic the sorrow i feel from the contemplation of this melancholy picture is not unconsoled by a comfortable hope that the class of wretches called mendicants will not much longer shock the feelings of humanity that the miseries entailed upon the marriage of those who are not rich will no longer tempt the bulk of mankind to fly to that promiscuous intercourse to which they are impelled by the instincts of nature and the dreadful satisfaction of escaping the prospect of infants sad fruit of such intercourse whom they are unable to support if these flattering prospects be ever realised it must be owing to some wise and salutary regulations counteracting that inequality among mankind which proceeds from the present fixed disproportion of their possessions  i am not an advocate for the agrarian law nor for sumptuary regulations but i contend that the people amongst whom the law of primogeniture exists and among whom corporate bodies are encouraged and immense salaries annexed to useless and indeed hereditary offices is oppressed by an inequality in the distribution of wealth which does not necessarily attend men in a state of civil society  thus far we have considered inequalities inseparable from civil society but other arbitrary distinctions exist among mankind either from choice or usurpation i allude to titles to stars ribbons and garters and other badges of fictitious superiority your lordship will not question the grand principle on which this inquiry set out i look upon it then as my duty to try the propriety of these distinctions by that criterion and think it will be no difficult task to prove that these separations among mankind are absurd impolitic and immoral considering hereditary nobility as a reward for services rendered to the stateand it is to my charity that you owe the permission of taking up the question on this groundwhat services can a man render to the state adequate to such a compensation that the making of laws upon which the happiness of millions is to depend shall be lodged in him and his posterity however depraved may be their principles however contemptible their understandings  but here i may be accused of sophistry i ought to subtract every idea of power from such distinction though from the weakness of mankind it is impossible to disconnect them what services then can a man render to society to compensate for the outrage done to the dignity of our nature when we bind ourselves to address him and his posterity with humiliating circumlocutions calling him most noble most honourable most high most august serene excellent eminent and so forth when it is more than probable that such unnatural flattery will but generate vices which ought to consign him to neglect and solitude or make him the perpetual object of the finger of scorn and does not experience justify the observation that where titlesa thing very rarehave been conferred as the rewards of merit those to whom they have descended far from being thereby animated to imitate their ancestor have presumed upon that lustre which they supposed thrown round them and prodigally relying on such resources lavished what alone was their own their personal reputation  it would be happy if this delusion were confined to themselves but alas the world is weak enough to grant the indulgence which they assume vice which is forgiven in one character will soon cease to meet with sternness of rebuke when found in others even at first she will entreat pardon with confidence assured that ere long she will be charitably supposed to stand in no need of it  but let me ask you seriously from the mode in which those distinctions are originally conferred is it not almost necessary that far from being the rewards of services rendered to the state they should usually be the recompense of an industrious sacrifice of the general welfare to the particular aggrandisement of that power by which they are bestowed let us even alter their source and consider them as proceeding from the nation itself and deprived of that hereditary quality even here i should proscribe them and for the most evident reasonthat a mans past services are no sufficient security for his future character he who today merits the civic wreath may tomorrow deserve the tarpeian rock besides where respect is not perverted where the world is not taught to reverence men without regarding their conduct the esteem of mankind will have a very different value and when a proper independence is secured will be regarded as a sufficient recompense for services however important and will be a much surer guarantee of the continuance of such virtues as may deserve it  i have another strong objection to nobility which is that it has a necessary tendency to dishonour labour a prejudice which extends far beyond its own circle that it binds down whole ranks of men to idleness while it gives the enjoyment of a reward which exceeds the hopes of the most active exertions of human industry the languid tedium of this noble repose must be dissipated and gaming with the tricking manoeuvres of the horserace afford occupation to hours which it would be happy for mankind had they been totally unemployed  reflecting on the corruption of the public manners does your lordship shudder at the prostitution which miserably deluges our streets you may find the cause in our aristocratical prejudices are you disgusted with the hypocrisy and sycophancy of our intercourse in private life you may find the cause in the necessity of dissimulation which we have established by regulations which oblige us to address as our superiors indeed as our masters men whom we cannot but internally despise do you lament that such large portions of mankind should stoop to occupations unworthy the dignity of their nature you may find in the pride and luxury thought necessary to nobility how such servile arts are encouraged besides where the most honourable of the land do not blush to accept such offices as groom of the bedchamber master of the hounds lords in waiting captain of the honourable band of gentlemenpensioners is it astonishing that the bulk of the people should not ask of an occupation what is it but what may be gained by it  if the long equestrian train of equipage should make your lordship sigh for the poor who are pining in hunger you will find that little is thought of snatching the bread from their mouths to eke out the necessary splendour of nobility  i have not time to pursue this subject further but am so strongly impressed with the baleful influence of aristocracy and nobility upon human happiness and virtue that if as i am persuaded monarchy cannot exist without such supporters i think that reason sufficient for the preference i have given to the republican system  it is with reluctance that i quit the subjects i have just touched upon but the nature of this address does not permit me to continue the discussion i proceed to what more immediately relates to this kingdom at the present crisis  you ask with triumphant confidence to what other law are the people of england subject than the general will of the society to which they belong is your lordship to be told that acquiescence is not choice and that obedience is not freedom if there is a single man in great britain who has no suffrage in the election of a representative the will of the society of which he is a member is not generally expressed he is a helot in that society you answer the question so confidently put in this singular manner the king we are all justly persuaded has not the inclinationand we all know that if he had the inclination he has not the powerto substitute his will in the place of law the house of lords has no such power the house of commons has no such power this passage so artfully and unconstitutionally framed to agree with the delusions of the moment cannot deceive a thinking reader the expression of your full persuasion of the upright intentions of the king can only be the language of flattery you are not to be told that it is constitutionally a maxim not to attribute to the person of the king the measures and misconduct of government had you chosen to speak as you ought to have done openly and explicitly you must have expressed your just persuasion and implicit confidence in the integrity moderation and wisdom of his majestys ministers have you forgot the avowed ministerial maxim of sir robert walpole are you ignorant of the overwhelming corruption of the present day  you seem unconscious of the absurdity of separating what is inseparable even in imagination would it have been any consolation to the miserable romans under the second triumvirate to have been asked insultingly is it octavius is it anthony or is it lepidus that has caused this bitterness of affliction and when the answer could not be returned with certainty to have been reproached that their sufferings were imaginary the fact is that the king and lords and commons by what is termed the omnipotence of parliament have constitutionally the right of enacting whatever laws they please in defiance of the petitions or remonstrances of the nation they have the power of doubling our enormous debt of 240 millions and may pursue measures which could never be supposed the emanation of the general will without concluding the people stripped of reason of sentiment and even of that first instinct which prompts them to preserve their own existence  i congratulate your lordship upon your enthusiastic fondness for the judicial proceedings of this country i am happy to find you have passed through life without having your fleece torn from your back in the thorny labyrinth of litigation but you have not lived always in colleges and must have passed by some victims whom it cannot be supposed without a reflection on your heart that you have forgotten here i am reminded of what i have said on the subject of representationto be qualified for the office of legislation you should have felt like the bulk of mankind their sorrows should be familiar to you of which if you are ignorant how can you redress them as a member of the assembly which from a confidence in its experience sagacity and wisdom the constitution has invested with the supreme appellant jurisdiction to determine the most doubtful points of an intricate jurisprudence your lordship cannot i presume be ignorant of the consuming expense of our neverending process the verbosity of unintelligible statutes and the perpetual contrariety in our judicial decisions  the greatest freedom that can be enjoyed by man in a state of civil society the greatest security that can be given with respect to the protection of his character property personal liberty limb and life is afforded to every individual by our present constitution  let it never be forgotten by ourselves and let us impress the observation upon the hearts of our children that we are in possession of both liberty and equality of as much of both as can be consistent with the end for which civil society was introduced among mankind  many of my readers will hardly believe me when i inform them that these passages are copied verbatim from your appendix mr burke roused the indignation of all ranks of men when by a refinement in cruelty superior to that which in the east yokes the living to the dead he strove to persuade us that we and our posterity to the end of time were riveted to a constitution by the indissoluble compact ofa dead parchment and were bound to cherish a corpse at the bosom when reason might call aloud that it should be entombed your lordship aims at the same detestable object by means more criminal because more dangerous and insidious attempting to lull the people of england into a belief that any inquiries directed towards the nature of liberty and equality can in no other way lead to their happiness than by convincing them that they have already arrived at perfection in the science of government what is your object but to exclude them for ever from the most fruitful field of human knowledge besides it is another cause to execrate this doctrine that the consequence of such fatal delusion would be that they must entirely draw off their attention not only from the government but from their governors that the stream of public vigilance far from clearing and enriching the prospect of society would by its stagnation consign it to barrenness and by its putrefaction infect it with death you have aimed an arrow at liberty and philosophy the eyes of the human race why like the inveterate enemy of philip in putting your name to the shaft did you not declare openly its destination  as a teacher of religion your lordship cannot be ignorant of a class of breaches of duty which may be denominated faults of omission you profess to give your opinions upon the present turbulent crisis expressing a wish that they may have some effect in tranquillising the minds of the people whence comes it then that the two grand causes of this working of the popular mind are passed over in silence your lordships conduct may bring to mind the story of a company of strolling comedians who gave out the play of hamlet as the performance of the evening the audience were not a little surprised to be told on the drawing up of the curtain that from circumstances of particular convenience it was hoped they would dispense with the omission of the character ofhamlet but to be seriousfor the subject is serious in the extremefrom your silence respecting the general call for a parliamentary reform supported by your assertion that we at present enjoy as great a portion of liberty and equality as is consistent with civil society what can be supposed but that you are a determined enemy to the redress of what the people of england call and feel to be grievances  from your omitting to speak upon the war and your general disapprobation of french measures and french principles expressed particularly at this moment we are necessarily led also to conclude that you have no wish to dispel an infatuation which is now giving up to the sword so large a portion of the poor and consigning the rest to the more slow and more painful consumption of want i could excuse your silence on this point as it would ill become an english bishop at the close of the eighteenth century to make the pulpit the vehicle of exhortations which would have disgraced the incendiary of the crusades the hermit peter but you have deprived yourself of the plea of decorum by giving no opinion on the reform of the legislature as undoubtedly you have some secret reason for the reservation of your sentiments on this latter head i cannot but apply the same reason to the former upon what principle is your conduct to be explained in some parts of england it is quaintly said when a drunken man is seen reeling towards his home that he has business on both sides of the road observing your lordships tortuous path the spectators will be far from insinuating that you have partaken of mr burkes intoxicating bowl they will content themselves shaking their heads as you stagger along with remarking that you have business on both sides of the road  the friends of liberty congratulate themselves upon the odium under which they are at present labouring as the causes which have produced it have obliged so many of her false adherents to disclaim with officious earnestness any desire to promote her interests nor are they disheartened by the diminution which their body is supposed already to have sustained conscious that an enemy lurking in our ranks is ten times more formidable than when drawn out against us that the unblushing aristocracy of a maury or a cazalès is far less dangerous than the insidious mask of patriotism assumed by a la fayette or a mirabeau we thank you for your desertion political convulsions have been said particularly to call forth concealed abilities but it has been seldom observed how vast is their consumption of them reflecting upon the fate of the greatest portion of the members of the constituent and legislative assemblies we must necessarily be struck with a prodigious annihilation of human talents aware that this necessity is attached to a struggle for liberty we are the less sorry that we can expect no advantage from the mental endowments of your lordship     appendix to bishop watsons sermon  it is deemed expedient to reprint here the appendix to bishop watsons sermon which is animadverted on in the preceding apology g   the sermon which is now for the first time published was written many years ago it may perhaps on that account be more worthy of the attention of those for whose benefit it is designed if it shall have any effect in calming the perturbation which has been lately excited and which still subsists in the minds of the lower classes of the community i shall not be ashamed of having given to the world a composition in every other light uninteresting i will take this opportunity of adding with the same intention a few reflections on the present circumstances of our own and of a neighbouring country  with regard to francei have no hesitation in declaring that the object which the french seemed to have in view at the commencement of their revolution had my hearty approbation the object was to free themselves and their posterity from arbitrary power i hope there is not a man in great britain so little sensible of the blessings of that free constitution under which he has the happiness to live so entirely dead to the interests of general humanity as not to wish that a constitution similar to our own might be established not only in france but in every despotic state in europe not only in europe but in every quarter of the globe  it is one thing to approve of an end another to approve of the means by which an end is accomplished i did not approve of the means by which the first revolution was effected in france i thought that it would have been a wiser measure to have abridged the oppressive privileges and to have lessened the enormous number of the nobility than to have abolished the order i thought that the state ought not in justice to have seized any part of the property of the church till it had reverted as it were to the community by the death of its immediate possessors i thought that the king was not only treated with unmerited indignity but that too little authority was left him to enable him as the chief executive magistrate to be useful to the state these were some of my reasons for not approving the means by which the first revolution in france was brought about as to other evils which took place on the occasion i considered them certainly as evils of importance but at the same time as evils inseparable from a state of civil commotion and which i conceived would be more than compensated by the establishment of a limited monarchy  the french have abandoned the constitution they had at first established and have changed it for another no one can reprobate with more truth than i do both the means and the end of this change the end has been the establishment of a republic now a republic is a form of government which of all others i most dislikeand i dislike it for this reason because of all forms of government scarcely excepting the most despotic i think a republic the most oppressive to the bulk of the people they are deceived in it with the show of liberty but they live in it under the most odious of all tyrannies the tyranny of their equals with respect to the means by which this new republic has been erected in france they have been sanguinary savage more than brutal they not merely fill the heart of every individual with commiseration for the unfortunate sufferers but they exhibit to the eye of contemplation an humiliating picture of human nature when its passions are not regulated by religion or controlled by law i fly with terror and abhorrence even from the altar of liberty when i see it stained with the blood of the aged of the innocent of the defenceless sex of the ministers of religion and of the faithful adherents of a fallen monarch my heart sinks within me when i see it streaming with the blood of the monarch himself merciful god strike speedily we beseech thee with deep contrition and sincere remorse the obdurate hearts of the relentless perpetrators and projectors of these horrid deeds lest they should suddenly sink into eternal and extreme perdition loaded with an unutterable weight of unrepented and except through the blood of him whose religion they reject inexpiable sin  the monarch you will tell me was guilty of perfidy and perjury i know not that he was guilty of either but admitting that he has been guilty of both who alas of the sons of men is so confident in the strength of his own virtue so assured of his own integrity and intrepidity of character as to be certain that under similar temptations he would not have been guilty of similar offences surely it would have been no diminution of the sternness of new republican virtue no disgrace to the magnanimity of a great nation if it had pardoned the perfidy which its own oppression had occasioned if it had remitted the punishment of the perjury of the king to the tribunal of him by whom kings reign and princes decree justice  and are there any men in this kingdom except such as find their account in public confusion who would hazard the introduction of such scenes of rapine barbarity and bloodshed as have disgraced france and outraged humanity for the sake of obtainingwhatliberty and equality i suspect that the meaning of these terms is not clearly and generally understood it may be of use to explain them  the liberty of a man in a state of nature consists in his being subject to no law but the law of nature and the liberty of a man in a state of society consists in his being subject to no law but to the law enacted by the general will of the society to which he belongs and to what other law is any man in great britain subject the king we are all justly persuaded has not the inclination and we all know that if he had the inclination he has not the power to substitute his will in the place of the law the house of lords has no such power the house of commons has no such power the church has no such power the rich men of the country have no such power the poorest man amongst us the beggar at our door is governednot by the uncertain passionate arbitrary will of an individualnot by the selfish insolence of an aristocratic factionnot by the madness of democratic violencebut by the fixed impartial deliberate voice of law enacted by the general suffrage of a free people is your property injured law indeed does not give you property but it ascertains it property is acquired by industry and probity by the exercise of talents and ingenuity and the possession of it is secured by the laws of the community against whom think you is it secured it is secured against thieves and robbers against idle and profligate men who however low your condition may be would be glad to deprive you of the little you possess it is secured not only against such disturbers of the public peace but against the oppression of the noble the rapacity of the powerful and the avarice of the rich the courts of british justice are impartial and incorrupt they respect not the persons of men the poor mans lamb is in their estimation as sacred as the monarchs crown with inflexible integrity they adjudge to every man his own your property under their protection is secure if your personal liberty be unjustly restrained though but for an hour and that by the highest servants of the crown the crown cannot screen them the throne cannot hide them the law with an undaunted arm seizes them and drags them with irresistible might to the judgment of whomof your equalsof twelve of your neighbours in such a constitution as this what is there to complain of on the score of liberty  the greatest freedom that can be enjoyed by man in a state of civil society the greatest security that can be given him with respect to the protection of his character property personal liberty limb and life is afforded to every individual by our present constitution  the equality of men in a state of nature does not consist in an equality of bodily strength or intellectual ability but in their being equally free from the dominion of each other the equality of men in a state of civil society does not consist in an equality of wisdom honesty ingenuity industry nor in an equality of property resulting from a due exertion of these talents but in being equally subject to equally protected by the same laws and who knows not that every individual in this great nation is in this respect equal to every other there is not one law for the nobles another for the commons of the landone for the clergy another for the laityone for the rich another for the poor the nobility it is true have some privileges annexed to their birth the judges and other magistrates have some annexed to their office and professional men have some annexed to their professionsbut these privileges are neither injurious to the liberty or property of other men and you might as reasonably contend that the bramble ought to be equal to the oak the lamb to the lion as that no distinctions should take place between the members of the same society the burdens of the state are distributed through the whole community with as much impartiality as the complex nature of taxation will admit every man sustains a part in proportion to his strength no order is exempted from the payment of taxes nor is any order of men exclusively entitled to the enjoyment of the lucrative offices of the state all cannot enjoy them but all enjoy a capacity of acquiring them the son of the meanest man in the nation may become a general or an admiral a lord chancellor or an archbishop if any persons have been so simple as to suppose that even the french ever intended by the term equality an equality of property they have been quite mistaken in their ideas the french never understood by it anything materially different from what we and our ancestors have been in full possession of for many ages  other nations may deluge their land with blood in struggling for liberty and equality but let it never be forgotten by ourselves and let us impress the observation upon the hearts of our children that we are in possession of both of as much of both as can be consistent with the end for which civil society was introduced amongst mankind  the provision which is made for the poor in this kingdom is so liberal as in the opinion of some to discourage industry the rental of the lands in england and wales does not i conjecture amount to more than eighteen millions a year and the poor rates amount to two millions the poor then at present possess a ninth part of the landed rental of the country and reckoning ten pounds for the annual maintenance of each pauper it may be inferred that those who are maintained by the community do not constitute a fortieth part of the people an equal division of land would be to the poor a great misfortune they would possess far less than by the laws of the land they are at present entitled to when we add to this consideration an account of the immense sums annually subscribed by the rich for the support of hospitals infirmaries dispensariesfor the relief of sufferers by fire tempests famine loss of cattle great sickness and other misfortunes all of which charities must cease were all men on a level for all men would then be equally poorit cannot but excite ones astonishment that so foolish a system should have ever been so much as mentioned by any man of common sense it is a system not practicable and was it practicable it would not be useful and was it useful it would not be just  but some one may think and indeed it has been studiously inculcated into the minds of the multitude that a monarchy even a limited one is a far more expensive mode of civil government than a republic that a civillist of a million a year is an enormous sum which might be saved to the nation supposing that every shilling of this sum could be saved and that every shilling of it was expended in supporting the dignity of the crownboth which suppositions are entirely falsestill should i think the liberty the prosperity the tranquillity the happiness of this great nation cheaply purchased by such a sum still should i think that he would be a madman in politics who would by a change of the constitution risk these blessings and france supplies us with a proof that infinite risk would be run for a paltry saving of expense i am not nor have ever been the patron of corruption so far as the civillist has a tendency to corrupt the judgment of any member of either house of parliament it has a bad tendency which i wish it had not but i cannot wish to see the splendour of the crown reduced to nothing lest its proper weight in the scale of the constitution should be thereby destroyed a great portion of this million is expended in paying the salaries of the judges the interpreters of our law the guardians of our lives and properties another portion is expended in maintaining ambassadors at different courts to protect the general concerns of the nation from foreign aggression another portion is expended in pensions and donations to men of letters and ingenuity to men who have by naval military or civil services just claims to the attention of their country to persons of respectable families and connections who have been humbled and broken down by misfortunes i do not speak with accuracy nor on such a subject is accuracy requisite but i am not far wide of truth in saying that a fifth part of the million is more than sufficient to defray the expenses of the royal household what a mighty matter is it to complain of that each individual contributes less than sixpence a year towards the support of the monarchy  that the constitution of this country is so perfect as neither to require or admit of any improvement is a proposition to which i never did or ever can assent but i think it far too excellent to be amended by peasants and mechanics i do not mean to speak of peasants and mechanics with any degree of disrespect i am not so ignorant of the importance either of the natural or social chain by which all the individuals of the human race are connected together as to think disrespectfully of any link of it peasants and mechanics are as useful to the state as any other order of men but their utility consists in their discharging well the duties of their respective stations it ceases when they affect to become legislators when they intrude themselves into concerns for which their education has not fitted them the liberty of the press is a main support of the liberty of the nation it is a blessing which it is our duty to transmit to posterity but a bad use is sometimes made of it and its use is never more pernicious than when it is employed to infuse into the minds of the lowest orders of the community disparaging ideas concerning the constitution of their country no danger need be apprehended from a candid examination of our own constitution or from a display of the advantages of any other it will bear to be contrasted with the best but all men are not qualified to make the comparison and there are so many men in every community who wish to have no government at all that an appeal to them on such a point ought never to be made  there are probably in every government upon earth circumstances which a man accustomed to the abstract investigation of truth may easily prove to be deviations from the rigid rule of strict political justice but whilst these deviations are either generally not known or though known generally acquiesced in as matters of little moment to the general felicity i cannot think it to be the part either of a good man or of a good citizen to be zealous in recommending such matters to the discussion of ignorant and uneducated men  i am far from insinuating that the science of politics is involved in mystery or that men of plain understandings should be debarred from examining the principles of the government to which they yield obedience all that i contend for is thisthat the foundations of our government ought not to be overturned nor the edifice erected thereon tumbled into ruins because an acute politician may pretend that he has discovered a flaw in the building or that he could have laid the foundation after a better model  what would you say to a stranger who should desire you to pull down your house because forsooth he had built one in france or america after what he thought a better plan you would say to him no sirmy ancestors have lived in this mansion comfortably and honourably for many generations all its walls are strong and all its timbers sound if i should observe a decay in any of its parts i know how to make the reparation without the assistance of strangers and i know too that the reparation when made by myself may be made without injury either to the strength or beauty of the building it has been buffeted in the course of ages by a thousand storms yet still it stands unshaken as a rock the wonder of all my neighbours each of whom sighs for one of a similar construction your house may be suited to your climate and temper this is suited to mine permit me however to observe to you that you have not yet lived long enough in your new house to be sensible of all the inconveniences to which it may be liable nor have you yet had any experience of its strength it has yet sustained no shocks the first whirlwind may scatter its component members in the air the first earthquake may shake its foundation the first inundation may sweep the superstructure from the surface of the earth i hope no accident will happen to your house but i am satisfied with mine own  great calamities of every kind attend the breaking up of established governmentsyet there are some forms of government especially when they happen to be badly administered so exceedingly destructive of the happiness of mankind that a change of them is not improvidently purchased at the expense of the mischief accompanying their subversion our government is not of that kind look round the globe and see if you can discover a single nation on all its surface so powerful so rich so beneficent so free and happy as our own may heaven avert from the minds of my countrymen the slightest wish to abolish their constitution  kingdoms observes mr locke have been overturned by the pride ambition and turbulency of private men by the peoples wantonness and desire to cast off the lawful authority of their rulers as well as by the rulers insolence and endeavours to get and exercise an arbitrary power over the people the recent danger to our constitution was in my opinion small for i considered its excellence to be so obvious to men even of the most unimproved understandings that i looked upon it as an idle and fruitless effort either in foreign or domestic incendiaries to endeavour to persuade the bulk of the people to consent to an alteration of it in favour of a republic i knew indeed that in every country the flagitious dregs of a nation were always ripe for revolutions but i was sensible at the same time that it was the interest not only of the opulent and powerful not only of the mercantile and middle classes of life but even of honest labourers and manufacturers of every sober and industrious man to resist the licentious principles of such pestilent members shall i call them or outcasts of society men better informed and wiser than myself thought that the constitution was in great danger whether in fact the danger was great or small it is not necessary now to inquire it may be more useful to declare that in my humble opinion the danger of whatever magnitude it may have been did not originate in any encroachments of either the legislative or executive power on the liberties or properties of the people but in the wild fancies and turbulent tempers of discontented or illinformed individuals i sincerely rejoice that through the vigilance of administration this turbulency has received a check the hopes of bad men have been disappointed and the understandings of mistaken men have been enlightened by the general and unequivocal judgment of a whole nation a nation not more renowned for its bravery and its humanity though justly celebrated for both than for its loyalty to its princes and what is perfectly consistent with loyalty for its love of liberty and attachment to the constitution wise men have formed it brave men have bled for it it is our part to preserve it  r

the following pages originated in the opposition which was made by his majestys ministers to the expression in public meetings and otherwise of the opinions and feelings of the people concerning the convention of cintra for the sake of immediate and general circulation i determined when i had made a considerable progress in the manuscript to print it in different portions in one of the daily newspapers accordingly two portions of it extending to page 25 were printed in the months of december and january in the courieras being one of the most impartial and extensively circulated journals of the time the reader is requested to bear in mind this previous publication otherwise he will be at a loss to account for the arrangement of the matter in one instance in the earlier part of the work an accidental loss of several sheets of the manuscript delayed the continuance of the publication in that manner till the close of the christmas holidays andthe pressure of public business rendering it then improbable that room could be found in the columns of the paper regularly to insert matter extending to such a lengththis plan of publication was given up  it may be proper to state that in the extracts which have been made from the spanish proclamations i have been obliged to content myself with the translations which appeared in the public journals having only in one instance had access to the original this is in some cases to be regrettedwhere the language falls below the dignity of the matter but in general it is not so and the feeling has suggested correspondent expressions to the translators hastily as no doubt they must have performed their work  i must entreat the reader to bear in mind that i began to write upon this subject in november last and have continued without bringing my work earlier to a conclusion partly from accident and partly from a wish to possess additional documents and facts passing occurrences have made changes in the situation of certain objects spoken of but i have not thought it necessary to accommodate what i had previously written to these changes the whole stands without alteration except where additions have been made or errors corrected  as i have spoken without reserve of things and of persons as far as it was necessary to illustrate things but no further and as this has been uniformly done according to the light of my conscience i have deemed it right to prefix my name to these pages in order that this last testimony of a sincere mind might not be wanting  may 20th 1809     concerning the convention of cintra                                        the convention recently concluded by the generals at the head of the british army in portugal is one of the most important events of our time it would be deemed so in france if the ruler of that country could dare to make it public with those merely of its known bearings and dependences with which the english people are acquainted it has been deemed so in spain and portugal as far as the people of those countries have been permitted to gain or have gained a knowledge of it and what this nation has felt and still feels upon the subject is sufficiently manifest wherever the tidings were communicated they carried agitation along with thema conflict of sensations in which though sorrow was predominant yet through force of scorn impatience hope and indignation and through the universal participation in passions so complex and the sense of power which this necessarily includedthe whole partook of the energy and activity of congratulation and joy not a street not a public room not a fireside in the island which was not disturbed as by a local or private trouble men of all estates conditions and tempers were affected apparently in equal degrees yet was the event by none received as an open and measurable affliction it had indeed features bold and intelligible to every one but there was an underexpression which was strange dark and mysteriousand accordingly as different notions prevailed or the object was looked at in different points of view we were astonished like men who are overwhelmed without forewarningfearful like men who feel themselves to be helpless and indignant and angry like men who are betrayed in a word it would not be too much to say that the tidings of this event did not spread with the commotion of a storm which sweeps visibly over our heads but like an earthquake which rocks the ground under our feet  how was it possible that it could be otherwise for that army had been sent upon a service which appealed so strongly to all that was human in the heart of this nationthat there was scarcely a gallant father of a family who had not his moments of regret that he was not a soldier by profession which might have made it his duty to accompany it every highminded youth grieved that his first impulses which would have sent him upon the same errand were not to be yielded to and that afterthought did not sanction and confirm the instantaneous dictates or the reiterated persuasions of an heroic spirit the army took its departure with prayers and blessings which were as widely spread as they were fervent and intense for it was not doubted that on this occasion every person of which it was composed from the general to the private soldier would carry both into his conflicts with the enemy in the field and into his relations of peaceful intercourse with the inhabitants not only the virtues which might be expected from him as a soldier but the antipathies and sympathies the loves and hatreds of a citizenof a human beingacting in a manner hitherto unprecedented under the obligation of his human and social nature if the conduct of the rapacious and merciless adversary rendered it neither easy nor wisemade it i might say impossible to give way to that unqualified admiration of courage and skill made it impossible in relation to him to be exalted by those triumphs of the courteous affections and to be purified by those refinements of civility which do more than any thing reconcile a man of thoughtful mind and humane dispositions to the horrors of ordinary war it was felt that for such loss the benign and accomplished soldier would upon this mission be abundantly recompensed by the enthusiasm of fraternal love with which his ally the oppressed people whom he was going to aid in rescuing themselves would receive him and that this and the virtues which he would witness in them would furnish his heart with neverfailing and far nobler objects of complacency and admiration the discipline of the army was well known and as a machine or a vital organized body the nation was assured that it could not but be formidable but thus to the standing excellence of mechanic or organic power seemed to be superadded at this time and for this service the force of inspiration could any thing therefore be looked for but a glorious result the army proved its prowess in the field and what has been the result is attested and long will be attested by the downcast looksthe silencethe passionate exclamationsthe sighs and shame of every man who is worthy to breathe the air or to look upon the greenfields of liberty in this blessed and highlyfavoured island which we inhabit  if i were speaking of things however weighty that were long past and dwindled in the memory i should scarcely venture to use this language but the feelings are of yesterdaythey are of today the flower a melancholy flower it is is still in blow nor will i trust its leaves be shed through months that are to come for i repeat that the heart of the nation is in this struggle this just and necessary war as we have been accustomed to hear it styled from the beginning of the contest in the year 1793 had some time before the treaty of amiens viz after the subjugation of switzerland and not till then begun to be regarded by the body of the people as indeed both just and necessary and this justice and necessity were by none more clearly perceived or more feelingly bewailed than by those who had most eagerly opposed the war in its commencement and who continued most bitterly to regret that this nation had ever borne a part in it their conduct was herein consistent they proved that they kept their eyes steadily fixed upon principles for though there was a shifting or transfer of hostility in their minds as far as regarded persons they only combated the same enemy opposed to them under a different shape and that enemy was the spirit of selfish tyranny and lawless ambition this spirit the class of persons of whom i have been speaking and i would now be understood as associating them with an immense majority of the people of great britain whose affections notwithstanding all the delusions which had been practised upon them were in the former part of the contest for a long time on the side of their nominal enemies this spirit when it became undeniably embodied in the french government they wished in spite of all dangers should be opposed by war because peace was not to be procured without submission which could not but be followed by a communion of which the word of greeting would be on the one part insultand on the other degradation the people now wished for war as their rulers had done before because open war between nations is a defined and effectual partition and the sword in the hands of the good and the virtuous is the most intelligible symbol of abhorrence it was in order to be preserved from spiritbreaking submissionsfrom the guilt of seeming to approve that which they had not the power to prevent and out of a consciousness of the danger that such guilt would otherwise actually steal upon them and that thus by evil communications and participations would be weakened and finally destroyed those moral sensibilities and energies by virtue of which alone their liberties and even their lives could be preservedthat the people of great britain determined to encounter all perils which could follow in the train of open resistancethere were some and those deservedly of high character in the country who exerted their utmost influence to counteract this resolution nor did they give to it so gentle a name as want of prudence but they boldly termed it blindness and obstinacy let them be judged with charity but there are promptings of wisdom from the penetralia of human nature which a people can hear though the wisest of their practical statesmen be deaf towards them this authentic voice the people of england had heard and obeyed and in opposition to french tyranny growing daily more insatiate and implacable they ranged themselves zealously under their government though they neither forgot nor forgave its transgressions in having first involved them in a war with a people then struggling for its own liberties under a twofold inflictionconfounded by inbred faction and beleagured by a cruel and imperious external foe but these remembrances did not vent themselves in reproaches nor hinder us from being reconciled to our rulers when a change or rather a revolution in circumstances had imposed new duties and in defiance of local and personal clamour it may be safely said that the nation united heart and hand with the government in its resolve to meet the worst rather than stoop its head to receive that which it was felt would not be the garland but the yoke of peace yet it was an afflicting alternative and it is not to be denied that the effort if it had the determination wanted the cheerfulness of duty our condition savoured too much of a grinding constrainttoo much of the vassalage of necessityit had too much of fear and therefore of selfishness not to be contemplated in the main with rueful emotion we desponded though we did not despair in fact a deliberate and preparatory fortitudea sedate and stern melancholy which had no sunshine and was exhilarated only by the lightnings of indignationthis was the highest and best state of moral feeling to which the most nobleminded among us could attain  but from the moment of the rising of the people of the pyrenëan peninsula there was a mighty change we were instantaneously animated and from that moment the contest assumed the dignity which it is not in the power of any thing but hope to bestow and if i may dare to transfer language prompted by a revelation of the state of being that admits not of decay or change to the concerns and interests of our transitory planet from that moment this corruptible put on incorruption and this mortal put on immortality this sudden elevation was on no account more welcomewas by nothing more endeared than by the returning sense which accompanied it of inward liberty and choice which gratified our moral yearnings inasmuch as it would give henceforward to our actions as a people an origination and direction unquestionably moralas it was freeas it was manifestly in sympathy with the speciesas it admitted therefore of fluctuations of generous feelingof approbation and of complacency we were intellectualized also in proportion we looked backward upon the records of the human race with pride and instead of being afraid we delighted to look forward into futurity it was imagined that this newborn spirit of resistance rising from the most sacred feelings of the human heart would diffuse itself through many countries and not merely for the distant future but for the present hopes were entertained as bold as they were disinterested and generous  never indeed was the fellowship of our sentient nature more intimately feltnever was the irresistible power of justice more gloriously displayed than when the british and spanish nations with an impulse like that of two ancient heroes throwing down their weapons and reconciled in the field cast off at once their aversions and enmities and mutually embraced each otherto solemnize this conversion of love not by the festivities of peace but by combating side by side through danger and under affliction in the devotedness of perfect brotherhood this was a conjunction which excited hope as fervent as it was rational on the one side was a nation which brought with it sanction and authority inasmuch as it had tried and approved the blessings for which the other had risen to contend the one was a people which by the help of the surrounding ocean and its own virtues had preserved to itself through ages its liberty pure and inviolated by a foreign invader the other a highminded nation which a tyrant presuming on its decrepitude had through the real decrepitude of its government perfidiously enslaved what could be more delightful than to think of an intercourse beginning in this manner on the part of the spaniards their love towards us was enthusiasm and adoration the faults of our national character were hidden from them by a veil of splendour they saw nothing around us but glory and light and on our side we estimated their character with partial and indulgent fondnessthinking on their past greatness not as the undermined foundation of a magnificent building but as the root of a majestic tree recovered from a long disease and beginning again to flourish with promise of wider branches and a deeper shade than it had boasted in the fulness of its strength if in the sensations with which the spaniards prostrated themselves before the religion of their country we did not keep pace with themif even their loyalty was such as from our mixed constitution of government and from other causes we could not thoroughly sympathize withand if lastly their devotion to the person of their sovereign appeared to us to have too much of the alloy of delusionin all these things we judged them gently and taught by the reverses of the french revolution we looked upon these dispositions as more humanmore socialand therefore as wiser and of better omen than if they had stood forth the zealots of abstract principles drawn out of the laboratory of unfeeling philosophists finally in this reverence for the past and present we found an earnest that they were prepared to contend to the death for as much liberty as their habits and their knowledge enabled them to receive to assist them and their neighbours the portugueze in the attainment of this end we sent to them in love and in friendship a powerful army to aidto invigorateand to chastisethey landed and the first proof they afforded of their being worthy to be sent on such a servicethe first pledge of amity given by them was the victory of vimiera the second pledge and this was from the hand of their generals was the convention of cintra  the reader will by this time have perceived what thoughts were uppermost in my mind when i began with asserting that this convention is among the most important events of our timesan assertion which was made deliberately and after due allowance for that infirmity which inclines us to magnify things present and passing at the expence of those which are past it is my aim to prove wherein the real importance of this event lies and as a necessary preparative for forming a right judgment upon it i have already given a representation of the sentiments with which the people of great britain and those of spain looked upon each other i have indeed spoken rather of the spaniards than of the portugueze but what has been said will be understood as applying in the main to the whole peninsula the wrongs of the two nations have been equal and their cause is the same they must stand or fall together what their wrongs have been in what degree they considered themselves united and what their hopes and resolutions were we have learned from public papers issued by themselves and by their enemies these were read by the people of this country at the time when they were severally published with due impression pity that those impressions could not have been as faithfully retained as they were at first received deeply doubtless there is not a man in these islands who is not convinced that the cause of spain is the most righteous cause in which since the opposition of the greek republics to the persian invader at thermopylae and marathon sword ever was drawn but this is not enough we are actors in the struggle and in order that we may have steady principles to controul and direct us without which we may do much harm and can do no good we ought to make it a duty to revive in the memory those words and facts which first carried the conviction to our hearts that as far as it is possible we may see as we then saw and feel as we then felt let me therefore entreat the reader seriously to peruse once more such parts of those declarations as i shall extract from them i feel indeed with sorrow that events are hurrying us forward as down the rapid of an american river and that there is too much danger before to permit the mind easily to turn back upon the course which is past it is indeed difficultbut i need not say that to yield to the difficulty would be degrading to rational beings besides if from the retrospect we can either gain strength by which we can overcome or learn prudence by which we may avoid such submission is not only degrading but pernicious i address these words to those who have feeling but whose judgment is overpowered by their feelingssuch as have not and who are mere slaves of curiosity calling perpetually for something new and being able to create nothing new for themselves out of old materials may be left to wander about under the yoke of their own unprofitable appetiteyet not so even these i would include in my request and conjure them as they are men not to be impatient while i place before their eyes a composition made out of fragments of those declarations from various parts of the peninsula which disposed as it were in a tesselated pavement shall set forth a story which may be easily understood which will move and teach and be consolatory to him who looks upon it i say consolatory and let not the reader shrink from the word i am well aware of the burthen which is to be supported of the discountenance from recent calamity under which every thing which speaks of hope for the spanish people and through them for mankind will be received but this far from deterring ought to be an encouragement it makes the duty more imperious nevertheless whatever confidence any individual of meditative mind may have in these representations of the principles and feelings of the people of spain both as to their sanctity and truth and as to their competence in ordinary circumstances to make these acknowledged it would be unjust to recall them to the public mind stricken as it is by present disaster without attempting to mitigate the bewildering terror which accompanies these events and which is caused as much by their nearness to the eye as by any thing in their own nature i shall however at present confine myself to suggest a few considerations some of which will be developed hereafter when i resume the subject  it appears then that the spanish armies have sustained great defeats and have been compelled to abandon their positions and that these reverses have been effected by an army greatly superior to the spanish forces in number and far excelling them in the art and practice of war this is the sum of those tidings which it was natural we should receive with sorrow but which too many have received with dismay and despair though surely no events could be more in the course of rational expectation and what is the amount of the evilit is manifest that though a great army may easily defeat or disperse another army less or greater yet it is not in a like degree formidable to a determined people nor efficient in a like degree to subdue them or to keep them in subjugationmuch less if this people like those of spain in the present instance be numerous and like them inhabit a territory extensive and strong by nature for a great army and even several great armies cannot accomplish this by marching about the country unbroken but each must split itself into many portions and the several detachments become weak accordingly not merely as they are small in size but because the soldiery acting thus necessarily relinquish much of that part of their superiority which lies in what may be called the enginery of war and far more because they lose in proportion as they are broken the power of profiting by the military skill of the commanders or by their own military habits the experienced soldier is thus brought down nearer to the plain ground of the inexperienced man to the level of man and it is then that the truly brave man rises the man of good hopes and purposes and superiority in moral brings with it superiority in physical power hence if the spanish armies have been defeated or even dispersed it not only argues a want of magnanimity but of sense to conclude that the cause therefore is lost supposing that the spirit of the people is not crushed the war is now brought back to that plan of conducting it which was recommended by the junta of seville in that inestimable paper entitled precautions which plan ought never to have been departed from except by compulsion or with a moral certainty of success and which the spaniards will now be constrained to readopt with the advantage that the lesson which has been received will preclude the possibility of their ever committing the same error in this paper it is said let the first object be to avoid all general actions and to convince ourselves of the very great hazards without any advantage or the hope of it to which they would expose us the paper then gives directions how the war ought to be conducted as a war of partizans and shews the peculiar fitness of the country for it yet though relying solely on this unambitious mode of warfare the framers of the paper which is in every part of it distinguished by wisdom speak with confident thoughts of success to this mode of warfare then after experience of calamity from not having trusted in it to this and to the people in whom the contest originated and who are its proper depository that contest is now referred  secondly if the spirits of the spaniards be not broken by defeat which is impossible if the sentiments that have been publicly expressed be fairly characteristic of the nation and do not belong only to particular spots or to a few individuals of superior minda doubt which the internal evidence of these publications sanctioned by the resistance already made and corroborated by the universal consent with which certain qualities have been attributed to the spaniards in all ages encourages us to repelthen are there mighty resources in the country which have not yet been called forth for all has hitherto been done by the spontaneous efforts of the people acting under little or no compulsion of the government but with its advice and exhortation it is an error to suppose that in proportion as a people are strong and act largely for themselves the government must therefore be weak this is not a necessary consequence even in the heat of revolution but only when the people are lawless from want of a steady and noble object among themselves for their love or in the presence of a foreign enemy for their hatred in the early part of the french revolution indeed as long as it was evident that the end was the common safety the national assembly had the power to turn the people into any course to constrain them to any task while their voluntary efforts as far as these could be exercised were not abated in consequence that which the national assembly did for france the spanish sovereigns authority acting through those whom the people themselves have deputed to represent him would in their present enthusiasm of loyalty and condition of their general feelings render practicable and easy for spain the spaniards it is true with a thoughtfulness most hopeful for the cause which they have undertaken have been loth to depart from established laws forms and practices this dignified feeling of selfrestraint they would do well to cherish so far as never to depart from it without some reluctancebut when old and familiar means are not equal to the exigency new ones must without timidity be resorted to though by many they may be found harsh and ungracious nothing but good would result from such conduct the welldisposed would rely more confidently upon a government which thus proved that it had confidence in itself men less zealous and of less comprehensive minds would soon be reconciled to measures from which at first they had revolted the remiss and selfish might be made servants of their country through the influence of the same passions which had prepared them to become slaves of the invader or should this not be possible they would appear in their true character and the main danger to be feared from them would be prevented the course which ought to be pursued is plain either the cause has lost the peoples love or it has not if it has let the struggle be abandoned if it has not let the government in whatever shape it may exist and however great may be the calamities under which it may labour act up to the full stretch of its rights nor doubt that the people will support it to the full extent of their power if therefore the chiefs of the spanish nation be men of wise and strong minds they will bring both the forces those of the government and of the people into their utmost action tempering them in such a manner that neither shall impair or obstruct the other but rather that they shall strengthen and direct each other for all salutary purposes  thirdly it was never dreamt by any thinking man that the spaniards were to succeed by their army if by their army be meant any thing but the people the whole people is their army and their true army is the people and nothing else five hundred men who in the early part of the struggle had been taken prisonersi think it was at the battle of rio secowere returned by the french general under the title of galician peasants a title which the spanish general blake rejected and maintained in his answer that they were genuine soldiers meaning regular troops the conduct of the frenchman was politic and that of the spaniard would have been more in the spirit of his cause and of his own noble character if waiving on this occasion the plea of any subordinate and formal commission which these men might have he had rested their claim to the title of soldiers on its true ground and affirmed that this was no other than the rights of the cause which they maintained by which rights every spaniard was a soldier who could appear in arms and was authorized to take that place in which it was probable to those under whom he acted and on many occasions to himself that he could most annoy the enemy but these patriots of galicia were not clothed alike nor perhaps armed alike nor had the outward appearance of those bodies which are called regular troops and the frenchman availed himself of this pretext to apply to them that insolent language which might i think have been more nobly repelled on a more comprehensive principle for thus are men of the gravest minds imposed upon by the presumptuous and through these influences it comes that the strength of a tyrant is in opinionnot merely in the opinion of those who support him but alas even of those who willingly resist and who would resist effectually if it were not that their own understandings betray them being already half enslaved by shews and forms the whole spanish nation ought to be encouraged to deem themselves an army embodied under the authority of their country and of human nature a military spirit should be there and a military action not confined like an ordinary river in one channel but spreading like the nile over the whole face of the land is this possible i believe it is if there be minds among them worthy to lead and if those leading minds cherish a civic spirit by all warrantable aids and appliances and above all other means by combining a reverential memory of their elder ancestors with distinct hopes of solid advantage from the privileges of freedom for themselves and their posterityto which the history and the past state of spain furnish such enviable facilities and if they provide for the sustenance of this spirit by organizing it in its primary sources not timidly jealous of a people whose toils and sacrifices have approved them worthy of all love and confidence and whose failing of excess if such there exist is assuredly on the side of loyalty to their sovereign and predilection for all established institutions we affirm then that a universal military spirit may be produced and not only this but that a much more rare and more admirable phenomenon may be realizedthe civic and military spirit united in one people and in enduring harmony with each other the people of spain with arms in their hands are already in an elevated mood to which they have been raised by the indignant passions and the keen sense of insupportable wrong and insult from the enemy and its infamous instruments but they must be taught not to trust too exclusively to the violent passions which have already done much of their peculiar task and service they must seek additional aid from affections which less imperiously exclude all individual interests while at the same time they consecrate them to the public goodbut the enemy is in the heart of their land we have not forgotten this we would encourage their military zeal and all qualities especially military by all rewards of honourable ambition and by rank and dignity conferred on the truly worthy whatever may be their birth or condition the elevating influence of which would extend from the individual possessor to the class from which he may have sprung for the necessity of thus raising and upholding the military spirit we plead but yet the professional excellencies of the soldier must be contemplated according to their due place and relation nothing is done or worse than nothing unless something higher be taught as higher something more fundamental as more fundamental in the moral virtues and qualities of passion which belong to a people must the ultimate salvation of a people be sought for moral qualities of a high order and vehement passions and virtuous as vehement the spaniards have already displayed nor is it to be anticipated that the conduct of their enemies will suffer the heat and glow to remit and languish these may be trusted to themselves and to the provocations of the merciless invader they must now be taught that their strength chiefly lies in moral qualities more silent in their operation more permanent in their nature in the virtues of perseverance constancy fortitude and watchfulness in a long memory and a quick feeling to rise upon a favourable summons a texture of life which though cut through as hath been feigned of the bodies of the angels unites againthese are the virtues and qualities on which the spanish people must be taught mainly to depend these it is not in the power of their chiefs to create but they may preserve and procure to them opportunities of unfolding themselves by guarding the nation against an intemperate reliance on other qualities and other modes of exertion to which it could never have resorted in the degree in which it appears to have resorted to them without having been in contradiction to itself paying at the same time an indirect homage to its enemy yet in hazarding this conditional censure we are still inclined to believe that in spite of our deductions on the score of exaggeration we have still given too easy credit to the accounts furnished by the enemy of the rashness with which the spaniards engaged in pitched battles and of their dismay after defeat for the spaniards have repeatedly proclaimed and they have inwardly felt that their strength was from their causeof course that it was moral why then should they abandon this and endeavour to prevail by means in which their opponents are confessedly so much superior moral strength is theirs but physical power for the purposes of immediate or rapid destruction is on the side of their enemies this is to them no disgrace but as soon as they understand themselves they will see that they are disgraced by mistrusting their appropriate stay and throwing themselves upon a power which for them must be weak nor will it then appear to them a sufficient excuse that they were seduced into this by the splendid qualities of courage and enthusiasm which being the frequent companions and in given circumstances the necessary agents of virtue are too often themselves hailed as virtues by their own title but courage and enthusiasm have equally characterized the best and the worst beings a satan equally with an abdiela bonaparte equally with a leonidas they are indeed indispensible to the spanish soldiery in order that man to man they may not be inferior to their enemies in the field of battle but inferior they are and long must be in warlike skill and coolness inferior in assembled numbers and in blind mobility to the preconceived purposes of their leader if therefore the spaniards are not superior in some superior quality their fall may be predicted with the certainty of a mathematical calculation nay it is right to acknowledge however depressing to false hope the thought may be that from a people prone and disposed to war as the french are through the very absence of those excellencies which give a contradistinguishing dignity to the spanish character that from an army of men presumptuous by nature to whose presumption the experience of constant success has given the confidence and stubborn strength of reason and who balance against the devotion of patriotism the superstition so naturally attached by the sensual and disordinate to the strange fortunes and continual felicity of their emperor that from the armies of such a people a more manageable enthusiasm a courage less under the influence of accidents may be expected in the confusion of immediate conflict than from forces like the spaniards united indeed by devotion to a common cause but not equally united by an equal confidence in each other resulting from long fellowship and brotherhood in all conceivable incidents of war and battle therefore i do not hesitate to affirm that even the occasional flight of the spanish levies from sudden panic under untried circumstances would not be so injurious to the spanish cause no nor so dishonourable to the spanish character nor so ominous of ultimate failure as a paramount reliance on superior valour instead of a principled reposal on superior constancy and immutable resolve rather let them have fled once and again than direct their prime admiration to the blaze and explosion of animal courage in slight of the vital and sustaining warmth of fortitude in slight of that moral contempt of death and privation which does not need the stir and shout of battle to call it forth or support it which can smile in patience over the stiff and cold wound as well as rush forward regardless because half senseless of the fresh and bleeding one why did we give our hearts to the present cause of spain with a fervour and elevation unknown to us in the commencement of the late austrian or prussian resistance to france because we attributed to the former an heroic temperament which would render their transfer to such domination an evil to human nature itself and an affrightening perplexity in the dispensations of providence but if in oblivion of the prophetic wisdom of their own first leaders in the cause they are surprised beyond the power of rallying utterly cast down and manacled by fearful thoughts from the first thunderstorm of defeat in the field wherein do they differ from the prussians and austrians wherein are they a people and not a mere army or set of armies if this be indeed so what have we to mourn over but our own honourable impetuosity in hoping where no just ground of hope existed a nation without the virtues necessary for the attainment of independence have failed to attain it this is all for little has that man understood the majesty of true national freedom who believes that a population like that of spain in a country like that of spain may want the qualities needful to fight out their independence and yet possess the excellencies which render men susceptible of true liberty the dutch the americans did possess the former but it is i fear more than doubtful whether the one ever did or the other ever will evince the nobler morality indispensible to the latter  it was not my intention that the subject should at present have been pursued so far but i have been carried forward by a strong wish to be of use in raising and steadying the minds of my countrymen an end to which every thing that i shall say hereafter provided it be true will contribute for all knowledge of human nature leads ultimately to repose and i shall write to little purpose if i do not assist some portion of my readers to form an estimate of the grounds of hope and fear in the present effort of liberty against oppression in the present or any future struggle which justice will have to maintain against might in fact this is my main object the seamark of my utmost sail in order that understanding the sources of strength and seats of weakness both in the tyrant and in those who would save or rescue themselves from his grasp we may act as becomes men who would guard their own liberties and would draw a good use from the desire which they feel and the efforts which they are making to benefit the less favoured part of the family of mankind with these as my ultimate objects i have undertaken to examine the convention of cintra and as an indispensible preparative for forming a right judgment of this event i have already faithfully exhibited the feelings of the people of great britain and of spain towards each other and have shewn by what sacred bonds they were united with the same view i shall next proceed to shew by what barrier of aversion scarcely less sacred the people of the peninsula were divided from their enemiestheir feelings towards them and their hopes for themselves trusting that i have already mitigated the deadening influences of recent calamity and that the representation i shall frame in the manner which has been promised will speak in its true colours and life to the eye and heart of the spectator  the government of asturias which was the first to rise against their oppressors thus expresses itself in the opening of its address to the people of that province loyal asturians beloved countrymen your wishes are already fulfilled the principality discharging those duties which are most sacred to men has already declared war against france you may perhaps dread this vigorous resolution but what other measure could or ought we to adopt shall there be found one single man among us who prefers the vile and ignominious death of slaves to the glory of dying on the field of honour with arms in his hand defending our unfortunate monarch our homes our children and our wives if in the very moment when those bands of banditti were receiving the kindest offices and favours from the inhabitants of our capital they murdered in cold blood upwards of two thousand people for no other reason than their having defended their insulted brethren what could we expect from them had we submitted to their dominion their perfidious conduct towards our king and his whole family whom they deceived and decoyed into france under the promise of an eternal armistice in order to chain them all has no precedent in history their conduct towards the whole nation is more iniquitous than we had the right to expect from a horde of hottentots they have profaned our temples they have insulted our religion they have assailed our wives in fine they have broken all their promises and there exists no right which they have not violated to arms asturians to arms the supreme junta of government sitting at seville introduces its declaration of war in words to the same effect france under the government of the emperor napoleon the first has violated towards spain the most sacred compactshas arrested her monarchsobliged them to a forced and manifestly void abdication and renunciation has behaved with the same violence towards the spanish nobles whom he keeps in his powerhas declared that he will elect a king of spain the most horrible attempt that is recorded in historyhas sent his troops into spain seized her fortresses and her capital and scattered his troops throughout the countryhas committed against spain all sorts of assassinations robberies and unheardof cruelties and this he has done with the most enormous ingratitude to the services which the spanish nation has rendered france to the friendship it has shewn her thus treating it with the most dreadful perfidy fraud and treachery such as was never committed against any nation or monarch by the most barbarous or ambitious king or people he has in fine declared that he will trample down our monarchy our fundamental laws and bring about the ruin of our holy catholic religionthe only remedy therefore to such grievous ills which are so manifest to all europe is in war which we declare against him the injuries done to the portugueze nation and government previous to its declaration of war against the emperor of the french are stated at length in the manifesto of the court of portugal dated rio janeiro may 1st 1808 and to that the reader may he referred but upon this subject i will beg leave to lay before him the following extract from the address of the supreme junta of seville to the portugueze nation dated may 30th 1808 portugueseyour lot is perhaps the hardest ever endured by any people on the earth your princes were compelled to fly from you and the events in spain have furnished an irrefragable proof of the absolute necessity of that measureyou were ordered not to defend yourselves and you did not defend yourselves junot offered to make you happy and your happiness has consisted in being treated with greater cruelty than the most ferocious conquerors inflict on the people whom they have subdued by force of arms and after the most obstinate resistance you have been despoiled of your princes your laws your usages your customs your property your liberty even your lives and your holy religion which your enemies never have respected however they may according to their custom have promised to protect it and however they may affect and pretend to have any sense of it themselves your nobility has been annihilatedits property confiscated in punishment of its fidelity and loyalty you have been basely dragged to foreign countries and compelled to prostrate yourselves at the feet of the man who is the author of all your calamities and who by the most horrible perfidy has usurped your government and rules you with a sceptre of iron even now your troops have left your borders and are travelling in chains to die in the defence of him who has oppressed you by which means his deep malignity may accomplish his purposeby destroying those who should constitute your strength and by rendering their lives subservient to his triumphs and to the savage glory to which he aspiresspain beheld your slavery and the horrible evils which followed it with mingled sensations of grief and despair you are her brother and she panted to fly to your assistance but certain chiefs and a government either weak or corrupt kept her in chains and were preparing the means by which the ruin of our king our laws our independence our liberty our lives and even the holy religion in which we are united might accompany yoursby which a barbarous people might consummate their own triumph and accomplish the slavery of every nation in europeour loyalty our honour our justice could not submit to such flagrant atrocity we have broken our chainslet us then to action but the story of portugueze sufferings shall be told by junot himself who in his proclamation to the people of portugal dated palace of lisbon june 26 thus speaks to them you have earnestly entreated of him a king who aided by the omnipotence of that great monarch might raise up again your unfortunate country and replace her in the rank which belongs to her doubtless at this moment your new monarch is on the point of visiting youhe expects to find faithful subjectsshall he find only rebels i expected to have delivered over to him a peaceable kingdom and flourishing citiesshall i be obliged to shew him only ruins and heaps of ashes and dead bodiesmerit pardon by prompt submission and a prompt obedience to my orders if not think of the punishment which awaits youevery city town or village which shall take up arms against my forces and whose inhabitants shall rise upon the french troops shall be delivered up to pillage and totally destroyed and the inhabitants shall be put to the swordevery individual taken in arms shall be instantly shot that these were not empty threats we learn from the bulletins published by authority of the same junot which at once shew his cruelty and that of the persons whom he employed and the noble resistance of the portugueze we entered beia says one of those dismal chronicles in the midst of great carnage the rebels left 1200 dead on the field of battle all those taken with arms in their hands were put to the sword and all the houses from which we had been fired upon were burned again in another the spirit of insanity which had led astray the inhabitants of beia and rendered necessary the terrible chastisement which they have received has likewise been exercised in the north of portugal describing another engagement it is said the lines endeavoured to make a stand but they were forced the massacre was terriblemore than a thousand dead bodies remained on the field of battle and general loison pursuing the remainder of these wretches entered guerda with fixed bayonets on approaching alpedrinha they found the rebels posted in a kind of redoubtit was forced the town of alpedrinha taken and delivered to the flames the whole of this tragedy is thus summed upin the engagements fought in these different marches we lost twenty men killed and 30 or 40 wounded the insurgents have left at least 13000 dead in the field the melancholy consequence of a frenzy which nothing can justify which forces us to multiply victims whom we lament and regret but whom a terrible necessity obliges us to sacrifice it is thus continues the writer that deluded men ungrateful children as well as culpable citizens exchange all their claims to the benevolence and protection of government for misfortune and wretchedness ruin their families carry into their habitations desolation conflagrations and death change flourishing cities into heaps of ashesinto vast tombs and bring on their whole country calamities which they deserve and from which feeble victims they cannot escape in fine it is thus that covering themselves with opprobrium and ridicule at the same time that they complete their destruction they have no other resource but the pity of those they have wished to assassinatea pity which they never have implored in vain when acknowledging their crime they have solicited pardon from frenchmen who incapable of departing from their noble character are ever as generous as they are braveby order of monseigneur le duc dabrantés commander in chiefcompare this with the address of massaredo to the biscayans in which there is the like avowal that the spaniards are to be treated as rebels he tells them that he is commanded by his master joseph bonaparte to assure themthat in case they disapprove of the insurrection in the city of bilboa his majesty will consign to oblivion the mistake and error of the insurgents and that he will punish only the heads and beginners of the insurrection with regard to whom the law must take its course  to be the victim of such bloodymindedness is a doleful lot for a nation and the anguish must have been rendered still more poignant by the scoffs and insults and by that heinous contempt of the most awful truths with which the perpetrator of those cruelties has proclaimed themmerciless ferocity is an evil familiar to our thoughts but these combinations of malevolence historians have not yet been called upon to record and writers of fiction if they have ever ventured to create passions resembling them have confined out of reverence for the acknowledged constitution of human nature those passions to reprobate spirits such tyranny is in the strictest sense intolerable not because it aims at the extinction of life but of every thing which gives life its valueof virtue of reason of repose in god or in truth with what heart may we suppose that a genuine spaniard would read the following impious address from the deputation as they were falsely called of his apostate countrymen at bayonne seduced or compelled to assemble under the eye of the tyrant and speaking as he dictated dear spaniards beloved countrymenyour habitations your cities your power and your property are as dear to us as ourselves and we wish to keep all of you in our eye that we may be able to establish your securitywe as well as yourselves are bound in allegiance to the old dynastyto her to whom an end has been put by that godlike providence which rules all thrones and sceptres we have seen the greatest states fall under the guidance of this rule and our land alone has hitherto escaped the same fate an unavoidable destiny has now overtaken our country and brought us under the protection of the invincible emperor of francewe know that you will regard our present situation with the utmost consideration and we have accordingly in this conviction been uniformly conciliating the friendship to which we are tied by so many obligations with what admiration must we see the benevolence and humanity of his imperial and royal majesty outstep our wishesqualities which are even more to be admired than his great power he has desired nothing else than that we should be indebted to him for our welfare whenever he gives us a sovereign to reign over us in the person of his magnanimous brother joseph he will consummate our prosperityas he has been pleased to change our old system of laws it becomes us to obey and to live in tranquillity as he has also promised to reorganize our financial system we may hope that then our naval and military power will become terrible to our enemies cthat the castilians were horrorstricken by the above blasphemies which are the habitual language of the french senate and ministers to their emperor is apparent from an address dated valladolidhe bonaparte carries his audacity the length of holding out to us offers of happiness and peace while he is laying waste our country pulling down our churches and slaughtering our brethren his pride cherished by a band of villains who are constantly anxious to offer incense on his shrine and tolerated by numberless victims who pine in his chains has caused him to conceive the fantastical idea of proclaiming himself lord and ruler of the whole world there is no atrocity which he does not commit to attain that end shall these outrages these iniquities remain unpunished while spaniardsand castilian spaniardsyet exist  many passages might be adduced to prove that carnage and devastation spread over their land have not afflicted this noble people so deeply as this more searching warfare against the conscience and the reason they groan less over the blood which has been shed than over the arrogant assumptions of beneficence made by him from whose order that blood has flowed still to be talking of bestowing and conferring and to be happy in the sight of nothing but what he thinks he has bestowed or conferred this in a man to whom the weakness of his fellows has given great power is a madness of pride more hideous than cruelty itself we have heard of attila and tamerlane who called themselves the scourges of god and rejoiced in personating the terrors of providence but such monsters do less outrage to the reason than he who arrogates to himself the gentle and gracious attributes of the deity for the one acts professedly from the temperance of reason the other avowedly in the gusts of passion through the terrors of the supreme ruler of things as set forth by works of destruction and ruin we see but darkly we may reverence the chastisement may fear it with awe but it is not natural to incline towards it in love moreover devastation passes awaya perishing power among things that perish whereas to found and to build to create and to institute to bless through blessing this has to do with objects where we trust we can see clearlyit reminds us of what we loveit aims at permanenceand the sorrow is as in the present instance the people of spain feel that it may last that if the giddy and intoxicated being who proclaims that he does these things with the eye and through the might of providence be not overthrown it will last that it needs must lastand therefore would they hate and abhor him and his pride even if he were not cruel if he were merely an image of mortal presumption thrust in between them and the piety which is natural to the heart of man between them and that religious worship which as authoritatively as his reason forbids idolatry that same reason commands accordingly labouring under these violations done to their moral nature they describe themselves in the anguish of their souls treated as a people at once dastardly and insensible in the same spirit they make it even matter of complaint as comparatively a far greater evil that they have not fallen by the brute violence of open war but by deceit and perfidy by a subtle undermining or contemptuous overthrow of those principles of good faith through prevalence of which in some degree or under some modification or other families communities a people or any frame of human society even destroying armies themselves can exist  but enough of their wrongs let us now see what were their consolations their resolves and their hopes first they neither murmur nor repine but with genuine religion and philosophy they recognize in these dreadful visitations the ways of a benign providence and find in them cause for thankfulness the council of castile exhort the people of madrid to cast off their lethargy and purify their manners and to acknowledge the calamities which the kingdom and that great capital had endured as a punishment necessary to their correction general morla in his address to the citizens of cadiz thus speaks to themthe commotion more or less violent which has taken place in the whole peninsula of spain has been of eminent service to rouse us from the state of lethargy in which we indulged and to make us acquainted with our rights our glory and the inviolable duty which we owe to our holy religion and our monarch we wanted some electric stroke to rouse us from our paralytic state of inactivity we stood in need of a hurricane to clear the atmosphere of the insalubrious vapours with which it was loadedthe unanimity with which the whole people were affected they rightly deem an indication of wisdom an authority and a sanctionand they refer it to its highest source the defence of our country and our king says a manifesto of the junta of seville that of our laws our religion and of all the rights of man trodden down and violated in a manner which is without example by the emperor of the french napoleon i and by his troops in spain compelled the whole nation to take up arms and choose itself a form of government and in the difficulties and dangers into which the french had plunged it all or nearly all the provinces as it were by the inspiration of heaven and in a manner little short of miraculous created supreme juntas delivered themselves up to their guidance and placed in their hands the rights and the ultimate fate of spain the effects have hitherto most happily corresponded with the designs of those who formed them  with this general confidence that the highest good may be brought out of the worst calamities they have combined a solace which is vouchsafed only to such nations as can recall to memory the illustrious deeds of their ancestors the names of pelayo and the cid are the watchwords of the address to the people of león and they are told that to these two deliverers of their country and to the sentiments of enthusiasm which they excited in every breast spain owes the glory and happiness which she has so long enjoyed the biscayans are called to cast their eyes upon the ages which are past and they will see their ancestors at one time repulsing the carthaginians at another destroying the hordes of rome at one period was granted to them the distinction of serving in the van of the army at another the privilege of citizens imitate says the address the glorious example of your worthy progenitors the asturians the gallicians and the city of cordova are exhorted in the same manner and surely to a people thus united in their minds with the heroism of years which have been long departed and living under such obligation of gratitude to their ancestors it is not difficult nay it is natural to take upon themselves the highest obligations of duty to their posterity to enjoy in the holiness of imagination the happiness of unborn ages to which they shall have eminently contributed and that each man fortified by these thoughts should welcome despair for himself because it is the assured mother of hope for his countrylife or death says a proclamation affixed in the most public places of seville is in this crisis indifferentye who shall return shall receive the reward of gratitude in the embraces of your country which shall proclaim you her deliverersye whom heaven destines to seal with your blood the independence of your nation the honour of your women and the purity of the religion which ye profess do not dread the anguish of the last moments remember in these moments that there are in our hearts inexhaustible tears of tenderness to shed over your graves and fervent prayers to which the almighty father of mercies will lend an ear to grant you a glory superior to that which they who survive you shall enjoy and in fact it ought never to be forgotten that the spaniards have not wilfully blinded themselves but have steadily fixed their eyes not only upon danger and upon death but upon a deplorable issue of the contest they have contemplated their subjugation as a thing possible the next extract from the paper entitled precautions and the same language is holden by many others will show in what manner alone they reconcile themselves to it therefore it is necessary to sacrifice our lives and property in defence of the king and of the country and though our lot which we hope will never come to pass should destine us to become slaves let us become so fighting and dying like gallant men not giving ourselves up basely to the yoke like sheep as the late infamous government would have done and fixing upon spain and her slavery eternal ignominy and disgrace  but let us now hear them as becomes men with such feelings express more cheering and bolder hopes rising from a confidence in the supremacy of justicehopes which however the tyrant from the iron fortresses of his policy may scoff at them and at those who entertained them will render their memory dear to all good men when his name will be pronounced with universal abhorrence  all europe says the junta of seville will applaud our efforts and hasten to our assistance italy germany and the whole north which suffer under the despotism of the french nation will eagerly avail themselves of the favourable opportunity held out to them by spain to shake off the yoke and recover their liberty their laws their monarchs and all they have been robbed of by that nation france herself will hasten to erase the stain of infamy which must cover the tools and instruments of deeds so treacherous and heinous she will not shed her blood in so vile a cause she has already suffered too much under the idle pretext of peace and happiness which never came and can never be attained but under the empire of reason peace religion and laws and in a state where the rights of other nations are respected and preserved to this may be added a hope the fulfilment of which belongs more to themselves and lies more within their own power namely a hope that they shall be able in their progress towards liberty to inflict condign punishment on their cruel and perfidious enemies the junta of seville in an address to the people of madrid express themselves thus people of madrid seville has learned with consternation and surprize your dreadful catastrophe of the second of may the weakness of a government which did nothing in our favourwhich ordered arms to be directed against you and your heroic sacrifices blessed be ye and your memory shall shine immortal in the annals of our nationshe has seen with horror that the author of all your misfortunes and of ours has published a proclamation in which he distorted every fact and pretended that you gave the first provocation while it was he who provoked you the government was weak enough to sanction and order that proclamation to be circulated and saw with perfect composure numbers of you put to death for a pretended violation of laws which did not exist the french were told in that proclamation that french blood profusely shed was crying out for vengeance and the spanish blood does not it cry out for vengeance that spanish blood shed by an army which hesitated not to attack a disarmed and defenceless people living under their laws and their king and against whom cruelties were committed which shake the human frame with horror we all spain exclaimthe spanish blood shed in madrid cries aloud for revenge comfort yourselves we are your brethren we will fight like you until we perish in defending our king and country assist us with your good wishes and your continual prayers offered up to the most high whom we adore and who cannot forsake us because he never forsakes a just cause again in the conclusion of their address to the people of portugal quoted before the universal cry of spain is we will die in defence of our country but we will take care that those infamous enemies shall die with us come then ye generous portugueze and unite with us you have among yourselves the objects of your vengeanceobey not the authors of your misfortunesattack themthey are but a handful of miserable panicstruck men humiliated and conquered already by the perfidy and cruelties which they have committed and which have covered them with disgrace in the eyes of europe and the world rise then in a body but avoid staining your honourable hands with crimes for your design is to resist them and to destroy themour united efforts will do for this perfidious nation and portugal spain nay all europe shall breathe or die free like mensuch are their hopes and again see upon this subject the paper entitled precautions a contrast this to the impious mockery of providence exhibited by the tyrant in some passages heretofore quoted care shall be taken to explain to the nation and to convince them that when free as we trust to be from this civil war to which the french have forced us and when placed in a state of tranquillity our lord and king ferdinand vii being restored to the throne of spain under him and by him the cortes will be assembled abuses reformed and such laws shall be enacted as the circumstances of the time and experience may dictate for the public good and happiness things which we spaniards know how to do which we have done as well as other nations without any necessity that the vile french should come to instruct us and according to their custom under the mask of friendship should deprive us of our liberty our laws c c  one extract more and i shall conclude it is from a proclamation dated oviedo july 17th yesspain with the energies of liberty has to contend with france debilitated by slavery if she remain firm and constant spain will triumph a whole people is more powerful than disciplined armies those who unite to maintain the independence of their country must triumph over tyranny spain will inevitably conquer in a cause the most just that has ever raised the deadly weapon of war for she fights not for the concerns of a day but for the security and happiness of ages not for an insulated privilege but for the rights of human nature not for temporal blessings but for eternal happiness not for the benefit of one nation but for all mankind and even for france herself  i will now beg of my reader to pause a moment and to review in his own mind the whole of what has been laid before him he has seen of what kind and how great have been the injuries endured by these two nations what they have suffered and what they have to fear he has seen that they have felt with that unanimity which nothing but the light of truth spread over the inmost concerns of human nature can create with that simultaneousness which has led philosophers upon like occasions to assert that the voice of the people is the voice of god he has seen that they have submitted as far as human nature could bear and that at last these millions of suffering people have risen almost like one man with one hope for whether they look to triumph or defeat to victory or death they are full of hopedespair comes not near themthey will die they sayeach individual knows the danger and strong in the magnitude of it grasps eagerly at the thought that he himself is to perish and more eagerly and with higher confidence does he lay to his heart the faith that the nation will survive and be victoriousor at the worst let the contest terminate how it may as to superiority of outward strength that the fortitude and the martyrdom the justice and the blessing are theirs and cannot be relinquished and not only are they moved by these exalted sentiments of universal morality and of direct and universal concern to mankind which have impelled them to resist evil and to endeavour to punish the evildoer but also they descend for even this great as in itself it is may be here considered as a descent to express a rational hope of reforming domestic abuses and of reconstructing out of the materials of their ancient institutions customs and laws a better frame of civil government the same in the great outlines of its architecture but exhibiting the knowledge and genius and the needs of the present race harmoniously blended with those of their forefathers woe then to the unworthy who intrude with their help to maintain this most sacred cause it calls aloud for the aid of intellect knowledge and love and rejects every other it is in vain to send forth armies if these do not inspire and direct them the stream is as pure as it is mighty fed by ten thousand springs in the bounty of untainted nature any augmentation from the kennels and sewers of guilt and baseness may clog but cannot strengthen itit is not from any thought that i am communicating new information that i have dwelt thus long upon this subject but to recall to the reader his own knowledge and to reinfuse into that knowledge a breath and life of appropriate feeling because the bare sense of wisdom is nothing without its powers and it is only in these feelings that the powers of wisdom exist if then we do not forget that the spanish and portugueze nations stand upon the loftiest ground of principle and passion and do not suffer on our part those sympathies to languish which a few months since were so strong and do not negligently or timidly descend from those heights of magnanimity to which as a nation we were raised when they first represented to us their wrongs and entreated our assistance and we devoted ourselves sincerely and earnestly to their service making with them a common cause under a common hope if we are true in all this to them and to ourselves we shall not be at a loss to conceive what actions are entitled to our commendation as being in the spirit of a friendship so nobly begun and tending assuredly to promote the common welfare and what are abject treacherous and pernicious and therefore to be condemned and abhorred is then i may now ask the convention of cintra an act of this latter kind have the generals who signed and ratified that agreement thereby proved themselves unworthy associates in such a cause and has the ministry by whose appointment these men were enabled to act in this manner and which sanctioned the convention by permitting them to carry it into execution thereby taken to itself a weight of guilt in which the nation must feel that it participates until the transaction shall be solemnly reprobated by the government and the remote and immediate authors of it brought to merited punishment an answer to each of these questions will be implied in the proof which will be given that the condemnation which the people did with one voice pronounce upon this convention when it first became known was just that the nature of the offence of those who signed it was such and established by evidence of such a kind making so imperious an exception to the ordinary course of action that there was no need to wait here for the decision of a court of judicature but that the people were compelled by a necessity involved in the very constitution of man as a moral being to pass sentence upon them and this i shall prove by trying this act of theirs by principles of justice which are of universal obligation and by a reference to those moral sentiments which rise out of that retrospect of things which has been given  i shall now proceed to facts the dispatches of sir arthur wellesley containing an account of his having defeated the enemy in two several engagements spread joy through the nation the latter action appeared to have been decisive and the result may be thus briefly reported in a never to be forgotten sentence of sir arthurs second letter in this action says he in which the whole of the french force in portugal was employed under the command of the duc dabrantes in person in which the enemy was certainly superior in cavalry and artillery and in which not more than half of the british army was actually engaged he sustained a signal defeat and has lost thirteen pieces of cannon c c in the official communication made to the public of these dispatches it was added that a general officer had arrived at the british headquarters to treat for terms this was joyful intelligence first an immediate effectual and honourable deliverance of portugal was confidently expected secondly the humiliation and captivity of a large french army and just punishment from the hands of the portugueze government of the most atrocious offenders in that army and among those who having held civil offices under it especially if portugueze had in contempt of all law civil and military notoriously abused the power which they had treasonably accepted thirdly in this presumed surrender of the army a diminution of the enemys military force was looked to which after the losses he had already sustained in spain would most sensibly weaken it and lastly and far above this there was an anticipation of a shock to his power where that power is strongest in the imaginations of men which are sure to fall under the bondage of longcontinued success the judicious part of the nation fixed their attention chiefly on these results and they had good cause to rejoice they also received with pleasure this additional proof which indeed with the unthinking many as after the victory of maida weighed too much of the superiority in courage and discipline of the british soldiery over the french and of the certainty of success whenever our army was led on by men of even respectable military talents against any equal or not too greatly disproportionate number of the enemy but the pleasure was damped in the minds of reflecting persons by several causes it occasioned regret and perplexity that they had not heard more of the portugueze they knew what that people had suffered and how they had risenremembered the language of the proclamation addressed to them dated august the 4th and signed charles cotton and arthur wellesley in which they the portugueze were told that the british army had been sent in consequence of ardent supplications from all parts of portugal that the glorious struggle in which they are engaged is for all that is dear to man that the noble struggle against the tyranny and usurpation of france will be jointly maintained by portugal spain and england why then it was asked do we not hear more of those who are at least coequals with us if not principals in this contest they appeared to have had little share in either engagement see appendix a and while the french were abundantly praised no word of commendation was found for them had they deserved to be thus neglected the body of the people by a general rising had proved their zeal and courage their animosity towards their enemies their hatred of them it was therefore apprehended from this silence respecting the portugueze that their chiefs might either be distracted by factions or blinded by selfish interests or that they mistrusted their allies situated as portugal then was it would argue gross ignorance of human nature to have expected that unanimity should prevail among all the several authorities or leading persons as to the means to be employed it was enough that they looked with one feeling to the end namely an honourable deliverance of their country and security for its independence in conjunction with the liberation and independence of spain it was therefore absolutely necessary to make allowance for some division in conduct from difference of opinion instead of acquiescing in the first feelings of disappointment our commanders ought to have used the best means to win the confidence of the portugueze chiefs and to induce them to regard the british as dispassionate arbiters they ought to have endeavoured to excite a genuine patriotic spirit where it appeared wanting and to assist in creating for it an organ by which it might act were these things done or if such evils existed among the portugueze was any remedy or alleviation attempted sir arthur wellesley has told us before the board of inquiry that he made applications to the portugueze general frere for assistance which were acceded to by general frere upon such conditions only as made sir arthur deem it more advisable to refuse than accept his cooperation and it is alleged that in his general expectations of assistance he was greatly disappointed we are not disposed to deny that such cause for complaint might exist but that it did and upon no provocation on our part requires confirmation by other testimony and surely the portugueze have a right to be heard in answer to this accusation before they are condemned for they have supplied no fact from their own hands which tends to prove that they were languid in the cause or that they had unreasonable jealousies of the british army or nation or dispositions towards them which were other than friendly now there is a fact furnished by sir arthur wellesley himself which may seem to render it in the highest degree probable that previously to any recorded or palpable act of disregard or disrespect to the situation and feelings of the portugueze the general tenour of his bearing towards them might have been such that they could not look favourably upon him that he was not a man framed to conciliate them to compose their differences or to awaken or strengthen their zeal i allude to the passage in his letter above quoted where having occasion to speak of the french general he has found no name by which to designate him but that of duc dabranteswords necessarily implying that bonaparte who had taken upon himself to confer upon general junot this portugueze title with portugueze domains to support it was lawful sovereign of that country and that consequently the portugueze nation were rebels and the british army and he himself at the head of it aiders and abettors of that rebellion it would be absurd to suppose that sir arthur wellesley at the time when he used these words was aware of the meaning really involved in them let them be deemed an oversight but the capability of such an oversight affords too strong suspicion of a deadness to the moral interests of the cause in which he was engaged and of such a want of sympathy with the just feelings of his injured ally as could exist only in a mind narrowed by exclusive and overweening attention to the military character led astray by vanity or hardened by general habits of contemptuousness these words duke of abrantes in person were indeed words of bad omen and thinking men trembled for the consequences they saw plainly that in the opinion of the exalted spaniardsof those assuredly who framed and of all who had felt that affecting proclamation addressed by the junta of seville to the portugueze people he must appear utterly unworthy of the station in which he had been placed he had been sent as a delivereras an assertor and avenger of the rights of human nature but these words would carry with them every where the conviction that portugal and spain yea all which was good in england or iniquitous in france or in frenchmen was forgotten and his head full only of himself miserably conceiting that he swelled the importance of his conquered antagonist by sounding titles and phrases come from what quarter they might and that in proportion as this was done he magnified himself and his achievements it was plain then that here was a man who having not any fellowfeeling with the people whom he had been commissioned to aid could not know where their strength lay and therefore could not turn it to account nor by his example call it forth or cherish it but that if his future conduct should be in the same spirit he must be a blighting wind wherever his influence was carried for he had neither felt the wrongs of his allies nor been induced by common worldly prudence to affect to feel them or at least to disguise his insensibility and therefore what could follow but in despite of victory and outward demonstrations of joy inward disgust and depression these reflections interrupted the satisfaction of many but more from fear of future consequences than for the immediate enterprize for here success seemed inevitable and a happy and glorious termination was confidently expected yet not without that intermixture of apprehension which was at once an acknowledgment of the general condition of humanity and a proof of the deep interest attached to the impending event  sir arthur wellesleys dispatches had appeared in the gazette on the 2d of september and on the 16th of the same month suspence was put an end to by the publication of sir hew dalrymples letter accompanied with the armistice and convention the night before by order of ministers an attempt had been made at rejoicing and the park and tower guns had been fired in sign of good newsheaven grant that the ears of that great city may be preserved from such another outrage as soon as the truth was known never was there such a burst of rage and indignationsuch an overwhelming of stupefaction and sorrow but i will not i cannot dwell upon itit is enough to say that sir hew dalrymple and sir arthur wellesley must he bold men if they can think of what must have been reported to them without awe and trembling the heart of their country was turned against them and they were execrated in bitterness  for they had changed all things into their contraries hope into despair triumph into defeat confidence into treachery which left no place to stand upon justice into the keenest injurywhom had they delivered but the tyrant in captivity whose hands had they bound but those of their allies who were able of themselves to have executed their own purposes whom had they punished but the innocent sufferer whom rewarded but the guiltiest of oppressors they had reversed every thingfavour and honour for their enemiesinsult for their friendsand robbery they had both protected the person of the robber and secured to him his booty and opprobrium for themselvesto those over whom they had been masters who had crouched to them by an open act of submission they had made themselves servants turning the british lion into a beast of burthen to carry a vanquished enemy with his load of iniquities when and whither it had pleased him  such issue would have been a heavy calamity at any time but now when we ought to have risen above ourselves and if possible to have been foremost in the strife of honour and magnanimity now when a newborn power had been arrayed against the tyrant the only one which ever offered a glimpse of hope to a sane mind the power of popular resistance rising out of universal reason and from the heart of human natureand by a peculiar providence disembarrassed from the imbecility the cowardice and the intrigues of a wornout governmentthat at this time we the most favoured nation upon earth should have acted as if it had been our aim to level to the ground by one blow this longwishedfor spirit whose birth we had so joyfully hailed and by which even our own glory our safety our existence were to be maintained this was verily a surpassing affliction to every man who had a feeling of life beyond his meanest concerns  as soon as men had recovered from the shock and could bear to look somewhat steadily at these documents it was found that the gross body of the transaction considered as a military transaction was this that the russian fleet of nine sail of the line which had been so long watched and could not have escaped was to be delivered up to us the ships to be detained till six months after the end of the war and the sailors sent home by us and to be by us protected in their voyage through the swedish fleet and to be at liberty to fight immediately against our ally the king of sweden secondly that a french army of more than twenty thousand men already beaten and no longer able to appear in the field cut off from all possibility of receiving reinforcements or supplies and in the midst of a hostile country loathing and abhorring it was to be transported with its arms ammunition and plunder at the expence of great britain in british vessels and landed within a few days march of the spanish frontierthere to be at liberty to commence hostilities immediately  omitting every characteristic which distinguishes the present contest from others and looking at this issue merely as an affair between two armies what stupidity of mind to provoke the accusation of not merely shrinking from future toils and dangers but of basely shifting the burthen to the shoulders of an ally already overpressedwhat infatuation to convey the imprisoned foe to the very spot whither if he had had wings he would have flown this last was an absurdity as glaring as if the french having landed on our own island we had taken them from yorkshire to be set on shore in sussex but ten thousand times worse from a place where without our interference they had been virtually blockaded where they were cut off hopeless useless and disgraced to become an efficient part of a mighty host carrying the strength of their numbers and alas the strength of their glory not to mention the sight of their plunder to animate that host while the british army more numerous in the proportion of three to two with all the population and resources of the peninsula to aid it within ten days sail of its own country and the sea covered with friendly shipping at its back was to make a long march to encounter this same enemy the british forfeiting instead of gaining by the treaty as to superiority of numbers for that this would be the case was clearly foreseen to encounter in a new condition of strength and pride those whom by its deliberate act it had exaltedhaving taken from itself meanwhile all which it had conferred and bearing into the presence of its noble ally an infection of despondency and disgrace the motive assigned for all this was the great importance of gaining time fear of an open beach and of equinoctial gales for the shipping fear that reinforcements could not be landed fear of faminefear of every thing but dishonour see appendix b  the nation had expected that the french would surrender immediately at discretion and supposing that sir arthur wellesley had told them the whole truth they had a right to form this expectation it has since appeared from the evidence given before the board of inquiry that sir arthur wellesley earnestly exhorted his successor in command sir harry burrard to pursue the defeated enemy at the battle of vimiera and that if this had been done the affair in sir arthur wellesleys opinion would have had a much more satisfactory termination but waiving any considerations of this advice or of the fault which might be committed in not following it and taking up the matter from the time when sir hew dalrymple entered upon the command and when the two adverse armies were in that condition relatively to each other that none of the generals has pleaded any difference of opinion as to their ability to advance against the enemy i will ask what confirmation has appeared before the board of inquiry of the reasonableness of the causes assigned by sir hew dalrymple in his letter for deeming a convention adviseable a want of cavalry for which they who occasioned it are heavily censurable has indeed been proved and certain failures of duty in the commissariat department with respect to horses c but these deficiencies though furnishing reasons against advancing upon the enemy in the open field had ceased to be of moment when the business was to expel him from the forts to which he might have the power of retreating it is proved that though there are difficulties in landing upon that coast and what military or marine operation can be carried on without difficulty there was not the slightest reason to apprehend that the army which was then abundantly supplied would suffer hereafter from want of provisions proved also that heavy ordnance for the purpose of attacking the forts was ready on shipboard to be landed when and where it might be needed therefore so far from being exculpated by the facts which have been laid before the board of inquiry sir hew dalrymple and the other generals who deemed any convention necessary or expedient upon the grounds stated in his letter are more deeply criminated but grant for the sake of looking at a different part of the subject grant a case infinitely stronger than sir hew dalrymple has even hinted atwhy was not the taste of some of those evils in apprehension so terrible actually tried it would not have been the first time that britons had faced hunger and tempests had endured the worst of such enmity and upon a call under an obligation how faint and feeble compared with that which the brave men of that army must have felt upon the present occasion in the proclamation quoted before addressed to the portugueze and signed charles cotton and arthur wellesley they were told that the objects for which they contended could only be attained by distinguished examples of fortitude and constancy where were the fortitude and constancy of the teachers when sir hew dalrymple had been so busy in taking the measure of his own weakness and feeding his own fears how came it to escape him that general junot must also have had his weaknesses and his fears was it nothing to have been defeated in the open field where he himself had been the assailant was it nothing that so proud a man the servant of so proud a man had stooped to send a general officer to treat concerning the evacuation of the country was the hatred and abhorrence of the portugueze and spanish nations nothing the people of a large metropolis under his eyedetesting him and stung almost to madness nothing the composition of his own army made up of men of different nations and languages and forced into the servicewas there no cause of mistrust in this and finally among the many unsound places which had his mind been as active in this sort of inquiry as sir hew dalrymples was he must have found in his constitution could a bad cause have been misseda worse cause than ever confounded the mind of a soldier when boldly pressed upon or gave courage and animation to a righteous assailant but alas in sir hew dalrymple and his brethren we had generals who had a power of sight only for the strength of their enemies and their own weakness  let me not be misunderstood while i am thus forced to repeat things which were uttered or thought of these men in reference to their military conduct as heads of that army it is needless to add that their personal courage is in no wise implicated in the charge brought against them but in the name of my countrymen i do repeat these accusations and tax them with an utter want of intellectual courageof that higher quality which is never found without one or other of the three accompaniments talents genius or principletalents matured by experience without which it cannot exist at all or the rapid insight of peculiar genius by which the fitness of an act may be instantly determined and which will supply higher motives than mere talents can furnish for encountering difficulty and danger and will suggest better resources for diminishing or overcoming them thus through the power of genius this quality of intellectual courage may exist in an eminent degree though the moral character be greatly perverted as in those personages who are so conspicuous in history conquerors and usurpers the alexanders the caesars and cromwells and in that other class still more perverted remorseless and energetic minds the catilines and borgias whom poets have denominated bold bad men but though a course of depravity will neither preclude nor destroy this quality nay in certain circumstances will give it a peculiar promptness and hardihood of decision it is not on this account the less true that to consummate this species of courage and to render it equal to all occasions especially when a man is not acting for himself but has an additional claim on his resolution from the circumstance of responsibility to a superior principle is indispensibly requisite i mean that fixed and habitual principle which implies the absence of all selfish anticipations whether of hope or fear and the inward disavowal of any tribunal higher and more dreaded than the minds own judgment upon its own act the existence of such principle cannot but elevate the most commanding genius add rapidity to the quickest glance a wider range to the most ample comprehension but without this principle the man of ordinary powers must in the trying hour be found utterly wanting neither without it can the man of excelling powers be trustworthy or have at all times a calm and confident repose in himself but he in whom talents genius and principle are united will have a firm mind in whatever embarrassment he may be placed will look steadily at the most undefined shapes of difficulty and danger of possible mistake or mischance nor will they appear to him more formidable than they really are for his attention is not distractedhe has but one business and that is with the object before him neither in general conduct nor in particular emergencies are his plans subservient to considerations of rewards estate or title these are not to have precedence in his thoughts to govern his actions but to follow in the train of his duty such men in ancient times were phocion epaminondas and philopoemen and such a man was sir philip sidney of whom it has been said that he first taught this country the majesty of honest dealing with these may be named the honour of our own age washington the deliverer of the american continent with these though in many things unlike lord nelson whom we have lately lost lord peterborough who fought in spain a hundred years ago had the same excellence with a sense of exalted honour and a tinge of romantic enthusiasm well suited to the country which was the scene of his exploits would that we had a man like peterborough or nelson at the head of our army in spain at this moment i utter this wish with more earnestness because it is rumoured that some of those who have already called forth such severe reprehension from their countrymen are to resume a command which must entrust to them a portion of those sacred hopes in which not only we and the people of spain and portugal but the whole human race are so deeply interested see appendix c  i maintain then that merely from want of this intellectual courage of courage as generals or chiefs for i will not speak at present of the want of other qualities equally needful upon this service grievous errors were committed by sir hew dalrymple and his colleagues in estimating the relative state of the two armies a precious moment it is most probable had been lost after the battle of vimiera yet still the inferiority of the enemy had been proved they themselves had admitted itnot merely by withdrawing from the field but by proposing termsmonstrous terms and how ought they to have been received repelled undoubtedly with scorn as an insult if our generals had been men capable of taking the measure of their real strength either as existing in their own army or in those principles of liberty and justice which they were commissioned to defend they must of necessity have acted in this mannerif they had been men of common sagacity for business they must have acted in this mannernay if they had been upon a level with an ordinary bargainmaker in a fair or a market they could not have acted otherwisestrange that they should so far forget the nature of their calling they were soldiers and their business was to fight sir arthur wellesley had fought and gallantly it was not becoming his high situation or that of his successors to treat that is to beat down to chaffer or on their part to propose it does not become any general at the head of a victorious army so to do19  19 those rare cases are of course excepted in which the superiority on the one side is not only fairly to be presumed but positiveand so prominently obtrusive that to propose terms is to inflict terms  they were to acceptand if the terms offered were flagrantly presumptuous our commanders ought to have rejected them with dignified scorn and to have referred the proposer to the sword for a lesson of decorum and humility this is the general rule of all highminded men upon such occasions and meaner minds copy them doing in prudence what they do from principle but it has been urged before the board of inquiry that the conduct of the french armies upon like occasions and their known character rendered it probable that a determined resistance would in the present instance be maintained we need not fear to say that this conclusion from reasons which have been adverted to was erroneous but in the mind of him who had admitted it upon whatever ground whether false or true surely the first thought which followed ought to have been not that we should bend to the enemy but that if they were resolute in defence we should learn from that example to be courageous in attack the tender feelings however are pleaded against this determination and it is said that one of the motives for the cessation of hostilities was to prevent the further effusion of human bloodwhen or how the enemy was delivered over to us it was not to be hoped that cut off from all assistance as they were these or an equal number of men could ever be reduced to such straits as would ensure their destruction as an enemy with so small a sacrifice of life on their part or on ours what then was to be gained by this tenderness the shedding of a few drops of blood is not to be risked in portugal today and streams of blood must shortly flow from the same veins in the fields of spain and even if this had not been the assured consequence let not the consideration though it be one which no humane man can ever lose sight of have more than its due weight for national independence and liberty and that honour by which these and other blessings are to be preserved honourwhich is no other than the most elevated and pure conception of justice which can be formed these are more precious than life else why have we already lost so many brave men in this strugglewhy not submit at once and let the tyrant mount upon his throne of universal dominion while the world lies prostrate at his feet in indifference and apathy which he will proclaim to it is peace and happiness but peace and happiness can exist only by knowledge and virtue slavery has no enduring connection with tranquillity or securityshe cannot frame a league with any thing which is desirableshe has no charter even for her own ignoble ease and darling sloth yet to this abject condition mankind betrayed by an illjudging tenderness would surely be led and in the face of an inevitable contradiction for neither in this state of things would the shedding of blood be prevented nor would warfare cease the only difference would be that instead of wars like those which prevail at this moment presenting a spectacle of such character that upon one side at least a superior being might look down with favour and blessing there would follow endless commotions and quarrels without the presence of justice any wherein which the alternations of success would not excite a wish or regret in which a prayer could not be uttered for a decision either this way or thatwars from no impulse in either of the combatants but rival instigations of demoniacal passion if therefore by the faculty of reason we can prophecy concerning the shapes which the future may put onif we are under any bond of duty to succeeding generations there is high cause to guard against a specious sensibility which may encourage the hoarding up of life for its own sake seducing us from those considerations by which we might learn when it ought to be resigned moreover disregarding future ages and confining ourselves to the present state of mankind it may be safely affirmed that he who is the most watchful of the honour of his country most determined to preserve her fair name at all hazards will be found in any view of things which looks beyond the passing hour the best steward of the lives of his countrymen for by proving that she is of a firm temper that she will only submit or yield to a point of her own fixing and that all beyond is immutable resolution he will save her from being wantonly attacked and if attacked will awe the aggressor into a speedier abandonment of an unjust and hopeless attempt thus will he preserve not only that which gives life its value but life itself and not for his own country merely but for that of his enemies to whom he will have offered an example of magnanimity which will ensure to them like benefits an example the reaction of which will be felt by his own countrymen and will prevent them from becoming assailants unjustly or rashly nations will thus be taught to respect each other and mutually to abstain from injuries and hence by a benign ordinance of our nature genuine honour is the handmaid of humanity the attendant and sustainerboth of the sterner qualities which constitute the appropriate excellence of the male character and of the gentle and tender virtues which belong more especially to motherliness and womanhood these general laws by which mankind is purified and exalted and by which nations are preserved suggest likewise the best rules for the preservation of individual armies and for the accomplishment of all equitable service upon which they can be sent  not therefore rashly and unfeelingly but from the dictates of thoughtful humanity did i say that it was the business of our generals to fight and to persevere in fighting and that they did not bear this duty sufficiently in mind this almost the sole duty which professional soldiers till our time happily for mankind used to think of but the victories of the french have been attended every where by the subversion of governments and their generals have accordingly united political with military functions and with what success this has been done by them the present state of europe affords melancholy proof but have they on this account ever neglected to calculate upon the advantages which might fairly be anticipated from future warfare or in a treaty of today have they ever forgotten a victory of yesterday eager to grasp at the double honour of captain and negociator have they ever sacrificed the one to the other or in the blind effort lost both above all in their readiness to flourish with the pen have they ever overlooked the sword the symbol of their power and the appropriate instrument of their success and glory i notice this assumption of a double character on the part of the french not to lament over it and its consequences but to render somewhat more intelligible the conduct of our own generals and to explain how far men whom we have no reason to believe other than brave have through the influence of such example lost sight of their primary duties apeing instead of imitating and following only to be misled  it is indeed deplorable that our generals from this infirmity or from any other cause did not assume that lofty deportment which the character and relative strength of the two armies authorized them and the nature of the service upon which they were sent enjoined them to assumethat they were in such haste to treatthat with such an enemy let me say at once and in such circumstances they should have treated at all is it possible that they could ever have asked themselves who that enemy was how he came into that country and what he had done there from the manifesto of the portugueze government issued at rio janeiro and from other official papers they might have learned what was notorious to all europe that this body of men commissioned by bonaparte in the time of profound peace without a declaration of war had invaded portugal under the command of junot who had perfidiously entered the country as the general of a friendly and allied power assuring the people as he advanced that he came to protect their sovereign against an invasion of the english and that when in this manner he had entered a peaceable kingdom which offered no resistance and had expelled its lawful sovereign he wrung from it unheardof contributions ravaged it cursed it with domestic pillage and open sacrilege and that when this unoffending people unable to endure any longer rose up against the tyrant he had given their towns and villages to the flames and put the whole country thus resisting under military executionsetting aside all natural sympathy with the portugueze and spanish nations and all prudential considerations of regard or respect for their feelings towards these men and for their expectations concerning the manner in which they ought to be dealt with it is plain that the french had forfeited by their crimes all right to those privileges or to those modes of intercourse which one army may demand from another according to the laws of war they were not soldiers in any thing but the power of soldiers and the outward frame of an army during their occupation of portugal the laws and customs of war had never been referred to by them but as a plea for some enormity to the aggravated oppression of that unhappy country pillage sacrilege and murdersweeping murder and individual assassination had been proved against them by voices from every quarter they had outlawed themselves by their offences from membership in the community of war and from every species of community acknowledged by reason but even should any one be so insensible as to question this he will not at all events deny that the french ought to have been dealt with as having put on a double character for surely they never considered themselves merely as an army they had dissolved the established authorities of portugal and had usurped the civil power of the government and it was in this compound capacity under this twofold monstrous shape that they had exercised over the religion and property of the country the most grievous oppressions what then remained to protect them but their powerright they had noneand power it is a mortifying consideration but i will ask if bonaparte nor do i mean in the question to imply any thing to his honour had been in the place of sir hew dalrymple what would he have thought of their poweryet before this shadow the solid substance of justice melted away  and this leads me from the contemplation of their errors in the estimate and application of means to the contemplation of their heavier errors and worse blindness in regard to ends the british generals acted as if they had no purpose but that the enemy should be removed from the country in which they were upon any terms now the evacuation of portugal was not the prime object but the manner in which that event was to be brought about this ought to have been deemed first both in order and importancethe french were to be subdued their ferocious warfare and heinous policy to be confounded and in this way and no other was the deliverance of that country to be accomplished it was not for the soil or for the cities and forts that portugal was valued but for the human feeling which was there for the rights of human nature which might be there conspicuously asserted for a triumph over injustice and oppression there to be achieved which could neither be concealed nor disguised and which should penetrate the darkest corner of the dark continent of europe by its splendour we combated for victory in the empire of reason for strongholds in the imagination lisbon and portugal as city and soil were chiefly prized by us as a language but our generals mistook the counters of the game for the stake played for the nation required that the french should surrender at discretiongrant that the victory of vimiera had excited some unreasonable impatiencewe were not so overweening as to demand that the enemy should surrender within a given time but that they should surrender every thing short of this was felt to be below the duties of the occasion not only no service but a grievous injury only as far as there was a prospect of forcing the enemy to an unconditional submission did the british nation deem that they had a right to interfereif that prospect failed they expected that their army would know that it became it to retire and take care of itself but our generals have told us that the convention would not have been admitted if they had not judged it right to effect even upon these terms the evacuation of portugalas ministerial to their future services in spain if this had been a common war between two established governments measuring with each other their regular resources there might have been some appearance of force in this plea but who does not cry out at once that the affections and opinions that is the souls of the people of spain and portugal must be the inspiration and the power if this labour is to be brought to a happy end therefore it was worse than folly to think of supporting spain by physical strength at the expence of moral besides she was strong in men she never earnestly solicited troops from us some of the provinces had even refused them when offeredand all had been lukewarm in the acceptance of them the spaniards could not ultimately be benefited but by allies acting under the same impulses of honour roused by a sense of their wrongs and sharing their loves and hatredsabove all their passion for justice they had themselves given an example at baylen proclaiming to all the world what ought to be aimed at by those who would uphold their cause and be associated in arms with them and was the law of justice which spaniards spanish peasantry i might almost say would not relax in favour of dupont to be relaxed by a british army in favour of junot had the french commander at lisbon or his army proved themselves less perfidious less cruel or less rapacious than the other nay did not the pride and crimes of junot call for humiliation and punishment far more importunately inasmuch as his power to do harm and therefore his will keeping pace with it had been greater yet in the noble letter of the governor of cadiz to dupont he expressly tells him that his conduct and that of his army had been such that they owed their lives only to that honour which forbad the spanish army to become executioners the portugueze also as appears from various letters produced before the board of inquiry have shewn to our generals as boldly as their respect for the british nation would permit them to do what they expected a portugueze general who was also a member of the regency appointed by the prince regent says in a protest addressed to sir hew dalrymple that he had been able to drive the french out of the provinces of algarve and alentejo and therefore he could not be convinced that such a convention was necessary what was this but implying that it was dishonourable and that it would frustrate the efforts which his country was making and destroy the hopes which it had built upon its own power another letter from a magistrate inveighs against the convention as leaving the crimes of the french in portugal unpunished as giving no indemnification for all the murders robberies and atrocities which had been committed by them but i feel that i shall be wanting in respect to my countrymen if i pursue this argument further i blush that it should be necessary to speak upon the subject at all and these are men and things which we have been reproved for condemning because evidence was wanting both as to fact and person if there ever was a case which could not in any rational sense of the word be prejudged this is one as to the factit appears and sheds from its own body like the sun in heaven the light by which it is seen as to the personeach has written down with his own hand i am the man condemnation of actions and men like these is not in the minds of a people thanks to the divine being and to human nature a matter of choice it is like a physical necessity as the hand must be burned which is thrust into the furnacethe body chilled which stands naked in the freezing northwind i am entitled to make this assertion here when the moral depravity of the convention of which i shall have to speak hereafter has not even been touched upon nor let it be blamed in any man though his station be in private life that upon this occasion he speaks publicly and gives a decisive opinion concerning that part of this public event and those measures which are more especially military all have a right to speak and to make their voices heard as far as they have power for these are times in which the conduct of military men concerns us perhaps more intimately than that of any other class when the business of arms comes unhappily too near to the fireside when the character and duties of a soldier ought to be understood by every one who values his liberty and bears in mind how soon he may have to fight for it men will and ought to speak upon things in which they are so deeply interested how else are right notions to spread or is error to be destroyed these are times also in which if we may judge from the proceedings and result of the court of inquiry the heads of the army more than at any other period stand in need of being taught wisdom by the voice of the people it is their own interest both as men and as soldiers that the people should speak fervently and fearlessly of their actionsfrom no other quarter can they be so powerfully reminded of the duties which they owe to themselves to their country and to human nature let any one read the evidence given before that court and he will there see how much the intellectual and moral constitution of many of our military officers has suffered by a profession which if not counteracted by admonitions willingly listened to and by habits of meditation does more than any other denaturalizeand therefore degrade the human beinghe will note with sorrow how faint are their sympathies with the best feelings and how dim their apprehension of some of the most awful truths relating to the happiness and dignity of man in society but on this i do not mean to insist at present it is too weighty a subject to be treated incidentally and my purpose isnot to invalidate the authority of military men positively considered upon a military question but comparativelyto maintain that there are military transactions upon which the people have a right to be heard and upon which their authority is entitled to far more respect than any man or number of men can lay claim to who speak merely with the ordinary professional views of soldiershipthat there are such military transactionsand that this is one of them  the condemnation which the people of these islands pronounced upon the convention of cintra considered as to its main military results that is as a treaty by which it was established that the russian fleet should be surrendered on the terms specified and by which not only the obligation of forcing the french army to an unconditional surrender was abandoned but its restoration in freedom and triumph to its own country was securedthe condemnation pronounced by the people upon a treaty by virtue of which these things were to be done i have recordedaccounted forand thereby justifiedi will now proceed to another division of the subject on which i feel a still more earnest wish to speak because though in itself of the highest importance it has been comparatively neglectedmean the political injustice and moral depravity which are stamped upon the front of this agreement and pervade every regulation which it contains i shall shew that our generals and with them our ministers as far as they might have either given directions to this effect or have countenanced what has been donewhen it was their paramount duty to maintain at all hazards the noblest principles in unsuspected integrity because upon the summons of these and in defence of them their allies had risen and by these alone could standnot only did not perform this duty but descended as far below the level of ordinary principles as they ought to have mounted above itimitating not the majesty of the oak with which it lifts its branches towards the heavens but the vigour with which in the language of the poet it strikes its roots downwards towards hell      radice in tartara tendit  the armistice is the basis of the convention and in the first article we find it agreed that there shall be a suspension of hostilities between the forces of his britannic majesty and those of his imperial and royal majesty napoleon i i will ask if it be the practice of military officers in instruments of this kind to acknowledge in the person of the head of the government with which they are at war titles which their own governmentfor which they are actinghas not acknowledged if this be the practice which i will not stop to determine it is grossly improper and ought to be abolished our generals however had entered portugal as allies of a government by which this title had been acknowledged and they might have pleaded this circumstance in mitigation of their offence but surely not in an instrument where we not only look in vain for the name of the portugueze sovereign or of the government which he appointed or of any heads or representatives of the portugueze armies or people as a party in the contractbut where it is stipulated in the 4th article that the british general shall engage to include the portugueze armies in this convention what an outragewe enter the portugueze territory as allies and without their consentor even consulting them we proceed to form the basis of an agreement relating not to the safety or interests of our own armybut to portugueze territory portugueze persons liberties and rightsand engage out of our own will and power to include the portugueze army they or their government willing or not within the obligation of this agreement i place these things in contrast viz the acknowledgement of bonaparte as emperor and king and the utter neglect of the portugueze sovereign and portugueze authorities to shew in what spirit and temper these agreements were entered upon i will not here insist upon what was our duty on this occasion to the portuguezeas dictated by those sublime precepts of justice which it has been proved that they and the spaniards had risen to defendand without feeling the force and sanctity of which they neither could have risen nor can oppose to their enemy resistance which has any hope in it but i will ask of any man who is not dead to the common feelings of his social natureand besotted in understanding if this be not a cruel mockery and which must have been felt unless it were repelled with hatred and scorn as a heartbreaking insult moreover this conduct acknowledges by implication that principle which by his actions the enemy has for a long time covertly maintained and now openly and insolently avows in his wordsthat power is the measure of rightand it is in a steady adherence to this abominable doctrine that his strength mainly lies i do maintain then that as far as the conduct of our generals in framing these instruments tends to reconcile men to this course of action and to sanction this principle they are virtually his allies their weapons may be against him but he will laugh at their weaponsfor he knows though they themselves do not that their souls are for him look at the preamble to the armistice in what is omitted and what is inserted the french ruler could not have fashioned it more for his own purpose if he had traced it with his own hand we have then trampled upon a fundamental principle of justice and countenanced a prime maxim of iniquity thus adding in an unexampled degree the foolishness of impolicy to the heinousness of guilt a conduct thus grossly unjust and impolitic without having the hatred which it inspires neutralised by the contempt is made contemptible by utterly wanting that colour of right which authority and power put forth in defence of our alliesin asserting their just claims and avenging their injuries might have given but we instead of triumphantly displaying our power towards our enemies have ostentatiously exercised it upon our friends reversing here as every where the practice of sense and reasonconciliatory even to abject submission where we ought to have been haughty and commandingand repulsive and tyrannical where we ought to have been gracious and kind even a common law of good breeding would have served us here had we known how to apply it we ought to have endeavoured to raise the portugueze in their own estimation by concealing our power in comparison with theirs dealing with them in the spirit of those mild and humane delusions which spread such a genial grace over the intercourse and add so much to the influence of love in the concerns of private life it is a common saying presume that a man is dishonest and that is the readiest way to make him so in like manner it may be said presume that a nation is weak and that is the surest course to bring it to weaknessif it be not rouzed to prove its strength by applying it to the humiliation of your pride the portugueze had been weak and in connection with their allies the spaniards they were prepared to become strong it was therefore doubly incumbent upon us to foster and encourage themto look favourably upon their effortsgenerously to give them credit upon their promisesto hope with them and for them and thus anticipating and foreseeing we should by a natural operation of love have contributed to create the merits which were anticipated and foreseen i apply these rules taken from the intercourse between individuals to the conduct of large bodies of men or of nations towards each other because these are nothing but aggregates of individuals and because the maxims of all just law and the measures of all sane practice are only an enlarged or modified application of those dispositions of love and those principles of reason by which the welfare of individuals in their connection with each other is promoted there was also here a still more urgent call for these courteous and humane principles as guides of conduct because in exact proportion to the physical weakness of governments and to the distraction and confusion which cannot but prevail when a people is struggling for independence and liberty are the wellintentioned and the wise among them remitted for their support to those benign elementary feelings of society for the preservation and cherishing of which among other important objects government was from the beginning ordained  therefore by the strongest obligations we were bound to be studious of a delicate and respectful bearing towards those illfated nations our allies and consequently if the government of the portugueze though weak in power possessed their affections and was strong in right it was incumbent upon us to turn our first thoughts to that governmentto look for it if it were hiddento call it forthand by our power combined with that of the people to assert its rights or if the government were dissolved and had no existence it was our duty in such an emergency to have resorted to the nation expressing its will through the most respectable and conspicuous authority through that which seemed to have the best right to stand forth as its representative in whatever circumstances portugal had been placed the paramount right of the portugueze nation or government to appear not merely as a party but a principal ought to have been established as a primary position without the admission of which all proposals to treat would be peremptorily rejected but the portugueze had a government they had a lawful prince in brazil and a regency appointed by him at home and generals at the head of considerable bodies of troops appointed also by the regency or the prince well then might one of those generals enter a formal protest against the treaty on account of its being totally void of that deference due to the prince regent or the government that represents him as being hostile to the sovereign authority and independence of that government and as being against the honour safety and independence of the nation i have already reminded the reader of the benign and happy influences which might have attended upon a different conduct how much good we might have added to that already in existence how far we might have assisted in strengthening among our allies those powers and in developing those virtues which were producing themselves by a natural process and to which these breathings of insult must have been a deadly check and interruption nor would the evil be merely negative for the interference of professed friends acting in this manner must have superinduced dispositions and passions which were alien to the condition of the portuguezescattered weeds which could not have been found upon the soil if our ignorant hands had not sown them of this i will not now speak for i have already detained the reader too long at the thresholdbut i have put the master key into his possession and every chamber which he opens will be found loathsome as the one which he last quitted let us then proceed  by the first article of the convention it is covenanted that all the places and forts in the kingdom of portugal occupied by the french troops shall be delivered to the british army articles iv and xii are to the same effectdetermining the surrender of portugueze fortified places stores and ships to the english forces but not a word of their being to be holden in trust for the prince regent or his government to whom they belonged the same neglect or contempt of justice and decency is shewn here as in the preamble to these instruments it was further shewn afterwards by the act of hoisting the british flag instead of the portugueze upon these forts when they were first taken possession of by the british forces it is no excuse to say that this was not intended such inattentions are among the most grievous faults which can be committed and are impossible when the affections and understandings of men are of that quality and in that state which are required for a service in which there is any thing noble or virtuous again suppose that it was the purpose of the generals who signed and ratified a convention containing the articles in question that the forts and ships c should be delivered immediately to the portugueze governmentwould the delivering up of them wipe away the affront would it not rather appear after the omission to recognize the right that we had ostentatiously taken upon us to bestowas a boon that which they felt to be their own  passing by as already deliberated and decided upon those conditions articles ii and iii by which it is stipulated that the french army shall not be considered as prisoners of war shall be conveyed with arms c to some port between rochefort and lorient and be at liberty to serve i come to that memorable condition article v that the french army shall carry with it all its equipments that is to say its military chests and carriages attached to the field commissariat and field hospitals or shall be allowed to dispose of such part as the commander in chief may judge it unnecessary to embark in like manner all individuals of the army shall be at liberty to dispose of their private property of every description with full security hereafter for the purchasers this is expressed still more pointedly in the armisticethough the meaning implied in the two articles is precisely the same for in the fifth article of the armistice it is agreed provisionally that all those of whom the french army consists shall be conveyed to france with arms and baggage and all their private property of every description no part of which shall be wrested from them in the convention it is only expressed that they shall be at liberty to depart article ii with arms and baggage and article v to dispose of their private property of every description but if they had a right to dispose of it this would include a right to carry it awaywhich was undoubtedly understood by the french general and in the armistice it is expressly said that their private property of every description shall be conveyed to france along with their persons what then are we to understand by the words their private property of every description equipments of the army in general and baggage of individuals had been stipulated for before now we all know that the lawful professional gains and earnings of a soldier must be small that he is not in the habit of carrying about him during actual warfare any accumulation of these or other property and that the ordinary private property which he can be supposed to have a just title to is included under the name of his baggagetherefore this was something more and what it wasis apparent no part of their property says the armistice shall be wrested from them who does not see in these words the consciousness of guilt an indirect selfbetraying admission that they had in their hands treasures which might be lawfully taken from them and an anxiety to prevent that act of justice by a positive stipulation who does not see on what sort of property the frenchman had his eye that it was not property by right but their possessionstheir plunderevery thing by what means soever acquired that the french army or any individual in it was possessed of but it has been urged that the monstrousness of such a supposition precludes this interpretation renders it impossible that it could either be intended by the one party or so understood by the other what right they who signed and he who ratified this convention have to shelter themselves under this pleawill appear from the 16th and 17th articles in these it is stipulated that all subjects of france or of powers in alliance with france domiciliated in portugal or accidentally in the country shall have their property of every kindmoveable and immoveableguaranteed to them with liberty of retaining or disposing of it and passing the produce into france the same is stipulated article xvii for such natives of portugal as have sided with the french or occupied situations under the french government here then is a direct avowal still more monstrous that every frenchman or native of a country in alliance with france however obnoxious his crimes may have made him and every traitorous portugueze shall have his property guaranteed to him both previously to and after the reinstatement of the portugueze government by the british army now let us ask what sense the word property must have had fastened to it in these cases must it not necessarily have included all the rewards which the frenchman had received for his iniquity and the traitorous portugueze for his treason for no man would bear a part in such oppressions or would be a traitor for nothing and moreover all the rewards which the french could bestow must have been taken from the portugueze extorted from the honest and loyal to be given to the wicked and disloyal these rewards of iniquity must necessarily have been included for on our side no attempt is made at a distinction and on the side of the french the word immoveable is manifestly intended to preclude such a distinction where alone it could have been effectual property then here meanspossessions thus infamously acquired and in the instance of the portugueze the fundamental notion of the word is subverted for a traitor can have no property till the government of his own country has remitted the punishment due to his crimes and these wages of guilt which the master by such exactions was enabled to pay and which the servant thus earned are to be guaranteed to him by a british army where does there exist a power on earth that could confer this right if the portugueze government itself had acted in this manner it would have been guilty of wilful suicide and the nation if it had acted so of high treason against itself let it not then be said that the monstrousness of covenanting to convey along with the persons of the french their plunder secures the article from the interpretation which the people of great britain gave and which i have now proved they were bound to give to itbut conceding for a moment that it was not intended that the words should bear this sense and that neither in a fair grammatical construction nor as illustrated by other passages or by the general tenour of the document they actually did bear it had not unquestionable voices proclaimed the cruelty and rapacitythe acts of sacrilege assassination and robbery by which these treasures had been amassed was not the perfidy of the french army and its contempt of moral obligation both as a body and as to the individuals which composed it infamous through europetherefore the concession would signify nothing for our generals by allowing an army of this character to depart with its equipments waggons military chest and baggage had provided abundant means to enable it to carry off whatsoever it desired and thus to elude and frustrate any stipulations which might have been made for compelling it to restore that which had been so iniquitously seized and here are we brought back to the fountainhead of all this baseness to that apathy and deadness to the principle of justice through the influence of which this army outlawed by its crimes was suffered to depart from the land over which it had so long tyrannizedother than as a band of disarmed prisonersi maintain therefore that permission to carry off the booty was distinctly expressed and if it had not been so that the principle of justice could not here be preserved as a violation of it must necessarily have followed from other conditions of the treaty sir hew dalrymple himself before the court of inquiry has told us in two letters to generals beresford and friere that such part of the plunder as was in money it would be difficult if not impossible to identify and consequently the french could not be prevented from carrying it away with them from the same letters we learn that the french were intending to carry off a considerable part of their plunder by calling it public money and saying that it belonged to the military chest and that their evasions of the article were most shameful and evinced a want of probity and honour which was most disgraceful to them if the french had given no other proofs of their want of such virtues than those furnished by this occasion neither the portugueze nor spanish nor british nations would condemn them nor hate them as they now do nor would this article of the convention have excited such indignation for the french by so acting could not deem themselves breaking an engagement no doubt they looked upon themselves as injuredthat the failure in good faith was on the part of the british and that it was in the lawlessness of power and by a mere quibble that this construction was afterwards put upon the article in question  widely different from the conduct of the british was that of the spaniards in a like casewith high feeling did they abating not a jot or a tittle enforce the principle of justice how says the governor of cadiz to general dupont in the same noble letter before alluded to how says he after enumerating the afflictions which his army and the tyrant who had sent it had unjustly brought upon the spanish nation for of these in their dealings with the french they never for a moment lost sight how asks he could you expect that your army should carry off from spain the fruit of its rapacity cruelty and impiety how could you conceive this possible or that we should be so stupid or senseless and this conduct is as wise in reason as it is true to nature the spanish people could have had no confidence in their government if it had not acted thus these are the sympathies which prove that a government is paternalthat it makes one family with the people besides it is only by such adherence to justice that in times of like commotion popular excesses can either be mitigated or prevented if we would be efficient allies of spain nay if we would not run the risk of doing infinite harm these sentiments must not only be ours as a nation but they must pervade the hearts of our ministers and our generalsour agents and our ambassadors if it be not so they who are sent abroad must either be conscious how unworthy they are and with what unworthy commissions they appear or not if they do feel this then they must hang their heads and blush for their country and themselves if they do not the spaniards must blush for them and revolt from them or what would be ten thousand times more deplorable they must purchase a reconcilement and a communion by a sacrifice of all that is excellent in themselves spain must either break down her lofty spirit her animation and fiery courage to run side by side in the same trammels with great britain or she must start off from her intended yokefellow with contempt and aversion this is the alternative and there is no avoiding it  i have yet to speak of the influence of such concessions upon the french ruler and his army with what satanic pride must he have contemplated the devotion of his servants and adherents to their law the steadiness and zeal of their perverse loyalty and the faithfulness with which they stand by him and each other how must his heart have distended with false glory while he contrasted these qualities of his subjects with the insensibility and slackness of his british enemies this notice has however no especial propriety in this place for as far as concerns bonaparte his pride and depraved confidence may be equally fed by almost all the conditions of this instrument but as to his army it is plain that the permission whether it be considered as by an express article formally granted or only involved in the general conditions of the treaty to bear away in triumph the harvest of its crimes must not only have emboldened and exalted it with arrogance and whetted its rapacity but that hereby every soldier of which this army was composed must upon his arrival in his own country have been a seed which would give back plenteously in its kind the french are at present a needy people without commerce or manufacturesunsettled in their minds and debased in their morals by revolutionary practices and habits of warfare and the youth of the country are rendered desperate by oppression which leaving no choice in their occupation discharges them from all responsibility to their own consciences how powerful then must have been the action of such incitements upon a people so circumstanced the actual sight and far more the imaginary sight and handling of these treasures magnified by the romantic tales which must have been spread about them would carry into every town and village an antidote for the terrors of conscription and would rouze men like the dreams imported from the new world when the first discoverers and adventurers returned with their ingots and their gold dusttheir stories and their promises to inflame and madden the avarice of the old what an effect says the governor of cadiz must it have upon the people he means the spanish people to know that a single soldier was carrying away 2580 livres tournois what an effect he might have said also must it have upon the frenchi direct the readers attention to this because it seems to have been overlooked and because some of the public journals speaking of the convention and no doubt uttering the sentiments of several of their readerssay that they are disgusted with the transaction not because the french have been permitted to carry off a few diamonds or some ingots of silver but because we confessed by consenting to the treaty that an army of 35000 british troops aided by the portugueze nation was not able to compel 20000 french to surrender at discretion this is indeed the root of the evil as hath been shewn and it is the curse of this treaty that the several parts of it are of such enormity as singly to occupy the attention and to destroy comparison and coexistence but the people of great britain are disgusted both with the one and the other they bewail the violation of the principle if the value of the things carried off had been in itself trifling their grief and their indignation would have been scarcely less but it is manifest from what has been said that it was not trifling and that therefore upon that account as well as upon others this permission was no less impolitic than it was unjust and dishonourable  in illustrating these articles of the armistice and convention by which the french were both expressly permitted and indirectly enabled to carry off their booty we have already seen that a concession was made which is still more enormous viz that all subjects of france or of powers in alliance with france domiciliated in portugal or resident there and all natives of portugal who have accepted situations under the french government c shall have their property of every kind guaranteed to them by the british army by articles 16th and 17th their persons are placed under the like protection the french article xvi shall be at liberty either to accompany the french army or to remain in portugal and the portugueze article xvii shall not be rendered accountable for their political conduct during the period of the occupation of the country by the french army they all are placed under the protection of the british commanders and shall sustain no injury in their property or persons  i have animadverted heretofore upon the unprofessional eagerness of our generals to appear in the character of negotiators when the sword would have done them more service than the pen but if they had confined themselves to mere military regulations they might indeed with justice have been grievously censured as injudicious commanders whose notion of the honour of armies was of a low pitch and who had no conception of the peculiar nature of the service in which they were engaged but the censure must have stopped here whereas by these provisions they have shewn that they have never reflected upon the nature of military authority as contradistinguished from civil french example had so far dazzled and blinded them that the french army is suffered to denominate itself the french government and from the whole tenour of these instruments from the preamble and these articles especially it should seem that our generals fancied themselves and their army to be the british government for these regulations emanating from a mere military authority are purely civil but of such a kind that no power on earth could confer a right to establish them and this trampling upon the most sacred rightsthis sacrifice of the consciousness of a selfpreserving principle without which neither societies nor governments can exist is not made by our generals in relation to subjects of their own sovereign but to an independent nation our ally into whose territories we could not have entered but from its confidence in our friendship and good faith surely the persons who under the countenance of too high authority have talked so loudly of prejudging this question entirely overlooked or utterly forgot this part of it what have these monstrous provisions to do with the relative strength of the two armies or with any point admitting a doubt what need here of a court of judicature to settle who were the persons their names are subscribed by their own hands and to determine the quality of the thing actions and agents like these exhibited in this connection with each other must of necessity be condemned the moment they are known and to assert the contrary is to maintain that man is a being without understanding and that morality is an empty dream and if this condemnation must after this manner follow to utter it is less a duty than a further inevitable consequence from the constitution of human nature they who hold that the formal sanction of a court of judicature is in this case required before a people has a right to pass sentence know not to what degree they are enemies to that people and to mankind to what degree selfishness whether arising from their peculiar situation or from other causes has in them prevailed over those faculties which are our common inheritance and cut them off from fellowship with the species most deplorable would be the result if it were possible that the injunctions of these men could be obeyed or their remonstrances acknowledged to be just for not to mention that if it were not for such prompt decisions of the public voice misdemeanours of men high in office would rarely be accounted for at all we must bear in mind at this crisis that the adversary of all good is hourly and daily extending his ravages and according to such notions of fitness our indignation our sorrow our shame our sense of right and wrong and all those moral affections and powers of the understanding by which alone he can be effectually opposed are to enter upon a long vacation their motion is to be suspendeda thing impossible if it could it would be destroyed  let us now see what language the portugueze speak upon that part of the treaty which has incited me to give vent to these feelings and to assert these truths i protest says general friere against article xvii one of the two now under examination because it attempts to tie down the government of this kingdom not to bring to justice and condign punishment those persons who have been notoriously and scandalously disloyal to their prince and the country by joining and serving the french party and even if the english army should be allowed to screen them from the punishment they have deserved still it should not prevent their expulsionwhereby this country would no longer have to fear being again betrayed by the same men yet while the partizans of the french are thus guarded not a word is said to protect the loyal portugueze whose fidelity to their country and their prince must have rendered them obnoxious to the french army and who in lisbon and the environs were left at its mercy from the day when the convention was signed till the departure of the french couple also with this the first additional article by which it is agreed that the individuals in the civil employment of the army including all the agitators spies informers all the jackals of the ravenous lion made prisoners either by the british troops or the portugueze in any part of portugal will be restored as is customary without exchange that is no stipulations being made for reciprocal conditions in fact through the whole course of this strange interference of a military power with the administration of civil justice in the country of an ally there is only one article the 15th which bears the least shew of attention to portugueze interests by this it is stipulated that from the date of the ratification of the convention all arrears of contributions requisitions or claims whatever of the french government against subjects of portugal or any other individuals residing in this country founded on the occupation of portugal by the french troops in the month of december 1807 which may not have been paid up are cancelled and all sequestrations laid upon their property moveable or immoveable are removed and the free disposal of the same is restored to the proper owners which amounts to this the french are called upon formally to relinquish in favour of the portugueze that to which they never had any right to abandon false claims which they either had a power to enforce or they had not if they departed immediately and had not power the article was nugatory if they remained a day longer and had power there was no security that they would abide by it accordingly loud complaints were made that after the date of the convention all kinds of ravages were committed by the french upon lisbon and its neighbourhood and what did it matter whether these were upon the plea of old debts and requisitions or new debts were created more greedily than everfrom the consciousness that the time for collecting them was so short this article then the only one which is even in shew favourable to the portugueze is in substance nothing inasmuch as in what it is silent upon viz that the people of lisbon and its neighbourhood shall not be vexed and oppressed by the french during their stay with new claims and robberies it is grossly cruel or negligent and in that for which it actually stipulates wholly delusive it is in fact insulting for the very admission of a formal renunciation of these claims does to a certain degree acknowledge their justice the only decent manner of introducing matter to this effect would have been by placing it as a bye clause of a provision that secured the portugueze from further molestations and merely alluding to it as a thing understood of course yet from the place which this specious article occupies preceding immediately the 16th and 17th which we have been last considering it is clear that it must have been intended by the french general as honey smeared upon the edge of the cupto make the poison contained in those two more palateable  thus much for the portugueze and their particular interests in one instance a concern of the spanish nation comes directly under notice and that nation also is treated without delicacy or feeling for by the 18th article it is agreed that the spaniards 4000 in number who had been disarmed and were confined on shipboard in the port of lisbon by the french should be liberated and upon what consideration not upon their right to be free as having been treacherously and cruelly dealt with by men who were part of a power that was labouring to subjugate their country and in this attempt had committed inhuman crimes against itnot even exchanged as soldiers against soldiersbut the condition of their emancipation is that the british general engages to obtain of the spaniards to restore such french subjects either military or civil as have been detained in spain without having been taken in battle or in consequence of military operations but on account of the occurrences of the 29th of last may and the days immediately following occurrences i know not what are exactly the features of the face for which this word serves as a veil i have no register at hand to inform me what these events precisely were but there can be no doubt that it was a time of triumph for liberty and humanity and that the persons for whom these nobleminded spaniards were to be exchanged were no other than a horde from among the most abject of the french nation probably those wretches who having never faced either the dangers or the fatigues of war had been most busy in secret preparations or were most conspicuous in open acts of massacre when the streets of madrid a few weeks before had been drenched with the blood of two thousand of her bravest citizens yet the liberation of these spaniards upon these terms is recorded in the report of the court of enquiry as one of the advantages which in the contemplation of the generals would result from the convention  finally if there shall be any doubt article xiv as to the meaning of any article it shall be explained favourably to the french army and hostages article xx of the rank of field officers on the part of the british army and navy shall be furnished for the guarantee of the present convention  i have now gone through the painful task of examining the most material conditions of the convention of cintrathe whole number of the articles is twentytwo with three additional onesa long ladder into a deep abyss of infamy  need it be said that neglectsinjuriesand insultslike these which we have been contemplating come from what quarter they may let them be exhibited towards whom they will must produce not merely mistrust and jealousy but alienation and hatred the passions and feelings may be quieted or diverted for a short time but though out of sight or seemingly asleep they must exist and the life which they have received cannot but by a long course of justice and kindness be overcome and destroyed but why talk of a long course of justice and kindness when the immediate result must have been so deplorable relying upon our humanity our fellowfeeling and our justice upon these instant and urgent claims sanctioned by the more mild one of ancient alliance the portugueze people by voices from every part of their land entreated our succour the arrival of a british army upon their coasts was joyfully hailed and the people of the country zealously assisted in landing the troops without which help as a british general has informed us that landing could not have been effected and it is in this manner that they are repaid scarcely have we set foot upon their country before we sting them into selfreproaches and act in every thing as if it were our wish to make them ashamed of their generous confidence as of a foolish simplicityproclaiming to them that they have escaped from one thraldom only to fall into another if the french had any traitorous partizans in portugal and we have seen that such there were and that nothing was left undone on our part which could be done to keep them there and to strengthen them what answer could have been given to one of these if with this treaty in his hand he had said the french have dealt hardly with us i allow but we have gained nothing the change is not for the better but for the worse for the appetite of their tyranny was palled but this being new to its food is keen and vigorous if you have only a choice between two masters such an advocate might have argued chose always the stronger for he after his evil passions have had their first harvest confident in his strength will not torment you wantonly in order to prove it besides the property which he has in you he can maintain and there will be no risk of your being torn in piecesthe unsettled prey of two rival claimants you will thus have the advantage of a fixed and assured object of your hatred and your fear being stripped of doubt will lose its motion and its edge both passions will relax and grow mild and though they may not turn into reconcilement and love though you may not be independent nor be free yet you will at least exist in tranquillityand possess if not the activity of hope the security of despair no effectual answer i say could have been given to a man pleading thus in such circumstances so much for the choice of evils but for the hope of goodwhat is to become of the efforts and high resolutions of the portugueze and spanish nations manifested by their own hand in the manner which we have seen they may live indeed and prosper but not by us but in despite of us  whatever may be the character of the portugueze nation be it true or not that they had a becoming sense of the injuries which they had received from the french invader and were rouzed to throw off oppression by a universal effort and to form a living barrier against itcertain it is that betrayed and trampled upon as they had been they held unprecedented claims upon humanity to secure them from further outragesmoreover our conduct towards them was grossly inconsistent for we entered their country upon the supposition that they had such sensibility and virtue we announced to them publickly and solemnly our belief in this and indeed to have landed a force in the peninsula upon any other inducement would have been the excess of folly and madness but the portugueze are a brave peoplea people of great courage and worth conclusions drawn from intercourse with certain classes of the depraved inhabitants of lisbon only and which are true only with respect to them have been hastily extended to the whole nation which has thus unjustly suffered both in our esteem and in that of all europe in common with their neighbours the spaniards they were making a universal zealous and fearless effort and whatever may be the final issue the very act of having risen under the pressure and in the face of the most tremendous military power which the earth has ever seenis itself evidence in their favour the strongest and most comprehensive which can be given a transcendent glory which let it be remembered no subsequent failures in duty on their part can forfeit this they must have feltthat they had furnished an illustrious example and that nothing can abolish their claim upon the good wishes and upon the gratitude of mankind which isand will be through all ages their due at such a time then injuries and insults from any quarter would have been deplorable but proceeding from us the evil must have been aggravated beyond calculation for we have throughout europe the character of a sage and meditative people our history has been read by the degraded nations of the continent with admiration and some portions of it with awe with a recognition of superiority and distance which was honourable to ussalutary for those to whose hearts in their depressed state it could find entranceand promising for the future condition of the human race we have been looked up to as a people who have acted nobly whom their constitution of government has enabled to speak and write freely and who therefore have thought comprehensively as a people among whom philosophers and poets by their surpassing geniustheir wisdomand knowledge of human nature have circulatedand made familiardivinelytempered sentiments and the purest notions concerning the duties and true dignity of individual and social man in all situations and under all trials by so readily acceding to the prayers with which the spaniards and portugueze entreated our assistance we had proved to them that we were not wanting in fellowfeeling therefore might we be admitted to be judges between them and their enemiesunexceptionable judgesmore competent even than a dispassionate posterity which from the very want comparatively of interest and passion might be in its examination remiss and negligent and therefore in its decision erroneous we their contemporaries were drawn towards them as suffering beings but still their sufferings were not ours nor could be and we seemed to stand at that due point of distance from which right and wrong might be fairly looked at and seen in their just proportions every thing conspired to prepossess the spaniards and portugueze in our favour and to give the judgment of the british nation authority in their eyes strange then would be their first sensations when upon further trial instead of a growing sympathy they met with demonstrations of a state of sentiment and opinion abhorrent from their own a shock must have followed upon this discovery a shock to their confidencenot perhaps at first in us but in themselves for like all men under the agitation of extreme passion no doubt they had before experienced occasional misgivings that they were subject to error and distraction from afflictions pressing too violently upon them these flying apprehensions would now take a fixed place and that moment would be most painful if they continued to respect our opinion so far must they have mistrusted themselves fatal mistrust at such a crisis their passion of just vengeance their indignation their aspiring hopes everything that elevated and cheared must have departed from them but this bad influence the excess of the outrage would mitigate or prevent and we may be assured that they rather recoiled from allies who had thus by their actions discountenanced and condemned efforts which the most solemn testimony of conscience had avouched to them were justthat they recoiled from us with that loathing and contempt which unexpected determined and absolute hostility upon points of dearest interest will for ever create  again independence and liberty were the blessings for which the people of the peninsula were contendingimmediate independence which was not to be gained but by modes of exertion from which liberty must ensue now libertyhealthy matured timehonoured libertythis is the growth and peculiar boast of britain and nature herself by encircling with the ocean the country which we inhabit has proclaimed that this mighty nation is for ever to be her own ruler and that the land is set apart for the home of immortal independence judging then from these first fruits of british friendship what bewildering and depressing and hollow thoughts must the spaniards and portugueze have entertained concerning the real value of these blessings if the people who have possessed them longest and who ought to understand them best could send forth an army capable of enacting the oppression and baseness of the convention of cintra if the government of that people could sanction this treaty and if lastly this distinguished and favoured people themselves could suffer it to be held forth to the eyes of men as expressing the sense of their heartsas an image of their understandings  but it did not speak their senseit was not enduredit was not submitted to in their hearts bitter was the sorrow of the people of great britain when the tidings first came to their ears when they first fixed their eyes upon this covenantoverwhelming was their astonishment tormenting their shame their indignation was tumultuous and the burthen of the past would have been insupportable if it had not involved in its very nature a sustaining hope for the future among many alleviations there was one which not wisely but overcome by circumstances all were willing to admitthat the event was so strange and uncouth exhibiting such discordant characteristics of innocent fatuity and enormous guilt that it could not without violence be thought of as indicative of a general constitution of things either in the country or the government but that it was a kind of lusus naturae in the moral worlda solitary straggler out of the circumference of natures lawa monster which could not propagate and had no birthright in futurity accordingly the first expectation was that the government would deem itself under the necessity of disanulling the convention a necessity which though in itself a great evil appeared small in the eyes of judicious men compared with the consequences of admitting that such a contract could be binding for they who had signed and ratified it had not only glaringly exceeded all power which could be supposed to be vested in them as holding a military office but in the exercise of political functions they had framed ordinances which neither the government nor the nation nor any power on earth could confer upon them a right to frame therefore the contract was selfdestroying from the beginning it is a wretched oversight or a wilful abuse of terms still more wretched to speak of the good faith of a nation as being pledged to an act which was not a shattering of the edifice of justice but a subversion of its foundations one man cannot sign away the faculty of reason in another much less can one or two individuals do this for a whole people therefore the contract was void both from its injustice and its absurdity and the party with whom it was made must have known it to be so it could not then but be expected by many that the government would reject it moreover extraordinary outrages against reason and virtue demand that extraordinary sacrifices of atonement should be made upon their altars and some were encouraged to think that a government might upon this impulse rise above itself and turn an exceeding disgrace into true glory by a public profession of shame and repentance for having appointed such unworthy instruments that this being acknowledged it would clear itself from all imputation of having any further connection with what had been done and would provide that the nation should as speedily as possible be purified from all suspicion of looking upon it with other feelings than those of abhorrence the people knew what had been their own wishes when the army was sent in aid of their allies and they clung to the faith that their wishes and the aims of the government must have been in unison and that the guilt would soon be judicially fastened upon those who stood forth as principals and who it was hoped would be found to have fulfilled only their own will and pleasureto have had no explicit commission or implied encouragement for what they had doneno accessaries in their crime the punishment of these persons was anticipated not to satisfy any cravings of vindictive justice for these if they could have existed in such a case had been thoroughly appeased already for what punishment could be greater than to have brought upon themselves the sentence passed upon them by the voice of their countrymen but for this reasonthat a judicial condemnation of the men who were openly the proximate cause and who were forgetfully considered as the single and sole originating source would make our detestation of the effect more signally manifest  these thoughts if not welcomed without scruple and relied upon without fear were at least encouraged till it was recollected that the persons at the head of government had ordered that the event should be communicated to the inhabitants of the metropolis with signs of national rejoicing no wonder if when these rejoicings were called to mind it was impossible to entertain the faith which would have been most consolatory the evil appeared no longer as the forlorn monster which i have described it put on another shape and was endued with a more formidable lifewith power to generate and transmit after its kind a new and alarming import was added to the event by this open testimony of gladness and approbation which intimatedwhich declaredthat the spirit which swayed the individuals who were the ostensible and immediate authors of the convention was not confined to them but that it was widely prevalent else it could not have been found in the very councilseat there where if wisdom and virtue have not some influence what is to become of the nation in these times of peril rather say into what an abyss is it already fallen  his majestys ministers by this mode of communicating the tidings indiscreet as it was unfeeling had committed themselves yet still they might have recovered from the lapse have awakened after a little time and accordingly notwithstanding an annunciation so ominous it was matter of surprise and sorrow to many that the ministry appeared to deem the convention binding and that its terms were to be fulfilled there had indeed been only a choice of evils but of the two the worseten thousand times the worsewas fixed upon the ministers having thus officially applauded the treatyand by suffering it to be carried into execution made themselves a party to the transactiondrew upon themselves those suspicions which will ever pursue the steps of public men who abandon the direct road which leads to the welfare of their country it was suspected that they had taken this part against the dictates of conscience and from selfishness and cowardice that from the first they reasoned thus within themselvesif the act be indeed so criminal as there is cause to believe that the public will pronounce it to be and if it shall continue to be regarded as such great odium must sooner or later fall upon those who have appointed the agents and this odium which will be from the first considerable in spite of the astonishment and indignation of which the framers of the convention may be the immediate object will when the astonishment has relaxed and the angry passions have died away settle for many causes more heavily upon those who by placing such men in the command are the original source of the guilt and the dishonour how then is this most effectually to be prevented by endeavouring to prevent or to destroy as far as may be the odium attached to the act itself for which purpose it was suspected that the rejoicings had been ordered and that afterwards when the people had declared themselves so loudlypartly upon the plea of the good faith of the nation being pledged and partly from a false estimate of the comparative force of the two obligationsthe convention in the same selfish spirit was carried into effect and that the ministry took upon itself a final responsibility with a vain hope that by so doing and incorporating its own credit with the transaction it might bear down the censures of the people and overrule their judgment to the superinducing of a belief that the treaty was not so unjust and inexpedient and thus would be includedin one sweeping exculpationthe misdeeds of the servant and the master  butwhether these suspicions were reasonable or not whatever motives produced a determination that the convention should be acted uponthere can be no doubt of the manner in which the ministry wished that the people should appreciate it when the same persons who had ordered that it should at first be received with rejoicing availed themselves of his majestys high authority to give a harsh reproof to the city of london for having prayed that an enquiry might be instituted into this dishonourable and unprecedented transaction in their petition they styled it also an afflicting eventhumiliating and degrading to the country and injurious to his majestys allies and for this to the astonishment and grief of all sound minds the petitioners were severely reprimanded and told among other admonitions that it was inconsistent with the principles of british jurisprudence to pronounce judgement without previous investigation  upon this charge as reechoed in its general import by persons who have been overawed or deceived and by others who have been wilful deceivers i have already incidentally animadverted and repelled it i trust with becoming indignation i shall now meet the charge for the last time formally and directly on account of considerations applicable to all times and because the whole course of domestic proceedings relating to the convention of cintra combined with menaces which have been recently thrown out in the lower house of parliament renders it too probable that a league has been framed for the purpose of laying further restraints upon freedom of speech and of the press and that the reprimand to the city of london was devised by ministers as a preparatory overt act of this scheme to the great abuse of the sovereigns authority and in contempt of the rights of the nation in meeting this charge i shall shew to what desperate issues men are brought and in what woeful labyrinths they are entangled when under the pretext of defending instituted law they violate the laws of reason and nature for their own unhallowed purposes  if the persons who signed this petition acted inconsistently with the principles of british jurisprudence the offence must have been committed by giving an answer before adequate and lawful evidence had entitled them so to do to one or other of these questionswhat is the act and who is the agentor to both conjointly now the petition gives no opinion upon the agent it pronounces only upon the act and that some one must be guilty but whoit does not take upon itself to say it condemns the act and calls for punishment upon the authors whosoever they may be found to be and does no more after the analysis which has been made of the convention i may ask if there be any thing in this which deserves reproof and reproof from an authority which ought to be most enlightened and most dispassionateas it is next to the legislative the most solemn authority in the land  it is known to every one that the privilege of complaint and petition in cases where the nation feels itself aggrieved itself being the judge and who else ought to be or can bea privilege the exercise of which implies condemnation of something complained of followed by a prayer for its removal or correctionnot only is established by the most grave and authentic charters of englishmen who have been taught by their wisest statesmen and legislators to be jealous over its preservation and to call it into practice upon every reasonable occasion but also that this privilege is an indispensable condition of all civil liberty nay of such paramount interest is it to mankind existing under any frame of government whatsoever that either by law or custom it has universally prevailed under all governmentsfrom the grecian and swiss democracies to the despotisms of imperial rome of turkey and of france under her present ruler it must then be a high principle which could exact obeisance from governments at the two extremes of polity and from all modes of government inclusively from the best and from the worst from magistrates acting under obedience to the stedfast law which expresses the general will and from depraved and licentious tyrants whose habit it isto express and to act upon their own individual will tyrants have seemed to feel that if this principle were acknowledged the subject ought to be reconciled to any thing that by permitting the free exercise of this right alone an adequate price was paid down for all abuses that a standing pardon was included in it for the past and a daily renewed indulgence for every future enormity it is then melancholy to think that the time is come when an attempt has been made to tear out of the venerable crown of the sovereign of great britain a gem which is in the very front of the turban of the emperor of moroccosee appendix d  to enter upon this argument is indeed both astounding and humiliating for the adversary in the present case is bound to contend that we cannot pronounce upon evil or good either in the actions of our own or in past times unless the decision of a court of judicature has empowered us so to do why then have historians written and why do we yield to the impulses of our nature hating or lovingapproving or condemning according to the appearances which their records present to our eyes but the doctrine is as nefarious as it is absurd for those public events in which men are most interested namely the crimes of rulers and of persons in high authority for the most part are such as either have never been brought before tribunals at all or before unjust ones for though offenders may be in hostility with each other yet the kingdom of guilt is not wholly divided against itself its subjects are united by a general interest to elude or overcome that law which would bring them to condign punishment therefore to make a verdict of a court of judicature a necessary condition for enabling men to determine the quality of an act when the head and frontthe life and soul of the offence may have been that it eludes or rises above the reach of all judicature is a contradiction which would be too gross to merit notice were it not that men willingly suffer their understandings to stagnate and hence this rotten bog rotten and unstable as the crude consistence of miltons chaos smitten for i will continue to use the language of the poet by the petrific maceand bound with gorgonian rigour by the lookof despotism is transmuted and becomes a highway of adamant for the sorrowful steps of generation after generation  again in cases where judicial inquiries can be and are instituted and are equitably conducted this suspension of judgment with respect to act or agent is only supposed necessarily to exist in the court itself not in the witnesses the plaintiffs or accusers or in the minds even of the people who may be present if the contrary supposition were realized how could the arraigned person ever have been brought into court what would become of the indignation the hope the sorrow or the sense of justice by which the prosecutors or the people of the country who pursued or apprehended the presumed criminal or they who appear in evidence against him are actuated if then this suspension of judgment by a law of human nature and a requisite of society is not supposed necessarily to existexcept in the minds of the court if this be undeniable in cases where the eye and earwitnesses are fewhow much more so in a case like the present where all that constitutes the essence of the act is avowed by the agents themselves and lies bare to the notice of the whole worldnow it was in the character of complainants and denunciators that the petitioners of the city of london appeared before his majestys throne and they have been reproached by his majestys ministers under the cover of a sophism which if our anxiety to interpret favourably words sanctioned by the first magistratemakes us unwilling to think it a deliberate artifice meant for the delusion of the people must however on the most charitable comment be pronounced an evidence of no little heedlessness and selfdelusion on the part of those who framed it  to sum up the matterthe right of petition which we have shewn as a general proposition supposes a right to condemn and is in itself an act of qualified condemnation may in too many instances take the ground of absolute condemnation both with respect to the crime and the criminal it was confined in this case to the crime but if the city of london had proceeded farther they would have been justifiable because the delinquents had set their hands to their own delinquency the petitioners then are not only clear of all blame but are entitled to high praise and we have seen whither the doctrines lead upon which they were condemnedand now mark the discord which will ever be found in the actions of men where there is no inward harmony of reason or virtue to regulate the outward conduct  those ministers who advised their sovereign to reprove the city of london for uttering prematurely upon a measure an opinion in which they were supported by the unanimous voice of the nation had themselves before publickly prejudged the question by ordering that the tidings should be communicated with rejoicings one of their body has since attempted to wipe away this stigma by representing that these orders were given out of a just tenderness for the reputation of the generals who would otherwise have appeared to be condemned without trial but did these rejoicings leave the matter indifferent was not the positive fact of thus expressing an opinion above all in a case like this in which surely no man could ever dream that there were any features of splendour far stronger language of approbation than the negative fact could be of disapprobation for these same ministers who had called upon the people of great britain to rejoice over the armistice and convention and who reproved and discountenanced and suppressed to the utmost of their power every attempt at petitioning for redress of the injury caused by those treaties have now made publick a document from which it appears that when the instruments were first laid before his majesty the king felt himself compelled at once ie previously to all investigation to express his disapprobation of those articles in which stipulations were made directly affecting the interests or feelings of the spanish and portugueze nations  and was it possible that a sovereign of a free country could be otherwise affected it is indeed to be regretted that his majestys censure was not upon this occasion radicaland pronounced in a sterner tone that a council was not in existence sufficiently intelligent and virtuous to advise the king to give full expression to the sentiments of his own mind which we may reasonably conclude were in sympathy with those of a brave and loyal people never surely was there a public event more fitted to reduce men in all ranks of society under the supremacy of their common nature to impress upon them one belief to infuse into them one spirit for it was not done in a remote corner by persons of obscure rank but in the eyes of europe and of all mankind by the leading authorities military and civil of a mighty empire it did not relate to a petty immunity or a local and insulated privilegebut to the highest feelings of honour to which a nation may either be calmly and gradually raised by a long course of independence liberty and glory or to the level of which it may be lifted up at once from a fallen state by a sudden and extreme pressure of violence and tyranny it not only related to these high feelings of honour but to the fundamental principles of justice by which life and property that is the means of living are secured  a people whose government had been dissolved by foreign tyranny and which had been left to work out its salvation by its own virtues prayed for our help and whence were we to learn how that help could be most effectually given how they were even to be preserved from receiving injuries instead of benefits at our handswhence were we to learn this but from their language and from our own hearts they had spoken of unrelenting and inhuman wrongs of patience wearied out of the agonizing yoke cast off of the blessed service of freedom chosen of heroic aspirations of constancy and fortitude and perseverance of resolution even to the death of gladness in the embrace of death of weeping over the graves of the slain by those who had not been so happy as to die of resignation under the worst final doom of glory and triumph and punishment this was the language which we heardthis was the devout hymn that was chaunted and the responses with which our country bore a part in the solemn service were from her soul and from the depths of her soul  o sorrow o misery for england the land of liberty and courage and peace the land trustworthy and long approved the home of lofty example and benign precept the central orb to which as to a fountain the nations of the earth ought to repair and in their golden urns draw lighto sorrow and shame for our country for the grass which is upon her fields and the dust which is in her gravesfor her good men who now look upon the dayand her long train of deliverers and defenders her alfred her sidneys and her milton whose voice yet speaketh for our reproach and whose actions survive in memory to confound us or to redeem  for what hath been done look at it we have looked at it we have handled it we have pondered it steadily we have tried it by the principles of absolute and eternal justice by the sentiments of highminded honour both with reference to their general nature and to their especial exaltation under present circumstances by the rules of expedience by the maxims of prudence civil and military we have weighed it in the balance of all these and found it wanting in that which is most excellent most wanting  our country placed herself by the side of spain and her fellow nation she sent an honourable portion of her sons to aid a suffering people to subjugate or destroy an armybut i degrade the worda banded multitude of perfidious oppressors of robbers and assassins who had outlawed themselves from society in the wantonness of power who were abominable for their own crimes and on account of the crimes of him whom they servedto subjugate or destroy these not exacting that it should be done within a limited time admitting even that they might effect their purpose or not she could have borne either issue she was prepared for either but she was not prepared for such a deliverance as hath been accomplished not a deliverance of portugal from french oppression but of the oppressor from the anger and power at least from the animating efforts of the peninsula she was not prepared to stand between her allies and their worthiest hopes that when chastisement could not be inflicted honouras much as bad men could receiveshould be conferred that them whom her own hands had humbled the same hands and no other should exalt that finally the sovereign of this horde of devastators himself the destroyer of the hopes of good men should have to say through the mouth of his minister and for the hearing of all europe that his army of portugal had dictated the terms of its glorious retreat  i have to defend my countrymen and if their feelings deserve reverence if there be any stirrings of wisdom in the motions of their souls my task is accomplished for here were no factions to blind no dissolution of established authorities to confound no ferments to distemper no narrow selfish interests to delude the object was at a distance and it rebounded upon us as with force collected from a mighty distance we were calm till the very moment of transition and all the people were movedand felt as with one heart and spake as with one voice every human being in these islands was unsettled the most slavish broke loose as from fetters and there was not an individualit need not be said of heroic virtue but of ingenuous life and sound discretionwho if his father his son or his brother or if the flower of his house had been in that army would not rather that they had perished and the whole body of their countrymen their companions in arms had perished to a man than that a treaty should have been submitted to upon such conditions this was the feeling of the people an awful feeling and it is from these oracles that rulers are to learn wisdom  for when the people speaks loudly it is from being strongly possessed either by the godhead or the demon and he who cannot discover the true spirit from the false hath no ear for profitable communion but in all that regarded the destinies of spain and her own as connected with them the voice of britain had the unquestionable sound of inspiration if the gentle passions of pity love and gratitude be porches of the temple if the sentiments of admiration and rivalry be pillars upon which the structure is sustained if lastly hatred and anger and vengeance be steps which by a mystery of nature lead to the house of sanctitythen was it manifest to what power the edifice was consecrated and that the voice within was of holiness and truth  spain had risen not merely to be delivered and saveddeliverance and safety were but intermediate objectsregeneration and liberty were the end and the means by which this end was to be attained had their own high value were determined and precious and could no more admit of being departed from than the end of being forgottenshe had risennot merely to be free but in the act and process of acquiring that freedom to recompense herself as it were in a moment for all which she had suffered through ages to levy upon the false fame of a cruel tyrant large contributions of true glory to lift herself by the conflict as high in honouras the disgrace was deep to which her own weakness and vices and the violence and perfidy of her enemies had subjected her  let us suppose that our own land had been so outraged could we have been content that the enemy should be wafted from our shores as lightly as he camemuch less that he should depart illustrated in his own eyes and glorified singing songs of savage triumph and wicked gaietynoshould we not have felt that a high trespassa grievous offence had been committed and that to demand satisfaction was our first and indispensable duty would we not have rendered their bodies back upon our guardian ocean which had borne them hither or have insisted that their haughty weapons should submissively kiss the soil which they had polluted we should have been resolute in a defence that would strike awe and terror this for our dignitymoreover if safety and deliverance are to be so fondly prized for their own sakes what security otherwise could they have would it not be certain that the work which had been so ill done today we should be called upon to execute still more imperfectly and ingloriously tomorrow that we should be summoned to an attempt that would be vain  in like manner were the wise and heroic spaniards moved if an angel from heaven had come with power to take the enemy from their grasp i do not fear to say this in spite of the dominion which is now reextended over so large a portion of their land they would have been sad they would have looked round them their souls would have turned inward and they would have stood like men defrauded and betrayed  for not presumptuously had they taken upon themselves the work of chastisement they did not wander madly about the worldlike the tamerlanes or the chengiz khans or the present barbarian ravager of europeunder a mock title of delegates of the almighty acting upon selfassumed authority their commission had been thrust upon them they had been trampled upon tormented wrongedbitterly wantonly wronged if ever a people on the earth was wronged and this it was which legitimately incorporated their law with the supreme conscience and gave to them the deep faith which they have expressedthat their power was favoured and assisted by the almightythese words are not uttered without a due sense of their awful import but the spirit of evil is strong and the subject requires the highest mode of thinking and feeling of which human nature is capablenor in this can they be deceived for whatever be the immediate issue for themselves the final issue for their country and mankind must be goodthey are instruments of benefit and glory for the human race and the deity therefore is with them  from these impulses then our brethren of the peninsula had risen they could have risen from no other by these energies and by such others as under judicious encouragement would naturally grow out of and unite with these the multitudes who have risen stand and if they desert them must fallriddance mere riddancesafety mere safetyare objects far too defined too inert and passive in their own nature to have ability either to rouze or to sustain they win not the mind by any attraction of grandeur or sublime delight either in effort or in endurance for the mind gains consciousness of its strength to undergo only by exercise among materials which admit the impression of its powerwhich grow under it which bend under itwhich resistwhich change under its influencewhich alter either through its might or in its presence by it or before it these during times of tranquillity are the objects with which in the studious walks of sequestered life genius most loves to hold intercourse by which it is reared and supportedthese are the qualities in action and in object in image in thought and in feeling from communion with which proceeds originally all that is creative in art and science and all that is magnanimous in virtuedespair thinks of safety and hath no purpose fear thinks of safety despondency looks the same waybut these passions are far too selfish and therefore too blind to reach the thing at which they aim even when there is in them sufficient dignity to have an aimall courage is a projection from ourselves however shortlived it is a motion of hope but these thoughts bind too closely to something inwardto the present and to the pastthat is to the self which is or has been whereas the vigour of the human soul is from without and from futurityin breaking down limit and losing and forgetting herself in the sensation and image of country and of the human race and when she returns and is most restricted and confined her dignity consists in the contemplation of a better and more exalted being which though proceeding from herself she loves and is devoted to as to another  in following the stream of these thoughts i have not wandered from my course i have drawn out to open day the truth from its recesses in the minds of my countrymensomething more perhaps may have been done a shape hath perhaps been given to that which was before a stirring spirit i have shewn in what manner it was their wish that the struggle with the adversary of all that is good should be maintainedby pure passions and high actions they forbid that their noble aim should be frustrated by measuring against each other things which are incommensuratemechanic against moral powerbody against soul they will not suffer without expressing their sorrow that purblind calculation should wither the purest hopes in the face of allseeing justice these are times of strong appealof deepsearching visitation when the best abstractions of the prudential understanding give way and are included and absorbed in a supreme comprehensiveness of intellect and passion which is the perfection and the very being of humanity  how base how puny how inefficient for all good purposes are the tools and implements of policy compared with these mighty engines of naturethere is no middle course two masters cannot be servedjustice must either be enthroned above might and the moral law take place of the edicts of selfish passion or the heart of the people which alone can sustain the efforts of the people will languish their desires will not spread beyond the plough and the loom the field and the fireside the sword will appear to them an emblem of no promise an instrument of no hope an object of indifference of disgust or fear was there eversince the earliest actions of men which have been transmitted by affectionate tradition or recorded by faithful history or sung to the impassioned harp of poetrywas there ever a people who presented themselves to the reason and the imagination as under more holy influences than the dwellers upon the southern peninsula as rouzed more instantaneously from a deadly sleep to a more hopeful wakefulness as a mass fluctuating with one motion under the breath of a mightier wind as breaking themselves up and settling into several bodies in more harmonious order as reunited and embattled under a standard which was reared to the sun with more authentic assurance of final victorythe superstition i do not dread the word which prevailed in these nations may have checked many of my countrymen who would otherwise have exultingly accompanied me in the challenge which under the shape of a question i have been confidently uttering as i know that this stain so the same persons termed it did from the beginning discourage their hopes for the cause shortsighted despondency whatever mixture of superstition there might be in the religious faith or devotional practices of the spaniards this must have necessarily been transmuted by that triumphant power wherever that power was felt which grows out of intense moral sufferingfrom the moment in which it coalesces with fervent hope the chains of bigotry which enthralled the mind must have been turned into armour to defend and weapons to annoy wherever the heaving and effort of freedom was spread purification must have followed it and the types and ancient instruments of error where emancipated men shewed their foreheads to the day must have become a language and a ceremony of imagination expressing consecrating and invigorating the most pure deductions of reason and the holiest feelings of universal nature  when the boy of saragossa as we have been told too immature in growth and unconfirmed in strength to be admitted by his fellowcitizens into their ranks too tender of age for them to bear the sight of him in armswhen this boy forgetful or unmindful of the restrictions which had been put upon him rushed into the field where his countrymen were engaged in battle and fighting with the sinew and courage of an unripe hero won a standard from the enemy and bore his acquisition to the church and laid it with his own hands upon the altar of the virginsurely there was not less to be hoped for his country from this act than if the banner taken from his grasp had without any such intermediation been hung up in the place of worshipa direct offering to the incorporeal and supreme being surely there is here an object which the most meditative and most elevated minds may contemplate with absolute delight a welladapted outlet for the dearest sentiments an organ by which they may act a function by which they may be sustainedwho does not recognise in this presentation a visible affinity with deliverance with patriotism with hatred of oppression and with human means put forth to the height for accomplishing under divine countenance the worthiest ends  such is the burst and growth of power and virtue which may rise out of excessive national afflictions from tyranny and oppressionsuch is the hallowing influence and thus mighty is the sway of the spirit of moral justice in the heart of the individual and over the wide world of humanity even the very faith in present miraculous interposition which is so dire a weakness and cause of weakness in tranquil times when the listless being turns to it as a cheap and ready substitute upon every occasion where the man sleeps and the saint or the image of the saint is to perform his work and to give effect to his wisheseven this infirm faith in a state of incitement from extreme passion sanctioned by a paramount sense of moral justice having for its object a power which is no longer sole nor principal but secondary and ministerial a power added to a power a breeze which springs up unthoughtof to assist the strenuous oarsmaneven this faith is subjugated in order to be exalted andinstead of operating as a temptation to relax or to be remiss as an encouragement to indolence or cowardice instead of being a false stay a necessary and definite dependence which may failit passes into a habit of obscure and infinite confidence of the mind in its own energies in the cause from its own sanctity and in the everpresent invisible aid or momentary conspicuous approbation of the supreme disposer of things  let the fire which is never wholly to be extinguished break out afresh let but the human creature be rouzed whether he have lain heedless and torpid in religious or civil slaveryhave languished under a thraldom domestic or foreign or under both these alternatelyor have drifted about a helpless member of a clan of disjointed and feeble barbarians let him rise and actand his domineering imagination by which from childhood he has been betrayed and the debasing affections which it has imposed upon him will from that moment participate the dignity of the newly ennobled being whom they will now acknowledge for their master and will further him in his progress whatever be the object at which he aims still more inevitable and momentous are the results when the individual knows that the fire which is reanimated in him is not less lively in the breasts of his associates and sees the signs and testimonies of his own power incorporated with those of a growing multitude and not to be distinguished from them accompany him wherever he moveshence those marvellous achievements which were performed by the first enthusiastic followers of mohammed and by other conquerors who with their armies have swept large portions of the earth like a transitory wind or have founded new religions or empiresbut if the object contended for be worthy and truly great as in the instance of the spaniards we have seen that it is if cruelties have been committed upon an ancient and venerable people which shake the human frame with horror if not alone the life which is sustained by the bread of the mouth but thatwithout which there is no lifethe life in the soul has been directly and mortally warred against if reason has had abominations to endure in her inmost sanctuarythen does intense passion consecrated by a sudden revelation of justice give birth to those higher and better wonders which i have described and exhibit true miracles to the eyes of men and the noblest which can be seen it may be added thatas this union brings back to the right road the faculty of imagination where it is prone to err and has gone farthest astray as it corrects those qualities which being in their essence indifferent and cleanses those affections which not being inherent in the constitution of man nor necessarily determined to their object are more immediately dependent upon the imagination and which may have received from it a thorough taint of dishonourso the domestic loves and sanctities which are in their nature less liable to be stainedso these wherever they have flowed with a pure and placid stream do instantly under the same influence put forth their strength as in a flood and without being sullied or polluted pursueexultingly and with songa course which leads the contemplative reason to the ocean of eternal love  i feel that i have been speaking in a strain which it is difficult to harmonize with the petty irritations the doubts and fears and the familiar and therefore frequently undignified exterior of present and passing events but the theme is justice and my voice is raised for mankind for us who are alive and for all posterityjustice and passion clearsighted aspiring justice and passion sacred as vehement these like twinborn deities delighting in each others presence have wrought marvels in the inward mind through the whole region of the pyrenëan peninsula i have shewn by what process these united powers sublimated the objects of outward sense in such ritespracticesand ordinances of religionas deviate from simplicity and wholesome piety how they converted them to instruments of nobler use and raised them to a conformity with things truly divine the same reasoning might have been carried into the customs of civil life and their accompanying imagery wherever these also were inconsistent with the dignity of man and like effects of exaltation and purification have been shewn  but a more urgent service calls me to point to further works of these united powers more obvious and obtrusiveworks and appearances such as were hailed by the citizen of seville when returning from madridwhere to use the words of his own public declaration he had left his countrymen groaning in the chains which perfidy had thrown round them and doomed at every step to the insult of being eyed with the disdain of the conqueror to the conquered from madrid threatened harrassed and vexed where mistrust reigned in every heart and the smallest noise made the citizens tremble in the bosom of their families where the enemy from time to time ran to arms to sustain the impression of terror by which the inhabitants had been stricken through the recent massacre from madrid a prison where the gaolers took pleasure in terrifying the prisoners by alarms to keep them quiet from madrid thus tortured and troubled by a relentless tyrant to fit it for the slow and interminable evils of slaverywhen he returned and was able to compare the oppressed and degraded state of the inhabitants of that metropolis with the noble attitude of defence in which andalusia stood a month ago says he the spaniards had lost their countryseville has restored it to life more glorious than ever and those fields which for so many years have seen no steel but that of the ploughshare are going amid the splendour of arms to prove the new cradle of their adored countryi could not he adds refrain from tears of joy on viewing the city in which i first drew breathand to see it in a situation so glorious  we might have trusted but for late disgraces that there is not a man in these islands whose heart would not at such a spectacle have beat in sympathy with that of this fervent patriotwhose voice would not be in true accord with his in the prayer which if he has not already perished for the service of his dear country he is perhaps uttering at this moment that andalusia and the city of seville may preserve the noble attitude in which they then stood and are yet standing or if they be doomed to fall that their dying efforts may not be unworthy of their first promises that the eveningthe closing hour of their freedom may display a brightness not less splendid though more aweful than the dawn so that the names of seville and andalusia may be consecrated among men and be words of life to endless generations  saragossashe also has given bond by her past actions that she cannot forget her duty and will not shrink from it20  20 written in february  valencia is under the seal of the same obligation the multitudes of men who were arrayed in the fields of baylen and upon the mountains of the north the peasants of asturias and the students of salamanca and many a solitary and untoldof hand which quitting for a moment the plough or the spade has discharged a more pressing debt to the country by levelling with the dust at least one insolent and murderous invaderthese have attested the efficacy of the passions which we have been contemplatingthat the will of good men is not a vain impulse heroic desires a delusive prophave proved that the condition of human affairs is not so forlorn and desperate but that there are golden opportunities when the dictates of justice may be unrelentingly enforced and the beauty of the inner mind substantiated in the outward actfor a visible standard to look back upon for a point of realized excellence at which to aspire a monument to recordfor a charter to fasten down and as far as it is possible to preserve  yes there was an annunciation which the good received with gladness a

virgo redeunt saturnia regna     jam nova progenies coelo demittitur alto  the spirits of the generous of the brave of the meditative of the youthful and undefiledwho upon the strongest wing of human nature have accompanied me in this journey into a fair regionmust descend and sorrowful to think it is at the name and remembrance of britain that we are to stoop from the balmy air of this pure element our country did not create but there was created for her one of those golden opportunities over which we have been rejoicing an invitation was offereda summons sent to her ear as if from heaven to go forth also and exhibit on her part in entire coincidence and perfect harmony the beneficent action with the benevolent will to advance in the career of renovation upon which the spaniards had so gloriously entered and to solemnize yet another marriage between victory and justice how she acquitted herself of this duty we have already seen and lamented yet on thisand on this duty onlyought the mind of that army and of the government to have been fixed every thing was smoothed before their feetprovidence it might almost be said held forth to the men of authority in this country a gracious temptation to deceive them into the path of the new virtues which were stirringthe enemy was delivered over to them and they were unable to close their infantine fingers upon the giftthe helplessness of infancy was theirsoh could i but add the innocence of infancy  reflect upon what was the temper and condition of the southern peninsula of europethe noble temper of the people of this mighty island sovereigns of the allembracing ocean think also of the condition of so vast a region in the western continent and its islands and we shall have cause to fear that ages may pass away before a conjunction of things so marvellously adapted to ensure prosperity to virtue shall present itself again it could scarcely be spoken of as being to the wishes of menit was so far beyond their hopesthe government which had been exercised under the name of the old monarchy of spainthis government imbecile even to dotage whose very selfishness was destitute of vigour had been removed taken laboriously and foolishly by the plotting corsican to his own bosom in order that the world might see more triumphantly set forth than since the beginning of things had ever been seen before to what degree a man of bad principles is despicablethough of great powerworking blindly against his own purposes it was a high satisfaction to behold demonstrated in this manner to what a narrow domain of knowledge the intellect of a tyrant must be confined that if the gate by which wisdom enters has never been opened that of policy will surely find moments when it will shut itself against its pretended master imperiously and obstinately to the eyes of the very peasant in the field this sublime truth was laid opennot only that a tyrants domain of knowledge is narrow but melancholy as narrow inasmuch asfrom all that is lovely dignified or exhilarating in the prospect of human naturehe is inexorably cut off and therefore he is inwardly helpless and forlorn  was not their hope in thistwofold hope from the weakness of him who had thus counteracted himself and a hope still more cheering from the strength of those who had been disburthened of a cleaving curse by an ordinance of providenceemploying their most wilful and determined enemy to perform for them the best service which man could perform the work of liberation was virtually accomplishedwe might almost say established the interests of the people were taken from a government whose sole aim it had been to prop up the last remains of its own decrepitude by betraying those whom it was its duty to protectwithdrawn from such hands to be committed to those of the people at a time when the double affliction which spain had endured and the return of affliction with which she was threatened made it impossible that the emancipated nation could abuse its newborn strength to any substantial injury to itselfinfinitely less favourable to all good ends was the condition of the french people when a few years past a revolution made them for a season their own mastersrid them from the incumbrance of superannuated institutionsthe galling pressure of so many unjust lawsand the tyranny of bad customs the spaniards became their own masters and the blessing lay in this that they became so at once there had not been time for them to court their power their fancies had not been fed to wantonness by everchanging temptations obstinacy in them would not have leagued itself with trivial opinions petty hatreds had not accumulated to masses of strength conflicting perniciously with each other vanity with them had not found leisure to flourishnor presumption they did not assume their authorityit was given themit was thrust upon them the perfidy and tyranny of napoleon compelled says the junta of seville in words before quoted the whole nation to take up arms and to choose itself a form of government and in the difficulties and dangers into which the french had plunged it allor nearly allthe provinces as it were by the inspiration of heaven and in a manner little short of miraculous created supreme juntasdelivered themselves up to their guidanceand placed in their hands the rights and the ultimate fate of spaingovernments thus newly issued from the people could not but act from the spirit of the peoplebe organs of their life and though misery by which i mean pain of mind not without some consciousness of guilt naturally disorders the understanding and perverts the moral sensecalamity that is suffering individual or national when it has been inflicted by one to whom no injury has been done or provocation given ever brings wisdom along with it and whatever outward agitation it may cause does inwardly rectify the will  but more was required not merely judicious desires not alone an eye from which the scales had dropped offwhich could see widely and clearly but a mighty hand was wanting the government had been formed and it could not but recollect that the condition of spain did not exact from her children as a first requisite virtues like those due and familiar impulses of springtime by which things are revived and carried forward in accustomed health according to established ordernot power so much for a renewal as for a birthlabour by throes and violencea chaos was to be conquereda work of creation begun and consummatedand afterwards the seasons were to advance and continue their gracious revolutions the powers which were needful for the people to enter upon and assist in this work had been given we have seen that they had been bountifully conferred the nation had been thrown intorather lifted up tothat state when conscience for the body of the people is not merely an infallible monitor which may be heard and disregarded but by combiningwith the attributes of insight to perceive and of inevitable presence to admonish and enjointhe attribute of passion to enforce it was truly an allpowerful deity in the soul  oh let but any man who has a care for the progressive happiness of the species peruse merely that epitome of spanish wisdom and benevolence and amplitude of mind for highest deeds which in the former part of this investigation i have laid before the reader let him listen to the reportswhich they who really have had means of knowledge and who are worthy to speak upon the subject will give to himof the things done or endured in every corner of spain and he will see what emancipation had there been effected in the mindhow far the perceptionsthe impulsesand the actions alsohad outstripped the habit and the character and consequently were in a process of permanently elevating both and how much farther alas by infinite degrees the principles and practice of a people with great objects before them to concentrate their love and their hatred transcend the principles and practice of governments not excepting those which in their constitution and ordinary conduct furnish the least matter for complaint  then it waswhen the people of spain were thus rouzed after this manner released from the natal burthen of that government which had bowed them to the ground in the free use of their understandings and in the play and noble rage of their passions while yet the new authorities which they had generated were truly living members of their body and as i have said organs of their life when that numerous people were in a stage of their journey which could not be accomplished without the spirit which was then prevalent in them and which as might be feared would too soon abate of itselfthen it was that wenot we but the heads of the british army and nationwhen if they could not breathe a favouring breath they ought at least to have stood at an awful distancestepped in with their forms their impediments their rotten customs and precedents their narrow desires their busy and purblind fears and called out to these aspiring travellers to haltfor ye are in a dream confounded them for it was the voice of a seeming friend that spoke and spellbound them as far as was possible by an instrument framed in the eclipse and sealed with curses darkin a word we had the power to act up to the most sacred letter of justiceand this at a time when the mandates of justice were of an affecting obligation such as had never before been witnessed and we plunged into the lowest depths of injusticewe had power to give a brotherly aid to our allies in supporting the mighty world which their shoulders had undertaken to uphold and while they were expecting from us this aid we underminedwithout forewarning themthe ground upon which they stood the evil is incalculable and the stain will cleave to the british name as long as the story of this island shall endure  did we not if from this comprehensive feeling of sorrow i may for a moment descend to particularsdid we not send forth a general one whom since his return court and parliament and army have been at strife with each other which shall most caress and applauda general who in defending the armistice which he himself had signed said in open court that he deemed that the french army was entitled to such terms the people of spain had through the supreme junta of seville thus spoken of this same army ye have among yourselves the objects of your vengeanceattack themthey are but a handful of miserable panicstruck men humiliated and conquered already by their perfidy and crueltiesresist and destroy them our united efforts will extirpate this perfidious nation the same spaniards had said speaking officially of the state of the whole peninsula and no doubt with their eye especially upon this army in portugalour enemies have taken up exactly those positions in which they may most easily be destroyedwhere then did the british general find this right and title of the french army in portugal because says he in military language it was not brokenof the man and of the understanding and heart of the manof the citizen who could think and feel after this manner in such circumstances it is needless to speak but to the general i will say this is most pitiable pedantry if the instinctive wisdom of your ally could not be understood you might at least have remembered the resolute policy of your enemy the french army was not broken break it thenwither itpursue it with unrelenting warfarehunt it out of its holdsif impetuosity be not justifiable have recourse to patienceto watchfulnessto obstinacy at all events never for a moment forget who the foe isand that he is in your power this is the example which the french ruler and his generals have given you at ulmat lubeckin switzerlandover the whole plain of prussiaevery whereand this for the worst deeds of darkness while yours was the noblest service of light  this remonstrance has been forced from me by indignationlet me explain in what sense i propose with calmer thought that the example of our enemy should be imitatedthe laws and customs of war and the maxims of policy have all had their foundation in reason and humanity and their object has been the attainment or security of some real or supposedsome positive or relativegood they are established among men as ready guides for the understanding and authorities to which the passions are taught to pay deference but the relations of things to each other are perpetually changing and in course of time many of these leaders and masters by losing part of their power to do service and sometimes the whole forfeit in proportion their right to obedience accordingly they are disregarded in some instances and sink insensibly into neglect with the general improvement of society but they often survive when they have become an oppression and a hindrance which cannot be cast off decisively but by an impulserising either from the absolute knowledge of good and great menor from the partial insight which is given to superior minds though of a vitiated moral constitutionor lastly from that blind energy and those habits of daring which are often found in men who checked by no restraint of morality suffer their evil passions to gain extraordinary strength in extraordinary circumstances by any of these forces may the tyranny be broken through we have seen in the conduct of our countrymen to what degree it tempts to weak actionsand furnishes excuse for them admitted by those who sit as judges i wish then that we could so far imitate our enemies as like them to shake off these bonds but not like them from the worstbut from the worthiest impulse if this were done we should have learned how much of their practice would harmonize with justice have learned to distinguish between those rules which ought to be wholly abandoned and those which deserve to be retained and should have known when and to what point they ought to be trustedbut how is this to be power of mind is wanting where there is power of place even we cannot as a beginning of a new journey force or win our way into the current of success the flattering motion of which would awaken intellectual couragethe only substitute which is able to perform any arduous part of the secondary work of heroic wisdomi mean execute happily any of its prudential regulations in the person of our enemy and his chieftains we have living example how wicked men of ordinary talents are emboldened by success there is a kindliness as they feel in the nature of advancement and prosperity is their genius but let us know and remember that this prosperity with all the terrible features which it has gradually assumed is a child of noble parentsliberty and philanthropic love perverted as the creature is which it has grown up to rather into which it has passedfrom no inferior stock could it have issued it is the fallen spirit triumphant in misdeeds which was formerly a blessed angel  if then to return to ourselves there be such strong obstacles in the way of our drawing benefit either from the maxims of policy or the principles of justice what hope remains that the british nation should repair by its future conduct the injury which has been donewe cannot advance a step towards a rational answer to this questionwithout previously adverting to the original sources of our miscarriages which are thesefirst a want in the minds of the members of government and public functionaries of knowledge indispensible for this service and secondly a want of power in the same persons acting in their corporate capacities to give effect to the knowledge which individually they possessof the latter source of weaknessthis inability as caused by decay in the machine of government and by illegitimate forces which are checking and controuling its constitutional motionsi have not spoken nor shall i now speak for i have judged it best to suspend my task for a while and this subject being in its nature delicate ought not to be lightly or transiently touched besides no immediate effect can be expected from the soundest and most unexceptionable doctrines which might be laid down for the correcting of this evilthe former source of weaknessnamely the want of appropriate and indispensible knowledgehas in the past investigation been reached and shall be further laid open not without a hope of some result of immediate good by a direct application to the mind and in full confidence that the best and surest way to render operative that knowledge which is already possessedis to increase the stock of knowledge  here let me avow that i undertook this present labour as a serious duty rather that it was forced and has been unremittingly pressed upon me by a perception of justice united with strength of feelingin a word by that power of conscience calm or impassioned to which throughout i have done reverence as the animating spirit of the cause my work was begun and prosecuted under this controuland with the accompanying satisfaction that no charge of presumption could by a thinking mind be brought against me though i had taken upon myself to offer instruction to men who if they possess not talents and acquirements have no title to the high stations which they hold who also by holding those stations are understood to obtain certain benefit of experience and of knowledge not otherwise to be gained and who have a further claim to deferencefounded upon reputation even when it is spurious as much of the reputation of men high in power must necessarily be their errors being veiled and palliated by the authority attached to their office while that same authority gives more than due weight and effect to their wiser opinions yet notwithstanding all this i did not fear the censure of having unbecomingly obtruded counsels or remonstrances for there can be no presumption upon a call so affecting as the present in an attempt to assert the sanctity and to display the efficacy of principles and passions which are the natural birthright of man to some share of which all are born but an inheritance which may be alienated or consumed and by none more readily and assuredly than by those who are most eager for the praise of policy of prudence of sagacity and of all those qualities which are the darling virtues of the worldlywise moreover the evidence to which i have made appeal in order to establish the truth is not locked up in cabinets but is accessible to all as it exists in the bosoms of menin the appearances and intercourse of daily lifein the details of passing eventsand in general history and more especially is its right import within the reach of him whotaking no part in public measures and having no concern in the changes of things but as they affect what is most precious in his country and humanitywill doubtless be more alive to those genuine sensations which are the materials of sound judgment nor is it to be overlooked that such a man may have more leisure and probably will have a stronger inclination to communicate with the records of past ages  deeming myself justified then in what has been saidi will continue to lay open and in some degree to account for those privations in the materials of judgment and those delusions of opinion and infirmities of mind to which practical statesmen and particularly such as are high in office are more than other men subjectas containing an answer to that question so interesting at this juncturehow far is it in our power to make amends for the harm done  after the view of things which has been takenwe may confidently affirm that nothing but a knowledge of human nature directing the operations of our government can give it a right to an intimate association with a cause which is that of human nature i say an intimate association founded on the right of thorough knowledgeto contradistinguish this best mode of exertion from another which might found its right upon a vast and commanding military power put forth with manifestation of sincere intentions to benefit our alliesfrom a conviction merely of policy that their liberty independence and honour are our genuine gainto distinguish the pure brotherly connection from this other in its appearance at least more magisterial which such a power guided by such intention uniformly displayed might authorize but of the former connection which supposes the main military effort to be made even at present by the people of the peninsula on whom the moral interest more closely presses and of the knowledge which it demands i have hitherto spokenand have further to speak  it is plain à priori that the minds of statesmen and courtiers are unfavourable to the growth of this knowledge for they are in a situation exclusive and artificial which has the further disadvantage that it does not separate men from men by collateral partitions which leave along with difference a sense of equalitythat they who are divided are yet upon the same level but by a degree of superiority which can scarcely fail to be accompanied with more or less of pride this situation therefore must be eminently unfavourable for the reception and establishment of that knowledge which is founded not upon things but upon sensationssensations which are general and under general influences and this it is which makes them what they are and gives them their importancenot upon things which may be brought but upon sensations which must be met passing by the kindred and usually accompanying influence of birth in a certain rankand where education has been predefined from childhood for the express purpose of future political power the tendency of such education to warp and therefore weaken the intellectwe may join at once with the privation which i have been noticing a delusion equally common it is this that practical statesmen assume too much credit to themselves for their ability to see into the motives and manage the selfish passions of their immediate agents and dependants and for the skill with which they baffle or resist the aims of their opponents a promptness in looking through the most superficial part of the characters of those menwho by the very circumstance of their contending ambitiously for the rewards and honours of government are separated from the mass of the society to which they belongis mistaken for a knowledge of human kind hence where higher knowledge is a prime requisite they not only are unfurnished but being unconscious that they are so they look down contemptuously upon those who endeavour to supply in some degree their wantthe instincts of natural and social man the deeper emotions the simpler feelings the spacious range of the disinterested imagination the pride in country for countrys sake when to serve has not been a formal professionand the mind is therefore left in a state of dignity only to be surpassed by having served nobly and generously the instantaneous accomplishment in which they start up who upon a searching call stir for the land which they lovenot from personal motives but for a reward which is undefined and cannot be missed the solemn fraternity which a great nation composesgathered together in a stormy season under the shade of ancestral feeling the delicacy of moral honour which pervades the minds of a people when despair has been suddenly thrown off and expectations are lofty the apprehensiveness to a touch unkindly or irreverent where sympathy is at once exacted as a tribute and welcomed as a gift the power of injustice and inordinate calamity to transmute to invigorate and to governto sweep away the barriers of opinionto reduce under submission passions purely evilto exalt the nature of indifferent qualities and to render them fit companions for the absolute virtues with which they are summoned to associateto consecrate passions which if not bad in themselves are of such temper that in the calm of ordinary life they are rightly deemed soto correct and embody these passionsand without weakening them nay with tenfold addition to their strength to make them worthy of taking their place as the advanced guard of hope when a sublime movement of deliverance is to be originatedthese arrangements and resources of nature these ways and means of society have so little connection with those others upon which a ruling minister of a longestablished government is accustomed to depend theseelements as it were of a universe functions of a living bodyare so opposite in their mode of action to the formal machine which it has been his pride to managethat he has but a faint perception of their immediate efficacy knows not the facility with which they assimilate with other powers nor the property by which such of themas from necessity of nature must change or pass awaywill under wise and fearless management surely generate lawful successors to fill their place when their appropriate work is performed nay of the majority of men who are usually found in high stations under old governments it may without injustice be said that when they look about them in times alas too rare which present the glorious product of such agency to their eyes they have not a right to saywith a dejected man in the midst of the woods the rivers the mountains the sunshine and shadows of some transcendant landscape       i see not feel how beautiful they are  these spectators neither see nor feel and it is from the blindness and insensibility of these and the train whom they draw along with them that the throes of nations have been so ill recompensed by the births which have followed and that revolutions after passing from crime to crime and from sorrow to sorrow have often ended in throwing back such heavy reproaches of delusiveness upon their first promises  i am satisfied that no enlightened patriot will impute to me a wish to disparage the characters of men high in authority or to detract from the estimation which is fairly due to them my purpose is to guard against unreasonable expectations that specific knowledgethe paramount importance of which in the present condition of europe i am insisting uponthey who usually fill places of high trust in old governments neither donor for the most part canpossess nor is it necessary for the administration of affairs in ordinary circumstances that they shouldthe progress of their own country and of the other nations of the world in civilization in true refinement in science in religion in morals and in all the real wealth of humanity might indeed be quicker and might correspond more happily with the wishes of the benevolentif governors better understood the rudiments of nature as studied in the walks of common life if they were men who had themselves felt every strong emotion inspired by nature and by fortune taught and could calculate upon the force of the grander passions yet at the same time there is temptation in this to know may seduce and to have been agitated may compel arduous cares are attractive for their own sakes great talents are naturally driven towards hazard and difficulty as it is there that they are most sure to find their exercise and their evidence and joy in anticipated triumphthe liveliest of all sensations moreover magnificent desires when least under the bias of personal feeling dispose the mindmore than itself is conscious ofto regard commotion with complacency and to watch the aggravations of distress with welcoming from an immoderate confidence that when the appointed day shall come it will be in the power of intellect to relieve there is danger in being a zealot in any causenot excepting that of humanity nor is it to be forgotten that the incapacity and ignorance of the regular agents of longestablished governments do not prevent some progress in the dearest concerns of men and that society may owe to these very deficiencies and to the tame and unenterprizing course which they necessitate much security and tranquil enjoyment  nor on the other hand for reasons which may be added to those already given is it so desirable as might at first sight be imagined much less is it desirable as an absolute good that men of comprehensive sensibility and tutored geniuseither for the interests of mankind or for their ownshould in ordinary times have vested in them political power the empire which they hold is more independent its constituent parts are sustained by a stricter connection the dominion is purer and of higher origin as mind is more excellent than bodythe search of truth an employment more inherently dignified than the application of forcethe determinations of nature more venerable than the accidents of human institution chance and disorder vexation and disappointment malignity and perverseness within or without the mind are a sad exchange for the steady and genial processes of reason moreover worldly distinctions and offices of command do not lie in the pathnor are they any part of the appropriate retinueof philosophy and virtue nothing but a strong spirit of love can counteract the consciousness of preeminence which ever attends preeminent intellectual power with correspondent attainments and this spirit of love is best encouraged by humility and simplicity in mind manners and conduct of life virtues to which wisdom leads butthough these be virtues in a man a citizen or a sagethey cannot be recommended to the especial culture of the political or military functionary and still less of the civil magistrate him in the exercise of his functions it will often become to carry himself highly and with state in order that evil may be suppressed and authority respected by those who have not understanding the power also of office whether the duties be discharged well or ill will ensure a neverfailing supply of flattery and praise and of thesea man becoming at once doubledealer and dupe may without impeachment of his modesty receive as much as his weakness inclines him to under the shew that the homage is not offered up to himself but to that portion of the public dignity which is lodged in his person but whatever may be the cause the fact is certainthat there is an unconquerable tendency in all power save that of knowledge acting by and through knowledge to injure the mind of him who exercises that power so much so that best natures cannot escape the evil of such alliance nor is it less certain that things of soundest quality issuing through a medium to which they have only an arbitrary relation are vitiated and it is inevitable that there should be a reäscent of unkindly influence to the heart of him from whom the gift thus unfairly dealt with proceededin illustration of these remarks as connected with the management of states we need only refer to the empire of chinawhere superior endowments of mind and acquisitions of learning are the sole acknowledged title to offices of great trust and yet in no country is the government more bigotted or intolerant or society less progressive  to prevent misconception and to silence at least to throw discredit upon the clamours of ignorancei have thought proper thus in some sort to strike a balance between the claims of men of routineand men of original and accomplished mindsto the management of state affairs in ordinary circumstances but ours is not an age of this character andafter having seen such a long series of misconduct so many unjustifiable attempts made and sometimes carried into effect good endeavours frustrated disinterested wishes thwarted and benevolent hopes disappointedit is reasonable that we should endeavour to ascertain to what cause these evils are to be ascribed i have directed the attention of the reader to one primary cause and can he doubt of its existence and of the operation which i have attributed to it  in the course of the last thirty years we have seen two wars waged against libertythe american war and the war against the french people in the early stages of their revolution in the latter instance the emigrants and the continental powers and the british did in all their expectations and in every movement of their efforts manifest a common ignoranceoriginating in the same source and for what more especially belongs to ourselves at this time we may affirmthat the same presumptuous irreverence of the principles of justice and blank insensibility to the affections of human nature which determined the conduct of our government in those two wars against liberty have continued to accompany its exertions in the present struggle for libertyand have rendered them fruitless the british government deems no doubt on its own part that its intentions are good it must not deceive itself nor must we deceive ourselves intentionsthoroughly goodcould not mingle with the unblessed actions which we have witnessed a disinterested and pure intention is a light that guides as well as cheers and renders desperate lapses impossible  our duty isour aim ought to beto employ the true means of liberty and virtue for the ends of liberty and virtue in such policy thoroughly understood there is fitness and concord and rational subordination it deserves a higher nameorganization health and grandeur contrast in a single instance the two processes and the qualifications which they require the ministers of that period found it an easy task to hire a band of hessians and to send it across the atlantic that they might assist in bringing the americans according to the phrase then prevalent to reason the force with which these troops would attack was grosstangibleand might be calculated but the spirit of resistance which their presence would create was subtleetherealmightyand incalculable accordingly from the moment when these foreigners landedmen who had no interest no business in the quarrel but what the wages of their master bound him to and he imposed upon his miserable slavesnay from the first rumour of their destination the success of the british was as hath since been affirmed by judicious americans impossible  the british government of the present day have been seduced as we have seen by the same commonplace facilities on the one side and have been equally blind on the other a physical auxiliar force of thirtyfive thousand men is to be added to the army of spain but the moral energy which thereby might be taken away from the principal is overlooked or slighted the material being too fine for their calculation what does it avail to graft a bough upon a tree if this be done so ignorantly and rashly that the trunk which can alone supply the sap by which the whole must flourish receives a deadly wound palpable effects of the convention of cintra and selfcontradicting consequences even in the matter especially aimed at may be seen in the necessity which it entailed of leaving 8000 british troops to protect portugueze traitors from punishment by the laws of their country a still more serious and fatal contradiction lies in thisthat the english army was made an instrument of injustice and was dishonoured in order that it might be hurried forward to uphold a cause which could have no life but by justice and honour the nation knows how that army languished in the heart of spain that it accomplished nothing except its retreat is sure what great service it might have performed if it had moved from a different impulse we have shewn  it surely then behoves those who are in authorityto look to the state of their own minds there is indeed an inherent impossibility that they should be equal to the arduous duties which have devolved upon them but it is not unreasonable to hope that something higher might be aimed at and that the people might see upon great occasionsin the practice of its rulersa more adequate reflection of its own wisdom and virtue our rulers i repeat must begin with their own minds this is a precept of immediate urgency and if attended to might be productive of immediate good i will follow it with further conclusions directly referring to future conduct  i will not suppose that any ministry of this country can be so abject so insensible and unwise as to abandon the spaniards and portugueze while there is a patriot in arms or if the people should for a time be subjugated to deny them assistance the moment they rise to require it again i cannot think so unfavourably of my country as to suppose this possible let men in power however take care and let the nation be equally careful not to receive any reports from our armyof the disposition of the spanish peoplewithout mistrust the british generals who were in portugal the whole body of them21 according to the statement of sir hew dalrymple approved of the convention of cintra and have thereby shewn that their communications are not to be relied upon in this case and indeed there is not any information which we can receive upon this subject that is so little trustworthy as that which comes from our armyor from any part of it the opportunities of notice afforded to soldiers in actual service must necessarily be very limited and a thousand things stand in the way of their power to make a right use of these but a retreating army in the country of an allyharrassed and dissatisfied willing to find a reason for its failures in any thing but itself and actually not without much solid ground for complaint retreating sometimes perhaps fugitive and in its disorder tempted and even forced to commit offences upon the people of the district through which it passes while they in their turn are filled with fear and inconsiderate angeran army in such a condition must needs be incapable of seeing objects as they really are and at the same time all things must change in its presence and put on their most unfavourable appearances  21 from this number however must be excepted the gallant and patriotic general ferguson for that officer has had the virtue publicly and in the most emphatic manner upon two occasions to reprobate the whole transaction  deeming it then not to be doubted that the british government will continue its endeavours to support its allies one or other of two maxims of policy follows obviously from the painful truths which we have been consideringeither first that we should put forth to the utmost our strength as a military powerstrain it to the very last point and prepare no erect mind will start at the proposition to pour into the peninsula a force of two hundred thousand men or moreand make ourselves for a time upon spanish ground principals in the contest or secondly that we should direct our attention to giving support rather in things than in men  the former plan though requiring a great effort and many sacrifices is i have no doubt practicable its difficulties would yield to a bold and energetic ministry in despite of the present constitution of parliament the militia if they had been called upon at the beginning of the rising in the peninsula would i believealmost to a manhave offered their services so would many of the volunteers in their individual capacity they would do so still the advantages of this plan would bethat the power which would attend it must if judiciously directed insure unity of effort taming down by its dignity the discords which usually prevail among allied armies and subordinating to itself the affections of the spanish and portugueze by the palpable service which it was rendering to their country a further encouragement for adopting this plan he will find who perceives that the military power of our enemy is not in substance so formidable by manymany degrees of terror as outwardly it appears to be the last campaign has not been wholly without advantage since it has proved that the french troops are indebted for their victories to the imbecility of their opponents far more than to their own discipline or courageor even to the skill and talents of their generals there is a superstition hanging over us which the efforts of our army not to speak of the spaniards have i hope removedbut their mighty numbersin that is a delusion of another kind in the former instance year after year we imagined things to be what they were not and in this by a more fatal and more common delusion the thought of what things really areprecludes the thought of what in a moment they may become the mind overlaid by the present cannot lift itself to attain a glimpse of the future  allwhich is comparatively inherent or can lay claim to any degree of permanence in the tyranny which the french nation maintains over europerests upon two foundationsfirst upon the despotic rule which has been established in france over a powerful people who have lately passed from a state of revolution in which they supported a struggle begun for domestic liberty and long continued for liberty and national independenceand secondly upon the personal character of the man by whom that rule is exercised  as to the former every one knows that despotism in a general sense is but another word for weakness let one generation disappear and a people over whom such rule has been extended if it have not virtue to free itself is condemned to embarrassment in the operations of its government and to perpetual languor with no better hope than that which may spring from the diseased activity of some particular prince on whom the authority may happen to devolve this if it takes a regular hereditary course butif the succession be interrupted and the supreme power frequently usurped or given by electionworse evils follow science and art must dwindle whether the power be hereditary or not and the virtues of a trajan or an antonine are a hollow support for the feeling of contentment and happiness in the hearts of their subjects such virtues are even a painful mockerysomething that is and may vanish in a moment and leave the monstrous crimes of a caracalla or a domitian in its placemen who are probably leaders of a long procession of their kind the feebleness of despotic power we have had before our eyes in the late condition of spain and prussia and in that of france before the revolution and in the present condition of austria and russia but in a newborn arbitrary and military government especially if like that of france it have been immediately preceded by a popular constitution not only this weakness is not found but it possesses for the purposes of external annoyance a preternatural vigour many causes contribute to this we need only mention that fitnessreal or supposedbeing necessarily the chief and almost sole recommendation to offices of trust it is clear that such offices will in general be ably filled and their duties comparatively well executed and that from the conjunction of absolute civil and military authority in a single person there naturally follows promptness of decision concentration of effort rapidity of motion and confidence that the movements made will be regularly supported this is all which need now be said upon the subject of this first basis of french tyranny  for the secondnamely the personal character of the chief i shall at present content myself with noting to prevent misconception that this basis is not laid in any superiority of talents in him but in his utter rejection of the restraints of moralityin wickedness which acknowledges no limit but the extent of its own power let any one reflect a moment and he will feel that a new world of forces is opened to a being who has made this desperate leap it is a tremendous principle to be adopted and steadily adhered to by a man in the station which buonaparte occupies and he has taken the full benefit of it what there is in this principle of weak perilous and selfdestructivei may find a grateful employment in endeavouring to shew upon some future occasion but it is a duty which we owe to the present moment to proclaimin vindication of the dignity of human nature and for an admonition to men of prostrate spiritthat the dominion which this enemy of mankind holds has neither been acquired nor is sustained by endowments of intellect which are rarely bestowed or by uncommon accumulations of knowledge but that it has risen from circumstances over which he had no influence circumstances which with the power they conferred have stimulated passions whose natural food hath been and is ignorance from the barbarian impotence and insolence of a mindoriginally of ordinary constitutionlagging in moral sentiment and knowledge three hundred years behind the age in which it acts in such manner did the power originate and by the forces which i have described is it maintained this should be declared and it should be addedthat the crimes of buonaparte are more to be abhorred than those of other denaturalized creatures whose actions are painted in history because the author of those crimes is guilty with less temptation and sins in the presence of a clearer light  no doubt in the command of almost the whole military force of europe the subject which called upon me to make these distinctions he has at this moment a third source of power which may be added to these two he himself rates this last so higheither is or affects to be so persuaded of its preeminencethat he boldly announces to the world that it is madness and even impiety to resist him and sorry may we be to remember that there are british senators who if a judgement may be formed from the language which they speak are inclined to accompany him far in this opinion but the enormity of this power has in it nothing inherent or permanent two signal overthrows in pitched battles would i believe go far to destroy it germans dutch italians swiss poles would desert the army of buonaparte and flock to the standard of his adversaries from the moment they could look towards it with that confidence which one or two conspicuous victories would inspire a regiment of 900 swiss joined the british army in portugal and if the french had been compelled to surrender as prisoners of war we should have seen that all those troops who were not native frenchmen would if encouragement had been given have joined the british and the opportunity that was lost of demonstrating this factwas not among the least of the mischiefs which attended the termination of the campaignin a word the vastness of buonapartes military power is formidablenot because it is impossible to break it but because it has not yet been penetrated in this respect it may not inaptly be compared to a huge pineforest such as are found in the northern parts of this island whose ability to resist the storms is in its skirts let but the blast once make an inroad and it levels the forest and sweeps it away at pleasure a hundred thousand men such as fought at vimiera and corunna would accomplish three such victories as i have been anticipating this nation might command a military force which would drive the french out of the peninsula i do not say that we could sustain there a military force which would prevent their reentering but that we could transplant thither by a great effort one which would expel themthis i maintain and it is matter of thought in which infirm minds may find both reproach and instruction the spaniards could then take possession of their own fortresses and have leisure to give themselves a blended civil and military organization complete and animated by liberty which if once accomplished they would be able to protect themselves the oppressed continental powers also seeing such unquestionable proof that great britain was sincere and earnest would lift their heads again and by so doing would lighten the burthen of war which might remain for the spaniards  in treating of this plani have presumed that a general might be placed at the head of this great military power who would not sign a treaty like that of the convention of cintra and say look at the proceedings of the board of inquiry that he was determined to this by british interests or frame any treaty in the country of an ally save one purely military for the honourable preservation if necessary of his own army or part of it to which the sole or even the main inducement wasour interests contradistinguished from those of that allya general and a ministry whose policy would be comprehensive enough to perceive that the true welfare of britain is best promoted by the independence freedom and honour of other nations and that it is only by the diffusion and prevalence of these virtues that french tyranny can be ultimately reduced or the influence of france over the rest of europe brought within its natural and reasonable limits  if this attempt be above the strain and temper of the country there remains only a plan laid down upon the other principles namely service as far as is required in things rather than in men that is men being secondary to things it is not i fear possible that the moral sentiments of the british army or government should accord with those of spain in her present condition commanding power indeed as hath been said put forth in the repulse of the common enemy would tend more effectually than any thing save the prevalence of true wisdom to prevent disagreement and to obviate any temporary injury which the moral spirit of the spaniards might receive from us at all eventssuch power should there ensue any injury would bring a solid compensation but from a middle coursean association sufficiently intimate and wide to scatter every where unkindly passions and yet unable to attain the salutary point of decisive powerno good is to be expected great would be the evil at this momentous period if the hatred of the spaniards should look two ways let it be as steadily fixed upon the french as the pilots eye upon his mark military stores and arms should be furnished with unfailing liberality let troops also be supplied but let these act separatelytaking strong positions upon the coast if such can be found to employ twice their numbers of the enemy and above all let there be floating armieskeeping the enemy in constant uncertainty where he is to be attacked the peninsula frame of spain and portugal lays that region open to the full shock of british warfare our fleet and army should act wherever it is possible as parts of one bodya right hand and a left and the enemy ought to be made to feel the force of both  butwhatever plans be adoptedthere can be no success unless the execution be entrusted to generals of competent judgement that the british army swarms with those who are incompetentis too plain from successive proofs in the transactions at buenos ayres at cintra and in the result of the board of inquirynor must we see a general appointed to commandand required at the same time to frame his operations according to the opinion of an inferior officer an injunction for a recommendation from such a quarter amounts to an injunction implying that a man had been appointed to a high stationof which the very persons who had appointed him deemed him unworthy else they must have known that he would endeavour to profit by the experience of any of his inferior officers from the suggestions of his own understanding at the same timeby denying to the generalinchief the free use of his own judgement and by the act of announcing this presumption of his incompetence to the man himselfsuch an indignity is put upon him that his passions must of necessity be rouzed so as to leave it scarcely possible that he could draw any benefit which he might otherwise have drawn from the local knowledge or talents of the individual to whom he was referred and lastly this injunction virtually involves a subversion of all military subordination in the better times of the house of commonsa minister who had presumed to write such a letter as that to which i allude would have been impeached  the debates in parliament and measures of government every day furnish new proofs of the truths which i have been attempting to establishof the utter want of general principlesnew and lamentable proofs this moment while i am drawing towards a conclusion i learn from the newspaper reports that the house of commons has refused to declare that the convention of centra disappointed the hopes and expectations of the nation  the motion according to the letter of it was illframed for the convention might have been a very good one and still have disappointed the hopes and expectations of the nationas those might have been unwise at all events the words ought to have stoodthe just and reasonable hopes of the nation but the hacknied phrase of disappointed hopes and expectationsshould not have been used at all it is a centre round which much delusion has gathered the convention not only did not satisfy the nations hopes of good but sunk it into a pitfall of unimagined and unimaginable evil the hearts and understandings of the people tell them that the language of a proposed parliamentary resolution upon this occasion oughtnot only to have been different in the letterbut also widely different in the spirit and the reader of these pages will have deduced that no terms of reprobation could in severity exceed the offences involved inand connected withthat instrument but while the grand keep of the castle of iniquity was to be stormed we have seen nothing but a puny assault upon heaps of the scattered rubbish of the fortress nay for the most part on some accidental molehills at its base i do not speak thus in disrespect to the right hon gentleman who headed this attack his mind left to itself would i doubt not have prompted something worthier and higher but he moves in the phalanx of partya spiritual body in which by strange inconsistency the hampering weakening and destroying of every individual mind of which it is composedis the law which must constitute the strength of the whole the question waswhether principles affecting the very existence of society had not been violated and an arm lifted and let fall which struck at the root of honour with the aggravation of the crime having been committed at this momentous period but what relation is there between these principles and actions and being in place or out of it if the people would constitutionally and resolutely assert their rights their representatives would be taught another lesson and for their own profit their understandings would be enriched accordingly for it is therethere where least suspectedthat the want from which this country suffers chiefly lies they err who suppose that venality and corruption though now spreading more and more are the masterevils of this day neither these nor immoderate craving for power are so much to be deprecated as the nonexistence of a widelyranging intellect of an intellect which if not efficacious to infuse truth as a vital fluid into the heart might at least make it a powerful tool in the hand outward professionwhich for practical purposes is an act of most desirable subserviencewould then wait upon those objects to which inward reverence though not felt was known to be due schemes of ample reach and true benefit would also promise best to insure the rewards coveted by personal ambition and men of baser passions finding it their interest would naturally combine to perform useful service under the direction of strong minds while men of good intentions would have their own pure satisfaction and would exert themselves with more uprighti mean more hopefulcheerfulness and more successfully it is not therefore inordinate desire of wealth or power which is so injuriousas the means which are and must be employed in the present intellectual condition of the legislature to sustain and secure that power these are at once an effect of barrenness and a cause acting and mutually reacting incessantly an enlightened friend has in conversation observed to the author of these pagesthat formerly the principles of men wore better than they who held them but that now a far worse evil men are better than their principles i believe itof the deplorable quality and state of principles the public proceedings in our country furnish daily new proof it is however some consolation at this present crisis to findthat of the thoughts and feelings uttered during the two debates which led me to these painful declarations suchas approach towards truth which has any dignity in itcome from the side of his majestys ministersbut note again those contradictions to which i have so often been obliged to advert the ministers advise his majesty publicly to express sentiments of disapprobation upon the convention of cintra and when the question of the merits or demerits of this instrument comes before them in parliament the same personswho as advisers of the crown lately condemned the treatynow in their character of representatives of the people by the manner in which they received this motion have pronounced an encomium upon it for though as i have said the motion was inaccurately and inadequately worded it was not set aside upon this ground and the parliament has therefore persisted in withholding from the insulted and injured people and from their allies the only reparation which perhaps it may be in its power to grant has refused to signify its repentance and sorrow for what hath been done without which as a previous step there can be no proofno gratifying intimation even to this country or to its allies that the future efforts of the british parliament are in a sincere spirit the guilt of the transaction therefore being neither repented of nor atoned for the course of evil is by necessity persevered inbut let us turn to a brighter region  the events of the last year gloriously destroying many frail fears have placedin the rank of serene and immortal truthsa proposition which as an object of belief hath in all ages been fondly cherished namelythat a numerous nation determined to be free may effect its purpose in despite of the mightiest power which a foreign invader can bring against it these events also have pointed out how in the ways of nature and under the guidance of society this happy end is to be attained in other words they have shewn that the cause of the people in dangers and difficulties issuing from this quarter of oppression is safe while it remains not only in the bosom but in the hands of the people or what amounts to the same thing in those of a government which being truly from the people is faithfully for them while the power remained with the provincial juntas that is with the body natural of the community for those authorities newly generated in such adversity were truly living members of that body every thing prospered in spain hopes of the best kind were opened out and encouraged liberal opinions countenanced and wise measures arranged and last and except as proceeding from these least of allvictories in the field in the streets of the city and upon the walls of the fortress  i have heretofore styled it a blessing that the spanish people became their own masters at once it was a blessing but not without much alloy as the same disinterested generous passions which preserved and would for a season still have preserved them from a bad exercise of their power impelled them to part with it too soon before labours hitherto neither tried nor thought of had created throughout the country the minor excellences indispensible for the performance of those labours before powerful minds not hitherto of general note had found time to shew themselves and before men who were previously known had undergone the proof of new situations much therefore was wanting to direct the general judgement in the choice of persons when the second delegation took place which was a removal the first we have seen had not been so of the power from the people but when a common centre became absolutely necessary the power ought to have passed from the provincial assemblies into the hands of the cortes and into none else a pernicious oligarchy crept into the place of this comprehensivethis constitutionalthis saving and majestic assembly far be it from me to speak of the supreme junta with illadvised condemnation every man must feel for the distressful trials to which that body has been exposed but eighty men or a hundred with a king at their head veiled under a cloud of fiction we might say with reference to the difficulties of this moment begotten upon a cloud of fiction could not be an image of a nation like that of spain or an adequate instrument of their power for their ends the assembly from the smallness of its numbers must have wanted breadth of wing to extend itself and brood over spain with a quickening touch of warmth every where if also as hath been mentioned there was a want of experience to determine the judgment in choice of persons this same smallness of numbers must have unnecessarily increased the evilby excluding many men of worth and talents which were so far known and allowed as that they would surely have been deputed to an assembly upon a larger scale gratitude habit and numerous other causes must have given an undue preponderance to birth station rank and fortune and have fixed the election more than was reasonable upon those who were most conspicuous for these distinctionsmen whose very virtue would incline them superstitiously to respect established things and to mistrust the peopletowards whom not only a frank confidence but a forward generosity was the first of duties i speak not of the vices to which such men would be liable brought up under the discipline of a government administered like the old monarchy of spain the matter is both ungracious and too obvious  but i began with hope and hope has inwardly accompanied me to the end the whole course of the campaign rightly interpreted has justified my hope in madrid in ferrol in corunna in every considerable place and in every part of the country over which the french have reextended their dominionwe learn from their own reports that the body of the people have shewed against them to the last the most determined hostility hence it is clear that the lure which the invading usurper found himself constrained lately to hold out to the inferior orders of society in the shape of various immunities has totally failed and therefore he turns for support to another quarter and now attempts to cajole the wealthy and the privileged but this class has been taught by late decrees what it has to expect from him and how far he is to be confidedin for its especial interests many individuals no doubt he will seduce but the bulk of the class even if they could be insensible to more liberal feelings cannot but be his enemies this change therefore is not merely shifting ground but retiring to a position which he himself has previously undermined here is confusion and a power warring against itself  so will it ever fare with foreign tyrants when in spite of domestic abuses a people which has lived long feels that it has a country to love and where the heart of that people is sound between the native inhabitants of france and spain there has existed from the earliest period and still does exist an universal and utter dissimilitude in laws actions deportment gait manners customs join with this the difference in the language and the barrier of the pyrenees a separation and an opposition in great things and an antipathy in small ignorant then must he be of history and of the reports of travellers and residents in the two countries or strangely inattentive to the constitution of human nature who this being true can admit the belief that the spaniards numerous and powerful as they are will live under frenchmen as their lords and masters let there be added to this inherent mutual repulsivenessthose recent indignities and horrible outrages and we need not fear to say that such reconcilement is impossible even without that further insuperable obstacle which we hope will exist an establishment of a free constitution in spainthe intoxicated setterup of kings may fill his diary with pompous stories of the acclamations with which his solemn puppets are received he may stuff their mouths with impious asseverations and hire knees to bend before them and lips to answer with honied greetings of gratitude and love these cannot remove the old heart and put a new one into the bosom of the spectators the whole is a pageant seen for a day among men in its passage to that limbo large and broad whither as to their proper home fleet      all the unaccomplishd works of natures hand     abortive monstrous or unkindly mixd     dissolvd on earth  talk not of the perishable nature of enthusiasm and rise above a craving for perpetual manifestations of things he is to be pitied whose eye can only be pierced by the light of a meridian sun whose frame can only be warmed by the heat of midsummer let us hear no more of the little dependence to be had in war upon voluntary service the things with which we are primarily and mainly concerned are inward passions and not outward arrangements these latter may be given at any time when the parts to be put together are in readiness hatred and love and each in its intensity and pride passions which existing in the heart of a nation are inseparable from hopethese elements being in constant preparationenthusiasm will break out from them or coalesce with them upon the summons of a moment and these passions are scarcely less than inextinguishable the truth of this is recorded in the manners and hearts of north and south britons of englishmen and welshmen on either border of the tweed and of the esk on both sides of the severn and the dee an inscription legible and in strong characters which the tread of many and great blessings continued through hundreds of years has been unable to efface the sicilian vespers are to this day a familiar game among the boys of the villages on the sides of mount etna and through every corner of the island and exterminate the french is the action in their arms and the word of triumph upon their tongues he then is a sorry statist who desponds or despairs nor is he less so who is too much elevated from any considerations connected with the quality of enthusiasm nothing is so easy as to sustain it by partial and gradual changes of its object and by placing it in the way of receiving new interpositions according to the need the difficulty liesnot in kindling feeding or fanning the flame but in continuing so to regulate the relations of thingsthat the fanning breeze and the feeding fuel shall come from no unworthy quarter and shall neither of them be wanting in appropriate consecration the spaniards have as great helps towards ensuring this as ever were vouchsafed to a people  what then is to be desired nothing but that the government and the higher orders of society should deal sincerely towards the middle class and the lower i mean that the general temper should be sincereit is not required that every one should be disinterested or zealous or of one mind with his fellows selfishness or slackness in individuals and in certain bodies of men also and at times perhaps in all have their use else why should they exist due circumspection and necessary activity in those who are sound could not otherwise maintain themselves the deficiencies in one quarter are more than made up by consequent overflowings in another if my neighbour fails says the true patriot more devolves upon me discord and even treason are not in a country situated as spain is the pure evils which upon a superficial view they appear to be never are a people so livelily admonished of the love they bear their country and of the pride which they have in their common parent as when they hear of some parricidal attempt of a false brother for this cause chiefly in times of national danger are their fancies so busy in suspicion which under such shape though oftentimes producing dire and pitiable effects is notwithstanding in its general character no other than that habit which has grown out of the instinct of selfpreservationelevated into a wakeful and affectionate apprehension for the whole and ennobling its private and baser ways by the generous use to which they are converted nor ever has a good and loyal man such a swell of mind such a clear insight into the constitution of virtue and such a sublime sense of its power as at the first tidings of some atrocious act of perfidy when having taken the alarm for human nature a second thought recovers him and his faith returnsgladsome from what has been revealed within himself and awful from participation of the secrets in the profaner grove of humanity which that momentary blast laid open to his view  of the ultimate independence of the spanish nation there is no reason to doubt and for the immediate furtherance of the good cause and a throwingoff of the yoke upon the first favourable opportunity by the different tracts of the country upon which it has been reimposed nothing is wanting but sincerity on the part of the government towards the provinces which are yet free the first end to be secured by spain is riddance of the enemy the second permanent independence and the third a free constitution of government which will give their main though far from sole value to the other two and without which little more than a formal independence and perhaps scarcely that can be secured humanity and honour and justice and all the sacred feelings connected with atonement retribution and satisfaction shame that will not sleep and the sting of unperformed duty and all the powers of the mind the memory that broods over the dead and turns to the living the understanding the imagination and the reasondemand and enjoin that the wanton oppressor should be driven with confusion and dismay from the country which he has so heinously abused  this cannot be accomplished scarcely can it be aimed at without an accompanying and an inseparable resolution in the souls of the spaniards to be and remain their own masters that is to preserve themselves in the rank of men and not become as the brute that is driven to the pasture and cares not who owns him it is a common saying among those who profess to be lovers of civil liberty and give themselves some credit for understanding itthat if a nation be not free it is mere dust in the balance whether the slavery be bred at home or comes from abroad be of their own suffering or of a strangers imposing they see little of the underground part of the tree of liberty and know less of the nature of man who can think thus where indeed there is an indisputable and immeasurable superiority in one nation over another to be conquered may in course of time be a benefit to the inferior nation and upon this principle some of the conquests of the greeks and romans may be justified but in what of really useful or honourable are the french superior to their neighbours never far advanced and now barbarizing apace they may carryamongst the sober and dignified nations which surround themmuch to be avoided but little to be imitated  there is yet another case in which a people may be benefited by resignation or forfeiture of their rights as a separate independent state i mean whereof two contiguous or neighbouring countries both included by nature under one conspicuously defined limitthe weaker is united with or absorbed into the more powerful and one and the same government is extended over both this with clue patience and foresight may for the most part be amicably effected without the intervention of conquest buteven should a violent course have been resorted to and have proved successfulthe result will be matter of congratulation rather than of regret if the countries have been incorporated with an equitable participation of natural advantages and civil privileges who does not rejoice that former partitions have disappearedand that england scotland and wales are under one legislative and executive authority and that ireland would that she had been more justly dealt with follows the same destiny the large and numerous fiefs which interfered injuriously with the grand demarcation assigned by nature to france have long since been united and consolidated the several independent sovereignties of italy a country the boundary of which is still more expressly traced out by nature and which has no less the further definition and cement of country which language prepares have yet this good to aim at and it will be a happy day for europe when the natives of italy and the natives of germany whose duty is in like manner indicated to them shall each dissolve the pernicious barriers which divide them and form themselves into a mighty people but spain excepting a free union with portugal has no benefit of this kind to look for she has long since attained it the pyrenees on the one side and the sea on every other the vast extent and great resources of the territory a population numerous enough to defend itself against the whole world and capable of great increase language and long duration of independencepoint out and command that the two nations of the peninsula should be united in friendship and strict alliance and as soon as it may be effected without injustice form one independent and indissoluble sovereignty the peninsula cannot be protected but by itself it is too large a tree to be framed by nature for a station among underwoods it must have power to toss its branches in the wind and lift a bold forehead to the sun  allowing that the regni novitas should either compel or tempt the usurper to do away some ancient abuses and to accord certain insignificant privileges to the people upon the purlieus of the forest of freedom for assuredly he will never suffer them to enter the body of it allowing this and much more that the mass of the population would be placed in a condition outwardly more thrivingwould be better off as the phrase in conversation is it is still true thatin the act and consciousness of submission to an imposed lord and master to a will not growing out of themselves to the edicts of another people their triumphant enemythere would be the loss of a sensation within for which nothing external even though it should come close to the garden and the fieldto the door and the fireside can make amends the artisan and the merchant men of classes perhaps least attached to their native soil would not be insensible to this loss and the mariner in his thoughtful mood would sadden under it upon the wide ocean the central or cardinal feeling of these thoughts may at a future time furnish fit matter for the genius of some patriotic spaniard to express in his own noble languageas an inscription for the sword of francis the first if that sword which was so ingloriously and perfidiously surrendered should ever by the energies of liberty be recovered and deposited in its ancient habitation in the escurial the patriot will recollect thatif the memorial then given up by the hand of the government had also been abandoned by the heart of the people and that indignity patiently subscribed tohis country would have been lost for ever  there are multitudes by whom i know these sentiments will not be languidly received at this day and sure i amthat a hundred and fifty years ago they would have been ardently welcomed by all but in many parts of europe and especially in our own country men have been pressing forward for some time in a path which has betrayed by its fruitfulness furnishing them constant employment for picking up things about their feet when thoughts were perishing in their minds while mechanic arts manufactures agriculture commerce and all those products of knowledge which are confined to grossdefiniteand tangible objects have with the aid of experimental philosophy been every day putting on more brilliant colours the splendour of the imagination has been fading sensibility which was formerly a generous nursling of rude nature has been chased from its ancient range in the wide domain of patriotism and religion with the weapons of derision by a shadow calling itself good sense calculations of presumptuous expediencygroping its way among partial and temporary consequenceshave been substituted for the dictates of paramount and infallible conscience the supreme embracer of consequences lifeless and circumspect decencies have banished the graceful negligence and unsuspicious dignity of virtue  the progress of these arts also by furnishing such attractive stores of outward accommodation has misled the higher orders of society in their more disinterested exertions for the service of the lower animal comforts have been rejoiced over as if they were the end of being a neater and more fertile garden a greener field implements and utensils more apt a dwelling more commodious and better furnishedlet these be attained say the actively benevolent and we are sure not only of being in the right road but of having successfully terminated our journey now a country may advance for some time in this course with apparent profit these accommodations by zealous encouragement may be attained and still the peasant or artisan their master be a slave in mind a slave rendered even more abject by the very tenure under which these possessions are held andif they veil from us this fact or reconcile us to itthey are worse than worthless the springs of emotion may be relaxed or destroyed within him he may have little thought of the past and less interest in the futurethe great end and difficulty of life for men of all classes and especially difficult for those who live by manual labour is a union of peace with innocent and laudable animation not by bread alone is the life of man sustained not by raiment alone is he warmedbut by the genial and vernal inmate of the breast which at once pushes forth and cherishes by selfsupport and selfsufficing endeavours by anticipations apprehensions and active remembrances by elasticity under insult and firm resistance to injury by joy and by love by pride which his imagination gathers in from afar by patience because life wants not promises by admiration by gratitude whichdebasing him not when his fellowbeing is its objecthabitually expands itself for his elevation in complacency towards his creator  now to the existence of these blessings national independence is indispensible and many of them it will itself produce and maintain for it is some consolation to those who look back upon the history of the world to knowthat even without civil liberty society may possessdiffused through its inner recesses in the minds even of its humblest memberssomething of dignified enjoyment but without national independence this is impossible the difference between inbred oppression and that which is from without is essential inasmuch as the former does not exclude from the minds of a people the feeling of being selfgoverned does not imply as the latter does when patiently submitted to an abandonment of the first duty imposed by the faculty of reason in reality where this feeling has no place a people are not a society but a herd man being indeed distinguished among them from the brute but only to his disgrace i am aware that there are too many who think that to the bulk of the community this independence is of no value that it is a refinement with which they feel they have no concern inasmuch as under the best frame of government there is an inevitable dependence of the pool upon the richof the many upon the fewso unrelenting and imperious as to reduce this other by comparison into a force which has small influence and is entitled to no regard superadd civil liberty to national independence and this position is overthrown at once for there is no more certain mark of a sound frame of polity than this that in all individual instances and it is upon these generalized that this position is laid down the dependence is in reality far more strict on the side of the wealthy and the labouring man leans less upon others than any man in the communitybut the case before us is of a country not internally free yet supposed capable of repelling an external enemy who attempts its subjugation if a country have put on chains of its own forging in the name of virtue let it be conscious that to itself it is accountable let it not have cause to look beyond its own limits for reproof andin the name of humanityif it be selfdepressed let it have its pride and some hope within itself the poorest peasant in an unsubdued land feels this pride i do not appeal to the example of britain or of switzerland for the one is free and the other lately was free and i trust will ere long be so again but talk with the swede and you will see the joy he finds in these sensations with him animal courage the substitute for many and the friend of all the manly virtues has space to move in and is at once elevated by his imagination and softened by his affections it is invigorated also for the whole courage of his country is in his breast  in fact the peasant and he who lives by the fair reward of his manual labour has ordinarily a larger proportion of his gratifications dependent upon these thoughtsthan for the most part men in other classes have for he is in his person attached by stronger roots to the soil of which he is the growth his intellectual notices are generally confined within narrower bounds in him no partial or antipatriotic interests counteract the force of those nobler sympathies and antipathies which he has in right of his country and lastly the belt or girdle of his mind has never been stretched to utter relaxation by false philosophy under a conceit of making it sit more easily and gracefully these sensations are a social inheritance to him more important as he is precluded from luxuriousand those which are usually called refinedenjoyments  love and admiration must push themselves out towards some quarter otherwise the moral man is killed collaterally they advance with great vigour to a certain extentand they are checked in that direction limits hard to pass are perpetually encountered but upwards and downwards to ancestry and to posterity they meet with gladsome help and no obstacles the tract is interminableperdition to the tyrant who would wantonly cut off an independent nation from its inheritance in past ages turning the tombs and burialplaces of the forefathers into dreaded objects of sorrow or of shame and reproach for the children look upon scotland and wales though by the union of these with england under the same government which was effected without conquest in one instance ferocious and desolating wars and more injurious intrigues and sapping and disgraceful corruptions have been prevented and tranquillity security and prosperity and a thousand interchanges of amity not otherwise attainable have followedyet the flashing eye and the agitated voice and all the tender recollections with which the names of prince llewellin and william wallace are to this day pronounced by the fireside and on the public road attest that these substantial blessings have not been purchased without the relinquishment of something most salutary to the moral nature of man else the remembrances would not cleave so faithfully to their abidingplace in the human heart but if these affections be of general interest they are of especial interest to spain whose history written and traditional is preeminently stored with the sustaining food of such affections and in no country are they more justly and generally prized or more feelingly cherished  in the conduct of this argument i am not speaking to the humbler ranks of society it is unnecessary they trust in nature and are safe the people of madrid and corunna and ferrol resisted to the last from an impulse which in their hearts was its own justification the failure was with those who stood higher in the scale in fact the universal rising of the peninsula under the pressure and in the face of the most tremendous military power which ever existed is evidence which cannot be too much insisted upon and is decisive upon this subject as involving a question of virtue and moral sentiment all ranks were penetrated with one feeling instantaneous and universal was the acknowledgement if there have been since individual fallingsoff those have been caused by that kind of afterthoughts which are the bastard offspring of selfishness the matter was brought home to spain and no spaniard has offended herein with a still conscienceit is to the worldlings of our own country and to those who think without carrying their thoughts far enough that i address myself let them know there is no true wisdom without imagination no genuine sensethat the man who in this age feels no regret for the ruined honour of other nations must be poor in sympathy for the honour of his own country and that if he be wanting here towards that which circumscribes the whole he neither hasnor can havesocial regard for the lesser communities which country includes contract the circle and bring him to his family such a man cannot protect that with dignified loves reduce his thoughts to his own person he may defend himselfwhat he deems his honour but it is the action of a brave man from the impulse of the brute or the motive of a coward  but it is time to recollect that this vindication of human feeling began from an hypothesisthat the outward state of the mass of the spanish people would be improved by the french usurpation to this i now give an unqualified denial let me also observe to those men for whose infirmity this hypothesis was toleratedthat the true point of comparison does not lie between what the spaniards have been under a government of their own and what they may become under french domination but between what the spaniards may do and in all likelihood will do for themselves and what frenchmen would do for them butwaiving thisthe sweeping away of the most splendid monuments of art and rifling of the public treasuries in the conquered countries are an apt prologue to the tragedy which is to ensue strange that there are men who can be so besotted as to see in the decrees of the usurper concerning feudal tenures and a wornout inquisition any other evidence than that of insidiousness and of a constrained acknowledgement of the strength which he felt he had to overcome what avail the lessons of history if men can be duped thus boons and promises of this kind rank in trustworthiness many degrees lower than amnesties after expelled kings have recovered their thrones the fate of subjugated spain may be expressed in these wordspillagedepressionand helotismfor the supposed aggrandizement of the imaginary freeman its master there would indeed be attempts at encouragement that there might be a supply of something to pillage studied depression there would be that there might arise no power of resistance and lastly helotismbut of what kind that a vain and impious nation might have slaves worthier than itself for work which its own hands would reject with scorn  what good can the present arbitrary power confer upon france itself let that point be first settled by those who are inclined to look farther the earlier proceedings of the french revolution no doubt infused health into the country something of which survives to this day but let not the nowexisting tyranny have the credit of it france neither owes nor can owe to this any rational obligation she has seen decrees without end for the increase of commerce and manufactures pompous stories without number of harbours canals warehouses and bridges but there is no worse sign in the management of affairs than when that which ought to follow as an effect goes before under a vain notion that it will be a causelet us attend to the springs of action and we shall not be deceived the works of peace cannot flourish in a country governed by an intoxicated despot the motions of whose distorted benevolence must be still more pernicious than those of his cruelty i have bestowed i have created i have regenerated i have been pleased to organizethis is the language perpetually upon his lips when his illfated activities turn that way now commerce manufactures agriculture and all the peaceful arts are of the nature of virtues or intellectual powers they cannot be given they cannot be stuck in here and there they must spring up they must grow of themselves they may be encouraged they thrive better with encouragement and delight in it but the obligation must have bounds nicely defined for they are delicate proud and independent but a tyrant has no joy in any thing which is endued with such excellence he sickens at the sight of it he turns away from it as an insult to his own attributes we have seen the present ruler of france publicly addressed as a providence upon earth styled among innumerable other blasphemies the supreme ruler of things and heard him say in his answers that he approved of the language of those who thus saluted him see appendix eoh folly to think that plans of reason can prosper under such countenance if this be the doom of france what a monster would be the doubleheaded tyranny of spain  it is immutably ordained that power taken and exercised in contempt of right never can bring forth good wicked actions indeed have oftentimes happy issues the benevolent economy of nature counterworking and diverting evil and educing finally benefits from injuries and turning curses to blessings but i am speaking of good in a direct course all good in this orderall moral goodbegins and ends in reverence of right the whole spanish people are to be treated not as a mighty multitude with feeling will and judgment not as rational creaturesbut as objects without reason in the language of human law insuperably laid down not as persons but as things can good come from this beginning which in matter of civil government is the fountainhead and the main feeder of all the pure evil upon earth look at the past history of our sister island for the quality of foreign oppression turn where you will it is miserable at best but in the case of spainit might be said engraven upon the rocks of her own pyrenees      per me si va nella città dolente     per me si va nell eterno dolore     per me si va tra la perduta gente  so much i have thought it necessary to speak upon this subject with a desire to enlarge the views of the shortsighted to cheer the desponding and stimulate the remiss i have been treating of duties which the people of spain feel to be solemn and imperious and have referred to springs of action in the sensations of love and hatred of hope and fearfor promoting the fulfilment of these dutieswhich cannot fail the people of spain thus animated will move now and will be prepared to move upon a favourable summons for ages and it is consolatory to think thateven if many of the leading persons of that country in their resistance to france should not look beyond the two first objects viz riddance of the enemy and security of national independenceit is i say consolatory to think that the conduct which can alone secure either of these ends leads directly to a free internal government we have therefore both the passions and the reason of these men on our side in two stages of the common journey and when this is the case surely we are justified in expecting some further companionship and support from their reasonacting independent of their partial interests or in opposition to them it is obvious that to the narrow policy of this class men loyal to the nation and to the king yet jealous of the people the most dangerous failures which have hitherto taken place are to be attributed for though from acts of open treason spain may suffer and has suffered much these as i have proved can never affect the vitals of the cause but the march of liberty has begun and they who will not lead may be borne alongat all events the road is plain let members for the cortes be assembled from those provinces which are not in the possession of the invader or at least if circumstances render this impossible at present let it be announced that such is the intention to be realized the first moment when it shall become possible in the mean while speak boldly to the people and let the people write and speak boldly let the expectation be familiar to them of open and manly institutions of law and liberty according to knowledge let them be universally trained to military exercises and accustomed to military discipline let them be drawn together in civic and religious assemblies and a general communication of those assemblies with each other be established through the country so that there may be one zeal and one life in every part of it  with great profit might the chiefs of the spanish nation look back upon the earlier part of the french revolution much in the outward manner might there be found worthy of qualified imitation and where there is a difference in the inner spirit and there is a mighty difference the advantage is wholly on the side of the spaniardswhy should the people of spain be dreaded by their leaders i do not mean the profligate and flagitious leaders but those who are wellintentioned yet timid that there are numbers of this class who have excellent intentions and are willing to make large personal sacrifices is clear for they have put every thing to riskall their privileges their honours and possessionsby their resistance to the invader why then should they have fears from a quarterwhence their safety must come if it come at allspain has nothing to dread from jacobinism manufactures and commerce have there in far less degree than elsewhereby unnaturally clustering the people togetherenfeebled their bodies inflamed their passions by intemperance vitiated from childhood their moral affections and destroyed their imaginations madrid is no enormous city like paris overgrown and disproportionate sickening and bowing down by its corrupt humours the frame of the body politic nor has the pestilential philosophism of france made any progress in spain no flight of infidel harpies has alighted upon their ground a spanish understanding is a hold too strong to give way to the meagre tactics of the système de la nature or to the pellets of logic which condillac has cast in the foundry of national vanity and tosses about at haphazardselfpersuaded that he is proceeding according to art the spaniards are a people with imagination and the paradoxical reveries of rousseau and the flippancies of voltaire are plants which will not naturalise in the country of calderon and cervantes though bigotry among the spaniards leaves much to be lamented i have proved that the religious habits of the nation must in a contest of this kind be of inestimable service  yet further contrasting the present condition of spain with that of france at the commencement of her revolution we must not overlook one characteristic the spaniards have no division among themselves by and through themselves no numerous priesthoodno nobilityno large body of powerful burghersfrom passion interest and conscienceopposing the end which is known and felt to be the duty and only honest and true interest of all hostility wherever it is found must proceed from the seductions of the invader and these depend solely upon his power let that be shattered and they vanish  and this once again leads us directly to that immense military force which the spaniards have to combat and which many think more than counterbalances every internal advantage it is indeed formidable as revolutionary appetites and energies must needs be when among a people numerous as the people of france they have ceased to spend themselves in conflicting factions within the country for objects perpetually changing shape and are carried out of it under the strong controul of an absolute despotism as opportunity invites for a definite objectplunder and conquest it is i allow a frightful spectacleto see the prime of a vast nation propelled out of their territory with the rapid sweep of a horde of tartars moving from the impulse of like savage instincts and furnished at the same time with those implements of physical destruction which have been produced by science and civilization such are the motions of the french armies unchecked by any thought which philosophy and the spirit of society progressively humanizing have called forthto determine or regulate the application of the murderous and desolating apparatus with which by philosophy and science they have been provided with a like perversion of things and the same mischievous reconcilement of forces in their nature adverse these revolutionary impulses and these appetites of barbarous nay what is far worse of barbarized men are embodied in a new frame of polity which possesses the consistency of an ancient government without its embarrassments and weaknesses and at the head of all is the mind of one man who acts avowedly upon the principle that everything which can be done safely by the supreme power of a state may be done see appendix f and who has at his command the greatest part of the continent of europeto fulfil what yet remains unaccomplished of his nefarious purposes  now it must be obvious to a reflecting mind that every thing which is desperately immoral being in its constitution monstrous is of itself perishable decay it cannot escape and further it is liable to sudden dissolution time would evince this in the instance before us though not perhaps until infinite and irreparable harm had been done but even at present each of the sources of this preternatural strength as far as it is formidable to europe has its corresponding seat of weakness which were it fairly touched would manifest itself immediatelythe power is indeed a colossus but if the trunk be of moltenbrass the members are of clay and would fall to pieces upon a shock which need not be violent great britain if her energies were properly called forth and directed might as we have already maintained give this shock magna parvis obscurantur was the appropriate motto the device a sun eclipsed when lord peterborough with a handful of men opposed to fortified cities and large armies brought a great part of spain to acknowledge a sovereign of the house of austria we have now a vast military force andeven without a peterborough or a marlboroughat this precious opportunity when as is daily more probable a large portion of the french force must march northwards to combat austria we might easily by expelling the french from the peninsula secure an immediate footing there for liberty and the pyrenees would then be shut against them for ever the disciplined troops of great britain might overthrow the enemy in the field while the patriots of spain under wise management would be able to consume him slowly but surely  for present annoyance his power is no doubt mighty but libertyin which it originated and of which it is a depravationis far mightier and the good in human nature is stronger than the evil the events of our age indeed have brought this truth into doubt with some persons and scrupulous observers have been astonished and have repined at the sight of enthusiasm courage perseverance and fidelity put forth seemingly to their heightand all engaged in the furtherance of wrong but the minds of men are not always devoted to this bad service as strenuously as they appear to be i have personal knowledge that when the attack was made which ended in the subjugation of switzerland the injustice of the undertaking was grievously oppressive to many officers of the french army and damped their exertions besides were it otherwise there is no just cause for despondency in the perverted alliance of these qualities with oppression the intrinsic superiority of virtue and liberty even for politic ends is not affected by it if the tide of success were by any effort fairly turnednot only a general desertion as we have the best reason to believe would follow among the troops of the enslaved nations but a moral change would also take place in the minds of the native french soldiery occasion would be given for the discontented to break out and above all for the triumph of human nature it would then be seen whether men fighting in a bad causemen without magnanimity honour or justicecould recover and stand up against champions who by these virtues were carried forward in good fortune as by these virtues in adversity they had been sustained as long as guilty actions thrive guilt is strong it has a giddiness and transport of its own a hardihood not without superstition as if providence were a party to its success but there is no independent spring at the heart of the machine which can be relied upon for a support of these motions in a change of circumstances disaster opens the eyes of conscience and in the minds of men who have been employed in bad actions defeat and a feeling of punishment are inseparable  on the other hand the power of an unblemished heart and a brave spirit is shewn in the events of war not only among unpractised citizens and peasants but among troops in the most perfect discipline large bodies of the british army have been several times brokenthat is technically vanquishedin egypt and elsewhere yet they who were conquered as formal soldiers stood their ground and became conquerors as men this paramount efficacy of moral causes is not willingly admitted by persons high in the profession of arms because it seems to diminish their value in societyby taking from the importance of their art but the truth is indisputable and those generals are as blind to their own interests as to the interests of their country who by submitting to inglorious treaties or by other misconduct hazard the breaking down of those personal virtues in the men under their commandto which they themselves as leaders are mainly indebted for the fame which they acquire  combine with this moral superiority inherent in the cause of freedom the endless resources open to a nation which shews constancy in defensive war resources which after a lapse of time leave the strongest invading army comparatively helpless before six cities resisting as saragossa hath resisted during her two sieges the whole of the military power of the adversary would melt away without any advantages of natural situation without fortifications without even a ditch to protect them with nothing better than a mud wall with not more than two hundred regular troops with a slender stock of arms and ammunition with a leader inexperienced in warthe citizens of saragossa began the contest enough of what was needfulwas produced and created andby courage fortitude and skill rapidly maturedthey baffled for sixty days and finally repulsed a large french army with all its equipments in the first siege the natural and moral victory were both on their side nor less so virtually though the termination was different in the second for after another resistance of nearly three months they have given the enemy cause feelingly to say with pyrrhus of olda little more of such conquest and i am destroyed  if evidence were wanting of the efficacy of the principles which throughout this treatise have been maintainedit has been furnished in overflowing measure a private individual i had written and knew not in what manner tens of thousands were enacting day after day the truths which in the solitude of a peaceful vale i was meditating most gloriously have the citizens of saragossa proved that the true army of spain in a contest of this nature is the whole people the same city has also exemplified a melancholyyea a dismal truth yet consolatory and full of joy thatwhen a people are called suddenly to fight for their liberty and are sorely pressed upontheir best field of battle is the floors upon which their children have played the chambers where the family of each man has slept his own or his neighbours upon or under the roofs by which they have been sheltered in the gardens of their recreation in the street or in the marketplace before the altars of their temples and among their congregated dwellingsblazing or uprooted  the government of spain must never forget saragossa for a moment nothing is wanting to produce the same effects every where but a leading mind such as that city was blessed with in the latter contest this has been proved for saragossa contained at that time bodies of men from almost all parts of spain the narrative of those two sieges should be the manual of every spaniard he may add to it the ancient stories of numantia and saguntum let him sleep upon the book as a pillow and if he be a devout adherent to the religion of his country let him wear it in his bosom for his crucifix to rest upon  beginning from these invincible feelings and the principles of justice which are involved in them let nothing be neglected which policy and prudence dictate for rendering subservient to the same end those qualities in human nature which are indifferent or even morally bad and for making the selfish propensities contribute to the support of wise arrangements civil and militaryperhaps there never appeared in the field more steady soldierstroops which it would have been more difficult to conquer with such knowledge of the art of war as then existedthan those commanded by fairfax and cromwell let us see from what root these armies grew cromwell says sir philip warwick made use of the zeal and credulity of these persons that issuch of the people as had in the authors language the fanatic humour teaching them as they too readily taught themselves that they engaged for god when he led them against his vicegerent the king and where this opinion met with a natural courage it made them bolderand too often crueller and where natural courage wanted zeal supplied its place and at first they chose rather to die than flee and custom removed fear of danger and afterwardsfinding the sweet of good pay and of opulent plunder and of preferment suitable to activity and meritthe lucrative part made gain seem to them a natural member of godliness and i cannot here omit continues the author a character of this army which general fairfax gave unto myself when complimenting him with the regularity and temperance of his army he told me the best common soldiers he hadcame out of our army and from the garrisons he had taken in so says he i found you had made them good soldiers and i have made them good men but upon this whole matter it may appear concludes the author that the spirit of discipline of war may beget that spirit of discipline which even solomon describes as the spirit of wisdom and obedience apply this process to the growth and maturity of an armed force in spain in making a comparison of the two cases to the sense of the insults and injuries which as spaniards and as human beings they have received and have to dreadand to the sanctity which an honourable resistance has already conferred upon their misfortunesadd the devotion of that people to their religion as catholicsand it will not be doubted that the superiority of the radical feeling is on their side immeasurable there is i cannot refrain from observing in the catholic religion and in the character of its priesthood especially a source of animation and fortitude in desperate struggleswhich may be relied upon as one of the best hopes of the cause the narrative of the first siege of zaragoza lately published in this country and which i earnestly recommend to the readers perusal informs us thatin every part of the town where the danger was most imminent and the french the most numerouswas padre st iago sass curate of a parish in zaragoza as general palafox made his rounds through the city he often beheld sass alternately playing the part of a priest and a soldier sometimes administering the sacrament to the dying and at others fighting in the most determined manner against the enemies of his countryhe was found so serviceable in inspiring the people with religious sentiments and in leading them on to danger that the general has placed him in a situation where both his piety and courage may continue to be as useful as before and he is now both captain in the army and chaplain to the commanderinchief  the reader will have been reminded by the passage above cited from sir philip warwicks memoirs of the details given in the earlier part of this tract concerning the course which as it appeared to me might with advantage be pursued in spain i must request him to combine those details with such others as have since been given the whole would have been further illustrated if i could sooner have returned to the subject but it was first necessary to examine the grounds of hope in the grand and disinterested passions and in the laws of universal morality my attention has therefore been chiefly directed to these laws and passions in order to elevate in some degree the conceptions of my readers and with a wish to rectify and fix in this fundamental point their judgements the truth of the general reasoning will i have no doubt be acknowledged by men of uncorrupted natures and practised understandings and the conclusion which i have repeatedly drawn will be acceded to namely that no resistance can be prosperous which does not look for its chief support to these principles and feelings if however there should be men who still fear as i have been speaking of things under combinations which are transitory that the action of these powers cannot be sustained to such i answer thatif there be a necessity that it should be sustained at the point to which it first ascended or should recover that height if there have been a fallnature will provide for that necessity the cause is in tyranny and that will again call forth the effect out of its holy retirements oppression its own blind and predestined enemy has poured this of blessedness upon spainthat the enormity of the outrages of which she has been the victim has created an object of love and of hatredof apprehensions and of wishesadequate if that be possible to the utmost demands of the human spirit the heart that serves in this cause if it languish must languish from its own constitutional weakness and not through want of nourishment from without but it is a belief propagated in books and which passes currently among talking men as part of their familiar wisdom that the hearts of the many are constitutionally weak that they do languish and are slow to answer to the requisitions of things i entreat those who are in this delusion to look behind them and about them for the evidence of experience now this rightly understood not only gives no support to any such belief but proves that the truth is in direct opposition to it the history of all ages tumults after tumults wars foreign or civil with short or with no breathingspaces from generation to generation warswhy and wherefore yet with courage with perseverance with selfsacrifice with enthusiasmwith cruelty driving forward the cruel man from its own terrible nakedness and attracting the more benign by the accompaniment of some shadow which seems to sanctify it the senseless weaving and interweaving of factionsvanishing and reviving and piercing each other like the northern lights public commotions and those in the bosom of the individual the long calenture to which the lover is subject the blast like the blast of the desart which sweeps perennially through a frightful solitude of its own making in the mind of the gamester the slowly quickening but ever quickening descent of appetite down which the miser is propelled the agony and cleaving oppression of grief the ghostlike hauntings of shame the incubus of revenge the lifedistemper of ambitionthese inward existences and the visible and familiar occurrences of daily life in every town and village the patient curiosity and contagious acclamations of the multitude in the streets of the city and within the walls of the theatre a procession or a rural dance a hunting or a horserace a flood or a fire rejoicing and ringing of bells for an unexpected gift of good fortune or the coming of a foolish heir to his estatethese demonstrate incontestibly that the passions of men i mean the soul of sensibility in the heart of manin all quarrels in all contests in all quests in all delights in all employments which are either sought by men or thrust upon themdo immeasurably transcend their objects the true sorrow of humanity consists in thisnot that the mind of man fails but that the course and demands of action and of life so rarely correspond with the dignity and intensity of human desires and hence that which is slow to languish is too easily turned aside and abused butwith the remembrance of what has been done and in the face of the interminable evils which are threateneda spaniard can never have cause to complain of this while a follower of the tyrant remains in arms upon the peninsula  here then they with whom i hope take their stand there is a spiritual community binding together the living and the dead the good the brave and the wise of all ages we would not be rejected from this community and therefore do we hope we look forward with erect mind thinking and feeling it is an obligation of duty take away the sense of it and the moral being would die within usamong the most illustrious of that fraternity whose encouragement we participate is an englishman who sacrificed his life in devotion to a cause bearing a stronger likeness to this than any recorded in history it is the elder sidneya deliverer and defender whose name i have before uttered with reverence who treating of the war in the netherlands against philip the second thus writes if her majesty says he were the fountain i wold fear considering what i daily find that we shold wax dry but she is but a means whom god useth and i know not whether i am deceaved but i am fully persuaded that if she shold withdraw herself other springs wold rise to help this action for methinks i see the great work indeed in hand against the abuses of the world wherein it is no greater fault to have confidence in mans power than it is too hastily to despair of gods work  the pen which i am guiding has stopped in my hand and i have scarcely power to proceedi will lay down one principle and then shall contentedly withdraw from the sanctuary  when wickedness acknowledges no limit but the extent of her power and advances with aggravated impatience like a devouring fire the only worthy or adequate opposition isthat of virtue submitting to no circumscription of her endeavours save that of her rights and aspiring from the impulse of her own ethereal zeal the christian exhortation for the individual is here the precept for nationsbe ye therefore perfect even as your father which is in heaven is perfect  upon a future occasion if what has been now said meets with attention i shall point out the steps by which the practice of life may be lifted up towards these high precepts i shall have to speak of the child as well as the man for with the child or the youth may we begin with more hope but i am not in despair even for the man and chiefly from the inordinate evils of our time there are as i shall attempt to shew tender and subtile ties by which these principles that love to soar in the pure region are connected with the groundnest in which they were fostered and from which they take their flight  the outermost and allembracing circle of benevolence has inward concentric circles which like those of the spiders web are bound together by links and rest upon each other making one frame and capable of one tremor circles narrower and narrower closer and closer as they lie more near to the centre of self from which they proceeded and which sustains the whole the order of life does not require that the sublime and disinterested feelings should have to trust long to their own unassisted power nor would the attempt consist either with their dignity or their humility they condescend and they adopt they know the time of their repose and the qualities which are worthy of being admitted into their serviceof being their inmates their companions or their substitutes i shall strive to shew that these principles and movements of wisdomso far from towering above the support of prudence or rejecting the rules of experience for the better conduct of those multifarious actions which are alike necessary to the attainment of ends good or baddo instinctively prompt the sole prudence which cannot fail the higher mode of being does not exclude but necessarily includes the lower the intellectual does not exclude but necessarily includes the sentient the sentient the animal and the animal the vitalto its lowest degrees wisdom is the hidden root which thrusts forth the stalk of prudence and these uniting feed and uphold the bright consummate flowernational happinessthe end the conspicuous crown and ornament of the whole  i have announced the feelings of those who hope yet one word more to those who despond and first he stands upon a hideous precipice and it will be the same with all who may succeed to him and his iron sceptrehe who has outlawed himself from society by proclaiming with act and deed that he acknowledges no mastery but power this truth must be evident to all who breathefrom the dawn of childhood till the last gleam of twilight is lost in the darkness of dotage but take the tyrant as he is in the plenitude of his supposed strength the vast country of germany in spite of the rusty but too strong fetters of corrupt princedoms and degenerate nobilitygermanywith its citizens its peasants and its philosopherswill not lie quiet under the weight of injuries which has been heaped upon it there is a sleep but no death among the mountains of switzerland florence and venice and genoa and romehave their own poignant recollections and a majestic train of glory in past ages the stir of emancipation may again be felt at the mouths as well as at the sources of the rhine poland perhaps will not be insensible kosciusko and his compeers may not have bled in vain nor is hungarian loyalty to be overlooked and for spain itself the territory is wide let it be overrun the torrent will weaken as the water spreads and should all resistance disappear be not daunted extremes meet and how often do hope and despair almost touch each otherthough unconscious of their neighbourhood because their faces are turned different ways yet in a moment the one shall vanish and the other begin a career in the fulness of her joy  but we may turn from these thoughts for the present juncture is most auspicious upon liberty and upon liberty alone can there be permanent dependence but a temporary relief will be given by the share which austria is about to take in the war now is the time for a great and decisive effort and if britain does not avail herself of it her disgrace will be indelible and the loss infinite if there be ground of hope in the crimes and errors of the enemy he has furnished enough of both but imbecility in his opponents above all the imbecility of the british has hitherto preserved him from the natural consequences of his ignorance his meanness of mind his transports of infirm fancy and his guilt let us hasten to redeem ourselves the field is open for a commanding british military force to clear the peninsula of the enemy while the better half of his power is occupied with austria for the south of spain where the first effort of regeneration was made is yet free saragossa which by a truly efficient british army might have been relieved has indeed fallen but leaves little to regret for consummate have been her fortitude and valour the citizens and soldiers of saragossa are to be envied for they have completed the circle of their duty they have done all that could be wishedall that could be prayed for and though the cowardly malice of the enemy gives too much reason to fear that their leader palafox with the fate of toussaint will soon be among the dead it is the high privilege of men who have performed what he has performedthat they cannot be missed and in moments of weakness only can they be lamented their actions represent them every where and for ever palafox has taken his place as parent and ancestor of innumerable heroes  oh that the surviving chiefs of the spanish people may prove worthy of their situation with such materialstheir labour would be pleasant and their success certain butthough heads of a nation venerable for antiquity and having good cause to preserve with reverence the institutions of their elder forefathersthey must not be indiscriminately afraid of new things it is their duty to restore the good which has fallen into disuse and also to create and to adopt young scions of polity must be engrafted on the timeworn trunk a new fortress must be reared upon the ancient and living rock of justice then would it be seen while the superstructure stands inwardly immoveable in how short a space of time the ivy and wild plant would climb up from the base and clasp the naked walls the storms which could not shake would weatherstain and the edifice in the day of its youth would appear to be one with the rock upon which it was planted and to grow out of it  but let us look to ourselves our offences are unexpiated and wanting light we want strength with reference to this guilt and to this deficiency and to my own humble efforts towards removing both i shall conclude with the words of a man of disciplined spirit who withdrew from the too busy worldnot out of indifference to its welfare or to forget its concerns but retired for wider compass of eyesight that he might comprehend and see in just proportions and relations knowing above all that he who hath not first made himself master of the horizon of his own mind must look beyond it only to be deceived it is petrarch who thus writes haec dicerem et quicquid in rem praesentem et indignatio dolorque dictarent nisi obtorpuisse animos actumque de rebus nostris crederem nempe qui aliis iter rectum ostendere solebamus nunc quod exitio proximum est coeci coecis ducibus per abrupta rapimur alienoque circumvolvimur exemplo quid

coeperint vergit in nauseam hinc ille discursus sine termino hinc medio calle discordiae et ante exitum damnata principia et expletè nihil  as an act of respect to the english readeri shall add to the same purpose the words of our own milton who contemplating our ancestors in his day thus speaks of them and their errorsvaliant indeed and prosperous to win a field but to know the end and reason of winning injudicious and unwise hence did their victories prove as fruitless as their losses dangerous and left them still languishing under the same grievances that men suffer conquered which was indeed unlikely to go otherwise unless men more than vulgar bred up in the knowledge of ancient and illustrious deeds invincible against many and vain titles impartial to friendships and relations had conducted their affairs  the end     appendix                                       a page 67   when this passage was written there had appeared only unauthorized accounts of the board of inquirys proceedings neither from these however nor from the official report of the board which has been since published is any satisfactory explanation to be gained on this questionor indeed on any other question of importance all which is to be collected from them is this the portugueze general it appears offered to unite his whole force with the british on the single condition that they should be provisioned from the british stores and accordingly rests his excuse for not cooperating on the refusal of sir arthur wellesley to comply with this condition sir aw denies the validity of his excuse and more than once calls it a pretence declaring that in his belief gen freires real motive for not joining wasa mistrust in the competence of the british to appear in the field against the french this however is mere surmise and therefore cannot have much weight with those who sincerely sought for satisfaction on this point moreover it is a surmise of the individual whose justification rests on making it appear that the difficulty did not arise with himself and it is right to add that the only fact produced goes to discredit this surmise viz that gen friere did without any delay furnish the whole number of troops which sir arthur engaged to feed however the board exhibited so little anxiety to be satisfied on this point that no positive information was gained  a reference being here first made to the official report of the board of inquiry i shall make use of the opportunity which it offers to lay before the reader an outline of that boards proceedings from which it will appear how far the opinionpronounced by the national voice upon the transactions in portugalought in sound logic to be modified by any part of those proceedings  we find in the warrant under which the board of inquiry was to act and which defined its powers that an inquiry was to be made into the conditions of the armistice and convention and into all the causes and circumstances whether arising from the operations of the british army or otherwise which led to them  whether answers to the charges of the people of england were made possible by the provisions of this warrantand secondly whether even these provisions have been satisfied by the board of inquirywill best appear by involving those charges in four questions according to the following scale which supposes a series of concessions impossible to those who think the nation justified in the language held on the transactions in portugal  1 considering the perfidy with which the french army had entered portugal the enormities committed by it during its occupation of that country the vast military power of which that army was a part and the use made of that power by its master the then existing spirit of the spanish portugueze and british nations in a word considering the especial nature of the service and the individual character of this warwas it lawful for the british army under any conceivable circumstances so long as it had the liberty of reembarking to make any conceivable convention ie was the negative evil of a total failure in every object for which it had been sent to portugal of worse tendency than the positive evil of acknowledging in the french army a fair title to the privileges of an honourable enemy by consenting to a mode of treaty which in its very name implying a reciprocation of concession and respect must be under any limitations as much more indulgent than an ordinary capitulation as that again must in its severest form be more indulgent than the only favour which the french marauders could presume upon obtainingviz permission to surrender at discretion  to this question the reader need not be told that these pages give a naked unqualified denial and that to establish the reasonableness of that denial is one of their main purposes but for the benefit of the men accused let it be supposed granted and then the second question will be  2 was it lawful for the english army in the case of its being reduced to the supposed dilemma of either reembarking or making some convention to make that specifical convention which it did make at cintra  this is of necessity and à fortiori denied and it has been proved that neither to this nor any other army could it be lawful to make such a conventionnot merely under the actual but under any conceivable circumstances let however this too on behalf of the parties accused be granted and then the third question will be  3 was the english army reduced to that dilemma  4 finally this also being conceded which not even the generals have dared to say it remains to ask by whose and by what misconduct did an armyconfessedly the arbiter of its own movements and plans at the opening of the campaignforfeit that free agencyeither to the extent of the extremity supposed or of any approximation to that extremity  now of these four possible questions in the minds of all those who condemn the convention of cintra it is obvious that the kings warrant supposes only the three latter to exist since though it allows inquiry to be made into the individual convention it no where questions the tolerability of a convention in genere and it is no less obvious that the board acting under that warrant has noticed only the lastie by what series of military movements the army was brought into a state of difficulty which justified a convention the board taking for granted throughout1st that such a state could exist 2ndly that it actually did exist and 3rdly thatif it existed and accordingly justified some imaginable conventionit must therefore of necessity justify this convention  having thus shewn that it is on the last question only that the nation could in deference to the board of inquiry surrender or qualify any opinion which it had previously givenlet us ask what answer is gained from the proceedings of that board to the charge involved even in this last question premising howeverfirstthat this charge was never explicitly made by the public or at least was enunciated only in the form of a conjectureand 2ndly that the answer to it is collected chiefly from the depositions of the parties accused now the whole sum of their answer amounts to no more than thisthat in the opinion of some part of the english staff an opportunity was lost on the 21st of exchanging the comparatively slow process of reducing the french army by siege for the brilliant and summary one of a coupdemain  this opportunity be it observed was offered only by gen junots presumption in quitting his defensive positions and coming out to meet the english army in the field so that it was an advantage so much over and above what might fairly have been calculated upon at any rate if this might have been looked for still the accident of battle by which a large part of the french army was left in a situation to be cut off to the loss of which advantage sir a wellesley ascribes the necessity of a convention could surely never have been anticipated and therefore the british army was even after that loss in as prosperous a state as it had from the first any right to expect hence it is to be inferred that sir aw must have entered on this campaign with a predetermination to grant a convention in any case excepting in one single case which he knew to be in the gift of only very extraordinary good fortune with respect to him therefore the chargespronounced by the national voiceare not only confirmed but greatly aggravated further with respect to the general who superseded him all thosewho think that such an opportunity of terminating the campaign was really offered and through his refusal to take advantage of it lostare compelled to suspect in him a want of military skill or a wilful sacrifice of his duty to the influence of personal rivalry accordingly as they shall interpret his motives  the whole which we gain therefore from the board of inquiry isthat what we barely suspected is ripened into certaintyand that on all which we assuredly knew and declared without needing that any tribunal should lend us its sanction no effort has been made at denial or disguise or palliation  thus much for the proceedings of the board of inquiry upon which their decision was to be grounded as to the decision itself it declares that no further military proceedings are necessary because say the members of the board however some of us may differ in our sentiments respecting the fitness of the convention in the relative situation of the two armies it is our unanimous declaration that unquestionable zeal and firmness appear throughout to have been exhibited by generals sir h dalrymple sir h burrard and sir a wellesley in consequence of this decision the commanderinchief addressed a letter to the boardreminding them that though the words of his majestys warrant expressly enjoin that the conditions of the armistice and convention should be strictly examined and reported upon they have altogether neglected to give any opinion upon those conditions they were therefore called upon then to declare their opinion whether an armistice was adviseable and if so whether the terms of that armistice were such as ought to be agreed uponand to declare in like manner whether a convention was adviseable and if so whether the terms of that convention were such as ought to have been agreed upon  to two of these questionsviz those which relate to the particular armistice and convention made by the british generalsthe members of the board still persevering in their blindness to the other two which express doubt as to the lawfulness of any armistice or convention severally return answers which convey an approbation of the armistice and convention by four members a disapprobation of the convention by the remaining three and further a disapprobation of the armistice by one of those three  now it may be observedfirstthat even if the investigation had not been a public one it might have reasonably been concluded from the circumstance of the board having omitted to report any opinion concerning the terms of the armistice and the convention that those terms had not occupied enough of its attention to justify the board in giving any opinion upon themwhether of approbation or disapprobation and secondlythis conclusion which might have been made à priori is confirmed by the actual fact that no examination or inquiry of this kind appears throughout the report of its proceedings and therefore any opinion subsequently given in consequence of the requisition of the commanderinchief can lay claim to no more authority upon these pointsthan the opinion of the same men if they had never sat in a public court upon this question in this condition are all the members whether they approve or disapprove of the convention and with respect to the three who disapprove of the conventionover and above the general impropriety of having under these circumstances pronounced a verdict at all in the character of members of that boardthey are subject to an especial charge of inconsistency in having given such an opinion in their second report as renders nugatory that which they first pronounced for the reasonassigned in their first report for deeming no further military proceedings necessaryis because it appears that unquestionable zeal and firmness were exhibited throughout by the several general officers and the reasonassigned by those three who condemn the conventionis that the generals did not insist upon the terms to which they were entitled that is in direct opposition to their former opinions the generals shewed a want of firmness and zeal if then the generals were acquitted in the first case solely upon the ground of having displayed firmness and zeal a confessed want of firmness and zeal in the second case implies conversely a ground of censurerendering in the opinions of these three members further military proceedings absolutely necessary theywho are most aware of the unconstitutional frame of this court or board and of the perplexing situation in which its members must have found themselves placedwill have the least difficulty in excusing this inconsistency it is however to be regretted particularly in the instance of the earl of moirawho disapproving both of the convention and armistice has assigned for that disapprobation unanswerable reasons drawnnot from hidden sources unapproachable except by judicial investigationbut from facts known to all the world  the reader will excuse this long note to which however i must add one wordis it not strange that in the general decision of the board zeal and firmnessnakedly considered and without question of their union with judgment and such other qualities as can alone give them any valueshould be assumed as sufficient grounds on which to rest the acquittal of men lying under a charge of military delinquency                                       b page 72  it is not necessary to add that one of these fears was removed by the actual landing of ten thousand men under sir j moore pending the negotiation and yet no change in the terms took place in consequence this was an important circumstance and of itself determined two of the members of the board of inquiry to disapprove of the convention such an accession entitling sir h dalrymple and of course making it his duty to insist on more favourable terms but the argument is complete without it                                       c page 75  i was unwilling to interrupt the reader upon a slight occasion but i cannot refrain from adding here a word or two by way of commenti have said at page 71 speaking of junots army that the british were to encounter the same men c sir arthur wellesley before the board of inquiry disallowed this supposition affirming that junots army had not then reached spain nor could be there for some time grant this was it not stipulated that a messenger should be sent off immediately after the conclusion of the treaty to buonaparteapprising him of its terms and when he might expect his troops and would not this enable him to hurry forward forces to the spanish frontiers and to bring them into actionknowing that these troops of junots would be ready to support him what did it matter whether the british were again to measure swords with these identical men whether these men were even to appear again upon spanish ground it was enough that if these did not others wouldwho could not have been brought to that service but that these had been released and were doing elsewhere some other service for their master enough that every thing was provided by the british to land them as near the spanish frontier and as speedily as they could desire                                       d page 108  this attempt the reader will recollect is not new to our countryit was accomplished at one aera of our history in that memorable act of an english parliament which made it unlawful for any man to ask his neighbour to join him in a petition for redress of grievances and which thus denied the people the benefit of tears and prayers to their own infamous deputies for the deplorable state of england and scotland at that timesee the annals of charles the second and his successorwe must not forget however that to this state of things as the cause of those measures which the nation afterwards resorted to we are originally indebted for the blessing of the bill of rights                                       e page 159  i allude here more especially to an address presented to buonaparte october 27th 1808 by the deputies of the new departments of the kingdom of italy from which address as given in the english journals the following passages are extracted       in the necessity in which you are to overthrowto destroyto      disperse your enemies as the wind dissipates the dust you are not      an exterminating angel but you are the being that extends his      thoughtsthat measures the face of the earthto reestablish      universal happiness upon better and surer bases                                            we are the interpreters of a million of souls at the extremity of      your kingdom of italydeign sovereign master of all things      to hear as we doubt not you will c  the answer begins thus  i applaud the sentiments you express in the name of my people of musora metauro and tronto                                       f page 163  this principle involved in so many of his actions buonaparte has of late explicitly avowed the instances are numerous it will be sufficient in this place to allege onefurnished by his answer to the address cited in the last note       i am particularly attached to your archbishop of urbino that      prelate animated with the true faith repelled with indignation      the adviceand braved the menacesof those who wished to confound      the affairs of heaven which never change with the affairs of this      world which are modified according to circumstances of force and      policy                                       suspension of arms  agreed upon between lieutenantgeneral

postscript  on sir john moores letters  whilst the latter sheets of this work were passing through the press there was laid before parliament a series of correspondence between the english government and its servants in spain amongst which were the letters of sir john moore that these letters even with minds the least vigilant to detect contradictions and to make a commentary from the past actions of the spaniards should have had power to alienate them from the spanish causecould never have been looked for except indeed by those who saw in the party spirit on this question a promise that more than ordinary pains would be taken to misrepresent their contents and to abuse the public judgment but however it was at any rate to have been expectedboth from the place which sir j moore held in the nations esteem previously to his spanish campaign and also especially from that which by his death in battle he had so lately taken in its affectionsthat they would weigh a good deal in depressing the general sympathy with spain and therefore the author of this work was desirous that all which these letters themselves or other sources of information furnished to mitigate and contradict sir jms opinionsshould be laid before the public butbeing himself at a great distance from london and not having within his reach all the documents necessary for this purposehe has honoured the friend who corrects the press errors by making over that task to him and the reader is therefore apprised that the author is not responsible for any thing which follows                                       those who have not examined these letters for themselves will have collected enough of their general import from conversation and the public prints to know that they pronounce an opinion unfavourable to the spaniards they will perhaps have yet to learn that this opinion is not supported by any body of facts for of facts only three are given and those as we shall see misrepresented but solely by the weight of sir john moores personal authority this being the case it becomes the more important to assign the value of that authority by making such deductions from the present public estimate of it as are either fairly to be presumed from his profession and office or directly inferred from the letters under consideration  as reasons for questioning à priori the impartiality of these lettersit might be suggested in reference to what they would be likely to omitfirstthat they are the letters of a soldier that is of a man trained by the prejudices of his profession to despise or at least to rate as secondary those resources which for spain must be looked to as supremeand secondly that they are the letters of a general that is of a soldier removed by his rank from the possibility of any extensive intercourse with the lower classes concerning whom the question chiefly was but it is more important to remark in reference to what they would be likely to misstatethirdlythat they are the letters of a commanderinchief standingfrom the very day when he took the fieldin a dilemma which compelled him to risk the safety of his army by advancing or its honour by retreating and having to make out an apology for either issue to the very persons who had imposed this dilemma upon himthe reader is requested to attend to this sir john moore found himself in león with a force which if united to quote his own words would not exceed 26000 men such a force after the defeat of the advanced armieshe was surecould effect nothing the best result he could anticipate was an inglorious retreat that he should be in this situation at the very opening of the campaign he saw would declare to all europe that somewhere there must be blame but where with himself he knew that there was none the english government with whom he must have seen that at least a part of the blame layfor sending him so late and with a force so lamentably incommensurate to the demands of the service it was not for himholding the situation that he didopenly to accuse though by implication he often does accuse them and therefore it became his business to look to the spaniards and in their conduct to search for palliations of that inefficiency on his partwhich else the persons to whom he was writing would understand as charged upon themselves writing with such a purposeand under a double fettering of his faculties first from anxious forebodings of calamity or dishonour and secondly from the pain he must have felt at not being free to censure those with whom he could not but be aware that the embarrassments of his situation had at least in part originatedwe might expect that it would not be difficult for him to find in the early events of the campaign all which he sought and to deceive himself into a belief that in stating these events without any commentary or even hints as to the relative circumstances under which they took place which only could give to the naked facts their value and due meaning he was making no misrepresentationsand doing the spaniards no injustice  these suggestions are made with the greater earnestness as it is probable that the honourable death of sir john moore will have given so much more weight to his opinion on any subjectas if these suggestions be warranted it is entitled on this subject to less weightthan the opinion of any other individual equally intelligent and not liable from high office and perplexity of situation to the same influences of disgust or prejudice  that these letters were written under some such influences is plain throughout we find in them reports of the four first events in the campaign and in justice to the spaniards it must be said that all are virtually misstatements take two instances  1 the main strength and efforts of the french were at the opening of the campaign directed against the army of gen blake the issue is thus given by sir jmgen blakes army in biscay has been defeateddispersed and its officers and men are flying in every direction could it be supposed that the army whose matchless exertions and endurances are all merged in this overcharged and almost insulting statement of their result was mere peasantry sir jms own words and opposed to greatly superior numbers of veteran troops confront with this account the description given by an eyewitness majorgen leith of their constancy and the trials of their constancy remembering that for ten successive days they were engaged under the pressure of similar hardships with the addition of one not mentioned here viza want of clothing in continued actions with the frenchhere i shall take occasion to state another instance of the patience and i will add the chearfulness of the spanish soldiers under the greatest privationsafter the action of soronosa on the 31st ult it was deemed expedient by gen blake for the purpose of forming a junction with the second division and the army of asturias that the army should make long rapid and continued marches through a country at any time incapable of feeding so numerous an army and at present almost totally drained of provisions from the 30th of october to the present day nov 6 with the exception of a small and partial issue of bread at bilboa on the morning of the 1st of november this army has been totally destitute of bread wine or spirits and has literally lived on the scanty supply of beef and sheep which those mountains afford yet never was there a symptom of complaint or murmur the soldiers minds appearing to be entirely occupied with the idea of being led against the enemy at bilboait is impossible for me to do justice to the gallantry and energy of the divisions engaged this day the army are loud in expressing their desires to be led against the enemy at bilboa the universal exclamation isthe bayonet the bayonet lead us back to soronosa  2 on the 10th of november the estramaduran advanced guard of about 12000 men was defeated at burgos by a division of the french army selected for the serviceand having a vast superiority in cavalry and artillery this event with the same neglect of circumstances as in the former instance sir jm thus reportsthe french after beating the army of estramadura are advanced at burgos now surely to any unprejudiced mind the bare fact of 12000 men chiefly raw levies having gone forward to meet and to find out the main french armyunder all the oppression which to the ignorant of the upper and lower classes throughout europe there is in the name of bonapartemust appear under any issue a title to the highest admiration such as would have made this slight and incidental mention of it impossible  the two next eventsviz the forcing of the pass at somosierra by the polish horse and the partial defeat of castanosare as might be shewn even from the french bulletins no less misrepresented with respect to the firstsir j moore overlooking the whole drama of that noble defence gives only the catastrophe and his account of the second will appear from any report to be an exaggeration  it may be objected thatsince sir jm no where alleges these events as proving any thing against the spaniards but simply as accounting for his own plans in which view howsoever effected whether with or without due resistance they were entitled to the same valueit is unfair to say that by giving them uncircumstantially he has misrepresented them but it must be answered that in letters containing elsewhere though not immediately in connexion with these statements opinions unfavourable to the spaniards to omit any thing making for themis to misrepresent in effect and further it shall now be shewn that even those three chargeswhich sir jm does allege in proof of his opinionsare as glaringly misstated  the first of these charges is the most important i give it to the reader in the words of sir john moorethe french cavalry from burgos in small detachments are overrunning the province of león raising contributions to which the inhabitants submit without the least resistance now here it cannot be meant that no efforts at resistance were made by individuals or small parties because this would not only contradict the universal laws of human naturebut would also be at utter variance with sir jms repeated complaints that he could gain no information of what was passing in his neighbourhood it is meant therefore that there was no regular organised resistance no resistance such as might be made the subject of an official report now we all know that the spaniards have every where suffered deplorably from a want of cavalry and in the absence of that hear from a military man majorgen brodrick why there was no resistance at that time i was not aware how remarkably the plains of león and castille differ from any other i have seen nor how strongly the circumstances which constitute that difference enforce the opinion i venture to express he means the necessity of cavalry reinforcements from england my road from astorga lay through a vast open space extending from 5 to 20 or more miles on every side without a single accident of ground which could enable a body of infantry to check a pursuing enemy or to cover its own retreat in such ground any corps of infantry might be insulted to the very gates of the town it occupied by cavalry far inferior in numbers contributions raised under their eyes and the whole neighbourhood exhausted of its resources without the possibility of their opposing any resistance to such incursions  the second charge is made on the retreat to corunna the gallicians though armed sir jm says made no attempt to stop the passage of the french through the mountains that they were armedis a proof that they had an intention to do so as one of our journals observed but what encouragement had they in that intention from the sight of a regular forcemore than 30000 strongabandoning without a struggle passes where as an english general asserts a body of a thousand men might stop an army of twenty times the number  the third charge relates to the same province it is a complaint that the people run away the villages are deserted and again in his last letterthey abandoned their dwellings at our approach drove away their carts oxen and every thing which could be of the smallest aid to the army to this charge in so far as it may be thought to criminate the spaniards a full answer is furnished by their accuser himself in the following memorable sentence in another part of the very same letteri am sorry to say that the army whose conduct i had such reason to extol in its march through portugal and on its arrival in spain has totally changed its character since it began to retreat what do we collect from this passage assuredly that the army illtreated the gallicians for there is no other way in which an army as a body can offendexcepting by an indisposition to fight and that interpretation besides that we are all sure that no english army could so offend sir j moore expressly guards against in the next sentence  the english army then treated its ally as an enemy andthough there are alleviations of its conduct in its great sufferingsyet it must be remembered that these sufferings were duenot to the galliciansbut to circumstances over which they had no controulto the precipitancy of the retreat the inclemency of the weather and the poverty of the country and that knowing this they must have had a double sense of injustice in any outrages of an english army from contrasting them with the professed objects of that army in entering spainit is to be observed that the answer to the second charge would singly have been some answer to this and reciprocally that the answer to this is a full answer to the second  having thus shewn that in sir j moores very inaccurate statements of facts we have some further reasons for a previous distrust of any opinion which is supported by those statementsit is now time to make the reader acquainted with the real terms and extent of that opinion for it is far less to be feared that from his just respect for him who gave it he should allow it an undue weight in his judgmentthan that reposing on the faithfulness of the abstracts and reports of these letters he should really be still ignorant of its exact tenor  the whole amount then of what sir john moore has alleged against the spaniards in any place but one is comprised in this sentencethe enthusiasm of which we have heard so much no where appears whatever goodwill there is and i believe amongst the lower orders there is a great deal is taken no advantage of it is true that in that one place viz in his last letter written at corunna he charges the spaniards with apathy and indifference but as this cannot be reconciled with his concession of a great deal of goodwill we are bound to take that as his real and deliberate opinion which he gave under circumstances that allowed him most coolness and freedom of judgmentthe spaniards then were wanting in enthusiasm now what is meant by enthusiasm does it mean want of ardour and zeal in battle this sir j moore no where asserts and even without a direct acknowledgement of their good conduct in the field of which he had indeed no better means of judging than we in england there is involved in his statement of the relative numbers of the french and spaniardscombined with our knowledge of the time during which they maintained their strugglea sufficient testimony to that even if the events of the first campaign had not made it superfluous does it mean then a want of goodwill to the cause so far from this we have seen that sir jm admits that there was in that class where it was most wanted a great deal of goodwill and in the present condition of spain let it be recollected what it is that this implies we see in the intercepted letter to marshal soult transmitted by sir jm that the french keep accurate registers of the behaviour of the different towns and this was no doubt well known throughout spain therefore to shew any signs of goodwillmuch more to give a kind welcome to the english as had been done at badajoz and salamancawas they knew a pledge of certain punishment on any visit from the french so that goodwill manifested in these circumstances was nothing less than a testimony of devotion to the cause  here then the reader will say i find grantedin the courage and the goodwill of the spaniardsall the elements of an enthusiastic resistance and cannot therefore imagine what more could be sought for except the throwing out and making palpable of their enthusiasm to the careless eye in some signal outward manifestations in this accordingly we learn what interpretation we are to give to sir jms chargethere were no tumults on his entrance into spain no insurrections they did not as he says rally round the english army but to determine how far this disappointment of his expectations tells against the spaniards we must first know how far those expectations were reasonable let the reader consider then  first what army was this round which the spaniards were to rally if it was known by the victory of vimiera it was known also to many by the convention of cintra for though the government had never ventured to communicate that affair officially to the nation dark and perplexing whispers were however circulated about it throughout spain moreover it must surely demand some superstition in behalf of regular troopsto see in an army of 20000 men a dignity adequate to the office here claimed for it of awakening a new vigour and enthusiasm in such a nation as spain not to mention that an english army however numerous had no right to consider itself as other than a tributary forceas itself tending to a centreand attracted rather than attracting  secondly it appears that sir jm has overlooked one most important circumstanceviz that the harvest in these provinces had been already reaped the english army could be viewed only as gleaners thus as we have already seen estramadura had furnished an army which had marched before his arrival from salamanca alsothe very place in which he makes his complaintthere had gone out a battalion to biscay which gen blake had held up for its romantic gallantly to the admiration of his whole army  yet thirdly it is not meant by any means to assert that spain has put forth an energy adequate to the serviceor in any tolerable proportion to her own strength far from it but upon whom does the blame rest not surely upon the peoplewho as long as they continued to have confidence in their rulers could not be expected after the early fervours of their revolution had subsided much to overstep the measure of exertion prescribed to thembut solely upon the government up to the time when sir jm died the supreme junta had adopted no one grand and comprehensive measure for calling out the strength of the nationscarcely any of such ordinary vigour as in some countries would have been adopted to meet local disturbances among the people from their jealousy of popular feelingthey had never taken any steps by books or civic assemblies to make the general enthusiasm in the cause available by bringing it within the general consciousness and thus to create the nation into an organic whole sir jm was fully aware of thisthe spanish government he says do not seem ever to have contemplated the possibility of a second attack and accordingly whenever he is at leisure to make distinctions he does the people the justice to saythat the failure was with those who should have taken advantage of their good will with the people therefore will for ever remain the glory of having resisted heroically with means utterly inadequate and with the government the whole burthen of the disgrace that the means were thus inadequate  but furthereven though it should still be thought that in the three provinces which sir j moore saw there may have been some failures with the peopleit is to be remembered that these were the very three which had never been the theatre of french outrages which therefore had neither such a vivid sense of the evils which they had to fear nor so strong an animation in the recollection of past triumphs we might accordingly have predicted that if any provinces should prove slack in their exertions it would be these three so that after all a candid inquirer into this matter will say admitting sir jms description to be faithful with respect to what he saw i can never allow that the conduct of these three provinces shall be held forth as an exponent of the general temper and condition of spain for that therefore i must look to other authorities  such an inquirer we might then refer to the testimonies of gen leith and of capt pasley for biscay and asturias of mr vaughan as cited by lord castlereagh for the whole east and south of lord cochrane himself a most gallant man and giving his testimony under a trying comparison of the spaniards with english sailors for catalonia in particular of lord w bentinck for the central provinces and for all spain we might appeal even to the spanish military reportswhich by the discrimination of their praises sometimes giving severe rebukes to particular regiments c authenticate themselves  but finally we are entitledafter the actions of the spaniardsto dispense with such appeals spain might justly deem it a high injury and affront to suppose that after her deeds performed under the condition of her means she could require any other testimony to justify her before nil posterity what those deeds have been it cannot surely now be necessary to inform the reader and therefore the remainder of this note shall be employed in placing before him the present posture of spainunder two aspects which may possibly have escaped his notice  first let him look to that part of spain which is now in the possession of the enemylet him bear in mind that the present campaign opened at the latter end of last october that the french were then masters of the country up to the ebro that the contest has since lain between a veteran army rated on the lowest estimate at 113000 menwith a prodigious superiority in cavalry artillery c opposed as to all regular opposition by unpractised spaniards split into three distinct armies having no communication with each other making a total of not more than 80000 menand then let him inquire what progress in this time and with these advantages the french have been able to make comparing it at the same time with that heretofore made in prussia and elsewhere the answer shall be given from the times newspaper of april 8thit appears that at the date of our last accounts from france as well as spain about one half of the peninsula was still unsubdued by the french arms the provinces which retain their independence form a sort of irregular or broken crescent of which one horn consists in parts of catalonia and valencia and the other horn includes asturias perhaps we may soon add gallicia the broader surface contains the four kingdoms of andalusia seville grenada cordova and murcia and considerable parts of estramadura and la mancha besides portugalthe writer might have added that even the provinces occupied by the french cannot yet be counted substantially as conquests since they have a military representation in the south large proportions of the defeated armies having retreated thither  secondly let him look to that part of spain which yet remains unsubduedit was thought no slight proof of heroism in the people of madrid that they prepared for their defencenot as the foremost champions of spain in which character they might have gained an adventitious support from the splendour of their post and at any rate would have been free from the depression of preceding disastersbut under a full knowledge of recent and successive overthrows their advanced armies had been defeated and their last stay at somosierra had been driven in upon them but the provinces in the south have many more causes for dejection they have heard since these disasters that this heroic city of madrid has fallen that their forts in catalonia have been wrested from them that an english army just moved upon the horizon of spainto draw upon itself the gaze and expectations of the people and then to vanish like an apparition and finally they have heard of the desolation of saragossa under all this accumulation of calamity what has been their conduct in valencia redoubled preparations of defence in seville a decree for such energetic retaliation on the enemyas places its authors in the event of his success beyond the hopes of mercy in cadizon a suspicion that a compromise was concerted with their enemytumults and clamours of the people for instant vengeance every where in their uttermost distress the same stern and unfaultering attitude of defiance as at the glorious birth of their resistance  in this statement then of the past efforts of spainand of her present preparations for further effortswill be found a full answer to all the charges alleged by sir john moore in his letters against the people of spain even if we did not find sufficient ground for rejecting them in an examination of these letters themselves                                       the author of the above notehaving in justice to the spaniards spoken with great plainness and freedomfeels it necessary to add a few words that it may not thence be concluded that he is insensible to sir j moores claims upon his respect perhapsif sir jm could himself have given us his commentary upon these letters and have restricted the extension of such passages as from want of vigilance in making distinctions or laxity of language are at variance with concessions made elsewherethey would have been found not more to differ from the reports of other intelligent and less prejudiced observers than we might have expected from the circumstances under which they were written sir jm has himself told us in a letter published since the above note was written that he thinks the spaniards a fine people and that acknowledgement from a soldier cannot be supposed to exclude courage nor from a briton some zeal for national independence we are therefore to conclude that when sir jm pronounces opinions on the spaniards not to be reconciled with this and other passages he speaksnot of the spanish peoplebut of the spanish government and even for what may still remain charged uncandidly upon the people the writer does not forget that there are infinite apologies to be found in sir j moores situation the earliest of these letters were written under great anxiety and disturbance of mind from the anticipation of calamityand the latter which are the most severe under the actual pressure of calamity and calamity of that sort which would be the most painful to the feelings of a gallant soldier and most likely to vitiate his judgment with respect to those who had in part however innocently occasioned it there may be pleaded also for himthat want of leisure which would make it difficult to compare the different accounts he received and to draw the right inferences from them but then these apologies for his want of fidelityare also reasons beforehand for suspecting it and there are now may 18th to be added to these reasons and their confirmations in the letters themselves fresh proofs in the present state of gallicia as manifested by the late recapture of vigo and the movements of the marquis de la romana all which from sir j moores account of the temper in that province we might have confidently pronounced impossible we must therefore remember that what in him were simply misstatementsare now when repeated with our better information calumnies and calumnies so much the less to be excused in us as we have already in our conduct towards spain given her other and no light matter of complaint against ourselves                                       end of the appendix     iii vindication of opinions in the treatise on the convention of cintra  viz  a letter to

to captain pasley royal engineers  grasmere march 28 1811  my dear sir  i address this to the publishers of your essay not knowing where to find you before i speak of the instruction and pleasure which i have derived from your work let me say a word or two in apology for my own apparent neglect of the letter with which you honoured me some time ago in fact i was thoroughly sensible of the value of your correspondence and of your kindness in writing to me and took up the pen to tell you so i wrote half of a pretty long letter to you but i was so disgusted with the imperfect and feeble expression which i had given to some not uninteresting ideas that i threw away the unfinished sheet and could not find resolution to resume what had been so inauspiciously begun i am ashamed to say that i write so few letters and employ my pen so little in any way that i feel both a lack of words such words i mean as i wish for and of mechanical skill extremely discouraging to me i do not plead these disabilities on my part as an excuse but i wish you to know that they have been the sole cause of my silence and not a want of sense of the honour done me by your correspondence or an ignorance of what good breeding required of me but enough of my trespasses let me only add that i addressed a letter of some length to you when you were lying ill at middleburgh this probably you never received now for your book i had expected it with great impatience and desired a friend to send it down to me immediately on its appearance which he neglected to do on this account i did not see it till a few days ago i have read it through twice with great care and many parts three or four times over from this you will conclude that i must have been much interested and i assure you that i deem myself also in a high degree instructed it would be a most pleasing employment to me to dwell in this letter upon those points in which i agree with you and to acknowledge my obligations for the clearer views you have given of truths which i before perceived though not with that distinctness in which they now stand before my eyes but i could wish this letter to be of some use to you and that end is more likely to be attained if i advert to those points in which i think you are mistaken these are chiefly such as though very material in themselves are not at all so to the main object you have in view viz that of proving that the military power of france may by us be successfully resisted and even overthrown in the first place then i think that there are great errors in the survey of the comparative strength of the two empires with which you begin your book and on which the first 160 pages are chiefly employed you seem to wish to frighten the people into exertion and in your ardour to attain your object that of rousing our countrymen by any means i think you have caught far too eagerly at every circumstance with respect to revenue navy c that appears to make for the french this i think was unnecessary the people are convinced that the power of france is dangerous and that it is our duty to resist it to the utmost i think you might have commenced from this acknowledged fact and at all events i cannot help saying that the first 100 pages or so of your book contrasted with the brilliant prospects towards the conclusion have impressed me with a notion that you have written too much under the influence of feelings similar to those of a poet or novelist who deepens the distress in the earlier part of his work in order that the happy catastrophe which he has prepared for his hero and heroine may be more keenly relished your object is to conduct us to elysium and lest we should not be able to enjoy that pure air and purpurial sunshine you have taken a peep at tartarus on the road now i am of your mind that we ought not to make peace with france on any account till she is humiliated and her power brought within reasonable bounds it is our duty and our interest to be at war with her but i do not think with you that a state of peace would give to france that superiority which you seem so clearly to foresee in estimating the resources of the two empires as to revenue you appear to make little or no allowance for what i deem of prime and paramount importance the characters of the two nations and of the two governments was there ever an instance since the world began of the peaceful arts thriving under a despotism so oppressive as that of france is and must continue to be and among a people so unsettled so depraved and so undisciplined in civil arts and habits as the french nation must now be it is difficult to come at the real revenue of the french empire but it appears to me certain absolutely certain that it must diminish rapidly every year the armies have hitherto been maintained chiefly from the contributions raised upon the conquered countries and from the plunder which the soldiers have been able to find but that harvest is over austria and particularly hungary may have yet something to supply but the french ruler will scarcely quarrel with them for a few years at least but from denmark and sweden and russia there is not much to be gained in the mean while wherever his iron yoke is fixed the spirits of the people are broken and it is in vain to attempt to extort money which they do not possess and cannot procure their bodies he may command but their bodies he cannot move without the inspiration of wealth somewhere or other by wealth i mean superfluous produce something arising from the labour of the inhabitants of countries beyond what is necessary to their support what will avail him the command of the whole population of the continent unless there be a security for capital somewhere existing so that the mechanic arts and inventions may thereby be applied in such a manner as that an overplus may arise from the labour of the country which shall find its way into the pocket of the state for the purpose of supporting its military and civil establishments now when i look at the condition of our country and compare it with that of france and reflect upon the length of the time and the infinite combination of favourable circumstances which have been necessary to produce the laws the regulations the customs the moral character and the physical enginery of all sorts through means and by aid of which labour is carried on in this happy land and when i think of the wealth and population concentrated too in so small a space which we must have at command for military purposes i confess i have not much dread looking either at war or peace of any power which france with respect to us is likely to attain for years i may say for generations whatever may be the form of a government its spirit at least must be mild and free before agriculture trade commerce and manufactures can thrive under it and if these do not prosper in a state it may extend its empire to right and to left and it will only carry poverty and desolation along with it without being itself permanently enriched you seem to take for granted that because the french revenue amounts to so much at present it must continue to keep up to that height this i conceive impossible unless the spirit of the government alters which is not likely for many years how comes it that we are enabled to keep by sea and land so many men in arms not by our foreign commerce but by our domestic ingenuity by our home labour which with the aid of capital and the mechanic arts and establishments has enabled a few to produce so much as will maintain themselves and the hundreds of thousands of their countrymen whom they support in arms if our foreign trade were utterly destroyed i am told that not more than onesixth of our trade would perish the spirit of buonapartes government is and must continue to be like that of the first conquerors of the new world who went raving about for goldgold and for whose rapacious appetites the slow but mighty and sure returns of any other produce could have no charms i cannot but think that generations must pass away before france or any of the countries under its thraldom can attain those habits and that character and those establishments which must be attained before it can wield its population in a manner that will ensure our overthrow this if we conduct the war upon principles of common sense seems to me impossible while we continue at war and should a peace take place which however i passionately deprecate france will long be compelled to pay tribute to us on account of our being so far before her in the race of genuine practical philosophy and true liberty i mean that the mind of this country is so far before that of france and that that mind has empowered the hands of the country to raise so much national wealth that france must condescend to accept from us what she will be unable herself to produce is it likely that any of our manufacturing capitalists in case of a peace would trust themselves to an arbitrary government like that of france which without a moments warning might go to war with us and seize their persons and their property nay if they should be so foolish as to trust themselves to its discretion would be base enough to pick a quarrel with us for the very purpose of a pretext to strip them of all they possessed or is it likely if the native french manufacturers and traders were capable of rivalling us in point of skill that any frenchman would venture upon that ostentatious display of wealth which a large cottonmill for instance requires when he knows that by so doing he would only draw upon himself a glance of the greedy eye of government soon to be followed by a squeeze from its rapacious hand but i have dwelt too long upon this the sum of what i think by conversation i could convince you of is that your comparative estimate is erroneous and materially so inasmuch as it makes no allowance for the increasing superiority which a state supposed to be independent and equitable in its dealings to its subjects must have over an oppressive government and none for the time which is necessary to give prosperity to peaceful arts even if the government should improve our country has a mighty and daily growing forest of this sort of wealth whereas in france the trees are not yet put into the ground for my own part i do not think it possible that france with all her command of territory and coast can outstrip us in naval power unless she could previously by her land power cut us off from timber and naval stores necessary for the building and equipment of our fleet in that intellectual superiority which as i have mentioned we possess over her we should find means to build as many ships as she could build and also could procure sailors to man them the same energy would furnish means for maintaining the men and if they could be fed and maintained they would surely be produced why then am i for war with france 1st because i think our naval superiority may be more cheaply maintained and more easily by war than by peace and because i think that if the war were conducted upon those principles of martial policy which you so admirably and nobly enforce united with or rather bottomed upon those notions of justice and right and that knowledge of and reverence for the moral sentiments of mankind which in my tract i attempted to portray and illustrate the tide of military success would immediately turn in our favour and we should find no more difficulty in reducing the french power than gustavus adolphus did in reducing that of the german empire in his day and here let me express my zealous thanks for the spirit and beauty with which you have pursued through all its details the course of martial policy which you recommend too much praise cannot be given to this which is the great body of your work i hope that it will not be lost upon your countrymen but as i said before i rather wish to dwell upon those points in which i am dissatisfied with your essay let me then come at once to a fundamental principle you maintain that as the military power of france is in progress ours must be so also or we must perish in this i agree with you yet you contend also that this increase or progress can only be brought about by conquests permanently established upon the continent and calling in the doctrines of the writers upon the law of nations to your aid you are for beginning with the conquest of sicily and so on through italy switzerland c c now it does not appear to me though i should rejoice heartily to see a british army march from calabria triumphantly to the heart of the alps and from holland to the centre of germanyyet it does not appear to me that the conquest and permanent possession of these countries is necessary either to produce those resources of men or money which the security and prosperity of our country requires all that is absolutely needful for either the one or the other is a large experienced and seasoned army which we cannot possess without a field to fight in and that field must be somewhere upon the continent therefore as far as concerns ourselves and our security i do not think that so wide a space of conquered country is desirable and as a patriot i have no wish for it if i desire it it is not for our sakes directly but for the benefit of those unhappy nations whom we should rescue and whose prosperity would be reflected back upon ourselves holding these notions it is natural highly as i rate the importance of military power and deeply as i feel its necessity for the protection of every excellence and virtue that i should rest my hopes with respect to the emancipation of europe more upon moral influence and the wishes and opinions of the people of the respective nations than you appear to do as i have written in my pamphlet on the moral qualities of a people must its salvation ultimately depend something higher than military excellence must be taught as higher something more fundamental as more fundamental adopting the opinion of the writers upon the laws of nations you treat of conquest as if conquest could in itself nakedly and abstractedly considered confer rights if we once admit this proposition all morality is driven out of the world we conquer italythat is we raise the british standard in italyand by the aid of the inhabitants we expel the french from the country and have a right to keep it for ourselves this if i am not mistaken is not only implied but explicitly maintained in your book undoubtedly if it be clear that the possession of italy is necessary for our security we have a right to keep possession of it if we should ever be able to master it by the sword but not because we have gained it by conquest therefore may we keep it no the sword as the sword can give no rights but because a great and noble nation like ours cannot prosper or exist without such possession if the fact were so we should then have a right to keep possession of what by our valour we had acquirednot otherwise if these things were matter of mere speculation they would not be worth talking about but they are not so the spirit of conquest and the ambition of the sword never can confer true glory and happiness upon a nation that has attained power sufficient to protect itself your favourites the romans though no doubt having the fear of the carthaginians before their eyes yet were impelled to carry their arms out of italy by ambition far more than by a rational apprehension of the danger of their condition and how did they enter upon their career by an act of atrocious injustice you are too well read in history for me to remind you what that act was the same disregard of morality followed too closely their steps everywhere their ruling passion and sole steady guide was the glory of the roman name and the wish to spread the roman power no wonder then if their armies and military leaders as soon as they had destroyed all foreign enemies from whom anything was to be dreaded turned their swords upon each other the ferocious cruelties of sylla and marius of catiline and of antony and octavius and the despotism of the empire were the necessary consequences of a long course of action pursued upon such blind and selfish principles therefore admiring as i do your scheme of martial policy and agreeing with you that a british military power may and that the present state of the world requires that it ought to be predominant in italy and germany and spain yet still i am afraid that you look with too much complacency upon conquest by british arms and upon british military influence upon the continent for its own sake accordingly you seem to regard italy with more satisfaction than spain i mean you contemplate our possible exertions in italy with more pleasure merely because its dismembered state would probably keep it more under our swayin other words more at our mercy now i think there is nothing more unfortunate for europe than the condition of germany and italy in these respects could the barriers be dissolved which have divided the one nation into neapolitans tuscans venetians c and the other into prussians hanoverians c and could they once be taught to feel their strength the french would be driven back into their own land immediately i wish to see spain italy france germany formed into independent nations nor have i any desire to reduce the power of france further than may be necessary for that end woe be to that country whose military power is irresistible i deprecate such an event for great britain scarcely less than for any other land scipio foresaw the evils with which rome would be visited when no carthage should be in existence for her to contend with if a nation have nothing to oppose or to fear without it cannot escape decay and concussion within universal triumph and absolute security soon betray a state into abandonment of that discipline civil and military by which its victories were secured if the time should ever come when this island shall have no more formidable enemies by land than it has at this moment by sea the extinction of all that it previously contained of good and great would soon follow indefinite progress undoubtedly there ought to be somewhere but let that be in knowledge in science in civilization in the increase of the numbers of the people and in the augmentation of their virtue and happiness but progress in conquest cannot be indefinite and for that very reason if for no other it cannot be a fit object for the exertions of a people i mean beyond certain limits which of course will vary with circumstances my prayer as a patriot is that we may always have somewhere or other enemies capable of resisting us and keeping us at arms length do i then object that our arms shall be carried into every part of the continent no such is the present condition of europe that i earnestly pray for what i deem would be a mighty blessing france has already destroyed in almost every part of the continent the detestable governments with which the nations have been afflicted she has extinguished one sort of tyranny but only to substitute another thus then have the countries of europe been taught that domestic oppression if not manfully and zealously repelled must sooner or later be succeeded by subjugation from without they have tasted the bitterness of both cups have drunk deeply of both their spirits are prepared for resistance to the foreign tyrant and with our help i think they may shake him off and under our countenance and following as far as they are capable our example they may fashion to themselves making use of what is best in their own ancient laws and institutions new forms of government which may secure posterity from a repetition of such calamities as the present age has brought forth the materials of a new balance of power exist in the language and name and territory of spain in those of france and those of italy germany russia and the british isles the smaller states must disappear and merge in the large nations and widespread languages the possibility of this remodelling of europe i see clearly earnestly do i pray for it and i have in my mind a strong conviction that your invaluable work will be a powerful instrument in preparing the way for that happy issue yet still we must go deeper than the nature of your labour requires you to penetrate military policy merely will not perform all that is needful nor mere military virtues if the roman state was saved from overthrow by the attack of the slaves and of the gladiators through the excellence of its armies yet this was not without great difficulty22 and rome would have been destroyed by carthage had she not been preserved by a civic fortitude in which she surpassed all the nations of the earth the reception which the senate gave to terentius varro after the battle of cannae is the sublimest event in human history what a contrast to the wretched conduct of the austrian government after the battle at wagram england requires as you have shown so eloquently and ably a new system of martial policy but england as well as the rest of europe requires what is more difficult to give ita new course of education a higher tone of moral feeling more of the grandeur of the imaginative faculties and less of the petty processes of the unfeeling and purblind understanding that would manage the concerns of nations in the same calculating spirit with which it would set about building a house now a state ought to be governed at least in these times the labours of the statesman ought to advance upon calculations and from impulses similar to those which give motion to the hand of a great artist when he is preparing a picture or of a mighty poet when he is determining the proportions and march of a poemmuch is to be done by rule the great outline is previously to be conceived in distinctness but the consummation of the work must be trusted to resources that are not tangible though known to exist much as i admire the political sagacity displayed in your work i respect you still more for the lofty spirit that supports it for the animation and courage with which it is replete for the contempt in a just cause of death and danger by which it is ennobled for its heroic confidence in the valour of your countrymen and the absolute determination which it everywhere expresses to maintain in all points the honour of the soldiers profession and that of the noble nation of which you are a memberof the land in which you were born no insults no indignities no vile stooping will your politics admit of and therefore more than for any other cause do i congratulate my country on the appearance of a book which resting in this point our national safety upon the purity of our national character will i trust lead naturally to make us at the same time a more powerful and a highminded nation       affectionately yours w wordsworth23  22 totis imperii viribus consurgitur says the historian speaking of the war of the gladiators  23 memoirs vol i pp 40620                                        letter enclosing the preceding to a friend unnamed  my dear sir  i have taken the liberty of addressing the enclosed to you with a wish that you would be so kind as to send it by the twopenny post the letter though to a personal acquaintance and to some degree a friend is upon a kind of public occasion and consists of comments upon captain pasleys lately published essay on the military policy of great britain a work which if you have not seen i earnestly recommend to your careful perusal i have sent my letter unsealed in order that if you think it worth while you may read it which would oblige me you may begin with those words in the 1st page now for your book which you will see are legible being transcribed by a friend the rest in my own hand is only an apology for not writing sooner save that there are two sonnets which if you like you may glance your eye over do not forget to put a wafer on the letter after you have done with it  will you excuse me if i find myself unable to forbear saying upon this occasion a few words concerning the conduct pursued with respect to foreign affairs by the party with whom you act i learn from a private quarter of unquestionable authority that it was lord grenvilles intention had he come into power as he lately expected to have recalled the army from portugal in the name of my country of our virtuous and suffering allies and of human nature itself i give thanks to providence who has restored the kings health so far as to prevent this intention being put into practice hitherto the transgressions of the present ministry are grievous but excepting only a deliberate and direct attack upon the civil liberty of our own country there cannot be any thing in a minister worse than a desponding spirit and the lack of confidence in a good cause if lord g and mr ponsonby think that the privilege allowed to oppositionmanoeuvering justifies them in speaking as they do they are sadly mistaken and do not discern what is becoming the times but if they sincerely believe in the omnipotence of buonaparte upon the continent they are the dupes of their own fears and the slaves of their own ignorance do not deem me presumptuous when i say that it is pitiable to hear lord grenville talking as he did in the late debate of the inability of great britain to take a commanding station as a military power and maintaining that our efforts must be essentially he means exclusively naval we have destroyed our enemies upon the sea and are equally capable of destroying him upon land rich in soldiers and revenues as we are we are capable availing ourselves of the present disposition of the continent to erect there under our countenance and by a wise application of our resources a military power which the tyrannical and immoral government of buonaparte could not prevail against and if he could not overthrow it he must himself perish lord g grudges two millions in aid of portugal which has eighty thousand men in arms and what they can perform has been proved yet lord g does not object to our granting aid to a great military power on the continent if such could he found nay he begs of us to wait till that fortunate period arrives whence does lord g from what quarter does he expect it from austria from the prussian monarchy brought to life again from russia or lastly from the confederacy of the rhine turning against their creator and fashioner is the expectation of the jews for their messiah or of the portugueze for st sebastian more extravagant but lord g ought to know that such a military power does already exist upon the peninsula formless indeed compared with what under our plastic hands it may become yet which has proved itself capable of its giving employment during the course of three years to at least five hundred thousand of the enemys best troops an important fact has been proved that the enemy cannot drive us from the peninsula we have the point to stand upon which archimedes wished for and we may move the continent if we persevere let us prepare to exercise in spain a military influence like that which we already possess in portugal and our affairs must improve daily and rapidly whatever money we advance for portugal and spain we can direct the management of it an inestimable advantage which with relation to prussia russia or austria we never possessed besides how could we govern the purposes of those states when that inherent imbecility and cowardice leave them no purpose or aim to which they can steadily adhere of themselves for six weeks together military powers so these states have been called a strange misnomer they are weaknessesa true though illsounding titleand not powers polybius tells us that hannibal entered into italy with twenty thousand men and that the aggregate forces of italy at that time amounted to seven hundred and sixty thousand foot and horse with the roman discipline and power to head that mighty force gustavus adolphus invaded germany with thirteen thousand men the emperor at that time having between two and three hundred thousand warlike and experienced troops commanded by able generals to oppose to him let these facts and numerous others which history supplies of the same kind be thought of and let us hear no more of the impossibility of great britain girt round and defended by the sea and an invincible navy becoming a military power great britain whose troops surpass in valour those of all the world and who has an army and a militia of upwards of three hundred thousand men do reflect my dear sir upon the materials which are now in preparation upon the continent hannibal expected to be joined by a parcel of the contented barbarian gauls in the north of italy gustavus stood forth as the champion of the protestant interest how feeble and limited each of these auxiliary sentiments and powers compared with what the state of knowledge the oppressions of their domestic governments and the insults and injuries and hostile cruelties inflicted by the french upon the continental nations must have exerted to second our arms whenever we shall appear in that force which we can assume and with that boldness which would become us and which justice and human nature and patriotism call upon us to put forth farewell most truly yours  w wordsworth  shall we see you this summer i hope so     iv two addresses to the freeholders of westmoreland  1818  note  on the occasion of these two addresses and other related matters see preface in the present volume g       two addresses to the freeholders of westmoreland                                      kendal  printed by airey and bellingham 1818  advertisement                                       the author thinks it proper to advise his reader that he alone is responsible for the sentiments and opinions expressed in these sheets gladly would he have availed himself of the judgment of others if that benefit could have been had without subjecting the persons consulted to the possibility of blame for having sanctioned any view of the topics under consideration which either from its erroneousness might deserve or from party feelings or other causes might incur censure  the matter comprised in these pages was intended to compose a succession of addresses to be printed in the kendal chronicle and a part of the first was published through that channel the intention was dropped for reasons well known it is now mentioned in order to account for the disproportion in the length of the two addresses and an arrangement of matter in some places different from what would otherwise have been chosen a portion also has appeared in the carlisle patriot  it is of little importance to add that this publication has been delayed by unavoidable engagements of the printer  march 26 1818                                       to the reader  the new candidate has appeared amongst us and concluded for the present his labours in the county they require no further notice here than an expression of thanks for the success with which he has cooperated with the author of these pages to demonstrate by the whole of his itinerant proceedings that the vital principle of the opposition ostensibly headed by him is at enmity with the bonds by which society is held together and government maintained  april 4 1818  to the freeholders c                                       gentlemen  two months have elapsed since warning was given of an intention to oppose the present representatives of the county of westmoreland at the ensuing election yet till so late a period as the 26th of january no avowal of such intention appeared from any quarter entitling it to consideration for as to the body of men calling itself the london committee there is not up to this hour i believe any public evidence even of its existence except certain notices signed by two obscure individuals but in the minds of those naturally interested in the welfare of the county a ferment was excited by various devices inflammatory addresses were busily circulated men laying claim to the flattering character of reformers of abuses became active and as this stir did not die away they who foresaw its bearings and tendencies were desirous that if there were any just grounds for discontent the same should be openly declared by persons whose characters and situations in life would be a pledge for their having proceeded upon mature deliberation at length a set of resolutions have appeared from a meeting of dissatisfied freeholders holden in a town which if not the principal in point of rank is the most populous opulent and weighty in the county among those who composed this meeting the first visible authentic body which the opposition has produced are to be found persons answering to the description above givenmen from whom might have been expected in the exposition of their complaints sound sense as to the nature of the grievances and rational views as to the mode of removing themhave such expectations if entertained been fulfilled  the first resolution unanimously agreed upon by this meeting is couched in these words it is impossible for us as freeholders to submit any longer to a single family however respectable naming both members for the county what if this leading article had been thus expressed that it is injurious to the interests and derogatory to the dignity of the county of westmoreland that both its representatives should be brought into parliament by the influence of one family words to this effect would surely have given the sense of the resolution as proceeding from men of cool reflection and offered nakedly to the consideration of minds which it was desired should be kept in a similar state but we cannot submit any longerif the intention was to mislead and irritate such language was well adapted for the purpose but it ill accords with the spirit of the next resolution which affirms that the meeting is wholly unconnected with any political party and thus disclaiming indirectly those passions and prejudices that are apt to fasten upon political partisans implicitly promises that the opinions of the meeting shall be conveyed in terms suitable to such disavowal did the persons in question imagine themselves in a state of degradation on their own word we must believe they did and no one could object to their employing among each other such language as gave vent to feelings proceeding from that impression in a way that gratified themselves but by publishing their resolutions they shew that they are not communing for the sake of mutual sympathy but to induce others to participate a sentiment which probably they are strangers to we submit to the law and to those who are placed in authority over us while in the legitimate exercise of their functionswe submit to the decrees of providence because they are not to be resisteda coward submits to be insulteda pusillanimous wretch to be despisedand a knave if detected must submit to be scouteda slave submits to his taskmaster but the freeholders of westmoreland cannot in reason be said to submit to the house of lowther naming their representatives unless it can be proved that those representatives have been thrust upon them by an unjustifiable agency and that they owe their seats not to the free suffrages and frank consent of their constituents but to unfair means whether in the shape of seduction or threat if there be an indignity on one side there must have been a wrong done on the other and to make out this point it ought to have been shewn that some other person qualified by his property his education his rank and character had stood forth and offered himself to represent you freeholders of westmoreland in parliament and that in this attempt he had been crushed by the power of a single family careless of the mode in which that power was exercised i appeal to those who have had an opportunity of being acquainted with the noble lord who is at the head of that family whether they are of opinion that any consideration of his own interest or importance in the state would have induced him to oppose such a candidate provided there was reason for believing that the unabused sense of the county was with him if indeed a candidate supposed to be so favoured by the county had declared himself an enemy to the general measures of administration for some years past those measures have depended on principles of conduct of such vast importance that the noble lord must needs have endeavoured as far as prudence authorised to frustrate an attempt which in conscience he could not approve  i affirm then that as there was no wrong there is no indignitythe present members owe their high situation to circumstances local and national they are there because no one else has presented himself or for some years back has been likely to present himself with pretensions the reasonableness of which could enter into competition with theirs this is in some points of view a misfortune but it is the fact and no class of men regret it more than the independent and judicious adherents of the house of lowther men who are happy and proud to rally round the nobleman who is the head of that house in defence of rational liberty men who know that he has proved himself a faithful guardian to the several orders of the statethat he is a tried enemy to dangerous innovationsa condemner of fantastic theoriesone who understands mankind and knows the heights and levels of human nature by which the course of the streams of social action is determineda lover of the people but one who despises as far as relates to his own practice and deplores in respect to that of others the shows and pretences and all the false arts by which the plaudits of the multitude are won and the people flattered to the common ruin of themselves and their deceivers  but after all let us soberly enquire to what extent it is really an evil that two persons so nearly connected in blood should represent this county and first looking at the matter locally what is that portion of england known by the name of the county of westmoreland a county which indeed the natives of it love and are justly proud of a region famous for the production of shrewd intelligent brave active honest enterprising menbut it covers no very large space on the map the soil is in general barren the country poor accordingly and of necessity thinly inhabited there are in england single towns even of a third or fourth rate importance that contain a larger population than is included within the limits of westmoreland from the foot of wrynose to the sides of stainmoor and from the banks of the kent to those of the emont is it then to be wondered at considering the antiquity of the house of lowther that circumstances should have raised it to the elevation which it holds in a district so thinly peopled neither rich in the products of agriculture nor in the materials of commerce and where it is impossible that any considerable number of country gentlemen of large or as our ancestors expressed themselves of notable estate can coexist it must unavoidably happen therefore that at all times there will be few persons in such a county furnished with the stable requisites of property rank family and personal fitness that shall point them out for such an office and dispose them to covet it by insuring that degree of public confidence which will make them independent comfortable and happy in discharging the duties which it imposes this small number will at particular periods be liable to be reduced that this has been the case is apparent upon retrospect and that the number is not large at present may be inferred from the difficulty with which a third candidate has been found and from the insignificant station which the individual who has at length obeyed the call of the discontented holds in the county  with these local circumstances general considerations have powerfully cooperated to place the representation of westmoreland where it now is and to this second division of the subject i particularly request your attention gentlemen as reflecting patriots  looking up to the government with respectful attachment we all acknowledge that power must be controlled and checked or it will be abused hence the desirableness of a vigorous opposition in the house of commons and hence a wish grounded upon a conviction of general expediency that the opposition to ministry whose head and chief seat of action are in parliament should be efficaciously diffused through all parts of the country on this principle the two grand divisions of party under our free government are founded conscience regulated by expediency is the basis honour binding men to each other in spite of temptation is the cornerstone and the superstructure is friendship protecting kindness gratitude and all the moral sentiments by which selfinterest is liberalized such is party looked at on the favourable side cogent moral inducements therefore exist for the prevalence of two powerful bodies in the practice of the state spreading their influence and interests throughout the country and on political considerations it is desirable that the strength of each should bear such proportion to that of the other that while ministry are able to carry into effect measures not palpably injurious the vigilance of opposition may turn to account being backed by power at all times sufficient to awe but never were that possible except when supported by manifest reason to intimidate  such apportioning of the strength of the two parties has existed such a degree of power the opposition formerly possessed and if they have lost that salutary power if they are dwindled and divided they must ascribe it to their own errors they are weak because they have been unwise they are brought low because when they had solid and high ground to stand upon they took a flight into the air to have hoped too ardently of human nature as they did at the commencement of the french revolution was no dishonour to them as men but politicians cannot be allowed to plead temptations of fancy or impulses of feeling in exculpation of mistakes in judgement grant however to the enthusiasm of philanthropy as much indulgence as it may call for it is still extraordinary that in the minds of english statesmen and legislators the naked absurdity of the means did not raise a doubt as to the attainableness of the end mr fox captivated by the vanities of a system founded upon abstract rights chaunted his expectations in the house of parliament and too many of his friends partook of the illusion the most sagacious politician of his age broke out in an opposite strain time has verified his predictions the books remain in which his principles of foreknowledge were laid down but as the author became afterwards a pensioner of state thousands in this country of free opinions persist in asserting that his divination was guesswork and that conscience had no part in urging him to speak that warning voice proved vain the party from whom he separated proceededconfiding in splendid oratorical talents and ardent feelings rashly wedded to novel expectations when common sense uninquisitive experience and a modest reliance on old habits of judgement when either these or a philosophic penetration were the only qualities that could have served them  how many private individuals at that period were kept in a rational course by circumstances supplying restraints which their own understandings would not have furnished through what fatality it happens that bodies of men are so slow to profit in a similar way by circumstances affecting their prosperity the opposition seem never to have enquired they could not avoid observing that the holders of property throughout the country being mostly panicstricken by the proceedings in france turned instinctively against the admirers of the new systemand as security for property is the very basis of civil society how was it possible but that reflecting men who perceived this truth should mistrust those representatives of the people who could not have acted less prudently had they been utterly unconscious of it but they had committed themselves and did not retract either from unabating devotion to their cause or from false honour and that selfinjuring consistency the favourite sister of obstinacy which the mixed conscience of mankind is but too apt to produce meanwhile the tactics of parliament must continue in exercise on some system or other their adversaries were to be annoyed at any rate and so intent were they upon this that in proportion as the entrenchments of ministry strengthened the assaults of opposition became more careless and desperate  while the war of words and opinions was going forward in this country europe was deluged with blood they in whose hands power was vested among us in course of time lost ground in public opinion through the failure of their efforts parties were broken and recomposed but men who are brought together less by principle than by events cannot cordially cooperate or remain long united the opponents of the war in this middle stage and desponding state of it were not popular and afterwards when the success of the enemy made the majority of the nation feel that peace dictated by him could not be lasting and they were bent on persevering in the struggle the party of opposition persisted in a course of action which as their countenance of the doctrine of the rights of man had brought their understandings into disrepute cast suspicion on the soundness of their patriotic affections their passions made them blind to the differences between a state of peace and war above all such a war as prescribing rules for their own conduct they were ignorant or never bore in mind that a species of hostility which had there been no foreign enemy to resist might have proved useful and honourable became equally pernicious and disgraceful when a formidable foe threatened us with destruction  i appeal to impartial recollection whether during the course of the late awful struggle and in the latter stages of it especially the antagonists of ministers in the two houses of parliament did not for the most part conduct themselves more like allies to a military despot who was attempting to enslave the world and to whom their own country was an object of paramount hatred than like honest englishmen who had breathed the air of liberty from their cradles if any state of things could supply them with motives for acting in that manner they must abide by the consequences they must reconcile themselves as well as they can to dislike and to disesteem the unavoidable results of behaviour so unnatural peace has indeed come but do they who deprecated the continuance of the war and clamoured for its close on any terms rejoice heartily in a triumph by which their prophecies were belied did they lend their voices to swell the hymn of transport that resounded through our land when the archenemy was overthrown are they pleased that inheritances have been restored and that legitimate governments have been reestablished on the continent and do they grieve when those reestablished governments act unworthily of the favour which providence has shown them do not too many rather secretly congratulate themselves on every proof of imbecility or misconduct there exhibited and endeavour that attention shall be exclusively fixed on those melancholy facts as if they were the only fruits of a triumph to which we britons owe that we are a fearless undishonoured and rapidly improving people and the nations of the continent owe their very existence as selfgoverned communities  the party of opposition or what remains of it has much to repent of many humiliating reflections must pass through the minds of those who compose it and they must learn the hard lesson to be thankful for them as a discipline indispensible to their amendment thus only can they furnish a sufficient nucleus for the formation of a new body nor can there be any hope of such body being adequate to its appropriate service and of its possessing that portion of good opinion which shall entitle it to the respect of its antagonists unless it live and act for a length of time under a distinct conception of the kind and degree of hostility to the executive government which is fairly warrantable the party must cease indiscriminately to court the discontented and to league itself with men who are athirst for innovation to a point which leaves it doubtful whether an opposition that is willing to cooperate with such agitators loves as it ought to do and becomingly venerates the happy and glorious constitution in church and state which we have inherited from our ancestors  till not a doubt can be left that this indispensible change has been effected freeholders of westmoreland you will remainbut to exhort is not my present businessi was retracing the history of the influence of one family and have shewn that much of it depends upon that steady support given by them to government during a long and arduous struggle and upon the general course of their public conduct which has secured your approbation and won for them your confidence let us now candidly ask what practical evil has arisen from this preponderance is it not obvious that it is justified by the causes that have produced it as far as it concerns the general wellbeing of the kingdom it would be easy to shew that if the democratic activities of the great towns and of the manufacturing districts were not counteracted by the sedentary power of large estates continued from generation to generation in particular families it would be scarcely possible that the laws and constitution of the country could sustain the shocks which they would be subject to and as to our own county that man must be strangely prejudiced who does not perceive how desireable it is that some powerful individual should he attached to it who by his influence with government may facilitate the execution of any plan tending with due concern for general welfare to the especial benefit of westmoreland the influence of the house of lowther is we acknowledge great but has a case been made out that this influence has been abused the voice of gratitude is not loud out of delicacy to the benefactor but if all who know were at liberty to speak to the measure of their wishes the services which have been rendered by the house of lowther to westmoreland its natives and inhabitants would be proclaimed in a manner that would confound detractionyet the kendal committee of the 26th of januarywithout troubling themselves to inquire how far this preponderance is a reasonable thing and what have been its real and practical effectsare indignant their blood is roused and they are determined to address their brother freeholders and call upon them to recover the exercise of the elective franchise which has been withheld from them for half a centurywithheld from them suppose these champions in this their first declaration of hostility had said to recover the elective franchise which we have suffered to lie dormant but nowho would take blame to himself when by so doing he is likely to break the force of the indignation which whether deserved or not he hopes to heap upon his adversary this is politicbut does it become professing men does it suit those who set forward with a proclamation that they are select spirits free from party ties and of course superior to those artifices and misrepresentationsto those groundless or immoderate aversionswhich men who act in parties find it so difficult to keep clear of  what degree of discernment and consistency an assembly of persons who begin their labours with such professions and publish such intentions have shewn by making choice of the individual whom they have recommended as eminently entitled to their confidence and qualified to assist them in attaining their end may become the fit subject of a future enquiry  second address   gentlemen  much of my former address originated in deference to that sense of right which is inseparable from the minds of enlightened patriots passing from local considerations i wrote under a belief that whatever personal or family leanings might prevail among you you would be moved by a wish to see the supporters of his majestys ministers and their opponentspossessed relatively to each other of that degree of strength which might render both parties in their several capacities most serviceable to the state i noticed that this just proportion of strength no longer remained and shewed that the opposition had caused it to be destroyed by holding from the beginning of the french revolution such a course as introduced in parliament discord among themselves deprived them in that house and elsewhere of the respect which from their adversaries they had been accustomed to command turned indifferent persons into enemies and alienated throughout the island the affections of thousands who had been proud to unite with them this weakness and degradation deplored by all true friends of the commonweal was sufficiently accounted for without even adverting to the fact thatwhen the disasters of the war had induced the country to forgive and in some degree to forget the alarming attachment of that party to french theories and power heightened by the popularity of hope and expectation was thrown into their handsthey disgusted even bigotted adherents by the rapacious use they made of that powerstooping to so many offensive compromises and committing so many faults in every department that a government of talents if such be the fruits of talent was proved to be the most mischievous sort of government which england had ever been troubled with so that whether in or out of place an evil genius seemed to attend them  how could all this happen for the fundamental reason that neither the religion the laws the morals the manners nor the literature of the country especially as contrasted with those of france were prized by the leaders of the party as they deserved it is a notorious fact that among their personal friends was scarcely to be found a single clergyman of distinctionso that how to dispose of their ecclesiastical patronage in a manner that might do them credit they were almost as ignorant as strangers landed for the first time in a foreign country this is not to be accounted for on any supposition since the education of men of rank naturally devolves on those members of our universities who choose the church for their profession but that of a repugnance on their part to associate with persons of grave character and decorous manners is the distracted remnant of the party now surviving improved in that respect the dazzling talents with which it was once distinguished have passed away pleasure and dissipation are no longer in that quarter exhibited to the world in such reconcilement with business as excited dispositions to forgive what could not be approved and a species of wonder not sufficiently kept apart from envy at the extraordinary gifts and powers by which the union was accomplished this injurious conjunction no longer exists so as to attract the eyes of the nation but we look in vain for signs that the opinions habits and feelings of the party are tending towards a restoration of that genuine english character by which alone the confidence of the sound part of the people can be recovered  the public life of the candidate who now for the first time solicits your suffrages my brother freeholders cannot however without injustice to that party be deemed a fair exponent of its political opinions it has indeed been too tolerant with mr brougham while he was labouring to ingraft certain sour cuttings from the wild wood of ultra reform on the reverend though somewhat decayed stock of that tree of whiggism which flourished proudly under the cultivation of our ancestors this indulgence and others like it will embolden him to aim at passing himself off as the delegate of opposition and the authorized pleader of their cause but time that judge from whom none but triflers appeal to conjecture has decided upon leading principles and main events and given the verdict against his clients while with a ready tongue the advocate of a disappointed party is filling one scale do you with a clear memory and apt judgment silently throw in what of right belongs to the other and the result will be that no sensible man among you who has supported the present members on account of their steady adherence to ministers can be induced to change his conduct or be persuaded that the hour is either come or approaching when for the sake of bringing the power of opposition in this county nearer to an equality with that of ministers it will be his duty to vote against those representatives in whom he has hitherto confided no if mr brougham had not individually passed far beyond the line of that partyif his conduct had been such that even they themselves would admit that he truly belonged to themthe exception would still lie against the general rule and will remain till the character of men and measures materially changes for the better assuredly on the one side if not for the worse on the other remember what england might have been with an administration countenancing french doctrines at the dawn of the french revolution and suffering them as it advanced to be sown with every wind that came across the channel think what was the state of europe before the french emperor the apparent and in too many respects the real idol of opposition was overthrown  numbers i am aware do not cease vehemently to maintain that the late war was neither just nor necessary that the ostensible and real causes of it were widely different that it was not begun and persisted in for the purpose of withstanding foreign aggression and in defence of social order but from unprincipled ambition in the powers of europe eager to seize that opportunity of augmenting their territories at the expence of distracted and enfeebled franceevents evertobelamented do i grant give too much colour to those affirmations but this was a war upon a large scale wherein many belligerents took part and no one who distinctly remembers the state of europe at its commencement will be inclined any more to question that the alleged motives had a solid foundation because then or afterwards others might mix with them than he would doubt that the maintenance of christianity and the reduction of the power of the infidels were the principal motives of the crusades because roving adventurers joining in those expeditions turned them to their own profit traders and hypocrites may make part of a caravan bound to mecca but it does not follow that a religious observance is not the prime object of the pilgrimage the political fanaticism it deserves no milder name that pervaded the manifesto issued by the duke of brunswick on his entry into france proves that he and the power whose organ he was were swayed on their march by an ambition very different from that of territorial aggrandizementat least if such ambition existed it is plain that feelings of another kind blinded them to the means of gratifying it nevertheless we must acknowledge the passion soon manifested itself and in a quarter where it was least excusable the seizure of valenciennes in the name of the emperor of germany was an act of such glaring rapacity and gave the lie so unfeelingly to all that had been professed that the then ministers of great britain doubtless opposed the intention with a strong remonstrance but the dictates of magnanimity which in such cases is but another word for high and sage policy would have beenthis unjust act must either be abandoned or great britain shall retire from a contest which if such principles are to govern or interfere with the conduct of it cannot but be calamitous a threat to this purpose was either not given or not acted upon hinc illae clades from that moment the alliance of the french loyalists with the coalesced powers seemed to have no ground of rational patriotism to stand upon their professed helpers became their worst enemies and numbers among them not only began to wish for the defeat of their false friends but joined themselves to their fellowcountrymen of all parties who were labouring to effect itbut the military successes of the french arising mainly from this want of principle in the confederate powers in course of time placed the policy and justice of the war upon a new footing however men might differ about the necessity or reasonableness of resorting to arms in the first instance things were brought to such a state that among the disinterested and dispassionate there could be but one opinion even if nothing higher than security was aimed at on the demand for the utmost strength of the nation being put forth in the prosecution of the war till it should assume a more hopeful aspectand now it was that ministers made ample amends for past subserviency to selfish coadjutors and proved themselves worthy of being entrusted with the fate of europe while the opposition were taking counsel from their fears and recommending despairwhile they continued to magnify without scruple the strength of the enemy and to expose misrepresent and therefore increase the weaknesses of their country his majestys ministers were not daunted though often discouraged they struggled up against adversity with fortitude and persevered heroically throwing themselves upon the honour and wisdom of the country and trusting for the issue to the decrees of a just providenceand for this determination everlasting gratitude will attend them  from the internal situation of france produced by the revolution war with the contiguous powers was inevitable sooner or later the evil must have been encountered and it was of little importance whether england took a share in it somewhat earlier than by fallible judgments might be deemed necessary or not the frankness with which the faults that were committed have been acknowledged entitles the writer to some regard when speaking from an intimate knowledge of the internal state of france at that time he affirms that the war waged against her was in a liberal interpretation of the words just and necessary at all events our nation viewed it in this light a large majority of the inhabitants of great britain called for the war and they who will the end will the means the war being deemed necessary taxes became indispensible for its support some might prefer one mode of raising themsome another but these are minor considerations public men united in bodies must act on great principles mutual deference is a fundamental requisite for the composition and efficiency of a party for if individual judgment is to be obtruded and insisted upon in subordinate concerns the march of business will be perpetually obstructed the leaders will not know whom they can depend upon and therefore will be at a loss what to recommend and how to act if a public man differs from his party in essentials conscience and honour demand that he should withdraw but if there be no such difference it is incumbent upon him to submit his personal opinion to the general sense he therefore who thought the prosecution of the war necessary could not condemn the public imposts on this consequence the steady adherents of ministers rest their claim to approbation and advance it boldly in defiance of the outcry raised against the government on account of the burthens which the situation of europe compelled it to lay upon the people  in matters of taste it is a process attended with little advantage and often injurious to compare one set of artists or writers with another but in estimating the merits of public men especially of two parties acting in direct opposition it is not only expedient but indispensible that both should be kept constantly in sight the truth or fallacy of french principles and the tendency good or bad of the revolution which sprang out of them and the necessity or nonnecessitythe policy or impolicyof resisting by war the encroachments of republican and imperial france these were the opposite grounds upon which each party staked their credit here we behold them in full contrast with each otherto whom shall the crown be given on whom has the light fallen and who are covered by shade and thick darkness  the magnanimity which resolved that for principles sake no efforts should be spared to crush a bestial despotism was acknowledged by every manly spirit whom party degenerating into faction had not vitiated that such was the dictate of confiding wisdom had long been inwardly felt and the prudence of the course was evinced by the triumphant issue but to the very completeness of this triumph may be indirectly attributed no small portion of the obloquy how heaped upon those advisers through whom it was achieved the power of napoleon buonaparte was overthrownhis person has disappeared from the theatre of europehis name has almost deserted the columns of her daily and weekly journalsbut as he has left no successor as there is no foreign tyrant of sufficient importance to attract hatred by exciting fear many honest english patriots must either find or set up something at home for the employment of those affections this is too natural to occasion surprise thousands are so framed that they are but languidly conscious of their love of an object unless while they feel themselves in an active state of aversion to something which they can regard as its oppositethus we see men who had been proud of their attachment to his majestys ministers during the awful struggle as soon as it was over allowing on the first temptation that proud attachment to be converted into immoderate suspicion and a long experienced gratitude into sudden alienationthrough this infirmity many were betrayed into taking part with the men whom they had heretofore despised or condemned and assisted them in reviling their own government for suffering among the states of the continent institutions to remain which the respective nations surely the best if not the only judges in the case were unwilling to part with and for having permitted things to be done either just and proper in themselves or if indeed abuses abuses of that kind which great britain had neither right to oppose nor power to prevent not a frenchman is in arms in spain but alas for the credit of the english cabinet ferdinand though a lawful appears to be a sorry king and the inquisition though venerated by the people of spain as a holy tribunal which has spread a protecting shade over their religion for hundreds of years is among protestants an abomination is that however a reason why we should not rejoice that spain is restored to the rank of an independent nation and that her resources do not continue at the disposal of a foreign tyrant for the annoyance of great britain prussia no longer receives decrees from the tuilleries but nothing we are told is gained by this deliverance because the sovereign of that country has not participated as far as became him a popular effervescence and has withheld from his subjects certain privileges which they have proved themselves to all but heated judgments not yet qualified to receive now if numbers can blame without cause the british cabinet for events falling below their wishes in cases remote from their immediate concerns the reasonableness of their opinions may well be questioned in points where selfish passion is touched to the quickyes in spite of the outcry of such men to the contrary every enlightened politician and discerning patriot however diffident as to what was the exact line of prudence in such arduous circumstances will reprobate the conduct of those who were for reducing public expenditure with a precipitation that might have produced a convulsion in the state the habeas corpus act is also our own near concern it was suspended some think without sufficient cause not so however the persons who had the best means of ascertaining the state of the country for they could have been induced to have recourse to a measure at all times so obnoxious by nothing less than a persuasion of its expediency but persuasion an objector will say is produced in many ways and even that degree of it which in these matters passes for conviction depends less upon external testimony than on the habits and feelings of those by whom the testimony is to be weighed and decided upon a council for the administration of affairs is far from being as favourably circumstanced as a tribunal of law for the party which is to pronounce upon the case has had to procure the evidence the sum and quality of which must needs have been affected by previously existing prejudices and by any bias received in the process of collecting itthe privileges of the subject one might think would never be unjustifiably infringed if it were only from considerations of selfinterest but power is apt to resort to unnecessary rigour in order to supply the deficiencies of authority forfeited by remissness it is also not unfrequently exerted merely to shew that it is possessed to shew this to others while power is a novelty and when it has long ceased to be so to prove it to ourselves impatience of mind moreover puts men upon the use of strong and coarse tools when those of lighter make and finer edge with due care might execute the work much better above all timidity flies to extremesif the elements were at our command how often would an inundation be called for when a fireengine would have proved equal to the servicemuch more might be urged in this strain and similar suggestions are all that the question will admit of for to suppose a gross appetite of tyranny in government would be an insult to the readers understanding happily for the inhabitants of westmoreland as no dispositions existing among them could furnish a motive for this restrictive measure so they will not be sorry that their remoteness from scenes of public confusion has placed them where they will be slow to give an unqualified opinion upon its merits yet it will not escape their discernment that if doubts might have been entertained whether the ignorant and distressed multitude in other parts of the island were actually brought to a state that justified the suspension of this law such doubts must have been weakened if not wholly removed by the subsequent behaviour of those in the upper ranks of society who in order to arraign the government and denounce the laws have seized every opportunity of palliating sedition if not of exculpating treason o far better to employ bad men in the detection of foul conspiracies than to excuse and shelterwould that i were allowed to confine myself to these wordsthan to reward and honourevery one that can contrive to make himself conspicuous by courses which wherever they are not branded with infamy find the national character in a state of degradation ominous if it should spread for the existence of all that ought to be dear to englishmen  but there are points of domestic policy in which his majestys ministers not appearing in counterview with their opponents are seen less to their honour speaking as an individual and knowing that here i differ from many freeholders with whom it is an honour to cooperate in the present struggle i must express my disapprobation of the patronage afforded by several persons in power to a society by which is virtually propagated the notion that priesthood and of course our own inestimable church establishment is superfluous i condemn their sanction and this attaches to the whole body of the malevolent and senseless abuse heaped upon the clergy in the matter of tythes through the medium of papers circulated by the agricultural board i deprecate the course which some among them take in the catholic question as unconstitutional and deplore the want of discernment evinced by men who persuade themselves that the discontents prevalent in ireland will be either removed or abated by such concession with these errors and weaknesses the members of the administration as appears to me may be justly reproached and a still heavier charge will lie against them if the correction of the poor laws be longer deferred may they exhibit in treating this momentous subject a tenderness of undeceived humanity on the one side and a sternness of enlightened statepolicy on the other thus and thus only can be checked immediately and in due course of time perhaps removed an evil by which one claim and title is set in array against another in a manner and to an extent that threatens utter subversion to the ancient frame of society  this is the heaviest burthen that now lies upon englandhere is a necessity for reform which as it cannot prosper unless it begin from the government and the upper ranks in society has no attraction for demagogues and mobexciting patriots they understand their game and as if the people could in no way be so effectually benefited as by rendering their government suspected they declaim against taxes and by their clamours for reduction of public expenditure drown the countersuggestions from the still small voice of moderation appealing to circumstances cry aloud and spare notretrench and lop off and so they proceeded with the huzza of the multitude at their heels till they had produced an extreme embarrassment in the government and instant distress and misery among the people  one of the most importunate of that class of economists which parliament contained now gentlemen solicits the honour of representing you and merit may perhaps be claimed for him for his exertions upon that occasion if it be praiseworthy to have contributed to cast shoals of our deserving countrymen adrift without regard to their past services that praise cannot be denied him if it be commendable to have availed himself of inordinate momentary passion to carry measures whereby the general weal was sacrificed whether designedly for the attainment of popularity or in the selfapplauding sincerity of a heated mind that praise is due to mr brougham and his coadjutors but to the judicious freeholders of westmoreland whether gentry or yeomanry rich or poor he will in vain adduce this or any other part of the recent conduct of opposition as a motive for strengthening their interests amongst us no freeholders we must wait assuring them that they shall have a reasonable portion of our support as soon as they have proved that they deserve it  till that time comes it will not grieve us that this county should supply two representatives to uphold the servants of the crown even if both should continue through unavoidable circumstances to issue from one family amongst us till that change takes place we will treat with scorn the senseless outcry for the recovery of an independence which has never been lost we are have been and will remain independent and the host of men respectable on every account who have publicly avowed their desire to maintain our present representatives in their seats deem it insolence to assert the contrary they are independent in every rational sense of the word acknowledging however that they rest upon a principle and are incorporated with an interest and this they regard as a proof that their affections are sane and their understandings superior to illusion but in certain vocabularies liberty is synonymous with licence and to be free as explained by some is to live and act without restraint in like manner independence according to the meaning of their interpretation is the explosive energy of conceitmaking blind havoc with expediency it is a presumptuous spirit at war with all the passive worth of mankind the independence which they boast of despises habit and timehonoured forms of subordination it consists in breaking old ties upon new temptations in casting off the modest garb of private obligation to strut about in the glittering armour of public virtue in sacrificing with jacobinical infatuation the near to the remote and preferring to what has been known and tried that which has no distinct existence even in imagination in renouncing with voluble tongue and vain heart every thing intricate in motive and mixed in quality in a downright passion of love for absolute unapproachable patriotism in short the independence these reformers bawl for is the worthy precursor of the liberty they adoremaking her first essay by starting out of the course for the pleasure of falling into the ditch and asserting her heavenborn vigour by soaring above the level of humanity in profession that it may more conspicuously appear how far she can fall below it in practice  to this spurious independence the friends of our present representatives lay no claim they assert in the face of the world that those representatives hold their seats by free electionthat has placed them there and why should we wish to change what we do not disapprove ofthat which could not have been without our approbation but this county has not for a long time been disturbed by electioneering contestsis there no species of choice then but that which is accompanied with commotion and clamour do silent acquiescence and deliberate consent pass for nothing being contented what could we seek for more being satisfied why should we stir for stirrings sake uproar and disorder even these we could tolerate on a justifying occasion but it is no sign of prudence to court them unnecessarily nor of temper to invite them wantonly he who resorts to substantial unruliness for the redress of imaginary grievances provokes certain mischief and often in the end produces calamity which would excite little compassion could it be confined to its original author  let those who think that they are degraded proclaim their own dishonour they choose to regard themselves as shackled conscriptswe know that we are selfequipped volunteers if they cannot be easy without branding themselves as slaves we would endeavour to dissuade them from such abuse of their freeagency but if they persist we cannot interfere with their humour only do not let them apply the iron to our foreheads they cry out that they have been in a lethargy why do they not add that they would have been asleep to this hour if they had not been roused in their vales and on their moors by an officious and impertinent call from the dirty alleys and obscure courts of the metropolis  if there be any honour in england the composition of the lowther party must be loyal and honourable its adversaries have admitted that a large majority they might have added nearly the whole of the leading gentry that the magistracyall but a single individual that the clergy and the members of the other liberal professionswith very few exceptions and a vast body of tradesmen and manufacturers and of substantial yeomen the honest greycoats of westmoreland have already declared themselves of one mind upon this appeal to their judgments looking to a distance they see the worth and opulence the weight of character and the dignity and respectability of station that distinguish the numerous list of freeholders resident in london who have jointly and publicly testified their satisfaction in the conduct of our present representatives the discontented see and know these things and are well aware also that the lowthers cannot justly be accused of inordinate and disrespectful family ambition inasmuch as it was not their wish that the county should be represented by two members of their house it has long been no secret that if any other gentleman of the county properly qualified whose political principles did not substantially differ from their own would have come forward he would have been sure of their support if they resist to the utmost persons of opposite principles the points in dispute being scarcely less than vital the more must they be respected by every zealous patriot and conscientious man  from what has been said it appears that the political influence of the family of lowther in westmoreland is the natural and reasonable consequence of a longcontinued possession of large propertyfurnishing with the judicious nobleman at its head an obvious support defence and instrument for the intelligent patriotism of the county i have said instrument and laid an emphasis upon the word because they who do not perceive that such is the truth are ignorant what shape in these cases social combinations must take in order to be efficient and be preserved every great family which many have rallied round from congeniality of public sentiment and for a political purpose seems in course of time to direct and in ordinary cases does direct its voluntary adherents but if it should violate their wishes and shock their sense of right it would speedily be reduced to such support only as it could command and then would be seen who had been principal and who secondary to whom had belonged in reality the place of agent to whom that of the employer the sticklers for emancipation a fashionable word in our times when rational acquiescence is deemed baseness of spirit and the most enlightened service passes for benighted servility have been free on numerous occasions to make the effort they are now making could any considerable person have been found to share their feeling they might have proposed a representative unacceptable to the family whose ascendancy they complain of with a certainty of securing his election had the goodwill of the freeholders been on their side what could possibly have prevented this trial but they talk as if some mysterious power had been used to their injury some call it a thraldom from withoutsome a drowsiness withinmr broughams kendal committee find fault with othersthe chairman of the appleby committee is inclined to fix the blame nearer home an accredited organ of their kendal committee tells you dogmatically from the bill of rights that elections shall be free and if asked how the citation bears upon the case his answer would most likely prove him of opinion that as noise is sometimes an accompaniment of freedom so there can be no freedom without noise or does the erudite constitutionalist take this method of informing us that the lord lieutenant has been accustomed to awe and controul the voters of this county as charles the second and his brother attempted to awe and controul those of the whole kingdom if such be the meaning of the writer and his employers what a pity westmoreland has not a lunatic asylum for the accommodation of the whole body in the same strain and from the same quarter we are triumphantly told that no peer of parliament shall interfere in elections how injurious then to these monitors and their cause the report of the hereditary high sheriffs massy subscription and his zealous countenance let him be entreated formally to contradict itor would they have one law for a peer who is a friend to administration and another for such as are its enemies is the same act to pass for culpable or praiseworthy just as it thwarts or furthers the wishes of those who pronounce a judgment upon it  the approvers of that order of things in which we live and move at this day as free englishmen are under no temptation to fall into these contradictions they acknowledge that the general question is one of great delicacy they admit that laws cannot be openly slighted without a breach of decorum even when the relations of things are so far altered that law looks one wayand reason another where such disagreement occurs in respect to those statutes which have the dignity of constitutional regulations the less that is said upon the subject the better for the country but writers who in such a case would gladly keep a silent course are often forced out of it by wily hypocrites and by others who seem unconscious that as there are pedants in literature and bigots in religion so are there precisians in politicsmen without experience who contend for limits and restraints when the power which those limits and restraints were intended to confine is long since vanished in the statutebooks enactments of great name stand unrepealed which may be compared to a stately oak in the last stage of decay or a magnificent building in ruins respect and admiration are due to both and we should deem it profaneness to cut down the one or demolish the other but are we therefore to be sent to the sapless tree for maygarlands or reproached for not making the mouldering ruin our place of abode government is essentially a matter of expediency they who perceive this and whose knowledge keeps pace with the changes of society lament that when time is gently carrying what is useless or injurious into the background he must be interrupted in the process by smatterers and sciolistsintent upon misdirecting the indignation of the simple and feeding the illhumours of the ignorant how often do such men for no better purpose remind their disciples of the standing order that declares it to be a high infringement of the liberties and privileges of the commons for any lord of parliament to concern himself in the election of members to serve for the commons in parliamentthis vote continues to be read publicly at the opening of every sessionbut practice rises up against it and without censuring the custom or doubting that it might be salutary when first established though it is not easily reconcileable with the eligibility of the eldest sons of peers to the lower house without any other qualification than their birth we may be permitted to be thankful that subsequent experience is not rendered useless to the living by the formal repetition of a voice from the tombs better is it that laws should remain till long trial has proved them an incumbrance than that they should be too hastily changed but this consideration need not prevent the avowal of an opinion which every practical statesman will confirm that if the property of the peers were not according to the will and by the care of the owners substantially represented by commoners to a proportionate extent under their influence their large estates would be for them little better than sand liable to be blown about in the desart and their privileges however useful to the country would become fugitive as foam upon the surface of the seasee note  i recollect a picture of diogenes going about in search of an honest man the philosopher bore a staff in one hand and a lantern in the other did the latter accompaniment imply that he was a persevering spirit who would continue his labour by night as well as by day or was it a stroke of satire on the part of the painter indicating that as diogenes was a surly and conceited cynic he preferred darkness for his time of search and a scanty and feeble light of his own carrying to the bounteous assistance of the sun in heaven how this might be with diogenes i know not but assuredly thus it fares with our reformersthe journal of some venal or factious scribbler is the black and smoky lantern they are guided by and the sunshine spread over the face of a happy country is of no use in helping them to find any object they are in search ofthe plea of the degraded state of the representation of westmoreland has been proved to be rottenif certain discontented persons desire to erect a building on a new plan why not look about for a firm foundation the dissatisfied ought honestly to avow that their aim is to elect a man whose principles differ from those of the present members to an extreme which takes away all hope or even wish that the interest he is to depend upon should harmonize with the interest hitherto prevalent in the county every thing short of this leaves them subject to a charge of acting upon false pretences unless they prefer being accused of harbouring a pharisaical presumption that would be odious were it not ridiculous if the state of society in westmoreland be as corrupt as they describe what in the name of wonder has preserved their purity away then with hypocrisy and hollow pretext let us be no longer deafened with a rant about throwing off intolerable burthens and repelling injuries and avenging insults say at once that you disapprove of the present members and would have others more to your own liking you have named your man or rather necessity has named him for you your ship was reduced to extremities it would have been better to abandon heryou thought otherwise will you listen then while i shew that the pilot who has taken charge of the vessel is ignorant of the soundings and that you will have cause to be thankful if he does not prove very desperate in the management of the helm  the lands of england you will recollect gentlemen are originally supposed to be holden by grants from the king our liege lord and the constitution of the country is accordingly a mellowed feudality the oldest and most respectable name for a county representative is knight of the shire in the reign of queen anne it was enacted that every knight of the shire the eldest sons of peers and a few others excepted shall have a clear estate of freehold or copyhold to the value of £600 per annum the same qualification continues to be required at this day and if the depreciation of money and other causes have injuriously affected the letter of the statute the spirit of it has not only been preserved in practice but carried still higher hence we scarcely scruple to take for granted that a county representative is a man of substantial landed property or stands in such known relation to a conspicuous estate that he has in it a valuable interest and that whoever be the possessor such estate may be looked upon as a pledge for his conduct  the basis of the elective franchise being property the legal condition of eligibility to a seat in parliament is the same our ancestors were not blind to the moral considerations which if they did not suggest these ordinances established a confidence in their expediency knowing that there could be no absolute guarantee for integrity and that there was no certain test of discretion and knowledge for bodies of men the prudence of former times turned to the best substitute human nature would admit of and civil society furnished this was property which shewed that a man had something that might be impaired or lost by mismanagement something which tended to place him above dependence from need and promised though it did not insure some degree of education to produce requisite intelligence to be a voter required a fixed property or a defined privilege to be voted for required more and the scale of demand rose with the responsibility incurred a knight of the shire must have double the estate required from a representative of a borough this is the old law and the course of things since has caused as was observed above that high office to devolve almost exclusively on persons of large estate or their near connections and why is it desirable that we should not deviate from this track if we wish for honesty we shall select men who not being subject to one of the strongest temptations to be otherwise than honest will incur heavier disgrace and meet with less indulgence if they disappoint us do we wish for sage conduct our choice will fall upon those who have the wisdom that lurks in circumstances to supply what may be deficient in their personal accomplishments but if there be a deficiency the fault must lie with the electors themselves when persons of large property are confided in we cannot plead want of opportunities for being acquainted with them men of large estates cannot but be men of wide concerns and thus it is that they become known in proportion extensive landed property entails upon the possessor many duties and places him in divers relations by which he undergoes a public trial is a man just in his dealings does he keep his promises does he pay his debts punctually has he a feeling for the poor is his family well governed is he a considerate landlord does he attend to his own affairs and are those of others which have fallen under his care diligently and judiciously managed answers to these questions where the subject of them has but an inconsiderable landed property can only be expected from a very narrow circle of neighboursbut place him at the head of a large estate and knowledge of what he is in these particulars must spread to a distance and it will be further known how he has acted as a magistrate and in what manner he has fulfilled the duties of every important office which he may have been called to by virtue of his possessions  such are the general principles of reason which govern law and justify practice in this weighty matter the decision is not to take place upon imagination or conjecture it is not to rest upon professions of the candidate or protestations of his friends as a county representative is to be voted for by manymany must have opportunities of knowing him or failing that intimate knowledge we require the pledge of condition the bond and seal of circumstance otherwise we withhold our confidence and cannot be prevailed upon to give to the opinions of an individual unbacked by these advantages the countenance and authority which they might derive from being supposed to accord with those of numerous constituents scattered over a wide country and therefore less liable to be affected by partial views or sudden and transitory passionto diminish their value  the freeholders of past times knew that their rights were most likely to repose in safety under the shade of rank and property adventurers had no estimation among them there was no room for themno place for them to appear inthink of this and ask if your fathers could they rise from their tombs would not have stared with no small degree of wonder upon the person who now solicits the suffrages of the county of westmoreland what are his rentswhere are his comings in he is engaged in an undertaking of great expencehow is that expence supplied from his own purse impossible where are the golden sinews which this champion of independence depends upon if they be furnished by those who have no natural connection with the county are we simple enough to believe that they dip their hands into their pockets out of pure goodwill to us may they not rather justly be suspected of a wish to embroil us for some sinister purpose at all events it might be some satisfaction would they shew themselves so that if we are to have a subscriptioncandidate we may know what sort of persons he is indebted to and at least be able to guess what they will require of him  the principles that have been laid down and the facts which have been adverted to might seem to render it superfluous to retrace the public conduct of mr brougham and to enquire whether in parliament or at the london tavern in palace yard or elsewhere those acts and courses to which he himself refers as his only recommendation do not still more unfit him for the trust which he covets but persons fond of novelty make light of deficiencies which would have admitted of no compensation in the judgment of our ancestors and the candidate being in no respect remarkable for deference to public opinion is willing to avail himself of newfangled expectations hence it becomes necessary to consider what would be the political value of the freeholds of westmoreland if the system of annual parliaments and universal suffrage countenanced by mr brougham should be acted upon but as there has been much saying and unsaying on this subject let us review the case  in the house of commons on the 17th of february 1817 lord cochrane affirmed that on a certain day which he named mr brougham at a dinner given at the london tavern to the friends of parliamentary reform used the following words or words to the same effectas often as we have required that parliaments should be chosen yearly and that the elective franchise should be extended to all who pay taxes we have been desired to wait for the enemy was at the gate and ready to avail himself of the discords attending our political contests in order to undermine our national independence this argument is gone and our adversaries must now look for another he had mentioned the two radical doctrines of yearly election and the franchise enjoyed by all paying taxes but it would be superfluous to reason in favour of them here where all are agreed on the subject  when this and other passages of like import were produced by lord c in a paper declared to be in mr broughams handwriting and to be a report made by himself of the speech then and there delivered did mr brougham deny that the handwriting was his and that those words had fallen from his pen as the best image that his own memory could furnish of what he had uttered nohe gave vent only to a vague complaint of groundless aspersions and accused certain persons of rashness and imprudence and of not waiting only for a few days longer when they would have had a full and fair opportunity of hearing his sentiments on this momentous subject he then acknowledged that some observations had fallen from him similar to what had been read by the noble lord and added that he then said or at least meant to be understood as saying he takes no notice of what he wrote or meant to be understood as writing what he still maintainedthat the power of election should he limited to those who paid direct taxes in other and more faithful words should be extended to all persons in that condition mr b proceeded manfully to scout the notion that the mere production of a speech delivered by him at a tavern would make him swerve from the line of his duty from the childish desire of keeping up an appearance of consistency  what then is the amount on the 23d of june 1814 it cannot be unfair to state as a fact that a vacancy in the representation of westminster was at that time looked for mr b either was or wished to be accounted an advocate of annual parliaments and suffrage to be enjoyed by all paying taxes and on the 17th of february 1817 when mr b in another place is reminded of these his avowed opinions he is utterly mute upon the subject of annual parliaments on the expediency of which he had before harangued at length and confines himself to announce as the sum of his then opinion that suffrage should be coextensive with direct taxation the question had two faces and mr b chooses only to look at one hard pressed as he was we cannot grant him this indulgence he has indeed denounced on other occasions the combined doctrines of annual parliaments and universal suffrage as chimerical and absurd though how near he came to the point of recommending both at the london tavern he is any thing but explicit in fact both as lord c shewed were virtually recommended by him but what does he think of annual parliaments in conjunction with his rectified opinion of suffrage coextensive with direct taxation here he leaves us wholly in the dark but if the turbulent workings of mr broughams mind and his fondness for contentious exhibition manifested on all possible occasions may be admitted as positive evidence to corroborate the negative which his silence on this point implies we are justified in believing that his passions were on that side whatever might be the bent of his cooler judgment but this is of little import  introduce suffrage coextensive with direct taxation and annual parliaments must unavoidably follow the clumsy simplicity of the one arrangement would in the eyes of its admirers match strikingly with the palpable expediency of the other such a union is equally suitable to an age of gross barbarism and an age of false philosophy it is amusing to hear this plan of suffrage for all who pay direct taxes recommended as consonant to the genius and spirit of the british constitution when in fact though sufficiently rash and hazardous it is no better than a timid plagiarism from the doctrine of the rights of man upon the model of that system it begins with flagrant injustice to chartered rights for if it were adopted the elective franchises that now exist would be depreciated accordingly an invidious process for those who would lose by the alteration and still more invidious for those to whom the privilege would not be suffered to descend alas i am trifling with the subject if the spirit of a people composed as that of england now is were once put into a ferment by organizing a democracy on this scheme and to this extent with a press as free and licentious as ours has long been what a flimsy barrier would remain to check the impetus of the excluded when in thousands they bore down upon the newly constituted house of assembly demanding to be placed upon a level with their fellowsubjects it would avail little to send a peaceofficer to enquirewhere are your vouchers shew us that the taxgatherer has been among you as soon as the petty artizans shopkeepers and pothouse keepers of our overgrown manufacturing towns and our enormous cities had each and all been invested with the right of voting the infection would spread like a plagueour neighbours on the continent tried this plan of direct taxation and in the beginning of the third year of their reform universal suffrage which had long ruled in spirit lorded it in form also from the pyrenees to the rhine and from the straits of calais to the shores of the mediterranean down went the throne of france and if we should take the same guide the throne of england must submit a second time to a like destiny most of us would deem this a considerable evilthe greatest political evil that could befal the land not so however our new candidate unless his opinion if indeed he ever held what may be called an opinion upon any thing has undergone important changes since the time when he expressed himself in the following wordswhen trade and the arts of civilized life have been carried to a certain length war is the greatest calamity that can befal a community any state in modern europe would be so completely ruined by the contests which athens and carthage easily supported that it would be a matter of total indifference whether the war was a series of victories or disasters the return of peace to france or england after half so long a contest as either the peloponnesian or the punic wars would be cheaply purchased by any conquest or revolution any change of dynasty or overthrow of governmentsee vol i p 13 of colonial policy by h brougham  the above was given to the world when we were at war with bonaparte and that part of the english nation who might read the book or hear of this authors doctrines was plainly told that in his estimation our constitutional liberties were not worthy of being defended at the cost of a 14 years war but the unsuspecting humane and hopecherishing adherents of the new candidate will tell you this does not prove that mr b sets a small price on the constitution and laws of england it only shews his tenderheartedness and his extreme aversion to the horrors and devastation of warhear then mr b on these points also let his serious friends take from his pen this pleasant description which proves at least that he can be jocular upon a subject that makes most men grave although they may not think twice seven years war so great a calamity as any conquest or revolution any change of dynasty or overthrow of governmenta species of pecuniary commutation he tells us has been contrived by which the operations of war are rendered very harmless they are performed by some hundreds of sailors fighting harmlessly on the barren plains of the ocean and some thousands of soldiers carrying on a scientific and regular and quiet system of warfare in countries set apart for the purpose and resorted to as the arena where the disputes of nations may be determined the prudent policy had been adopted of purchasing defeat at a distance rather than victory at home in this manner we paid our allies for being vanquished a few useless millions and a few more useless lives were sacrificed and the result was that we were amply rewarded by safety increased resources and real addition of power edinburgh review no ii and ascertained to be the writing of mr brougham by his having incorporated it in his colonial policy  the new candidate challenges the strictest scrutiny into his public life so that had we gone much farther than the above retrospect we should only have been fulfilling his own wishes personal enmity towards the subject the writer has none being in all that concerns the feelings of private life friendly to mr brougham rather than otherwise that his talents and habits of application entitle him to no common respect must be universally acknowledged but talents in themselves merely are in the eyes of the judicious no recommendation if a sword be sharp it is of the more importance to askwhat use it is likely to be put to in government if we can keep clear of mischief good will come of itself fitness is the thing to be sought and unfitness is much less frequently caused by general incapacity than by absence of that kind of capacity which the charge demands talent is apt to generate presumption and selfconfidence and no qualities are so necessary in a legislator as the opposites of thesewhich if they do not imply the existence of sagacity are the best substitutes for itwhether they produce in the general disposition of the mind an humble reliance on the wisdom of our forefathers and a sedate yielding to the pressure of existing things or carry the thoughts still higher to religious trust in a superintending providence by whose permission laws are ordered and customs established for other purposes than to be perpetually found fault with  these suggestions are recommended to the consideration of our new aspirant and of all those public men whose judgments are perverted and tempers soured by long struggling in the ranks of opposition and incessant bustling among the professors of reform i shall not recall to notice further particulars because time by softening asperities or removing them out of sight is a friend to benevolence although a rigorous investigation has been invited it is well that there is no need to run through the rash assertions the groundless accusations and the virulent invectives that disfigure the speeches of this neversilent member all these things offensive to moderate men are too much to the taste of many of mr broughams partizans in westmoreland but i call upon those who relish these deviations from fair and honourable dealingupon those also of his adherents who are inwardly ashamed of their champion on this accountand upon all the freeholders concerned in the general question to review what has been laid before them having done this they cannot but admit that mr broughams independence is a dark dependence which no one understandsand that if a jewel has been lost in westmoreland his are not the eyes by which it is to be found again if the dignity of knight of the shire is to be conferred he cannot be pronounced a fit person to receive it for whether my brother freeholders you look at the humbleness of his situation amongst country gentlemen or at his amphibious habits in the two elements of law and authorship and the odd vagaries he has played in both or whether he be tried by the daring opinions which by his own acknowledgment he has maintained in parliament and at public meetings on the subject of the elective franchise we meet with concurring proofs that he is altogether unfit to represent this or any other county  if notwithstanding the truth of this inference mr broughams talents information and activity make it desirable that he should have a place in the house of commons why cannot they who are of this opinion be content since he is already there what service he is capable of rendering may be as effectually performed should he never aspire beyond reelection to one of those seats which he now fills the good if any is to be looked for may then be obtained with much less risk of evil while he continues a member for a close borough his dangerous opinions are left mainly to the support of his own character and the arguments which his ingenuity can adduce to recommend them but should they derive that degree of sanction from the freeholders of a county which success in his present undertaking would imply they might become truly formidablelet every one then who cannot accompany mr b in his bold theories and does not go the length of admiring the composition of his political life be cautious how he betakes himself to such help in order to reduce within what he may deem due bounds the influence of a family prominent in the civil service of the county from the earliest times it is apparent if the writer has not employed his pen in vain that against this influence there is no just ground of complaint they who think with him will continue to uphold it as long as the family proves that it understands its own interest and honour by a judicious attention to ours and should it forfeit our respect by misconduct in the unavoidable decline of its political importance which would ensue we should not envy that house its splendid possessions or its manifold privileges knowing that some families must be permanently great and opulent or there would be no security for the possessions of the middle ranks or of the humble proprietor but looking at the present constitution and measure of this influence you cannot but perceive gentlemen that if there were indeed any thing in it that could justly be complained of our duty might still be to bear with the local evil as correcting an opposite extreme in some other quarter of the islandas a counterpoise of some weight elsewhere pressing injuriously upon the springs of social order how deplorable would be the ignorance how pitiful the pride that could prevent us from submitting to a partial evil for the sake of a general good in fine if a comprehensive survey enjoined no such sacrifice and even if all that the unthinking the malevolent and the desperate all that the deceivers and the deceived have conjointly urged at this time against the house of lowther were literally true you would be cautious how you sought a remedy for aristocratic oppression by throwing yourselves into the arms of a flaming democracy  government and civil society are things of infinite complexity and rash politicians are the worst enemies of mankind because it is mainly through them that rational liberty has made so little progress in the world you have heard of a profession to which the luxury of modern times has given birth that of landscapegardeners or improvers of pleasuregrounds a competent practitioner in this elegant art begins by considering every object that he finds in the place where he is called to exercise his skill as having a right to remain till the contrary be proved if it be a deformity he asks whether a slight alteration may not convert it into a beauty and he destroys nothing till he has convinced himself by reflection that no alteration no diminution or addition can make it ornamental modern reformers reverse this judicious maxim if a thing is before them so far from deeming that it has on that account a claim to continue and be deliberately dealt with its existence with them is a sufficient warrant for its destruction institutions are to be subverted practices radically altered and measures to be reversed all men are to change their places not because the men are objectionable or the place is injurious but because certain pretenders are eager to be at work being tired of both some are forward through pruriency of youthful talentsand greybeards hobble after them in whom number of years is a cloak for poverty of experience some who have much leisure because every affair of their own has withered under their mismanagement are eager to redeem their credit by stirring gratis for the publicothers having risen a little in the world take swimmingly to the trade of factious politics on their original stock of base manners and vulgar opinions some are theorists hot for practice others hacknied practitioners who never had a theory many are vain and must be busy and almost as many are needyand the spirit of justice deciding upon their own merits will not suffer them to remain at rest  the movement made among us my countrymen of westmoreland was preceded announced and prepared by such agitators disseminating falsehoods and misrepresentations equally mischievous whether they proceeded from wilful malice or presumptuous ignorance take warning in time be not persuaded to unite with them who whether they intend you injury or not cannot but prove your enemies let not yours be the first county in england which since the days of wilkes and after the dreadful example of france has given countenance to principles congenial to the vice profligacy and halfknowledge of westminster but which formerly were unheard of among us or known only to be detested places pensions and formidable things if you like but far better these with our king and constitution with our quiet firesides and flourishing fields than proscription and confiscation without them long wars and their unavoidable accompaniment heavy taxesboth these evils are liable to intemperate exaggeration but be they what they may would there be less of war and lighter taxes as so many grumblers loudly preach and too many submissive spirits fondly believe if the house of commons were altered into one of more popular frame with more frequent opportunities given of changing the persons sent thither a reference to the twenty years which succeeded the revolution may suffice to shew the fallacy of such expectations parliaments were then triennial and democratic principles fashionable even among the servants of the crown yet during that space of time wars were almost incessant and never were burthens imposed so far above the apparent ability of the nation to support them having adverted to the warlike measures of those reigns merely to support my argument i cannot forbear to applaud the highspirited englishmen of that age our forefathers were tried as we have been triedand their virtue did not sink under the duties which the decrees of providence imposed upon it they triumphed though less signally than we have donefollowing their example let us now cultivate fortitude encourage hope and chearful industry and give way to enterprise so will prosperity return the stream which has been checked will flow with recruited vigourand when another century shall have passed away the ambition of france will be as little formidable to our thenexisting posterity as it is now to us but the lessons of history must be studiedthey teach us that under every form of civil polity war will contrive to lift up its head and most pertinaciously in those states where the people have most sway when i recur to these admonitions it is to entreat that the discontented would exercise their understandings rather than consult their passions first separating real from mistaken grievances and then endeavouring to ascertain which cannot be done with a glance of the mind how much is fairly attributable to the government how much to ourselves and how large a portion of what we have to endure has been forced upon us by a foreign power over whom we could exercise no controul but by arms the course here recommended will keep us as we are free and happywill preserve us from what through want of these and like precautions other nations have been hurried intodomestic broils sanguinary tribunals civil slaughter in the field anarchy and sad cure and close of all tranquillity under the iron grasp of military despotism years before this catastrophe what would have become of your elective franchise freeholders of westmoreland the coadjutors of the obscure individuals who from a distance first excited this movement under a pretence of recovering your rights would have played the whirlwind among your property and crushed you less perhaps out of malice than because in their frenzy they could not help it  a conviction that the subject is ill understood by those who were unprepared for what has just been said is the excuse to my own mind gentlemen for having made so protracted a demand upon your attention the ruinous tendencies of this selfflattering enterprize can only be checked by timely and general foresight the contest in which we are engaged has been described by persons noticing it from a distance as the work of a cabal of electioneering jobbers who have contrived to set up the thanet against the lowther interests that both parties might spend their money for the benefit of those who cared for neither the thanet interest in the county of westmorelandone might almost as well talk of an interest in the moon the descendant of the cliffords has not thought it worth while to recommend himself to the electors by the course either of his public or his private life and therefore though his purse may have weight and his possessions are considerable he himself in reference to the supposed object is nothing if this had been really an attempt made by a numerous body of malcontent freeholders to carry their wishes for a change into effect by placing at their head some approved chief of an ancient family possessed of real consequence in the county the proceeding considered in the abstract could not have been objected to this county is and ever was open to fair and honourable contest originating in principles sanctioned by general practice and carried on by means which if universally adopted would not be injurious to the state but the present measure stands not upon any such grounds it is an attempt no matter with what ultimate view to effect a total change in the character of county elections beginning here with the expectation as is openly avowed of being imitated elsewhere it reverses the order hitherto pursued instead of aiming to influence the less wealthy and less instructed freeholders through the medium of those whom they have been accustomed to confide ininstead of descending by legitimate gradations from high to lower from the wellinstructed and widelyexperienced to those who have not had equal advantagesit commences at the bottom far beneath the degree of the poorest freeholders and works upwards with an inflammatory appeal to feelings that owe their birth to previous mistatement of facts opulence rank station privilege distinction intellectual culturethe notions naturally following upon these in a country like england are protection succour guidance example dissemination of knowledge introduction of improvements and all the benefits and blessings that among freemen are diffused where authority like the parental from a sense of community of interest and the natural goodness of mankind is softened into brotherly concern this is no utopian picture of the characteristics of elevated rank wealth competence and learned and liberal education in england for with the liberty of speech and writing that prevails amongst us if such rays of light and love did not generally emanate from superiority of station possessions and accomplishment the frame of society which we behold could not subsist yesin spite of pride hardness of heart grasping avarice and other selfish passions the not unfrequent concomitants of affluence and worldly prosperity the mass of the people are justly dealt with and tenderly cherishedaccordingly gratitude without servility dispositions to prompt return of service undebased by officiousness and respectful attachment that with small prejudice to the understanding greatly enriches the heart such are the sentiments with which englishmen of the humblest condition have been accustomed to look up towards their friends and benefactors among the holders of fixed property whether labourers in the field or artisans among those who are fortunate enough to have an interest in the soil of their country these human sentiments of civil life are strengthened by additional dependenciesi am aware how much universal habits of rapacious speculation occasioned by fluctuations in the value of produce during the late warhow much the spread of manufactories and the baleful operation of the poor laws have done to impair these indigenous and salutary affections i am conscious of the sad deterioration and no one can lament it more deeply but sufficient vitality is left in the stock of ancient virtue to furnish hope that by careful manuring and skilful application of the knife to the withered branches fresh shoots might thrive in their placewere it not for the base artifices of malignants who pretending to invigorate the tree pour scalding water and corrosive compounds among its roots so that the fibres are killed in the mould by which they have been nourished  that for years such artifices have been employed in westmoreland and in a neighbouring county with unremitting activity must be known to all whatever was disliked has been systematically attacked by the vilifying of persons connected with it the magistrates and public functionaries up to the lord lieutenant himself have been regularly traducedas unfaithful to their trust the clergy habitually deridedas timeservers and slavish dependants and the gentry if conspicuous for attachment to the government stigmatizedas men without honour or patriotism and leagued in conspiracy against the poor after this manner have the provincial newspapers the chief agents in this local mischief concurred with the disaffected london journals who were playing the same part towards laws and institutions and general measures of state by calumniating the principal authorities of the kingdom hence instead of gratitude and love and confidence and hope are resentment and envy mistrust and jealousy and hatred and rancour inspiredand the drift of all is to impress the body of the people with a belief that neither justice can be expected nor benevolence hoped for unless power be transferred to persons least resembling those who now hold it that isto demagogues and incendiaries  it will be thought that this attempt is too extravagant to be dangerous inasmuch as every member of society possessed of weight and authority must revolt from such a transfer and abhor the issues to which it points possessed of weight and authoritywith whom these agitators have weight and authority there where they seek for it that is with no small portion of what they term the physical strength of the country the people have ever been the dupes of extremes vast gains with little pains is a jingle of words that would be an appropriate inscription for the insurrectionary banner of unthinking humanity to walkto windtowards a thing that is covetedhow unattractive an operation compared with leaping upon it at oncecertainly no one possessed of legitimate authority can desire such a transfer as we have been forced to contemplate but he may aid in bringing it about without desiring it numerous are the courses of civil action in which men of pure dispositions and honourable aims are tempted to take part with those who are utterly destitute of both be not startled if merely glancing at the causes of this deplorable union as it is now exhibited in this part of england i observe that there is no necessary connection between public spirit and political sagacity how often does it happen that right intention is averse to inquiry as casting a damp upon its own zeal and a suspicion upon the intrinsic recommendation of its object good men turn instinctively from inferences unfavourable to human nature but there are facts which are not to be resisted where the understanding is sound the selfstyled emancipators have tried their strength if there were any thing promising to england in their efforts we should have seen this country arrayed in opposite parties resembling each other in quality and composition little of that appears the promoters of the struggle did not hope for such a result and many of them would not have wished for it could they have expected to be carried through by that ruinous division of the upper from the lower ranks of society on which they mainly relied  but freeholders wicked devices have not done the service that was expected from them you are upon your guard the result of this canvass has already shewn that a vast majority of you are proof against assault and remain of sound mind such example of men abiding by the rules of their forefathers cannot but encourage others who yet hesitate to determine in favour of the good cause the more signal the victory the greater will be the honour paid to fixed and true principles and the firmer our security against the recurrence of like innovations at all events enough i trust has been effected by the friends of our present representatives to protect those who have been deceived and may not in time awaken from their delusion may their eyes be opened and at no distant day so that perceiving the benefits which the laws as now enacted and administered ensure to their native land they may feel towards you who make the wiser choice the gratitude which you will have deservedthe beginnings of great troubles are mostly of comparative insignificancea little spark can kindle a mighty conflagration and a small leak will suffice to sink a stately vessel to that loyal decision of the event now pending which may be confidently expected britain may owe the continuance of her tranquillity and freedom the maintenance of the justice and equity for which she is preeminent among nations and the preservation of her social comforts her charitable propensities her morals and her religion of this as belonging to the future we cannot speak with certainty but not a doubt can exist that the practices which led to the destruction of all that was venerable in a neighbouring country have upon this occasion been industriously unscrupulously eagerly resorted tobut my last words shall be words of congratulation and thanksgivingupon a bright prospect that the wishes will be crossed and the endeavours frustrated of those amongst us who without their own knowledge were ready to relinquish every good which they and we possess by uniting with overweening reformersto compose the vanguard of a ferocious revolution  a freeholder  westmoreland february 24 1818                                       note  i have not scrupled to express myself strongly on this subject perceiving what use is made by the opposite party of those resolutions of the house of commons in support of my opinion i quote the following from the carlisle patriot of the 14th of february premising with the author of the letter from which it is extracted that by far the greatest number of opulent landholders are members of the upper house and that the richest subjects are some of its peers  the peers of great britain stripped as they now are of the overgrown importance which they derived from the feudal system have made no acquisition of political influence to compensate for the loss of it by an increasing extension of patronage either collectively or individually like the crown nor have the various circumstances operated upon their body in any considerable degree which have effected such a radical and powerful accumulation of consequence and importance in the lower house add to this that the general sentiment or feeling that commonly exists between them and the body of the people bears no analogy to the vivid principles of affectionate loyalty that tend so strongly to secure and guard the person and rights of the king or the reciprocal sympathy of congenial interests that acts and directs so powerfully betwixt the commons and the community in general on the contrary the spirit that exists betwixt the peers as a collectively distinct body and the people at large is a spirit of repulsion rather than of attraction in a corporate light they are viewed with no sentiments of kindly affection and therefore upon the supposition of a political contest betwixt them and either of the other two estates they would inevitably labour under the disadvantage of carrying it on against all the force of the prejudices which to a great extent always directs popular opinion hence amidst all the contests and straggles which have agitated or convulsed the kingdom since the reign of henry the seventh the political importance of the peers considered as an estate of parliament has been rather diminished than increased and were such a democratical house of commons as our modern patriots so loudly call for to be efficiently formed the constitutional equilibrium of our envied public system would be infallibly destroyed and the spirit of our legislative body which in a great measure awards influence in proportion to property completely abrogatedand it is in vain to suppose that if even such a change was desirable it could possibly be effected without producing a train of incalculable miseries that would much more than overbalance any partial good which could reasonably be expected from the alteration  as property then is incontestibly the foundationstone of political right in britain it follows as an inevitable consequence that the ratio of these rights should be in some measure commensurate to the extent of the property otherwise the immutable maxims of justice as well as the spirit of the constitution is violated for it would be palpably unjust to put a man who possessed a great stake in the welfare of the country and paid comparatively a greater proportion of its public revenue on a level with the inferior freeholders who not possessing any thing like an equal extent of property cannot possibly have the means of equally contributing to the exigencies of the state  now if any considerate conscientious man will calmly reflect upon the power of the house of commons in the imposition of taxes and in how many ways the public burthen affects the landed interest either directly or indirectly he must acknowledge the expediency as well as the necessity and justice of the system which steadily though silently protects the great landholders in exercising an appropriate influence in the election of the representatives of the peoplephocion  previous to the reign of henry the seventh the peers defended their property and their privileges through the means of armed retainers that politic prince by laws directed against the number of these retainers by bringing in use the making of leases and by statutes framed for the purpose of unfettering more easily the estates of his powerful nobility and laying them more open to alienation prepared the way for reducing the power of an order which had been too strong for the crown the operation of these laws in course of time would have brought the peers as an estate of the realm to utter insignificance had not the practice of supplying the peerage with new members through creation by patent without intervention of parliament been substituted for the only mode previously tolerated by the great barons for the exercise of this royal prerogative namely by authority of parliament thus did the consequence of the order notwithstanding the diminution of its power continue to be maintainedrich commoners and royal favourites being introduced to supply the places of extinguished families or those whose wealth had fallen into decay this prerogative grew without immoderate exercise till the close of the reign of queen elizabeth the first of the stuarts employed it lavishly not considering the changes that had taken place his predecessors of the house of tudor by breaking down the feudal strength of the lords and by transfer through the reformation of the spiritual supremacy to themselves as temporal sovereigns had come into possession of a superfluity of power which enabled the crown to supply what was wanted in the peers for their own support but through remote operation of the same causes the commons were rising fast into consequence with a puritanical spirit of republicanism spreading rapidly amongst them hence the augmentation of the number of peers made by james the first notwithstanding the addition of property carried by it to the upper house did not add sufficient strength to that body to compensate for the distastefulness of the measure to the people and as far as the property of the new peers was but the creature of prodigal grants from the crown the conjoint strength of the two estates received no increase in the meanwhile surrenders were made of the power of the crown with infatuated facility till the commons became so strong that the right of creating boroughs being openly disputed was almost abandoned and the speedy consequence of the whole was that the two parliamentary estates of king and lords fell before the intemperance of the third after the restoration the disputes about the bounds of liberty and prerogative were revived but prerogative was gradually abandoned for the less obnoxious and less obvious operations of influence the numerous creations of peers were complained of but whatever motive might have governed those creations they were justified by the necessity of things large as were the additions made to the number of peers they were insufficient to give the house its due weight as a separate estate in the legislature through the reigns of charles william and anne whether the crown was disposed to tyranny or the commons were venal factious or arbitrary we see too many proofs of the lords wanting natural strength to maintain their rights and carry their patriotic wishes into effect even when they were supported by marked expressions of popular opinion in their favour if the changes which had taken place in the structure of society would have allowed them to act regularly as an independent body upon its intrinsic resources a deathblow was given to such expectation towards the close of the reign of queen anne when twelve peers were created in one day this act deservedly made one of the articles of impeachment against lord oxford shewed that their sentiments as a body were at the mercy of any unprincipled administration and compelled them to look about for some other means of being attended toand the most obvious was the best for the country and themselvesthat of taking care of and augmenting the influence which they possessed in the house of commons reformers plead against this practice constitutional resolutions still existing the slight review which has been given demonstrates its necessity if the constitution is to be preserved the only question which a practical politician can tolerate for a moment relates to the degree of this influencehas it been carried too far the considerations which put me upon writing the present note for the length of which i ought to apologise do not require the discussion of this point the amicable reader will rejoice with me that in spite of mutual shocks and encroachments the three orders of the state are preserved in salutary equipoise although the mode of bringing this about has unavoidably changed with change of circumstances the spirit of the constitution remains unimpaired nor have the essential parts of its frame undergone any alteration may both endure as long as the island itself     v of the catholic relief bill 1829  note  see preface in the present volume for details on this letter which was addressed to the bishop of london blomfield this is printed from the original manuscript g  of the catholic relief bill 1829   my lord  i have been hesitating for the space of a week whether i should take the liberty of addressing you but as the decision draws near my anxiety increases and i cannot refrain from intruding upon you for a few minutes i will try to be brief throwing myself upon your indulgence if what i have to say prove of little moment  the question before us is can protestantism and poperyor somewhat narrowing the ground can the church of england including that of ireland and the church of romebe coordinate powers in the constitution of a free country and at the same time christian belief be in that country a vital principle of action the states of the continent afford no proof whatever that the existence of protestantism and romanism under the specified conditions is practicable nor can they be rationally referred to as furnishing a guide for us in france the most conspicuous of these states and the freest the number of protestants in comparison with catholics is insignificant and unbelief and superstition almost divide the country between them in prussia there is no legislative assembly the government is essentially military and excepting the countries upon the rhine recently added to that power the proportion of catholics is inconsiderable in hanover jacob speaks of the protestants as more than ten to one here indeed is a legislative assembly but its powers are ill defined hanover had and still may have a censorship of the pressan indulgent one it can afford to be so through the sedative virtue of the standing army of the country and that of the germanic league to back the executive in case of commotion no soundminded englishman will build upon the shortlived experience of the kingdom of the netherlands in flanders a benighted papacy prevails which defeated the attempts of the king to enlighten the people by education and i am well assured that the protestant portion of holland have small reason to be thankful for the footing upon which they have been there placed if that kingdom is to last there is great cause for fear that its government will incline more and more to romanism as the religion of a great majority of its subjects and as one which by its slavish spirit makes the people more manageable if so it is to be apprehended that protestantism will gradually disappear before it and the ruling classes in a still greater degree than they now are will become infidels as the easiest refuge in their own minds from the debasing doctrines of papacy  three great conflicts24 are before the progressive nations between christianity and infidelity between papacy and protestantism and between the spirit of the old feudal and monarchical governments and the representative and republican system as established in america the church of england in addition to her infidel and roman catholic assailants and the politicians of the antifeudal class has to contend with a formidable body of protestant dissenters amid these several and often combined attacks how is she to maintain herself from which of these enemies has she most to fear some are of opinion that papacy is less formidable than dissent whose bias is republican which is averse to monarchy to a hierarchy and to the tything systemto all which romanism is strongly attached the abstract principles embodied in the creed of the dissenters catechism are without doubt full as politically dangerous as those of the romanists but fortunately their creed is not their practice they are divided among themselves they acknowledge no foreign jurisdiction their organisation and discipline are comparatively feeble and in times long past however powerful they proved themselves to overthrow they are not likely to be able to build up whatever the presbyterian form as in the church of scotland may have to recommend it we find that the sons of the nobility and gentry of scotland who choose the sacred profession almost invariably enter into the church of england and for the same reason viz the want of a hierarchy you will excuse me for connecting views so humiliating with divine truth the rich dissenters in the course of a generation or two fall into the bosom of our church as holding out attractions to the upper orders the church of england has no advantages over that of rome but rather the contrary papacy will join with us in preserving the form but for the purpose and in the hope of seizing the substance for itself its ambition is upon record it is essentially at enmity with light and knowledge its power to exclude these blessings is not so great as formerly though its desire to do so is equally strong and its determination to exert its power for its own exaltation by means of that exclusion is not in the least abated the see of rome justly regards england as the head of protestantism it admires it is jealous it is envious of her power and greatness it despairs of being able to destroy them but it is ever on the watch to regain its lost influence over that country and it hopes to effect this through the means of ireland the words of this last sentence are not my own but those of the head of one of the first catholic families of the county from which i write spoken without reserve several years ago surely the language of this individual must be greatly emboldened when he sees the prostrate condition in which our yet protestant government now lies before the papacy of ireland the great catholic interest the old catholic interest i know to have been phrases of frequent occurrence in the mouth of a head of the first roman catholic family of england and to descend far lower what would satisfy you said not long ago a person to a very clever lady a dependent upon another branch of that family that church replied she pointing to the parish church of the large town where the conversation took place monstrous expectation yet not to be overlooked as an ingredient in the compound of papacy this great catholic interest we are about to embody in a legislative form a protestant parliament is to turn itself into a canine monster with two heads which instead of keeping watch and ward will be snarling at and bent on devouring each other  24 in this classification i anticipate matter which mr southey has in the press the substance of a conversation between us  whatever enemies the church of england may have to struggle with now and hereafter it is clear that at this juncture she is specially called to take the measure of her strength as opposed to the church of romethat is her most pressing enemy the church of england as to the point of private judgment standing between the two extremes of papacy and dissent is entitled to heartfelt reverence and among thinking men whose affections are not utterly vitiated never fails to receive it papacy will tolerate no private judgment and dissent is impatient of anything else the blessing of providence has thus far preserved the church of england between the shocks to which she has been exposed from those opposite errors and notwithstanding objections may lie against some parts of her liturgy particularly the athanasian creed and however some of her articles may be disputed about her doctrines are exclusively scriptural and her practice is accommodated to the exigencies of our weak nature if this be so what has she to fear look at ireland might be a sufficient answer look at the disproportion between her catholic and protestant population look at the distempered heads of the roman catholic church insisting upon terms which in france and even in austria dare not be proposed and which the pope himself would probably relinquish for a season look at the revenues of the protestant church her cathedrals her churches that once belonged to the romanists and where in imagination their worship has never ceased to be celebrated can it be doubted that when the yet existing restrictions are removed that the disproportion in the population and the wealth of the protestant church will become more conspicuous objects for discontent to point at and that plans however covert will be instantly set on foot with the aid of new powers for effecting an overthrow and if possible a transfer but all this is too obvious i would rather argue with those who think that by excluding the romanists from political power we make them more attached to their religion and cause them to unite more strongly in support of it were this true to the extent maintained we should still have to balance between the unorganised power which they derive from a sense of injustice real or supposed and the legitimate organised power which concession would confer upon surviving discontent for no one i imagine is weak enough to suppose that discontent would disappear but it is a deception and a most dangerous one to conclude that if a free passage were given to the torrent it would lose by diffusion its ability to do injury the checks as your lordship well knows which are after a time necessary to provoke other sects to activity are not wanted here the roman church stands independent of them through its constitution so exquisitely contrived and through its doctrine and discipline which give a peculiar and monstrous power to its priesthood in proof of this take the injunction of celibacy alone separating the priesthood from the body of the community and the practice of confession making them masters of the conscience while the doctrines give them an absolute power over the will to submit to such thraldom men must be bigoted in its favour and that we see is the case of spain in portugal in austria in italy in flanders in ireland and in all countries where you have papacy in full blow and does not history prove that however other sects may have languished under the relaxing influence of good fortune papacy has ever been most fiery and rampant when most prosperous  but many who do not expect that conciliation will be the result of concession have a farther expedient on which they rely much they propose to take the romish church in ireland into pay and expect that afterwards its clergy will be as compliant to the government as the presbyterians in that country have proved this measure is in the first place too disingenuous not to be condemned by honest men for the government acting on this policy would degrade itself by offering bribes to men of a sacred calling to act contrary to their sense of duty if they be sincere as priests and truly spiritualminded they will find it impossible to accept of a stipend known to be granted with such expectation if they be worldlings and false of heart they will practise doubledealing and seem to support the government while they are actually undermining it for they know that if they be suspected of sacrificing the interests of the church they will lose all authority over their flocks power and consideration are more valued than money the priests will not be induced to risk their sway over the people for any sums that our government would venture to afford them out of the exhausted revenues of the empire surely they would prefer to such a scanty hire the hope of carving for themselves from the property of the protestant church of their country or even the gratification of stripping usurpationfor such they deem itof its gains though there may be no hope to win what others are deprived of many english favourers of this scheme are reconciled to what they call a modification of the irish protestant establishment in an application of a portion of the revenues to the support of the romish church this they deem reasonable shortly it will be openly aimed at and they will rejoice should they accomplish their purpose but your lordship will agree with me that if that happen it would be one of the most calamitous events that ignorance has in our time given birth to after all could the secular clergy be paid out of this spoliation or in any other way the regulars would rise in consequence of their degradation and where would be the influence that could keep them from mischief they would swarm over the country to prey upon the people still more than they now do in all the reasonings of the friends to this bribing scheme the distinctive character of the papal church is overlooked  but they who expect that tranquillity will be a permanent consequence of the relief bill dwell much upon the mighty difference in opinion and feeling between the upper and lower ranks of the romish communion they affirm that many keep within the pale of the church as a point of honour that others have notions greatly relaxed and though not at present prepared to separate they will gradually fall off but what avail the inward sentiments of men if they are convinced that by acting upon them they will forfeit their outward dignity and power as long as the political influence which the priests now exercise shall endure or anything like it the great proprietors will be obliged to dissemble and to conform in their action to the demands of that power such will be the conduct of the great roman catholic proprietors nay farther i agree with those who deem it probable that through a natural and reasonable desire to have their property duly represented many landholders who are now protestant will be tempted to go over to papacy this may be thought a poor compliment to protestantism since religious scruples it is said are all that keep the papists out but is not the desire to be in pushing them on almost to rebellion at this moment we are taking i own a melancholy view of both sides but human nature be it what it may must by legislators be looked at as it is  in the treatment of this question we hear perpetually of wrong but the wrong is all on one side if the political power of ireland is to be a transfer from those who are of the state religion of the country to those who are not there is nothing gained on the score of justice we hear also much of stigma but this is not to be done away unless all offices the privy council and the chancellorship be open to them that is unless we allow a man to be eligible to keep the kings conscience who has not his own in his keeping unless we open the throne itself to men of this souldegrading faith  the condition of ireland is indeed and long has been wretched lamentable is it to acknowledge that the mass of the people are so grossly uninformed and from that cause subject to such delusions and passions that they would destroy each other were it not for restraints put upon them by a power out of themselves this power it is that protracts their existence in a state for which otherwise the course of nature would provide a remedy by reducing their numbers through mutual destruction so that english civilisation may fairly be said to have been the shield of irish barbarism and now these swarms of degraded people which could not have existed but through the neglect and misdirected power of the sister island are by a withdrawing of that power to have their own way and to be allowed to dictate to us a population vicious in character as unnatural in immediate origin for it has been called into birth by shortsighted landlords set upon adding to the number of votes at their command and by priests who for lucres sake favour the increase of marriages is held forth as constituting a claim to political power strong in proportion to its numbers though in a sane view that claim is in an inverse ratio to them brute force indeed wherever lodged as we are too feelingly taught at present must be measured and metmeasured with care in order to be met with fortitude  the chief proximate causes of irish misery and ignorance are papacyof which i have said so muchand the tenure and management of landed property and both these have a common origin viz the imperfect conquest of the country the countries subjected by the ancient romans and those that in the middle ages were subdued by the northern tribes afford striking instances of the several ways in which nations may be improved by foreign conquest the romans by their superiority in arts and arms and in the earlier period of their history in virtues also may seem to have established a moral right to force their institutions upon other nations whether under a process of decline or emerging from barbarism and this they effected we all know not by overrunning countries as eastern conquerors have done and bonaparte in our own days but by completing a regular subjugation with military roads and garrisons which became centres of civilisation for the surrounding district nor am i afraid to add though the fact might be caught at as bearing against the general scope of my argument that both conquerors and conquered owed much to the participation of civil rights which the romans liberally communicated the other mode of conquest that pursued by the northern nations brought about its beneficial effects by the settlement of a hardy and vigorous people among the distracted and effeminate nations against whom their incursions were made the conquerors transplanted with them their independent and ferocious spirit to reanimate exhausted communities and in their turn received a salutary mitigation till in process of time the conqueror and conquered having a common interest were lost in each other to neither of these modes was unfortunate ireland subject and her insular territory by physical obstacles and still more by moral influences arising out of them has aggravated the evil consequent upon independence lost as hers was the writers of the time of queen elizabeth have pointed out how unwise it was to transplant among a barbarous people not half subjugated the institutions that time had matured among those who too readily considered themselves masters of that people it would be presumptuous in me to advert in detail to the exacerbations and longlived hatred that have perverted the moral sense in ireland obstructed religious knowledge and denied to her a due share of english refinement and civility it is enough to observe that the reformation was ill supported in that country and that her soil became through frequent forfeitures mainly possessed by men whose hearts were not in the land where their wealth lay  but it is too late we are told for retrospection we have no choice between giving way and a sanguinary war surely it is rather too much that the country should be required to take the measure of the threatened evil from a cabinet which by its being divided against itself which by its remissness and fear of long and harassing debates in the two houses has for many years past fostered the evil and in no small part created the danger the extent of which is now urged as imposing the necessity of granting their demands  danger is a relative thing and the first requisite for being in a condition to judge of what we have to dread from the physical force of the romanists is to be in sympathy with the protestants had our ministers been truly so could they have suffered themselves to be bearded by the catholic association for so many years as they have been  i speak openly to you my lord though a member of his majestys privy council and begging your pardon for detaining you so long i hasten to a conclusion  the civil disabilities for the removal of which mr oconnell and his followers are braving the government cannot but be indifferent to the great body of the irish nation except as means for gaining an end take away the intermediate power of the priests and an insurrection in brobdignag at the call of the king of lilliput might be as hopefully expected as that the irish people would stir as they are now prepared to do at the call of a political demagogue now these civil disabilities do not directly affect the priests they therefore must have ulterior views and though it must be flattering to their vanity to shew that they have the irish representation in their own hands and though their worldly interest and that of their connections will they know immediately profit by that dominion what they look for principally is the advancement of their religion at the cost of protestantism that would bring everything else in its train while it is obvious that the political agitators could not rouse the people without the intervention of the priests it is true that the priests could not excite the people without a hope that from the exaltation of their church their social condition would be improved what in irish interpretation these words would mean we may tremble to think of  in whatever way we look religion is so much mixed up in this matter that the guardians of the episcopal church of the empire are imperiously called upon to show themselves worthy of the high trust reposed in them you my lord are convinced that in spite of the best securities that can be given the admission of roman catholics into the legislature is a dangerous experiment oaths cannot be framed that will avail here the only securities to be relied upon are what we have little hope to seethe roman church reforming itself and a ministry and a parliament sufficiently sensible of the superiority of the one form of religion over the other to be resolved not only to preserve the present rights and immunities of the protestant church inviolate but prepared by all fair means for the extension of its influence with a hope that it may gradually prevail over papacy  it is we trust the intention of providence that the church of rome should in due time disappear and come what may on the church of england we have the satisfaction of knowing that in defending a government resting upon a protestant basissay what they will the other party have abandonedwe are working for the welfare of humankind and supporting whatever there is of dignity in our frail nature  here i might stop but i am above measure anxious for the course which the bench of bishops may take at this crisis they are appealed to and even by the heir presumptive to the throne from his seat in parliament there will be attempts to browbeat them on the score of humanity but humanity is if it deserves the name a calculating and prospective quality it will on this occasion balance an evil at hand with a far greater one that is sure or all but sure to come humanity is not shewn the less by firmness than by tenderness of heart it is neither deterred by clamour nor enfeebled by its own sadness but it estimates evil and good to the best of its power acts by the dictates of conscience and trusts the issue to the ruler of all things  if my lord i have seemed to write with overconfidence on any opinions i have above given impute it to a wish of avoiding cumbrous qualifying expressions  sincerely do i pray that god may give your lordship and the rest of your brethren light to guide you and strength to walk in that light       i am my lord c     ii ethical     i of legislation for the poor the working classes and the clergy appendix to poems  1835  note  on the several portions of this division of the prose see preface in the present volume g  of legislation for the poor the working classes and the clergy  appendix to poems   in the present volume as in those that have preceded it the reader will have found occasionally opinions expressed upon the course of public affairs and feelings given vent to as national interests excited them since nothing i trust has been uttered but in the spirit of reflective patriotism those notices are left to produce their own effect but among the many objects of general concern and the changes going forward which i have glanced at in verse are some especially affecting the lower orders of society in reference to these i wish here to add a few words in plain prose  were i conscious of being able to do justice to those important topics i might avail myself of the periodical press for offering anonymously my thoughts such as they are to the world but i feel that in procuring attention they may derive some advantage however small from my name in addition to that of being presented in a less fugitive shape it is also not impossible that the state of mind which some of the foregoing poems may have produced in the reader will dispose him to receive more readily the impression which i desire to make and to admit the conclusions i would establish                                       i the first thing that presses upon my attention is the poor law amendment act i am aware of the magnitude and complexity of the subject and the unwearied attention which it has received from men of far wider experience than my own yet i cannot forbear touching upon one point of it and to this i will confine myself though not insensible to the objection which may reasonably be brought against treating a portion of this or any other great scheme of civil polity separately from the whole the point to which i wish to draw the readers attention is that all persons who cannot find employment or procure wages sufficient to support the body in health and strength are entitled to a maintenance by law  this dictate of humanity is acknowledged in the report of the commissioners but is there not room for apprehension that some of the regulations of the new act have a tendency to render the principle nugatory by difficulties thrown in the way of applying it if this be so persons will not be wanting to show it by examining the provisions of the act in detailan attempt which would be quite out of place here but it will not therefore be deemed unbecoming in one who fears that the prudence of the head may in framing some of those provisions have supplanted the wisdom of the heart to enforce a principle which cannot be violated without infringing upon one of the most precious rights of the english people and opposing one of the most sacred claims of civilised humanity  there can be no greater error in this department of legislation than the belief that this principle does by necessity operate for the degradation of those who claim or are so circumstanced as to make it likely they may claim through laws founded upon it relief or assistance the direct contrary is the truth it may be unanswerably maintained that its tendency is to raise not to depress by stamping a value upon life which can belong to it only where the laws have placed men who are willing to work and yet cannot find employment above the necessity of looking for protection against hunger and other natural evils either to individual and casual charity to despair and death or to the breach of law by theft or violence  and here as in the report of the commissioners the fundamental principle has been recognised i am not at issue with them any farther than i am compelled to believe that their remedial measures obstruct the application of it more than the interests of society require  and calling to mind the doctrines of political economy which are now prevalent i cannot forbear to enforce the justice of the principle and to insist upon its salutary operation  and first for its justice if selfpreservation be the first law of our nature would not every one in a state of nature be morally justified in taking to himself that which is indispensable to such preservation where by so doing he would not rob another of that which might be equally indispensable to his preservation and if the value of life be regarded in a right point of view may it not be questioned whether this right of preserving life at any expense short of endangering the life of another does not survive mans entering into the social state whether this right can be surrendered or forfeited except when it opposes the divine law upon any supposition of a social compact or of any convention for the protection of mere rights of property  but if it be not safe to touch the abstract question of mans right in a social state to help himself even in the last extremity may we not still contend for the duty of a christian government standing in loco parentis towards all its subjects to make such effectual provision that no one shall be in danger of perishing either through the neglect or harshness of its legislation or waiving this is it not indisputable that the claim of the state to the allegiance involves the protection of the subject and as all rights in one party impose a correlative duty upon another it follows that the right of the state to require the services of its members even to the jeoparding of their lives in the common defence establishes a right in the people not to be gainsaid by utilitarians and economists to public support when from any cause they may be unable to support themselves  let us now consider the salutary and benign operation of this principle here we must have recourse to elementary feelings of human nature and to truths which from their very obviousness are apt to be slighted till they are forced upon our notice by our own sufferings or those of others in the paradise lost milton represents adam after the fall as exclaiming in the anguish of his soul       did i request thee maker from my clay      to mould me man did i solicit thee      from darkness to promote me      my will      concurred not to my being  under how many various pressures of misery have men been driven thus in a strain touching upon impiety to expostulate with the creator and under few so afflictive as when the source and origin of earthly existence have been brought back to the mind by its impending close in the pangs of destitution but as long as in our legislation due weight shall be given to this principle no man will be forced to bewail the gift of life in hopeless want of the necessaries of life  englishmen have therefore by the progress of civilisation among them been placed in circumstances more favourable to piety and resignation to the divine will than the inhabitants of other countries where a like provision has not been established and as providence in this care of our countrymen acts through a human medium the objects of that care must in like manner be more inclined towards a grateful love of their fellowmen thus also do stronger ties attach the people to their country whether while they tread its soil or at a distance think of their native land as an indulgent parent to whose arms even they who have been imprudent and undeserving may like the prodigal son betake themselves without fear of being rejected  such is the view of the case that would first present itself to a reflective mind and it is in vain to show by appeals to experience in contrast with this view that provisions founded upon the principle have promoted profaneness of life and dispositions the reverse of philanthropic by spreading idleness selfishness and rapacity for these evils have arisen not as an inevitable consequence of the principle but for want of judgment in framing laws based upon it and above all from faults in the mode of administering the law the mischief that has grown to such a height from granting relief in cases where proper vigilance would have shewn that it was not required or in bestowing it in undue measure will be urged by no truly enlightened statesman as a sufficient reason for banishing the principle itself from legislation  let us recur to the miserable states of consciousness that it precludes  there is a story told by a traveller in spain of a female who by a sudden shock of domestic calamity was driven out of her senses and ever after looked up incessantly to the sky feeling that her fellowcreatures could do nothing for her relief can there be englishmen who with a good end in view would upon system expose their brother englishmen to a like necessity of looking upwards only or downwards to the earth after it shall contain no spot where the destitute can demand by civil right what by right of nature they are entitled to  suppose the objects of our sympathy not sunk into this blank despair but wandering about as strangers in streets and ways with the hope of succour from casual charity what have we gained by such a change of scene woful is the condition of the famished northern indian dependent among winter snows upon the chance passage of a herd of deer from which one if brought down by his riflegun may be made the means of keeping him and his companions alive as miserable is that of some savage islander who when the land has ceased to afford him sustenance watches for food which the waves may cast up or in vain endeavours to extract it from the inexplorable deep but neither of these is in a state of wretchedness comparable to that which is so often endured in civilised society multitudes in all ages have known it of whom may be said      homeless near a thousand homes they stood     and near a thousand tables pined and wanted food  justly might i be accused of wasting time in an uncalledfor attempt to excite the feelings of the reader if systems of political economy widely spread did not impugn the principle and if the safeguards against such extremities were left unimpaired it is broadly asserted by many that every man who endeavours to find work may find it were this assertion capable of being verified there still would remain a question what kind of work and how far may the labourer be fit for it for if sedentary work is to be exchanged for standing and some light and nice exercise of the fingers to which an artisan has been accustomed all his life for severe labour of the arms the best efforts would turn to little account and occasion would be given for the unthinking and the unfeeling unwarrantably to reproach those who are put upon such employment as idle froward and unworthy of relief either by law or in any other way were this statement correct there would indeed be an end of the argument the principle here maintained would be superseded but alas it is far otherwise that principle applicable to the benefit of all countries is indispensable for england upon whose coast families are perpetually deprived of their support by shipwreck and where large masses of men are so liable to be thrown out of their ordinary means of gaining bread by changes in commercial intercourse subject mainly or solely to the will of foreign powers by new discoveries in arts and manufactures and by reckless laws in conformity with theories of political economy which whether right or wrong in the abstract have proved a scourge to tens of thousands by the abruptness with which they have been carried into practice  but it is urgedrefuse altogether compulsory relief to the ablebodied and the number of those who stand in need of relief will steadily diminish through a conviction of an absolute necessity for greater forethought and more prudent care of a mans earnings undoubtedly it would but so also would it and in a much greater degree if the legislative provisions were retained and parochial relief administered under the care of the upper classes as it ought to be for it has been invariably found that wherever the funds have been raised and applied under the superintendence of gentlemen and substantial proprietors acting in vestries and as overseers pauperism has diminished accordingly proper care in that quarter would effectually check what is felt in some districts to be one of the worst evils in the poor law system viz the readiness of small and needy proprietors to join in imposing rates that seemingly subject them to great hardships while in fact this is done with a mutual understanding that the relief each is ready to bestow upon his still poorer neighbours will be granted to himself or his relatives should it hereafter be applied for  but let us look to inner sentiments of a nobler quality in order to know what we have to build upon affecting proofs occur in every ones experience who is acquainted with the unfortunate and the indigent of their unwillingness to derive their subsistence from aught but their own funds or labour or to be indebted to parochial assistance for the attainment of any object however dear to them a case was reported the other day from a coroners inquest of a pair who through the space of four years had carried about their dead infant from house to house and from lodging to lodging as their necessities drove them rather than ask the parish to bear the expense of its intermentthe poor creatures lived in the hope of one day being able to bury their child at their own cost it must have been heartrending to see and hear the mother who had been called upon to account for the state in which the body was found make this deposition by some judging coldly if not harshly this conduct might be imputed to an unwarrantable pride as she and her husband had it is true been once in prosperity but examples where the spirit of independence works with equal strength though not with like miserable accompaniments are frequently to be found even yet among the humblest peasantry and mechanics there is not then sufficient cause for doubting that a like sense of honour may be revived among the people and their ancient habits of independence restored without resorting to those severities which the new poor law act has introduced  but even if the surfaces of things only are to be examined we have a right to expect that lawgivers should take into account the various tempers and dispositions of mankind while some are led by the existence of a legislative provision into idleness and extravagance the economical virtues might be cherished in others by the knowledge that if all their efforts fail they have in the poor laws a refuge from the storm and a shadow from the heat despondency and distraction are no friends to prudence the springs of industry will relax if cheerfulness be destroyed by anxiety without hope men become reckless and have a sullen pride in adding to the heap of their own wretchedness he who feels that he is abandoned by his fellowmen will be almost irresistibly driven to care little for himself will lose his selfrespect accordingly and with that loss what remains to him of virtue  with all due deference to the particular experience and general intelligence of the individuals who framed the act and of those who in and out of parliament have approved of and supported it it may be said that it proceeds too much upon the presumption that it is a labouring mans own fault if he be not as the phrase is beforehand with the world but the most prudent are liable to be thrown back by sickness cutting them off from labour and causing to them expense and who but has observed how distress creeps upon multitudes without misconduct of their own and merely from a gradual fall in the price of labour without a correspondent one in the price of provisions so that men who may have ventured upon the marriage state with a fair prospect of maintaining their families in comfort and happiness see them reduced to a pittance which no effort of theirs can increase let it be remembered also that there are thousands with whom vicious habits of expense are not the cause why they do not store up their gains but they are generous and kindhearted and ready to help their kindred and friends moreover they have a faith in providence that those who have been prompt to assist others will not be left destitute should they themselves come to need by acting from these blended feelings numbers have rendered themselves incapable of standing up against a sudden reverse nevertheless these men in common with all who have the misfortune to be in want if many theorists had their wish would be thrown upon one or other of those three sharp points of condition before adverted to from which the intervention of law has hitherto saved them  all that has been said tends to show how the principle contended for makes the gift of life more valuable and has it may be hoped led to the conclusion that its legitimate operation is to make men worthier of that gift in other words not to degrade but to exalt human nature but the subject must not be dismissed without adverting to the indirect influence of the same principle upon the moral sentiments of a people among whom it is embodied in law in our criminal jurisprudence there is a maxim deservedly eulogised that it is better that ten guilty persons should escape than that one innocent man should suffer so also might it be maintained with regard to the poor laws that it is better for the interests of humanity among the people at large that ten undeserving should partake of the funds provided than that one morally good man through want of relief should either have his principles corrupted or his energies destroyed than that such a one should either be driven to do wrong or be cast to the earth in utter hopelessness in france the english maxim of criminal jurisprudence is reversed there it is deemed better that ten innocent men should suffer than one guilty escape in france there is no universal provision for the poor and we may judge of the small value set upon human life in the metropolis of that country by merely noticing the disrespect with which after death the body is treated not by the thoughtless vulgar but in schools of anatomy presided over by men allowed to be in their own art and in physical science among the most enlightened in the world in the east where countries are overrun with population as with a weed infinitely more respect is shown to the remains of the deceased and what a bitter mockery is it that this insensibility should be found where civil polity is so busy in minor regulations and ostentatiously careful to gratify the luxurious propensities whether social or intellectual of the multitude irreligion is no doubt much concerned with this offensive disrespect shown to the bodies of the dead in france but it is mainly attributable to the state in which so many of the living are left by the absence of compulsory provision for the indigent so humanely established by the law of england  sights of abject misery perpetually recurring harden the heart of the community in the perusal of history and of works of fiction we are not indeed unwilling to have our commiseration excited by such objects of distress as they present to us but in the concerns of real life men know that such emotions are not given to be indulged for their own sakes there the conscience declares to them that sympathy must be followed by action and if there exist a previous conviction that the power to relieve is utterly inadequate to the demand the eye shrinks from communication with wretchedness and pity and compassion languish like any other qualities that are deprived of their natural aliment let these considerations be duly weighed by those who trust to the hope that an increase of private charity with all its advantages of superior discrimination would more than compensate for the abandonment of those principles the wisdom of which has been here insisted upon how discouraging also would be the sense of injustice which could not fail to arise in the minds of the welldisposed if the burden of supporting the poor a burden of which the selfish have hitherto by compulsion borne a share should now or hereafter be thrown exclusively upon the benevolent  by having put an end to the slave trade and slavery the british people are exalted in the scale of humanity and they cannot but feel so if they look into themselves and duly consider their relation to god and their fellowcreatures that was a noble advance but a retrograde movement will assuredly be made if ever the principle which has been here defended should be either avowedly abandoned or but ostensibly retained  but after all there may be a little reason to apprehend permanent injury from any experiment that may be tried on the one side will be human nature rising up in her own defence and on the other prudential selfishness acting to the same purpose from a conviction that without a compulsory provision for the exigencies of the labouring multitude that degree of ability to regulate the price of labour which is indispensable for the reasonable interest of arts and manufactures cannot in great britain be upheld                                       ii in a poem of the foregoing collection allusion is made to the state of the workmen congregated in manufactories in order to relieve many of the evils to which that class of society are subject and to establish a better harmony between them and their employers it would be well to repeal such laws as prevent the formation of jointstock companies there are no doubt many and great obstacles to the formation and salutary working of these societies inherent in the mind of those whom they would obviously benefit but the combinations of masters to keep down unjustly the price of labour would be fairly checked by them as far as they were practicable they would encourage economy inasmuch as they would enable a man to draw profit from his savings by investing them in buildings or machinery for processes of manufacture with which he was habitually connected his little capital would then be working for him while he was at rest or asleep he would more clearly perceive the necessity of capital for carrying on great works he would better learn to respect the larger portions of it in the hands of others he would be less tempted to join in unjust combinations and for the sake of his own property if not for higher reasons he would be slow to promote local disturbance or endanger public tranquillity he would at least be loth to act in that way knowingly for it is not to be denied that such societies might be nurseries of opinions unfavourable to a mixed constitution of government like that of great britain the democratic and republican spirit which they might be apt to foster would not however be dangerous in itself but only as it might act without being sufficiently counterbalanced either by landed proprietorship or by a church extending itself so as to embrace an evergrowing and evershifting population of mechanics and artisans but if the tendencies of such societies would be to make the men prosper who might belong to them rulers and legislators should rejoice in the result and do their duty to the state by upholding and extending the influence of that church to which it owes in so great a measure its safety its prosperity and its glory  this in the temper of the present times may be difficult but it is become indispensable since large towns in great numbers have sprung up and others have increased tenfold with little or no dependence upon the gentry and the landed proprietors and apart from those mitigated feudal institutions which till of late have acted so powerfully upon the composition of the house of commons now it may be affirmed that in quarters where there is not an attachment to the church or the landed aristocracy and a pride in supporting them there the people will dislike both and be ready upon such incitements as are perpetually recurring to join in attempts to overthrow them there is no neutral ground here from want of due attention to the state of society in large towns and manufacturing districts and ignorance or disregard of these obvious truths innumerable wellmeaning persons became zealous supporters of a reform bill the qualities and powers of which whether destructive or constructive they would otherwise have been afraid of and even the framers of that bill swayed as they might be by party resentments and personal ambition could not have gone so far had not they too been lamentably ignorant or neglectful of the same truths both of fact and philosophy  but let that pass and let no opponent of the bill be tempted to compliment his own foresight by exaggerating the mischiefs and dangers that have sprung from it let not time be wasted in profitless regrets and let those party distinctions vanish to their very names that have separated men who whatever course they may have pursued have ever had a bond of union in the wish to save the limited monarchy and those other institutions that have under providence rendered for so long a period of time this country the happiest and worthiest of which there is any record since the foundation of civil society                                       iii a philosophic mind is best pleased when looking at religion in its spiritual bearing as a guide of conduct a solace under affliction and a support amid the instabilities of mortal life but the church having been forcibly brought by political considerations to my notice while treating of the labouring classes i cannot forbear saying a few words upon that momentous topic  there is a loud clamour for extensive change in that department the clamour would be entitled to more respect if they who are the most eager to swell it with their voices were not generally the most ignorant of the real state of the church and the service it renders to the community reform is the word employed let us pause and consider what sense it is apt to carry and how things are confounded by a lax use of it the great religious reformation in the sixteenth century did not profess to be a new construction but a restoration of something fallen into decay or put out of sight that familiar and justifiable use of the word seems to have paved the way for fallacies with respect to the term reform which it is difficult to escape from were we to speak of improvement and the correction of abuses we should run less risk of being deceived ourselves or of misleading others we should be less likely to fall blindly into the belief that the change demanded is a renewal of something that has existed before and that therefore we have experience on our side nor should we be equally tempted to beg the question that the change for which we are eager must be advantageous from generation to generation men are the dupes of words and it is painful to observe that so many of our species are most tenacious of those opinions which they have formed with the least consideration they who are the readiest to meddle with public affairs whether in church or state fly to generalities that they may be eased from the trouble of thinking about particulars and thus is deputed to mechanical instrumentality the work which vital knowledge only can do well  abolish pluralities have a resident incumbent in every parish is a favourite cry but without adverting to other obstacles in the way of this specious scheme it may be asked what benefit would accrue from its indiscriminate adoption to counterbalance the harm it would introduce by nearly extinguishing the order of curates unless the revenues of the church should grow with the population and be greatly increased in many thinly peopled districts especially among the parishes of the north  the order of curates is so beneficial that some particular notice of it seems to be required in this place for a church poor as relatively to the numbers of people that of england is and probably will continue to be it is no small advantage to have youthful servants who will work upon the wages of hope and expectation still more advantageous is it to have by means of this order young men scattered over the country who being more detached from the temporal concerns of the benefice have more leisure for improvement and study and are less subject to be brought into secular collision with those who are under their spiritual guardianship the curate if he reside at a distance from the incumbent undertakes the requisite responsibilities of a temporal kind in that modified way which prevents him as a newcomer from being charged with selfishness while it prepares him for entering upon a benefice of his own with something of a suitable experience if he should act under and in cooperation with a resident incumbent the gain is mutual his studies will probably be assisted and his training managed by a superior will not be liable to relapse in matters of prudence seemliness or in any of the highest cares of his functions and by way of return for these benefits to the pupil it will often happen that the zeal of a middleaged or declining incumbent will be revived by being in near communion with the ardour of youth when his own efforts may have languished through a melancholy consciousness that they have not produced as much good among his flock as when he first entered upon the charge he fondly hoped  let one remark and that not the least important be added a curate entering for the first time upon his office comes from college after a course of expense and with such inexperience in the use of money that in his new situation he is apt to fall unawares into pecuniary difficulties if this happens to him much more likely is it to happen to the youthful incumbent whose relations to his parishioners and to society are more complicated and his income being larger and independent of another a costlier style of living is required of him by public opinion if embarrassment should ensue and with that unavoidably some loss of respectability his future usefulness will be proportionably impaired not so with the curate for he can easily remove and start afresh with a stock of experience and an unblemished reputation whereas the early indiscretions of an incumbent being rarely forgotten may be impediments to the efficacy of his ministry for the remainder of his life the same observations would apply with equal force to doctrine a young minister is liable to errors from his notions being either too lax or overstrained in both cases it would prove injurious that the error should be remembered after study and reflection with advancing years shall have brought him to a clearer discernment of the truth and better judgment in the application of it  it must be acknowledged that among the regulations of ecclesiastical polity none at first view are more attractive than that which prescribes for every parish a resident incumbent how agreeable to picture to ones self as has been done by poets and romance writers from chaucer down to goldsmith a man devoted to his ministerial office with not a wish or a thought ranging beyond the circuit of its cares nor is it in poetry and fiction only that such characters are found they are scattered it is hoped not sparingly over real life especially in sequestered and rural districts where there is but small influx of new inhabitants and little change of occupation the spirit of the gospel unaided by acquisitions of profane learning and experience in the worldthat spirit and the obligations of the sacred office may in such situations suffice to effect most of what is needful but for the complex state of society that prevails in england much more is required both in large towns and in many extensive districts of the country a minister should not only be irreproachable in manners and morals but accomplished in learning as far as is possible without sacrifice of the least of his pastoral duties as necessary perhaps more so is it that he should be a citizen as well as a scholar thoroughly acquainted with the structure of society and the constitution of civil government and able to reason upon both with the most expert all ultimately in order to support the truths of christianity and to diffuse its blessings  a young man coming fresh from the place of his education cannot have brought with him these accomplishments and if the scheme of equalising church incomes which many advisers are much bent upon be realised so that there should be little or no secular inducement for a clergyman to desire a removal from the spot where he may chance to have been first set down surely not only opportunities for obtaining the requisite qualifications would be diminished but the motives for desiring to obtain them would be proportionably weakened and yet these qualifications are indispensable for the diffusion of that knowledge by which alone the political philosophy of the new testament can be rightly expounded and its precepts adequately enforced in these time when the press is daily exercising so great a power over the minds of the people for wrong or for right as may happen that preacher ranks among the first of benefactors who without stooping to the direct treatment of current politics and passing events can furnish infallible guidance through the delusions that surround them and who appealing to the sanctions of scripture may place the grounds of its injunctions in so clear a light that disaffection shall cease to be cultivated as a laudable propensity and loyalty cleansed from the dishonour of a blind and prostrate obedience  it is not however in regard to civic duties alone that this knowledge in a minister of the gospel is important it is still more so for softening and subduing private and personal discontents in all places and at all times men have gratuitously troubled themselves because their survey of the dispensations of providence has been partial and narrow but now that readers are so greatly multiplied men judge as they are taught and repinings are engendered everywhere by imputations being cast upon the government and are prolonged or aggravated by being ascribed to misconduct or injustice in rulers when the individual himself only is in fault if a christian pastor be competent to deal with these humours as they may be dealt with and by no members of society so successfully both from more frequent and more favourable opportunities of intercourse and by aid of the authority with which he speaks he will be a teacher of moderation a dispenser of the wisdom that blunts approaching distress by submission to gods will and lightens by patience grievances which cannot be removed  we live in times when nothing of public good at least is generally acceptable but what we believe can be traced to preconceived intention and specific acts and formal contrivances of human understanding a christian instructor thoroughly accomplished would be a standing restraint upon such presumptuousness of judgment by impressing the truth that       in the unreasoning progress of the world      a wiser spirit is at work for us      a better eye than oursms  revelation points to the purity and peace of a future world but our sphere of duty is upon earth and the relations of impure and conflicting things to each other must be understood or we shall be perpetually going wrong in all but goodness of intention and goodness of intention will itself relax through frequent disappointment how desirable then is it that a minister of the gospel should be versed in the knowledge of existing facts and be accustomed to a wide range of social experience nor is it less desirable for the purpose of counterbalancing and tempering in his own mind that ambition with which spiritual power is as apt to be tainted as any other species of power which men covet or possess  it must be obvious that the scope of the argument is to discourage an attempt which would introduce into the church of england an equality of income and station upon the model of that of scotland the sounder part of the scottish nation know what good their ancestors derived from their church and feel how deeply the living generation is indebted to it they respect and love it as accommodated in so great a measure to a comparatively poor country through the far greater portion of which prevails a uniformity of employment but the acknowledged deficiency of theological learning among the clergy of that church is easily accounted for by this very equality what else may be wanting there it would be unpleasant to inquire and might prove invidious to determine one thing however is clear that in all countries the temporalities of the church establishment should bear an analogy to the state of society otherwise it cannot diffuse its influence through the whole community in a country so rich and luxurious as england the character of its clergy must unavoidably sink and their influence be everywhere impaired if individuals from the upper ranks and men of leading talents are to have no inducements to enter into that body but such as are purely spiritual and this tinge of secularity is no reproach to the clergy nor does it imply a deficiency of spiritual endowments parents and guardians looking forward to sources of honourable maintenance for their children and wards often direct their thoughts early towards the church being determined partly by outward circumstances and partly by indications of seriousness or intellectual fitness it is natural that a boy or youth with such a prospect before him should turn his attention to those studies and be led into those habits of reflection which will in some degree tend to prepare him for the duties he is hereafter to undertake as he draws nearer to the time when he will be called to these duties he is both led and compelled to examine the scriptures he becomes more and more sensible of their truth devotion grows in him and what might begin in temporal considerations will end as in a majority of instances we trust it does in a spiritualmindedness not unworthy of that gospel the lessons of which he is to teach and the faith of which he is to inculcate not inappositely may be here repeated an observation which from its obviousness and importance must have been frequently madeviz that the impoverishing of the clergy and bringing their incomes much nearer to a level would not cause them to become less worldlyminded the emoluments howsoever reduced would be as eagerly sought for but by men from lower classes in society men who by their manners habits abilities and the scanty measure of their attainments would unavoidably be less fitted for their station and less competent to discharge its duties  visionary notions have in all ages been afloat upon the subject of best providing for the clergy notions which have been sincerely entertained by good men with a view to the improvement of that order and eagerly caught at and dwelt upon by the designing for its degradation and disparagement some are beguiled by what they call the voluntary system not seeing what stares one in the face at the very threshold that they who stand in most need of religious instruction are unconscious of the want and therefore cannot reasonably be expected to make any sacrifices in order to supply it will the licentious the sensual and the depraved take from the means of their gratifications and pursuits to support a discipline that cannot advance without uprooting the trees that bear the fruit which they devour so greedily will they pay the price of that seed whose harvest is to be reaped in an invisible world a voluntary system for the religious exigencies of a people numerous and circumstanced as we are not more absurd would it be to expect that a knot of boys should draw upon the pittance of their pocketmoney to build schools or out of the abundance of their discretion be able to select fit masters to teach and keep them in order some who clearly perceive the incompetence and folly of such a scheme for the agricultural part of the people nevertheless think it feasible in large towns where the rich might subscribe for the religious instruction of the poor alas they know little of the thick darkness that spreads over the streets and alleys of our large towns the parish of lambeth a few years since contained not more than one church and three or four small proprietary chapels while dissenting chapels of every denomination were still more scantily found there yet the inhabitants of the parish amounted at that time to upwards of 50000 were the parish church and the chapels of the establishment existing there an impediment to the spread of the gospel among that mass of people who shall dare to say so but if any one in the face of the fact which has just been stated and in opposition to authentic reports to the same effect from various other quarters should still contend that a voluntary system is sufficient for the spread and maintenance of religion we would ask what kind of religion wherein would it differ among the many from deplorable fanaticism  for the preservation of the church establishment all men whether they belong to it or not could they perceive their true interest would be strenuous but how inadequate are its provisions for the needs of the country and how much is it to be regretted that while its zealous friends yield to alarms on account of the hostility of dissent they should so much overrate the danger to be apprehended from that quarter and almost overlook the fact that hundreds of thousands of our fellowcountrymen though formally and nominally of the church of england never enter her places of worship neither have they communication with her ministers this deplorable state of things was partly produced by a decay of zeal among the rich and influential and partly by a want of due expansive power in the constitution of the establishment as regulated by law private benefactors in their efforts to build and endow churches have been frustrated or too much impeded by legal obstacles these where they are unreasonable or unfitted for the times ought to be removed and keeping clear of intolerance and injustice means should be used to render the presence and powers of the church commensurate with the wants of a shifting and stillincreasing population  this cannot be effected unless the english government vindicate the truth that as her church exists for the benefit of all though not in equal degree whether of her communion or not all should be made to contribute to its support if this ground be abandoned cause will be given to fear that a moral wound may be inflicted upon the heart of the english people for which a remedy cannot be speedily provided by the utmost efforts which the members of the church will themselves be able to make  but let the friends of the church be of good courage powers are at work by which under divine providence she may be strengthened and the sphere of her usefulness extended not by alterations in her liturgy accommodated to this or that demand of finical taste nor by cutting off this or that from her articles or canons to which the scrupulous or the overweening may object covert schism and open nonconformity would survive after alterations however promising in the eyes of those whose subtilty had been exercised in making them latitudinarianism is the parhelion of liberty of conscience and will ever successfully lay claim to a divided worship among presbyterians socinians baptists and independents there will always be found numbers who will tire of their several creeds and some will come over to the church conventicles may disappear congregations in each denomination may fall into decay or be broken up but the conquests which the national church ought chiefly to aim at lie among the thousands and tens of thousands of the unhappy outcasts who grow up with no religion at all the wants of these cannot but be feelingly remembered whatever may be the disposition of the new constituencies under the reformed parliament and the course which the men of their choice may be inclined or compelled to follow it may be confidently hoped that individuals acting in their private capacities will endeavour to make up for the deficiencies of the legislature is it too much to expect that proprietors of large estates where the inhabitants are without religious instruction or where it is sparingly supplied will deem it their duty to take part in this good work and that thriving manufacturers and merchants will in their several neighbourhoods be sensible of the like obligation and act upon it with generous rivalry  moreover the force of public opinion is rapidly increasing and some may bend to it who are not so happy as to be swayed by a higher motive especially they who derive large incomes from layimpropriations in tracts of country where ministers are few and meagerly provided for a claim still stronger may be acknowledged by those who round their superb habitations or elsewhere walk over vast estates which were lavished upon their ancestors by royal favouritism or purchased at insignificant prices after churchspoliation such proprietors though not consciencestricken there is no call for that may be prompted to make a return for which their tenantry and dependents will learn to bless their names an impulse has been given an accession of means from these several sources cooperating with a wellconsidered change in the distribution of some parts of the property at present possessed by the church a change scrupulously founded upon due respect to law and justice will we trust bring about so much of what her friends desire that the rest may be calmly waited for with thankfulness for what shall have been obtained  let it not be thought unbecoming in a layman to have treated at length a subject with which the clergy are more intimately conversant all may without impropriety speak of what deeply concerns all nor need an apology be offered for going over ground which has been trod before so ably and so often without pretending however

liberty i take in addressing you on the subject of your work i feel deeply interested in the cause you have undertaken to support and my object in writing this letter is to describe to you in part from my own feelings what i conceive to be the state of many minds which may derive important advantage from your instructions  i speak sir of those who though bred up under our unfavourable system of education have yet held at times some intercourse with nature and with those great minds whose works have been moulded by the spirit of nature who therefore when they pass from the seclusion and constraint of early study bring with them into the new scene of the world much of the pure sensibility which is the spring of all that is greatly good in thought and action to such the season of that entrance into the world is a season of fearful importance not for the seduction of its passions but of its opinions whatever be their intellectual powers unless extraordinary circumstances in their lives have been so favourable to the growth of meditative genius that their speculative opinions must spring out of their early feelings their minds are still at the mercy of fortune they have no inward impulse steadily to propel them and must trust to the chances of the world for a guide and such is our present moral and intellectual state that these chances are little else than variety of danger there will be a thousand causes conspiring to complete the work of a false education and by inclosing the mind on every side from the influences of natural feeling to degrade its inborn dignity and finally bring the heart itself under subjection to a corrupted understanding i am anxious to describe to you what i have experienced or seen of the dispositions and feelings that will aid every other cause of danger and tend to lay the mind open to the infection of all those falsehoods in opinion and sentiment which constitute the degeneracy of the age  though it would not be difficult to prove that the mind of the country is much enervated since the days of her strength and brought down from its moral dignity it is not yet so forlorn of all goodthere is nothing in the face of the times so dark and saddening and repulsiveas to shock the first feelings of a generous spirit and drive it at once to seek refuge in the elder ages of our greatness there yet survives so much of the character bred up through long years of liberty danger and glory that even what this age produces bears traces of those that are past and it still yields enough of beautiful and splendid and bold to captivate an ardent but untutored imagination and in this real excellence is the beginning of danger for it is the first spring of that excessive admiration of the age which at last brings down to its own level a mind born above it if there existed only the general disposition of all who are formed with a high capacity for good to be rather credulous of excellence than suspiciously and severely just the error would not be carried far but there are to a young mind in this country and at this time numerous powerful causes concurring to inflame this disposition till the excess of the affection above the worth of its object is beyond all computation to trace these causes it will be necessary to follow the history of a pure and noble mind from the first moment of that critical passage from seclusion to the world which changes all the circumstances of its intellectual existence shows it for the first time the real scene of living men and calls up the new feeling of numerous relations by which it is to be connected with them  to the young adventurer in life who enters upon his course with such a mind every thing seems made for delusion he comes with a spirit the dearest feelings and highest thoughts of which have sprung up under the influences of nature he transfers to the realities of life the high wild fancies of visionary boyhood he brings with him into the world the passions of solitary and untamed imagination and hopes which he has learned from dreams those dreams have been of the great and wonderful and lovely of all which in these has yet been disclosed to him his thoughts have dwelt among the wonders of nature and among the loftiest spirits of men heroes and sages and saintsthose whose deeds and thoughts and hopes were high above ordinary mortality have been the familiar companions of his soul to love and to admire has been the joy of his existence love and admiration are the pleasures he will demand of the world for these he has searched eagerly into the ages that are gone but with more ardent and peremptory expectation he requires them of that in which his own lot is cast for to look on life with hopes of happiness is a necessity of his nature and to him there is no happiness but such as is surrounded with excellence  see first how this spirit will affect his judgment of moral character in those with whom chance may connect him in the common relations of life it is of those with whom he is to live that his soul first demands this food of her desires from their conversation their looks their actions their lives she asks for excellence to ask from all and to ask in vain would be too dismal to bear it would disturb him too deeply with doubt and perplexity and fear in this hope and in the revolting of his thoughts from the possibility of disappointment there is a preparation for selfdelusion there is an unconscious determination that his soul shall be satisfied an obstinate will to find good every where and thus his first study of mankind is a continued effort to read in them the expression of his own feelings he catches at every uncertain shew and shadowy resemblance of what he seeks and unsuspicious in innocence he is first won with those appearances of good which are in fact only false pretensions but this error is not carried far for there is a sort of instinct of rectitude which like the pressure of a talisman given to baffle the illusions of enchantment warns a pure mind against hypocrisy there is another delusion more difficult to resist and more slowly dissipated it is when he finds as he often will some of the real features of excellence in the purity of their native form for then his rapid imagination will gather round them all the kindred features that are wanting to perfect beauty and make for him where he could not find the moral creature of his expectation peopling even from this human world his little circle of affection with forms as fair as his heart desired for its love  but when from the eminence of life which he has reached he lifts up his eyes and sends out his spirit to range over the great scene that is opening before him and around him the whole prospect of civilised life so wide and so magnificentwhen he begins to contemplate in their various stations of power or splendour the leaders of mankind those men on whose wisdom are hung the fortunes of nations those whose genius and valour wield the heroism of a peopleor those in no inferior pride of place whose sway is over the mind of society chiefs in the realm of imagination interpreters of the secrets of nature rulers of human opinionwhat wonder when he looks on all this living scene that his heart should burn with strong affection that he should feel that his own happiness will be for ever interwoven with the interests of mankind here then the sanguine hope with which he looks on life will again be blended with his passionate desire of excellence and he will still be impelled to single out some on whom his imagination and his hopes may repose to whatever department of human thought or action his mind is turned with interest either by the sway of public passion or by its own impulse among statesmen and warriors and philosophers and poets he will distinguish some favoured names on which he may satisfy his admiration and there just as in the little circle of his own acquaintance seizing eagerly on every merit they possess he will supply more from his own credulous hope completing real with imagined excellence till living men with all their imperfections become to him the representatives of his perfect ideal creationtill multiplying his objects of reverence as he enlarges his prospect of life he will have surrounded himself with idols of his own hands and his imagination will seem to discern a glory in the countenance of the age which is but the reflection of its own effulgence  he will possess therefore in the creative power of generous hope a preparation for illusory and exaggerated admiration of the age in which he lives and this predisposition will meet with many favouring circumstances when he has grown up under a system of education like ours which as perhaps all education must that is placed in the hands of a distinct and embodied class who therefore bring to it the peculiar and hereditary prejudices of their order has controlled his imagination to a reverence of former times with an unjust contempt of his own for no sooner does he break loose from this control and begin to feel as he contemplates the world for himself how much there is surrounding him on all sides that gratifies his noblest desires than there springs up in him an indignant sense of injustice both to the age and to his own mind and he is impelled warmly and eagerly to give loose to the feelings that have been held in bondage to seek out and to delight in finding excellence that will vindicate the insulted world while it justifies too his resentment of his own undue subjection and exalts the value of his new found liberty  add to this that secluded as he has been from knowledge and in the imprisoning circle of one system of ideas cut off from his share in the thoughts and feelings that are stirring among men he finds himself at the first steps of his liberty in a new intellectual world passions and powers which he knew not of start up in his soul the human mind which he had seen but under one aspect now presents to him a thousand unknown and beautiful forms he sees it in its varying powers glancing over nature with restless curiosity and with impetuous energy striving for ever against the barriers which she has placed around it sees it with divine power creating from dark materials living beauty and fixing all its high and transported fancies in imperishable forms in the world of knowledge and science and art and genius he treads as a stranger in the confusion of new sensations bewildered in delights all seems beautiful all seems admirable and therefore he engages eagerly in the pursuit of false or insufficient philosophy he is won by the allurements of licentious art he follows with wonder the irregular transports of undisciplined imagination nor where the objects of his admiration are worthy is he yet skilful to distinguish between the acquisitions which the age has made for itself and that large proportion of its wealth which it has only inherited but in his delight of discovery and growing knowledge all that is new to his own mind seems to him newborn to the world to himself every fresh idea appears instruction every new exertion acquisition of power he seems just called to the consciousness of himself and to his true place in the intellectual world and gratitude and reverence towards those to whom he owes this recovery of his dignity tend much to subject him to the dominion of minds that were not formed by nature to be the leaders of opinion  all the tumult and glow of thought and imagination which seize on a mind of power in such a scene tend irresistibly to bind it by stronger attachment of love and admiration to its own age and there is one among the new emotions which belong to its entrance on the world one almost the noblest of all in which this exaltation of the age is essentially mingled the faith in the perpetual progression of human nature towards perfection gives birth to such lofty dreams as secure to it the devout assent of the imagination and it will be yet more grateful to a heart just opening to hope flushed with the consciousness of new strength and exulting in the prospect of destined achievements there is therefore almost a compulsion on generous and enthusiastic spirits as they trust that the future shall transcend the present to believe that the present transcends the past it is only on an undue love and admiration of their own age that they can build their confidence in the melioration of the human race nor is this faith which in some shape will always be the creed of virtue without apparent reason even in the erroneous form in which the young adopt it for there is a perpetual acquisition of knowledge and art an unceasing progress in many of the modes of exertion of the human mind a perpetual unfolding of virtues with the changing manners of society and it is not for a young mind to compare what is gained with what has passed away to discern that amidst the incessant intellectual activity of the race the intellectual power of individual minds maybe falling off and that amidst accumulating knowledge lofty science may disappear and still less to judge in the more complicated moral character of a people what is progression and what is decline  into a mind possessed with this persuasion of the perpetual progress of man there may even imperceptibly steal both from the belief itself and from many of the views on which it rests something like a distrust of the wisdom of great men of former ages and with the reverence which no delusion will ever overpower in a pure mind for their greatness a fancied discernment of imperfection and of incomplete excellence which wanted for its accomplishment the advantages of later improvements there will be a surprise that so much should have been possible in times so ill prepared and even the study of their works may be sometimes rather the curious research of a speculative inquirer than the devout contemplation of an enthusiastthe watchful and obedient heart of a disciple listening to the inspiration of his master  here then is the power of delusion that will gather round the first steps of a youthful spirit and throw enchantment over the world in which it is to dwell hope realising its own dreams ignorance dazzled and ravished with sudden sunshine power awakened and rejoicing in its own consciousness enthusiasm kindling among multiplying images of greatness and beauty and enamoured above all of one splendid error and springing from all these such a rapture of life and hope and joy that the soul in the power of its happiness transmutes things essentially repugnant to it into the excellence of its own nature these are the spells that cheat the eye of the mind with illusion it is under these influences that a young man of ardent spirit gives all his love and reverence and zeal to productions of art to theories of science to opinions to systems of feeling and to characters distinguished in the world that are far beneath his own original dignity  now as this delusion springs not from his worse but his better nature it seems as if there could be no warning to him from within of his danger for even the impassioned joy which he draws at times from the works of nature and from those of her mightier sons and which would startle him from a dream of unworthy passion serves only to fix the infatuationfor those deep emotions proving to him that his heart is uncorrupted justify to him all its workings and his mind confiding and delighting in itself yields to the guidance of its own blind impulses of pleasure his chance therefore of security is the chance that the greater number of objects occurring to attract his honourable passions may be worthy of them but we have seen that the whole power of circumstances is collected to gather round him such objects and influences as will bend his high passions to unworthy enjoyment he engages in it with a heart and understanding unspoiled but they cannot long be misapplied with impunity they are drawn gradually into closer sympathy with the falsehoods they have adopted till his very nature seeming to change under the corruption there disappears from it the capacity of those higher perceptions and pleasures to which he was born and he is cast off from the communion of exalted minds to live and to perish with the age to which he has surrendered himself  if minds under these circumstances of danger are preserved from decay and overthrow it can seldom i think be to themselves that they owe their deliverance it must be to a fortunate chance which places them under the influence of some more enlightened mind from which they may first gain suspicion and afterwards wisdom there is a philosophy which leading them by the light of their best emotions to the principles which should give life to thought and law to genius will discover to them in clear and perfect evidence the falsehood of the errors that have misled them and restore them to themselves and this philosophy they will be willing to hear and wise to understand but they must be led into its mysteries by some guiding hand for they want the impulse or the power to penetrate of themselves the recesses  if a superior mind should assume the protection of others just beginning to move among the dangers i have described it would probably be found that delusions springing from their own virtuous activity were not the only difficulties to be encountered even after suspicion is awakened the subjection to falsehood may be prolonged and deepened by many weaknesses both of the intellectual and moral nature weaknesses that will sometimes shake the authority of acknowledged truth there may be intellectual indolence an indisposition in the mind to the effort of combining the ideas it actually possesses and bringing into distinct form the knowledge which in its elements is already its own there may be where the heart resists the sway of opinion misgivings and modest selfmistrust in him who sees that if he trusts his heart he must slight the judgment of all around himthere may be too habitual yielding to authority consisting more than in indolence or diffidence in a conscious helplessness and incapacity of the mind to maintain itself in its own place against the weight of general opinion and there may be too indiscriminate too undisciplined a sympathy with others which by the mere infection of feeling will subdue the reason there must be a weakness in dejection to him who thinks with sadness if his faith be pure how gross is the error of the multitude and that multitude how vasta reluctance to embrace a creed that excludes so many whom he loves so many whom his youth has revereda difficulty to his understanding to believe that those whom he knows to be in much that is good and honourable his superiors can be beneath him in this which is the most important of alla sympathy pleading importunately at his heart to descend to the fellowship of his brothers and to take their faith and wisdom for his own how often when under the impulses of those solemn hours in which he has felt with clearer insight and deeper faith his sacred truths he labours to win to his own belief those whom he loves will he be checked by their indifference or their laughter and will he not bear back to his meditations a painful and disheartening sorrow a gloomy discontent in that faith which takes in but a portion of those whom he wishes to include in all his blessings will he not be enfeebled by a distraction of inconsistent desires when he feels so strongly that the faith which fills his heart the circle within which he would embrace all he loveswould repose all his wishes and hopes and enjoymentsis yet incommensurate with his affections  even when the mind strong in reason and just feeling united and relying on its strength has attached itself to truth how much is there in the course and accidents of life that is for ever silently at work for its degradation there are pleasures deemed harmless that lay asleep the recollections of innocence there are pursuits held honourable or imposed by duty that oppress the moral spirit above all there is that perpetual connection with ordinary minds in the common intercourse of society that restless activity of frivolous conversation where men of all characters and all pursuits mixing together nothing may be talked of that is not of common interest to allnothing therefore but those obvious thoughts and feelings that float over the surface of things and all which is drawn from the depth of nature all which impassioned feeling has made original in thought would be misplaced and obtrusive the talent that is allowed to shew itself is that which can repay admiration by furnishing entertainment and the display to which it is invited is that which flatters the vulgar pride of society by abasing what is too high in excellence for its sympathy a dangerous seduction to talents which would make language given to exalt the soul by the fervid expression of its pure emotions the instrument of its degradation and even when there is as in the instance i have supposed too much uprightness to choose so dishonourable a triumph there is a necessity of manners by which everyone must be controlled who mixes much in society not to offend those with whom he converses by his superiority and whatever be the native spirit of a mind it is evident that this perpetual adaptation of itself to others this watchfulness against its own rising feelings this studied sympathy with mediocrity must pollute and impoverish the sources of its strength  from much of its own weakness and from all the errors of its misleading activities may generous youth be rescued by the interposition of an enlightened mind and in some degree it may be guarded by instruction against the injuries to which it is exposed in the world his lot is happy who owes this protection to friendship who has found in a friend the watchful guardian of his mind he will not be deluded having that light to guide he will not slumber with that voice to inspire he will not be desponding or dejected with that bosom to lean on but how many must there be whom heaven has left unprovided except in their own strength who must maintain themselves unassisted and solitary against their own infirmities and the opposition of the world for such there may yet be a protector if a teacher should stand up in their generation conspicuous above the multitude in superior power and still more in the assertion and proclamation of disregarded truthto him to his cheering or summoning voice all those would turn whose deep sensibility has been oppressed by the indifference or misled by the seduction of the times of one such teacher who has been given to our own age you have described the power when you said that in his annunciation of truths he seemed to speak in thunders i believe that mighty voice has not been poured out in vain that there are hearts that have received into their inmost depths all its varying tones and that even now there are many to whom the name of wordsworth calls up the recollection of their weakness and the consciousness of their strength  to give to the reason and eloquence of one man this complete control over the minds of others it is necessary i think that he should be born in their own times for thus whatever false opinion of preeminence is attached to the age becomes at once a title of reverence to him and when with distinguished powers he sets himself apart from the age and above it as the teacher of high but illunderstood truths he will appear at once to a generous imagination in the dignity of one whose superior mind outsteps the rapid progress of society and will derive from illusion itself the power to disperse illusions it is probable too that he who labours under the errors i have described might feel the power of truth in a writer of another age yet fail in applying the full force of his principles to his own times but when he receives them from a living teacher there is no room for doubt or misapplication it is the errors of his own generation that are denounced and whatever authority he may acknowledge in the instructions of his master strikes with inevitable force at his veneration for the opinions and characters of his own times and finally there will be gathered round a living teacher who speaks to the deeper soul many feelings of human love that will place the infirmities of the heart peculiarly under his control at the same time that they blend with and animate the attachment to his cause so that there will flow from him something of the peculiar influence of a friend while his doctrines will be embraced and asserted and vindicated with the ardent zeal of a disciple such as can scarcely be carried back to distant times or connected with voices that speak only from the grave  i have done what i proposed i have related to you as much as i have had opportunities of knowing of the difficulties from within and from without which may oppose the natural development of true feeling and right opinion in a mind formed with some capacity for good and the resources which such a mind may derive from an enlightened contemporary writer if what i have said be just it is certain that this influence will be felt more particularly in a work adapted by its mode of publication to address the feelings of the time and to bring to its readers repeated admonition and repeated consolation  i have perhaps presumed too far in trespassing on your attention and in giving way to my own thoughts but i was unwilling to leave any thing unsaid which might induce you to consider with favour the request i was anxious to make in the name of all whose state of mind i have described that you would at times regard us more particularly in your instructions i cannot judge to what degree it may be in your power to give the truth you teach a control over understandings that have matured their strength in error but in our class i am sure you will have docile learners  mathetes  b answer to the letter of mathetes  the friend might rest satisfied that his exertions thus far have not been wholly unprofitable if no other proof had been given of their influence than that of having called forth the foregoing letter with which he has been so much interested that he could not deny himself the pleasure of communicating it to his readers in answer to his correspondent it need scarcely here be repeated that one of the main purposes of his work is to weigh honestly and thoughtfully the moral worth and intellectual power of the age in which we live to ascertain our gain and our loss to determine what we are in ourselves positively and what we are compared with our ancestors and thus and by every other means within his power to discover what may be hoped for future times what and how lamentable are the evils to be feared and how far there is cause for fear if this attempt should not be made wholly in vain my ingenious correspondent and all who are in a state of mind resembling that of which he gives so lively a picture will be enabled more readily and surely to distinguish false from legitimate objects of admiration and thus may the personal errors which he would guard against be more effectually prevented or removed by the development of general truth for a general purpose than by instructions specifically adapted to himself or to the class of which he is the able representative there is a life and spirit in knowledge which we extract from truths scattered for the benefit of all and which the mind by its own activity has appropriated to itselfa life and spirit which is seldom found in knowledge communicated by formal and direct precepts even when they are exalted and endeared by reverence and love for the teacher  nevertheless though i trust that the assistance which my correspondent has done me the honour to request will in course of time flow naturally from my labours in a manner that will best serve him i cannot resist the inclination to connect at present with his letter a few remarks of direct application to the subject of it remarks i sayfor to such i shall confine myselfindependent of the main point out of which his complaint and request both proceed i mean the assumed inferiority of the present age in moral dignity and intellectual power to those which have preceded it for if the fact were true that we had even surpassed our ancestors in the best of what is good the main part of the dangers and impediments which my correspondent has feelingly portrayed could not cease to exist for minds like his nor indeed would they be much diminished as they arise out of the constitution of things from the nature of youth from the laws that govern the growth of the faculties and from the necessary condition of the great body of mankind let us throw ourselves back to the age of elizabeth and call up to mind the heroes the warriors the statesmen the poets the divines and the moral philosophers with which the reign of the virgin queen was illustrated or if we be more strongly attracted by the moral purity and greatness and that sanctity of civil and religious duty with which the tyranny of charles i was struggled against let us cast our eyes in the hurry of admiration round that circle of glorious patriots but do not let us be persuaded that each of these in his course of discipline was uniformly helped forward by those with whom he associated or by those whose care it was to direct him then as now existed objects to which the wisest attached undue importance then as now judgment was misled by factions and parties time wasted in controversies fruitless except as far as they quickened the faculties then as now minds were venerated or idolized which owed their influence to the weakness of their contemporaries rather than to their own power then though great actions were wrought and great works in literature and science produced yet the general taste was capricious fantastical or grovelling and in this point as in all others was youth subject to delusion frequent in proportion to the liveliness of the sensibility and strong as the strength of the imagination every age hath abounded in instances of parents kindred and friends who by indirect influence of example or by positive injunction and exhortation have diverted or discouraged the youth who in the simplicity and purity of nature had determined to follow his intellectual genius through good and through evil and had devoted himself to knowledge to the practice of virtue and the preservation of integrity in slight of temporal rewards above all have not the common duties and cares of common life at all times exposed men to injury from causes the action of which is the more fatal from being silent and unremitting and which wherever it was not jealously watched and steadily opposed must have pressed upon and consumed the diviner spirit  there are two errors into which we easily slip when thinking of past times one lies in forgetting in the excellence of what remains the large overbalance of worthlessness that has been swept away ranging over the wide tracts of antiquity the situation of the mind may be likened to that of a traveller26 in some unpeopled part of america who is attracted to the burial place of one of the primitive inhabitants it is conspicuous upon an eminence a mount upon a mount he digs into it and finds that it contains the bones of a man of mighty stature and he is tempted to give way to a belief that as there were giants in those days so all men were giants but a second and wiser thought may suggest to him that this tomb would never have forced itself upon his notice if it had not contained a body that was distinguished from othersthat of a man who had been selected as a chieftain or ruler for the very reason that he surpassed the rest of his tribe in stature and who now lies thus conspicuously inhumed upon the mountaintop while the bones of his followers are laid unobtrusively together in their burrows upon the plain below the second habitual error is that in this comparison of ages we divide time merely into past and present and place these in the balance to be weighed against each other not considering that the present is in our estimation not more than a period of thirty years or half a century at most and that the past is a mighty accumulation of many such periods perhaps the whole of recorded time or at least the whole of that portion of it in which our own country has been distinguished we may illustrate this by the familiar use of the words ancient and modern when applied to poetry what can be more inconsiderate or unjust than to compare a few existing writers with the whole succession of their progenitors the delusion from the moment that our thoughts are directed to it seems too gross to deserve mention yet men will talk for hours upon poetry balancing against each other the words ancient and modern and be unconscious that they have fallen into it  26 see ashes travels in america  these observations are not made as implying a dissent from the belief of my correspondent that the moral spirit and intellectual powers of this country are declining but to guard against unqualified admiration even in cases where admiration has been rightly fixed and to prevent that depression which must necessarily follow where the notion of the peculiar unfavourableness of the present times to dignity of mind has been carried too far for in proportion as we imagine obstacles to exist out of ourselves to retard our progress will in fact our progress be retarded deeming then that in all ages an ardent mind will be baffled and led astray in the manner under contemplation though in various degrees i shall at present content myself with a few practical and desultory comments upon some of those general causes to which my correspondent justly attributes the errors in opinion and the lowering or deadening of sentiment to which ingenuous and aspiring youth is exposed and first for the heartcheering belief in the perpetual progress of the species towards a point of unattainable perfection if the present age do indeed transcend the past in what is most beneficial and honourable he that perceives this being in no error has no cause for complaint but if it be not so a youth of genius might it should seem be preserved from any wrong influence of this faith by an insight into a simple truth namely that it is not necessary in order to satisfy the desires of our nature or to reconcile us to the economy of providence that there should be at all times a continuous advance in what is of highest worth in fact it is not as a writer of the present day has admirably observed in the power of fiction to portray in words or of the imagination to conceive in spirit actions or characters of more exalted virtue than those which thousands of years ago have existed upon earth as we know from the records of authentic history such is the inherent dignity of human nature that there belong to it sublimities of virtues which all men may attain and which no man can transcend and though this be not true in an equal degree of intellectual power yet in the persons of plato demosthenes and homer and in those of shakespeare milton and lord bacon were enshrined as much of the divinity of intellect as the inhabitants of this planet can hope will ever take up its abode among them but the question is not of the power or worth of individual minds but of the general moral or intellectual merits of an age or a people or of the human race be it so let us allow and believe that there is a progress in the species towards unattainable perfection or whether this be so or not that it is a necessity of a good and greatlygifted nature to believe it surely it does not follow that this progress should be constant in those virtues and intellectual qualities and in those departments of knowledge which in themselves absolutely considered are of most value things independent and in their degree indispensable the progress of the species neither is nor can be like that of a roman road in a right line it may be more justly compared to that of a river which both in its smaller reaches and larger turnings is frequently forced back towards its fountains by objects which cannot otherwise be eluded or overcome yet with an accompanying impulse that will insure its advancement hereafter it is either gaining strength every hour or conquering in secret some difficulty by a labour that contributes as effectually to further it in its course as when it moves forward uninterrupted in a line direct as that of the roman road with which i began the comparison  it suffices to content the mind though there may be an apparent stagnation or a retrograde movement in the species that something is doing which is necessary to be done and the effects of which will in due time appear that something is unremittingly gaining either in secret preparation or in open and triumphant progress but in fact here as every where we are deceived by creations which the mind is compelled to make for itself we speak of the species not as an aggregate but as endued with the form and separate life of an individual but human kindwhat is it else than myriads of rational beings in various degrees obedient to their reason some torpid some aspiring some in eager chase to the right hand some to the left these wasting down their moral nature and those feeding it for immortality a whole generation may appear even to sleep or may be exasperated with ragethey that compose it tearing each other to pieces with more than brutal fury it is enough for complacency and hope that scattered and solitary minds are always labouring somewhere in the service of truth and virtue and that by the sleep of the multitude the energy of the multitude may be prepared and that by the fury of the people the chains of the people may be broken happy moment was it for england when her chaucer who has rightly been called the morning star of her literature appeared above the horizon when her wicliffe like the sun shot orient beams through the night of romish superstition yet may the darkness and the desolating hurricane which immediately followed in the wars of york and lancaster be deemed in their turn a blessing with which the land has been visited  may i return to the thought of progress of accumulation of increasing light or of any other image by which it may please us to represent the improvement of the species the hundred years that followed the usurpation of henry iv were a hurlingback of the mind of the country a dilapidation an extinction yet institutions laws customs and habits were then broken down which would not have been so readily nor perhaps so thoroughly destroyed by the gradual influence of increasing knowledge and under the oppression of which if they had continued to exist the virtue and intellectual prowess of the succeeding century could not have appeared at all much less could they have displayed themselves with that eager haste and with those beneficent triumphs which will to the end of time be looked back upon with admiration and gratitude  if the foregoing obvious distinctions be once clearly perceived and steadily kept in view i do not see why a belief in the progress of human nature towards perfection should dispose a youthful mind however enthusiastic to an undue admiration of his own age and thus tend to degrade that mind  but let me strike at once at the root of the evil complained of in my correspondents letter protection from any fatal effect of seductions and hindrances which opinion may throw in the way of pure and highminded youth can only be obtained with certainty at the same price by which every thing great and good is obtained namely steady dependence upon voluntary and selforiginating effort and upon the practice of selfexamination sincerely aimed at and rigorously enforced but how is this to be expected from youth is it not to demand the fruit when the blossom is barely put forth and is hourly at the mercy of frosts and winds to expect from youth these virtues and habits in that degree of excellence to which in mature years they may be carried would indeed be preposterous yet has youth many helps and aptitudes for the discharge of these difficult duties which are withdrawn for the most part from the more advanced stages of life for youth has its own wealth and independence it is rich in health of body and animal spirits in its sensibility to the impressions of the natural universe in the conscious growth of knowledge in lively sympathy and familiar communion with the generous actions recorded in history and with the high passions of poetry and above all youth is rich in the possession of time and the accompanying consciousness of freedom and power the young man feels that he stands at a distance from the season when his harvest is to be reaped that he has leisure and may look around and may defer both the choice and the execution of his purposes if he makes an attempt and shall fail new hopes immediately rush in and new promises hence in the happy confidence of his feelings and in the elasticity of his spirit neither worldly ambition nor the love of praise nor dread of censure nor the necessity of worldly maintenance nor any of those causes which tempt or compel the mind habitually to look out of itself for support neither these nor the passions of envy fear hatred despondency and the rankling of disappointed hopes all which in after life give birth to and regulate the efforts of men and determine their opinions have power to preside over the choice of the young if the disposition be not naturally bad or the circumstances have not been in an uncommon degree unfavourable  in contemplation then of this disinterested and free condition of the youthful mind i deem it in many points peculiarly capable of searching into itself and of profiting by a few simple questions such as these that follow am i chiefly gratified by the exertion of my power from the pure pleasure of intellectual activity and from the knowledge thereby acquired in other words to what degree do i value my faculties and my attainments for their own sakes or are they chiefly prized by me on account of the distinction which they confer or the superiority which they give me over others am i aware that immediate influence and a general acknowledgment of merit are no necessary adjuncts of a successful adherence to study and meditation in those departments of knowledge which are of most value to mankindthat a recompense of honours and emoluments is far less to be expected in fact that there is little natural connection between them have i perceived this truth and perceiving it does the countenance of philosophy continue to appear as bright and beautiful in my eyeshas no haze bedimmed it has no cloud passed over and hidden from me that look which was before so encouraging knowing that it is my duty and feeling that it is my inclination to mingle as a social being with my fellow men prepared also to submit cheerfully to the necessity that will probably exist of relinquishing for the purpose of gaining a livelihood the greatest portion of my time to employments where i shall have little or no choice how or when i am to act have i at this moment when i stand as it were upon the threshold of the busy world a clear intuition of that preeminence in which virtue and truth involving in this latter word the sanctities of religion sit enthroned above all denominations and dignities which in various degrees of exaltation rule over the desires of men do i feel that if their solemn mandates shall be forgotten or disregarded or denied the obedience due to them when opposed to others i shall not only have lived for no good purpose but that i shall have sacrificed my birthright as a rational being and that every other acquisition will be a bane and a disgrace to me this is not spoken with reference to such sacrifices as present themselves to the youthful imagination in the shape of crimes acts by which the conscience is violated such a thought i know would be recoiled from at once not without indignation but i write in the spirit of the ancient fable of prodicus representing the choice of hercules here is the world a female figure approaching at the head of a train of willing or giddy followers her air and deportment are at once careless remiss selfsatisfied and haughty and there is intellectual prowess with a pale cheek and serene brow leading in chains truth her beautiful and modest captive the one makes her salutation with a discourse of ease pleasure freedom and domestic tranquillity or if she invite to labour it is labour in the busy and beaten track with assurance of the complacent regards of parents friends and of those with whom we associate the promise also may be upon her lip of the huzzas of the multitude of the smile of kings and the munificent rewards of senates the other does not venture to hold forth any of these allurements she does not conceal from him whom she addresses the impediments the disappointments the ignorance and prejudice which her follower will have to encounter if devoted when duty calls to active life and if to contemplative she lays nakedly before him a scheme of solitary and unremitting labour a life of entire neglect perhaps or assuredly a life exposed to scorn insult persecution and hatred but cheered by encouragement from a grateful few by applauding conscience and by a prophetic anticipation perhaps of famea late though lasting consequence of these two each in this manner soliciting you to become her adherent you doubt not which to prefer but oh the thought of moment is not preference but the degree of preference the passionate and pure choice the inward sense of absolute and unchangeable devotion  i spoke of a few simple questions the question involved in this deliberation is simple but at the same time it is high and awful and i would gladly know whether an answer can be returned satisfactory to the mind we will for a moment suppose that it can not that there is a startling and a hesitation are we then to despondto retire from all contestand to reconcile ourselves at once to cares without a generous hope and to efforts in which there is no more moral life than that which is found in the business and labours of the unfavoured and unaspiring many no but if the inquiry have not been on just grounds satisfactorily answered we may refer confidently our youth to that nature of which he deems himself an enthusiastic follower and one who wishes to continue no less faithful and enthusiastic we would tell him that there are paths which he has not trodden recesses which he has not penetrated that there is a beauty which he has not seen a pathos which he has not felt a sublimity to which he hath not been raised if he have trembled because there has occasionally taken place in him a lapse of which he is conscious if he foresee open or secret attacks which he has had intimations that he will neither be strong enough to resist nor watchful enough to elude let him not hastily ascribe this weakness this deficiency and the painful apprehensions accompanying them in any degree to the virtues or noble qualities with which youth by nature is furnished but let him first be assured before he looks about for the means of attaining the insight the discriminating powers and the confirmed wisdom of manhood that his soul has more to demand of the appropriate excellencies of youth than youth has yet supplied to it that the evil under which he labours is not a superabundance of the instincts and the animating spirit of that age but a falling short or a failure but what can he gain from this admonition he cannot recall past time he cannot begin his journey afresh he cannot untwist the links by which in no undelightful harmony images and sentiments are wedded in his mind granted that the sacred light of childhood is and must be for him no more than a remembrance he may notwithstanding be remanded to nature and with trustworthy hopes founded less upon his sentient than upon his intellectual being to nature as leading on insensibly to the society of reason but to reason and will as leading back to the wisdom of nature a reunion in this order accomplished will bring reformation and timely support and the two powers of reason and nature thus reciprocally teacher and taught may advance together in a track to which there is no limit  we have been discoursing by implication at least of infancy childhood boyhood and youth of pleasures lying upon the unfolding intellect plenteously as morning dewdropsof knowledge inhaled insensibly like the fragranceof dispositions stealing into the spirit like music from unknown quartersof images uncalled for and rising up like exhalationsof hopes plucked like beautiful wild flowers from the ruined tombs that border the highways of antiquity to make a garland for a living foreheadin a word we have been treating of nature as a teacher of truth through joy and through gladness and as a creatress of the faculties by a process of smoothness and delight we have made no mention of fear shame sorrow nor of ungovernable and vexing thoughts because although these have been and have done mighty service they are overlooked in that stage of life when youth is passing into manhoodoverlooked or forgotten we now apply for the succour which we need to a faculty that works after a different course that faculty is reason she gives more spontaneously but she seeks for more she works by thought through feeling yet in thoughts she begins and ends  a familiar incident may elucidate this contrast in the operations of nature may render plain the manner in which a process of intellectual improvements the reverse of that which nature pursues is by reason introduced there never perhaps existed a schoolboy who having when he retired to rest carelessly blown out his candle and having chanced to notice as he lay upon his bed in the ensuing darkness the sullen light which had survived the extinguished flame did not at some time or other watch that light as if his mind were bound to it by a spell it fades and revives gathers to a point seems as if it would go out in a moment again recovers its strength nay becomes brighter than before it continues to shine with an endurance which in its apparent weakness is a mystery it protracts its existence so long clinging to the power which supports it that the observer who had lain down in his bed so easyminded becomes sad and melancholy his sympathies are touched it is to him an intimation and an image of departing human life the thought comes nearer to him it is the life of a venerated parent of a beloved brother or sister or of an aged domestic who are gone to the grave or whose destiny it soon may be thus to linger thus to hang upon the last point of mortal existence thus finally to depart and be seen no more this is nature teaching seriously and sweetly through the affections melting the heart and through that instinct of tenderness developing the understanding in this instance the object of solicitude is the bodily life of another let us accompany this same boy to that period between youth and manhood when a solicitude may be awakened for the moral life of himself are there any powers by which beginning with a sense of inward decay that affects not however the natural life he could call to mind the same image and hang over it with an equal interest as a visible type of his own perishing spirit oh surely if the being of the individual be under his own care if it be his first care if duty begin from the point of accountableness to our conscience and through that to god and human nature if without such primary sense of duty all secondary care of teacher of friend or parent must be baseless and fruitless if lastly the motions of the soul transcend in worth those of the animal functions nay give to them their sole value then truly are there such powers and the image of the dying taper may be recalled and contemplated though with no sadness in the nerves no disposition to tears no unconquerable sighs yet with a melancholy in the soul a sinking inward into ourselves from thought to thought a steady remonstrance and a high resolve let then the youth go back as occasion will permit to nature and to solitude thus admonished by reason and relying upon this newly acquired support a world of fresh sensations will gradually open upon him as his mind puts off its infirmities and as instead of being propelled restlessly towards others in admiration or too hasty love he makes it his prime business to understand himself new sensations i affirm will be opened out pure and sanctioned by that reason which is their original author and precious feelings of disinterested that is selfdisregarding joy and love may be regenerated and restored and in this sense he may be said to measure back the track of life he has trodden  in such disposition of mind let the youth return to the visible universe and to conversation with ancient books and to those if such there be which in the present day breathe the ancient spirit and let him feed upon that beauty which unfolds itself not to his eye as it sees carelessly the things which cannot possibly go unseen and are remembered or not as accident shall decide but to the thinking mind which searches discovers and treasures up infusing by meditation into the objects with which it converses an intellectual life whereby they remain planted in the memory now and for ever hitherto the youth i suppose has been content for the most part to look at his own mind after the manner in which he ranges along the stars in the firmament with naked unaided sight let him now apply the telescope of art to call the invisible stars out of their hiding places and let him endeavour to look through the system of his being with the organ of reason summoned to penetrate as far as it has power in discovery of the impelling forces and the governing laws  these expectations are not immoderate they demand nothing more than the perception of a few plain truths namely that knowledge efficacious for the production of virtue is the ultimate end of all effort the sole dispenser of complacency and repose a perception also is implied of the inherent superiority of contemplation to action the friend does not in this contradict his own words where he has said heretofore that doubtless to act is nobler than to think27  27 the friend vol i p 158 ed 1850 g  in those words it was his purpose to censure that barren contemplation which rests satisfied with itself in cases where the thoughts are of such quality that they may and ought to be embodied in action but he speaks now of the general superiority of thought to action as proceeding and governing all action that moves to salutary purposes and secondly as leading to elevation the absolute possession of the individual mind and to a consistency or harmony of the being within itself which no outward agency can reach to disturb or to impair and lastly as producing works of pure science or of the combined faculties of imagination feeling and reason works which both from their independence in their origin upon accident their nature their duration and the wide spread of their influence are entitled rightly to take place of the noblest and most beneficent deeds of heroes statesmen legislators or warriors  yet beginning from the perception of this established superiority we do not suppose that the youth whom we wish to guide and encourage is to be insensible to those influences of wealth or rank or station by which the bulk of mankind are swayed our eyes have not been fixed upon virtue which lies apart from human nature or transcends it in fact there is no such virtue we neither suppose nor wish him to undervalue or slight these distinctions as modes of power things that may enable him to be more useful to his contemporaries nor as gratifications that may confer dignity upon his living person and through him upon those who love him nor as they may connect his name through a family to be founded by his success in a closer chain of gratitude with some portion of posterity who shall speak of him as among their ancestry with a more tender interest than the mere general bond of patriotism or humanity would supply we suppose no indifference to much less a contempt of these rewards but let them have their due place let it be ascertained when the soul is searched into that they are only an auxiliary motive to exertion never the principal or originating force if this be too much to expect from a youth who i take for granted possesses no ordinary endowments and whom circumstances with respect to the more dangerous passions have favoured then indeed must the noble spirit of the country be wasted away then would our institutions be deplorable and the education prevalent among us utterly vile and debasing  but my correspondent who drew forth these thoughts has said rightly that the character of the age may not without injustice be thus branded he will not deny that without speaking of other countries there is in these islands in the departments of natural philosophy of mechanic ingenuity in the general activities of the country and in the particular excellence of individual minds in high stations civil or military enough to excite admiration and love in the soberminded and more than enough to intoxicate the youthful and inexperienced i will compare then an aspiring youth leaving the schools in which he has been disciplined and preparing to bear a part in the concerns of the world i will compare him in this season of eager admiration to a newlyinvested knight appearing with his blank unsignalized shield upon some day of solemn tournament at the court of the faeryqueen as that sovereignty was conceived to exist by the moral and imaginative genius of our divine spenser he does not himself immediately enter the lists as a combatant but he looks round him with a beating heart dazzled by the gorgeous pageantry the banners the impresses the ladies of overcoming beauty the persons of the knights now first seen by him the fame of whose actions is carried by the traveller like merchandize through the world and resounded upon the harp of the minstrel but i am not at liberty to make this comparison if a youth were to begin his career in such an assemblage with such examples to guide and to animate it will be pleaded there would be no cause for apprehension he could not falter he could not be misled but ours is notwithstanding its manifold excellences a degenerate age and recreant knights are among us far outnumbering the true a false gloriana in these days imposes worthless services which they who perform them in their blindness know not to be such and which are recompensed by rewards as worthless yet eagerly grasped at as if they were the immortal guerdon of virtue  i have in this declaration insensibly overstepped the limits which i had determined not to pass let me be forgiven for it is hope which hath carried me forward in such a mixed assemblage as our age presents with its genuine merit and its large overbalance of alloy i may boldly ask into what errors either with respect to person or thing could a young man fall who had sincerely entered upon the course of moral discipline which has been recommended and to which the condition of youth it has been proved is favourable his opinions could no where deceive him beyond the point up to which after a season he would find that it was salutary for him to have been deceived for as that man cannot set a right value upon health who has never known sickness nor feel the blessing of ease who has been through his life a stranger to pain so can there be no confirmed and passionate love of truth for him who has not experienced the hollowness of error range against each other as advocates oppose as combatants two several intellects each strenuously asserting doctrines which he sincerely believes but the one contending for the worth and beauty of that garment which the other has outgrown and cast away mark the superiority the ease the dignity on the side of the more advanced mind how he overlooks his subject commands it from centre to circumference and hath the same thorough knowledge of the tenets which his adversary with impetuous zeal but in confusion also and thrown off his guard at every turn of the argument is labouring to maintain if it be a question of the fine arts poetry for instance the riper mind not only sees that his opponent is deceived but what is of far more importance sees how he is deceived the imagination stands before him with all its imperfections laid open as duped by shows enslaved by words corrupted by mistaken delicacy and false refinement as not having even attended with care to the reports of the senses and therefore deficient grossly in the rudiments of its own power he has noted how as a supposed necessary condition the understanding sleeps in order that the fancy may dream studied in the history of society and versed in the secret laws of thought he can pass regularly through all the gradations can pierce infallibly all the windings which false taste through ages has pursued from the very time when first through inexperience heedlessness or affectation the imagination took its departure from the side of truth its original parent can a disputant thus accoutred be withstoodone to whom further every movement in the thoughts of his antagonist is revealed by the light of his own experience who therefore sympathizes with weakness gently and wins his way by forbearance and hath when needful an irresistible power of onset arising from gratitude to the truth which he vindicates not merely as a positive good for mankind but as his own especial rescue and redemption  i might here conclude but my correspondent towards the close of his letter has written so feelingly upon the advantages to be derived in his estimation from a living instructor that i must not leave this part of the subject without a word of direct notice the friend cited some time ago28 a passage from the prose works of milton eloquently describing the manner in which good and evil grow up together in the field of the world almost inseparably and insisting consequently upon the knowledge and survey of vice as necessary to the constituting of human virtue and the scanning of error to the confirmation of truth  28 the friend vol i p 96 ed 1850 g  if this be so and i have been reasoning to the same effect in the preceding paragraph the fact and the thoughts which it may suggest will if rightly applied tend to moderate an anxiety for the guidance of a more experienced or superior mind the advantage where it is possessed is far from being an absolute good nay such a preceptor ever at hand might prove an oppression not to be thrown off and a fatal hindrance grant that in the general tenor of his intercourse with his pupil he is forbearing and circumspect inasmuch as he is rich in that knowledge above all other necessary for a teacher which cannot exist without a liveliness of memory preserving for him an unbroken image of the winding excursive and often retrograde course along which his own intellect has passed grant that furnished with these distinct remembrances he wishes that the mind of his pupil should be free to luxuriate in the enjoyments loves and admirations appropriated to its age that he is not in haste to kill what he knows will in due time die of itself or be transmuted and put on a nobler form and higher faculties otherwise unattainable in a word that the teacher is governed habitually by the wisdom of patience waiting with pleasure yet perceiving how much the outward help of art can facilitate the progress of nature he may be betrayed into many unnecessary or pernicious mistakes where he deems his interference warranted by substantial experience and in spite of all his caution remarks may drop insensibly from him which shall wither in the mind of his pupil a generous sympathy destroy a sentiment of approbation or dislike not merely innocent but salutary and for the inexperienced disciple how many pleasures may be thus off what joy what admiration and what love while in their stead are introduced into the ingenuous mind misgivings a mistrust of its own evidence dispositions to affect to feel where there can be no real feeling indecisive judgments a superstructure of opinions that has no base to support it and words uttered by rote with the impertinence of a parrot or a mockingbird yet which may not be listened to with the same indifference as they cannot be heard without some feeling of moral disapprobation  these results i contend whatever may be the benefit to be derived from such an enlightened teacher are in their degree inevitable and by this process humility and docile dispositions may exist towards the master endued as he is with the power which personal presence confers but at the same time they will be liable to overstep their due bounds and to degenerate into passiveness and prostration of mind this towards him while with respect to other living men nay even to the mighty spirits of past times there may be associated with such weakness a want of modesty and humility insensibly may steal in presumption and a habit of sitting in judgment in cases where no sentiment ought to have existed but diffidence or veneration such virtues are the sacred attributes of youth its appropriate calling is not to distinguish in the fear of being deceived or degraded not to analyze with scrupulous minuteness but to accumulate in genial confidence its instinct its safety its benefit its glory is to love to admire to feel and to labour nature has irrevocably decreed that our prime dependence in all stages of life after infancy and childhood have been passed through nor do i know that this latter ought to be excepted must be upon our own minds and that the way to knowledge shall be long difficult winding and oftentimes returning upon itself  what has been said is a mere sketch and that only of a part of the interesting country into which we have been led but my correspondent will be able to enter the paths that have been pointed out should he do this and advance steadily for a while he needs not fear any deviations from the truth which will be finally injurious to him he will not long have his admiration fixed upon unworthy objects he will neither be clogged nor drawn aside by the love of friends or kindred betraying his understanding through his affections he will neither be bowed down by conventional arrangements of manners producing too often a lifeless decency nor will the rock of his spirit wear away in the endless beating of the waves of the world neither will that portion of his own time which he must surrender to labours by which his livelihood is to be earned or his social duties performed be unprofitable to himself indirectly while it is directly useful to others for that time has been primarily surrendered through an act of obedience to a moral law established by himself and therefore he moves them also along the orbit of perfect liberty  let it be remembered that the advice requested does not relate to the government of the more dangerous passions or to the fundamental principles of right and wrong as acknowledged by the universal conscience of mankind i may therefore assure my youthful correspondent if he will endeavour to look into himself in the manner which i have exhorted him to do that in him the wish will be realized to him in due time the prayer granted which was uttered by that living teacher of whom he speaks with gratitude as of a benefactor when in his character of philosophical poet having thought of morality as implying in its essence voluntary obedience and producing the effect of order he transfers in the transport of imagination the law of moral to physical natures and having contemplated through the medium of that order all modes of existence as subservient to one spirit concludes his address to the power of duty in the following words      to humbler functions awful power     i call thee i myself commend     unto thy guidance from this hour     oh let my weakness have an end     give unto me made lowly wise     the spirit of selfsacrifice     the confidence of reason give     and in the

a on the education of the young  letter to a friend 1806  my dear sir  i am happy to hear of the instructions which you are preparing for parents and feel honoured by your having offered to me such an opportunity of conveying to the public any information i may possess upon the subject but in truth i am so little competent in the present unarranged state of my ideas to write any thing of value that it would be the highest presumption in me to attempt it this is not mock modesty but rigorous and sober truth as to the case of your own child i will set down a few thoughts which i do not hope will throw much light on your mind but they will show my willingness to do the little that is in my power  the child being the child of a man like you what i have to say will lie in small compass  i consider the facts which you mention as indicative of what is commonly called sensibility and of quickness and talent and shall take for granted that they are so you add that the child is too much noticed by grown people and apprehend selfishness  such a child will almost always be too much noticed and it is scarcely possible entirely to guard against the evil hence vanity and under bad management selfishness of the worst kind and true it is that under better and even the best management such constitutions are liable to selfishness not showing itself in the shape of tyranny caprice avarice meanness envy skulking and base selfreference but selfishness of a worthier kind yet still rightly called by that name what i mean i shall explain afterwards  vanity is not the necessary or even natural growth of such a temperament quite the contrary such a child if neglected and suffered to run wild would probably be entirely free from vanity owing to the liveliness of its feelings and the number of its resources it would be by nature independent and sufficient for itself but as such children in these times in particular are rarely if ever neglected or rather rarely if ever not far too much noticed it is a hundred to one your child will have more vanity than you could wish this is one evil to be guarded against formerly indeed till within these few years children were very carelessly brought up at present they too early and too habitually feel their own importance from the solicitude and unremitting attendance which is bestowed upon them a child like yours i believe unless under the wisest guidance would prosper most where she was the least noticed and the least made of i mean more than this where she received the least cultivation she does not stand in need of the stimulus of praise as much as can benefit her ie as much as her nature requires it will be impossible to withhold from her nor of being provoked to exertion or even if she be not injudiciously thwarted to industry nor can there be any need to be sedulous in calling out her affections her own lively enjoyments will do all this for her and also point out what is to be done to her but take all the pains you can she will be too much noticed other evils will also beset her arising more from herself and how are these to be obviated but first let us attempt to find what these evils will be  observe i put all gross mismanagement out of the question and i believe they will then probably be as follows first as mentioned before a considerable portion of vanity but if the child be not constrained too much and be left sufficiently to her own pursuits and be not too anxiously tended and have not her mind planted over by art with likings that do not spring naturally up in it this will by the liveliness of her independent enjoyment almost entirely disappear and she will become modest and diffident and being not apt from the same ruling causei mean the freshness of her own sensationsto compare herself with others she will hold herself in too humble estimation but she will probably still be selfish and this brings me to the explanation of what i hinted at before viz in what manner she will be selfish  it appears then to me that all the permanent evils which you have to apprehend for your daughter supposing you should live to educate her yourself may be referred to this principlean undue predominance of present objects over absent ones which as she will surely be distinguished by an extreme love of those about her will produce a certain restlessness of mind calling perpetually for proofs of everliving regard and affection she must be loved as much and in the same way as she loves or she will not be satisfied hence quickness in taking offence petty jealousies and apprehensions lest she is neglected or loses ground in peoples love a want of a calm and steady sense of her own merits to secure her from these fits of imagined slights for in the first place she will as is hinted at before be in general deficient in this just estimation of her own worth and will further be apt to forget everything of that kind in the present sense of supposed injury she will all which is referable to the same cause in the company of others have too constant a craving for sympathy up to a height beyond what her companions are capable of bestowing this will often be mortifying to herself and burthensome to others and should circumstances be untoward and her mind be not sufficiently furnished with ideas and knowledge this craving would be most pernicious to herself preying upon mind and body she will be too easily pleased apt to overrate the merits of new acquaintances subject to fits of overlove and overjoy in absence from those she loves full of fears and apprehensions c injurious to her health her passions for the most part will be happy and good but she will be too little mistress of them the distinctions which her intellect will make will be apt able and just but in conversation she will be prone to overshoot herself and commit eloquent blunders through eagerness in fine her manners will be frank and ardent but they will want dignity and a want of dignity will be the general defect of her character  something of this sort of character which i have thus loosely sketched and something of the sort of selfishness to which i have adverted it seems to me that under the best management you have reason to apprehend for your daughter if she should happen to be an only child or the only sister of brothers who would probably idolize her one might prophesy almost with absolute confidence that most of these qualities would be found in her in a great degree how then is the evil to be softened down or prevented assuredly not by mortifying her which is the course commonly pursued with such tempers nor by preaching to her about her own defects nor by overrunning her infancy with books about good boys and girls and bad boys and girls and all that trumpery but and this is the only important thing i have to say upon the subject by putting her in the way of acquiring without measure or limit such knowledge as will lead her out of herself such knowledge as is interesting for its own sake things known because they are interesting not interesting because they are known in a word by leaving her at liberty to luxuriate in such feelings and images as will feed her mind in silent pleasure this nourishment is contained in fairy tales romances the best biographies and histories and such parts of natural history relating to the powers and appearances of the earth and elements and the habits and structure of animals as belong to it not as an art or science but as a magazine of form and feeling this kind of knowledge is purely good a direct antidote to every evil to be apprehended and food absolutely necessary to preserve the mind of a child like yours from morbid appetites next to these objects comes such knowledge as while it is chiefly interesting for its own sake admits the fellowship of another sort of pleasure that of complacence from the conscious exertion of the faculties and love of praise the accomplishments of dancing music and drawing rank under this head grammar learning of languages botany probably and out of the way knowledge of arts and manufactures c the second class of objects as far as they tend to feed vanity and selfconceit are evil but let them have their just proportion in the plan of education and they will afterwards contribute to destroy these by furnishing the mind with power and independent gratification the vanity will disappear and the good will remain  lastly comes that class of objects which are interesting almost solely because they are known and the knowledge may be displayed and this unfortunately comprehends three fourths of what according to the plan of modern education childrens heads are stuffed with that is minute remote or trifling facts in geography topography natural history chronology c or acquisitions in art or accomplishments which the child makes by rote and which are quite beyond its age things of no value in themselves but as they show cleverness things hurtful to any temper but to a child like yours absolute poison having said thus much it seems almost impertinent to add that your child above all should i might say be chained down to the severest attention to truthi mean to the minutest accuracy in every thing which she relates this will strike at the root of evil by teaching her to form correct notions of present things and will steadily strengthen her mind much caution should be taken not to damp her natural vivacity for this may have a very bad effect and by the indirect influence of the example of manly and dignified manners any excessive wildnesses of her own will be best kept under most unrelaxing firmness should from the present hour be maintained in withstanding such of her desires as are grossly unreasonable but indeed i am forgetting to whom i am speaking and am ashamed of these precepts they will show my good will and in that hope alone can i suffer them to stand farewell there is great reason to congratulate yourself in having a child so promising and you have my best and most ardent wishes that she may be a blessing to her parents and every one about her29  29 memoirs vol ii pp 16470 g  b of the people their ways and needs  letter to archdeacon wrangham  grasmere june 5 1808  my dear wrangham  i have this moment received your letter  is a most provoking fellow very kind very humane very generous very ready to serve with a thousand other good qualities but in the practical business of life the arrantest marplan that ever lived when i first wrote to you i wrote also to him sending the statement which i sent to you and begging his exertions among his friends by and by comes back my statement having undergone a rifacimento from his hands and printed with an accompanying letter saying that if some of the principal people in this neighbourhood who had already subscribed would put their names to this paper testifying that this was a proper case for charitable interferences or that the persons mentioned were proper objects of charity that he would have the printed paper inserted in the public newspapers c upon which my sister wrote to him that in consequence of what had been already subscribed and what we had reason to expect from those friends who were privately stirring in the business among whom we chiefly alluded to you in our own minds as one on whom we had most dependence that there would be no necessity for public advertisements but that if among his private friends he could raise any money for us we should be very glad to receive it and upon this does he write to you in this what shall i call it for i am really vexed blundering manner i will not call upon you to undertake the awkward task of rebuilding that part of the edifice which  has destroyed but let what remains be preserved and if a little could be added there would be no harm i must request you to transmit the money to me with the names of the persons to whom we are obliged                                       with regard to the more important part of your letter i am under many difficulties i am writing from a window which gives me a view of a little boat gliding quietly about upon the surface of our basin of a lake i should like to be in it but what could i do with such a vessel in the heart of the atlantic ocean as this boat would be to that navigation so is my letter to the subject upon which you would set me afloat let me however say that i have read your sermon which i lately received from longman with much pleasure i only gave it a cursory perusal for since it arrived our family has been in great confusion we having removed to another house in which we are not yet half settled the appendix i had received before in a frank and of that i feel myself more entitled to speak because i had read it more at leisure i am entirely of accord with you in chiefly recommending religious books for the poor but of many of those which you recommend i can neither speak in praise nor blame as i have never read them yet as far as my own observation goes which has been mostly employed upon agricultural persons in thinlypeopled districts i cannot find that there is much disposition to read among the labouring classes or much occasion for it among manufacturers and persons engaged in sedentary employments it is i know very different the labouring man in agriculture generally carries on his work either in solitude or with his own familywith persons whose minds he is thoroughly acquainted with and with whom he is under no temptation to enter into discussions or to compare opinions he goes home from the field or the barn and within and about his own house he finds a hundred little jobs which furnish him with a change of employment which is grateful and profitable then comes supper and bed this for weekdays for sabbaths he goes to church with us often or mostly twice a day on coming home some one turns to the bible finds the text and probably reads the chapter whence it is taken or perhaps some other and in the afternoon the master or mistress frequently reads the bible if alone and on this day the mistress of the house almost always teaches the children to read or as they express it hears them a lesson or if not thus employed they visit their neighbours or receive them in their own houses as they drop in and keep up by the hour a slow and familiar chat this kind of life of which i have seen much and which i know would be looked upon with little complacency by many religious persons is peaceable and as innocent as the frame of society and the practices of government being what they are we have a right to expect besides it is much more intellectual than a careless observer would suppose one of our neighbours who lives as i have described was yesterday walking with me and as we were pacing on talking about indifferent matters by the side of a brook he suddenly said to me with great spirit and a lively smile i like to walk where i can hear the sound of a beck the word as you know in our dialect for a brook i cannot but think that this man without being conscious of it has had many devout feelings connected with the appearances which have presented themselves to him in his employment as a shepherd and that the pleasure of his heart at that moment was an acceptable offering to the divine being but to return to the subject of books i find among the people i am speaking of halfpenny ballads and penny and twopenny histories in great abundance these are often bought as charitable tributes to the poor persons who hawk them about and it is the best way of procuring them they are frequently stitched together in tolerably thick volumes and such i have read some of the contents though not often religious very good others objectionable either for the superstition in them such as prophecies fortunetelling c or more frequently for indelicacy i have so much felt the influence of these straggling papers that i have many a time wished that i had talents to produce songs poems and little histories that might circulate among other good things in this way supplanting partly the bad flowers and useless herbs and to take place of weeds indeed some of the poems which i have published were composed not without a hope that at some time or other they might answer this purpose the kind of library which you recommend would not i think for the reasons given above be of much direct use in any of the agricultural districts of cumberland and westmoreland with which i am acquainted though almost every person here can read i mean of general use as to morals or behaviour it might however with individuals do much in awakening enterprise calling forth ingenuity and fostering genius i have known several persons who would eagerly have sought not after these books merely but any books and would have been most happy in having such a collection to repair to the knowledge thus acquired would also have spread by being dealt about in conversation among their neighbours at the door and by the fireside so that it is not easy to foresee how far the good might extend and harm i can see none which would not be greatly overbalanced by the advantage the situation of manufacturers is deplorably different the monotony of their employments renders some sort of stimulus intellectual or bodily absolutely necessary for them their work is carried on in clustersmen from different parts of the world and perpetually changing so that every individual is constantly in the way of being brought into contact with new notions and feelings and being unsettled in his own accordingly a select library therefore in such situations may be of the same use as a public dial keeping everybodys clock in some kind of order  besides contrasting the manufacturer with the agriculturalist it may be observed that he has much more leisure and in his over hours not having other pleasant employment to turn to he is more likely to find reading a relief what then are the books which should be put in his way without being myself a clergyman i have no hesitation in saying chiefly religious ones though i should not go so far as you seemed inclined to do excluding others because they are not according to the letter or in the spirit of your profession i with you feel little disposed to admire several of those mentioned by gilbert burns much less others which you name as having been recommended in gilbert bs collection there may be too little religion and i should fear that you like all other clergymen may confine yourself too exclusively to that concern which you justly deem the most important but which by being exclusively considered can never be thoroughly understood i will allow with you that a religious faculty is the eye of the soul but if we would have successful souloculists not merely that organ but the general anatomy and constitution of the intellectual frame must be studied for the powers of that eye are affected by the general state of the system my meaning is that piety and religion will be the best understood by him who takes the most comprehensive view of the human mind and that for the most part they will strengthen with the general strength of the mind and that this is best promoted by a due mixture of direct and indirect nourishment and discipline for example paradise lost and robinson crusoe might be as serviceable as laws serious call or melmoths great importance of a religious life at least if the books be all good they would mutually assist each other in what i have said though following my own thoughts merely as called forth by your appendix is implied an answer to your request that i would give you half an idea upon education as a national object i have only kept upon the surface of the question but you must have deduced that i deem any plan of national education in a country like ours most difficult to apply to practice in switzerland or sweden or norway or france or spain or anywhere but great britain it would be comparatively easy heaven and hell are scarcely more different from each other than sheffield and manchester c differ from the plains and valleys of surrey essex cumberland or westmoreland we have mighty cities and towns of all sizes with villages and cottages scattered everywhere we are mariners miners manufacturers in tens of thousands traders husbandmen everything what form of discipline what books or doctrinesi will not say would equally suit all thesebut which if happily fitted for one would not perhaps be an absolute nuisance in another you will also have deduced that nothing romantic can be said with truth of the influence of education upon the district in which i live we have thank heaven free schools or schools with some endowment almost everywhere and almost every one can read but not because we have free or endowed schools but because our land is far more than elsewhere tilled by men who are the owners of it and as the population is not over crowded and the vices which are quickened and cherished in a crowded population do not therefore prevail parents have more ability and inclination to send their children to school much more than in manufacturing districts and also though in a less degree more than in agricultural ones where the tillers are not proprietors if in scotland the children are sent to school where the parents have not the advantage i have been speaking of it is chiefly because their labour can be turned to no account at home send among them manufacturers or farmers on a large scale and you may indeed substitute sundayschools or other modes of instructing them but the ordinary parish schools will be neglected the influence of our schools in this neighbourhood can never be understood if this their connection with the state of landed property be overlooked in fact that influence is not striking the people are not habitually religious in the common sense of the word much less godly the effect of their schooling is chiefly seen by the activity with which the young persons emigrate and the success attending it and at home by a general orderliness and gravity with habits of independence and selfrespect nothing obsequious or fawning is ever to be seen amongst them  it may be added that this ability from the two causes land and schools of giving their children instruction contributes to spread a respect for scholarship through the country if in any family one of the children should be quicker at his book or fonder of it than others he is often marked out in consequence for the profession of a clergyman this before the mercantile or manufacturing employments held out such flattering hopes very generally happened so that the schools of the north were the great nurseries of curates several of whom got forward in their profession some with and others without the help of a university education and in all instances such connection of families all the members of which lived in the humblest and plainest manner working with their own hands as labourers with a learned and dignified profession assisted and still does though in a less degree not a little to elevate their feelings and conferred importance on them in their own eyes but i must stop my dear wrangham begin your education at the top of society let the head go in the right course and the tail will follow but what can you expect of national education conducted by a government which for twenty years resisted the abolition of the slave trade and annually debauches the morals of the people by every possible device holding out temptation with one hand and scourging with the other the distilleries and lotteries are a standing record that the government cares nothing for the morals of the people and that all which they want is their money but wisdom and justice are the only true sources of the revenue of a people preach this and may you not preach in vain  wishing you success in every good work i remain your affectionate friend w wordsworth  thanks for your inquiries about our little boy who is well though not yet quite strong30  30

before the university31 several times in nothing were my notions different from yours as there expressed it happened that i had been reading just before bishop bulls sermon32 of which you speak so highly it had struck me just in the same way as an inestimable production i was highly gratified by your discourses and cannot but think that they must have been beneficial to the hearers there abounds in them so pure a fervour i have as yet bestowed less attention upon your german controversy33 than so important a subject deserves  31 on the commission and consequent duties of the clergy preached before the university of cambridge in april 1826 and published in 1828 g  32 the title of which is the priests office difficult and dangerous it will be found in vol i p 137 of dr burtons edition of the bishops works g  33 the state of the protestant religion in germany a series of discourses preached before the university of cambridge by the rev hugh james rose lond 1825 and his letter to the bishop of london in reply to mr puseys work on that subject lond 1829 g  since our conversation upon the subject of education i have found no reason to alter the opinions i then expressed of those who seem to me to be in error two parties are especially prominent they the most conspicuous head of whom is mr brougham who think that sharpening of intellect and attainment of knowledge are things good in themselves without reference to the circumstances under which the intellect is sharpened or to the quality of the knowledge acquired knowledge says lord bacon is power but surely not less for evil than for good lord bacon spoke like a philosopher but they who have that maxim in their mouths the oftenest have the least understanding of it  the other class consists of persons who are aware of the importance of religion and morality above everything but from not understanding the constitution of our nature and the composition of society they are misled and hurried on by zeal in a course which cannot but lead to disappointment one instance of this fell under my own eyes the other day in the little town of ambleside where a party the leaders of which are young ladies are determined to set up a school for girls on the madras system confidently expecting that these girls will in consequence be less likely to go astray when they grow up to women alas alas they may be taught i own more quickly to read and write under the madras system and to answer more readily and perhaps with more intelligence questions put to them than they could have done under dameteaching but poetry may with deference to the philosopher and the religionist be consulted in these matters and i will back shenstones schoolmistress by her winter fire and in her summer gardenseat against all dr bells sourlooking teachers in petticoats that i have ever seen  what is the use of pushing on the education of girls so fast and mainly by the stimulus of emulation who to say nothing worse of her is cousingerman to envy what are you to do with these girls what demand is there for the ability that they may have prematurely acquired will they not be indisposed to bend to any kind of hard labour or drudgery and yet many of them must submit to it or do wrong the mechanism of the bell system is not required in small places praying after the fugleman is not like praying at a mothers knee the bellites overlook the difference they talk about moral discipline but wherein does it encourage the imaginative feelings without which the practical understanding is of little avail and too apt to become the cunning slave of the bad passions i dislike display in everything above all in education the old dame did not affect to make theologians or logicians but she taught to read and she practised the memory often no doubt by rote but still the faculty was improved something perhaps she explained and trusted the rest to parents to masters and to the pastor of the parish i am sure as good daughters as good servants as good mothers and wives were brought up at that time as now when the world is so much less humbleminded a hand full of employment and a head not above it with such principles and habits as may be acquired without the madras machinery are the best security for the chastity of wives of the lower rank  farewell i have exhausted my paper  your affectionate  w wordsworth34  34 memoirs vol ii pp 1803 g                                        of the same to the same  my dear sir  i have taken a folio sheet to make certain minutes upon the subject of education   as a christian preacher your business is with man as an immortal being let us imagine you to be addressing those and those only who would gladly cooperate with you in any course of education which is most likely to ensure to men a happy immortality are you satisfied with that course which the most active of this class are bent upon clearly not as i remember from your conversation which is confirmed by your last letter great principles you hold are sacrificed to shifts and expedients i agree with you what more sacred law of nature for instance than that the mother should educate her child yet we felicitate ourselves upon the establishment of infantschools which is in direct opposition to it nay we interfere with the maternal instinct before the child is born by furnishing in cases where there is no necessity the mother with babylinen for her unborn child now that in too many instances a lamentable necessity may exist for this i allow but why should such charity be obtruded why should so many excellent ladies form themselves into committees and rush into an almost indiscriminate benevolence which precludes the poor mother from the strongest motive human nature can be actuated by for industry for forethought and selfdenial when the stream has thus been poisoned at its fountainhead we proceed by separating through infantschools the mother from the child and from the rest of the family disburthening them of all care of the littleone for perhaps eight hours of the day to those who think this an evil but a necessary one much might be said in order to qualify unreasonable expectations but there are thousands of stirring people now in england who are so far misled as to deem these schools good in themselves and to wish that even in the smallest villages the children of the poor should have what they call a good education in this way now these people and no error is at present more common confound education with tuition  education i need not remark to you is everything that draws out the human being of which tuition the teaching of schools especially however important is comparatively an insignificant part yet the present bent of the public mind is to sacrifice the greater power to the lessall that life and nature teach to the little that can be learned from books and a master in the eyes of an enlightened statesman this is absurd in the eyes of a pure lowlyminded christian it is monstrous  the spartan and other ancient communities might disregard domestic ties because they had the substitution of country which we cannot have with us country is a mere name compared with what it was to the greeks first as contrasted with barbarians and next and above all as that passion only was strong enough to preserve the individual his family and the whole state from everimpending destruction our course is to supplant domestic attachments without the possibility of substituting others more capacious what can grow out of it but selfishness  let it then be universally admitted that infantschools are an evil only tolerated to qualify a greater viz the inability of mothers to attend to their children and the like inability of the elder to take care of the younger from their labour being wanted in factories or elsewhere for their common support but surely this is a sad state of society and if these expedients of tuition or education if that word is not to be parted with divert our attention from the fact that the remedy for so mighty an evil must be sought elsewhere they are most pernicious things and the sooner they are done away with the better  but even as a course of tuition i have strong objections to infantschools and in no small degree to the madras system also we must not be deceived by premature adroitness the intellect must not be trained with a view to what the infant or child may perform without constant reference to what that performance promises for the man it is with the mind as with the body i recollect seeing a german babe stuffed with beer and beef who had the appearance of an infant hercules he might have enough in him of the old teutonic blood to grow up to a strong man but tens of thousands would dwindle and perish after such unreasonable cramming now i cannot but think that the like would happen with our modern pupils if the views of the patrons of these schools were realised the diet they offer is not the natural diet for infant and juvenile minds the faculties are overstrained and not exercised with that simultaneous operation which ought to be aimed at as far as is practicable natural history is taught in infantschools by pictures stuck up against walls and such mummery a moments notice of a redbreast pecking by a winters hearth is worth it all  these hints are for the negative side of the question and for the positivewhat conceit and presumption and vanity and envy and mortification and hypocrisy c c are the unavoidable result of schemes where there is so much display and contention all this is at enmity with christianity and if the practice of sincere churchmen in this matter be so what have we not to fear when we cast our eyes upon other quarters where religious instruction is deliberately excluded the wisest of us expect far too much from school teaching one of the most innocent contented happy and in his sphere most useful men whom i know can neither read nor write though learning and sharpness of wit must exist somewhere to protect and in some points to interpret the scriptures yet we are told that the founder of this religion rejoiced in spirit that things were hidden from the wise and prudent and revealed unto babes and again out of the mouths of babes and sucklings thou hast perfected praise apparently the infants here contemplated were under a very different course of discipline from that which many in our day are condemned to in a town of lancashire about nine in the morning the streets resound with the crying of infants wheeled off in carts and other vehicles some ladies i believe lending their carriages for this purpose to their schoolprisons  but to go back a little human learning as far as it tends to breed pride and selfestimation and that it requires constant vigilance to counteract this tendency we must all feel is against the spirit of the gospel much cause then is there to lament that inconsiderate zeal wherever it is found which whets the intellect by blunting the affections can it in a general view be good that an infant should learn much which its parents do not know will not the child arrogate a superiority unfavourable to love and obedience  but suppose this to be an evil only for the present generation and that a succeeding race of infants will have no such advantage over their parents still it may be asked should we not be making these infants too much the creatures of society when we cannot make them more so here would they be for eight hours in the day like plants in a conservatory what is to become of them for the other sixteen hours when they are returned to all the influences the dread of which first suggested this contrivance will they be better able to resist the mischief they may be exposed to from the bad example of their parents or brothers and sisters it is to be feared not because though they must have heard many good precepts their condition in school is artificial they have been removed from the discipline and exercise of humanity and they have besides been subject to many evil temptations within school and peculiar to it  in the present generation i cannot see anything of an harmonious cooperation between these schools and home influences if the family be thoroughly bad and the child cannot be removed altogether how feeble the barrier how futile the expedient if the family be of middle character the children will lose more by separation from domestic cares and reciprocal duties than they can possibly gain from captivity with such formal instruction as may be administered  we are then brought round to the point that it is to a physical and not a moral necessity that we must look if we would justify this disregard i had almost said violation of a primary law of human nature the link of eleemosynary tuition connects the infant school with the national schools upon the madras system now i cannot but think that there is too much indiscriminate gratuitous instruction in this country arising out of the misconception above adverted to of the real power of school teaching relatively to the discipline of life and out of an overvalue of talent however exerted and of knowledge prized for its own sake and acquired in the shape of knowledge the latter clauses of the last sentence glance rather at the london university and the mechanics institutes than at the madras schools yet they have some bearing upon these also emulation as i observed in my last letter is the masterspring of that system it mingles too much with all teaching and with all learning but in the madras mode it is the great wheel which puts every part of the machine into motion  but i have been led a little too far from gratuitous instruction if possible instruction ought never to be altogether so a child will soon learn to feel a stronger love and attachment to its parents when it perceives that they are making sacrifices for its instruction all that precept can teach is nothing compared with convictions of this kind in short unless bookattainments are carried on by the side of moral influences they are of no avail gratitude is one of the most benign of moral influences can a child be grateful to a corporate body for its instruction or grateful even to the lady bountiful of the neighbourhood with all the splendour which he sees about her as he would be grateful to his poor father and mother who spare from their scanty provision a mite for the culture of his mind at school if we look back upon the progress of things in this country since the reformation we shall find that instruction has never been severed from moral influences and purposes and the natural action of circumstances in the way that is now attempted our forefathers established in abundance free grammar schools but for a distinctly understood religious purpose they were designed to provide against a relapse of the nation into popery by diffusing a knowledge of the languages in which the scriptures are written so that a sufficient number might be aware how small a portion of the popish belief had a foundation in holy writ  it is undoubtedly to be desired that every one should be able to read and perhaps for that is far from being equally apparent to write but you will agree with me i think that these attainments are likely to turn to better account where they are not gratuitously lavished and where either the parents and connections are possessed of certain property which enables them to procure the instruction for their children or where by their frugality and other serious and selfdenying habits they contribute as far as they can to benefit their offspring in this way surely whether we look at the usefulness and happiness of the individual or the prosperity and security of the state this which was the course of our ancestors is the better course contrast it with that recommended by men in whose view knowledge and intellectual adroitness are to do everything of themselves  we have no guarantee on the social condition of these well informed pupils for the use they may make of their power and their knowledge the scheme points not to man as a religious being its end is an unworthy one and its means do not pay respect to the order of things try the mechanics institutes and the london university c c by this test the powers are not coordinate with those to which this nation owes its virtue and its prosperity here is in one case a sudden formal abstraction of a vital principle and in both an unnatural and violent pushing on mechanics institutes make discontented spirits and insubordinate and presumptuous workmen such at least was the opinion of watt one of the most experienced and intelligent of men and instruction where religion is expressly excluded is little less to be dreaded than that by which it is trodden under foot and for my own part i cannot look without shuddering on the array of surgical midwifery lectures to which the youth of london were invited at the commencement of this season by the advertisements of the london university hogarth understood human nature better than these professors his picture i have not seen for many long years but i think his last stage of cruelty is in the dissecting room  but i must break off or you will have double postage to pay for this letter pray excuse it and pardon the style which is purposely as meagre as i could make it for the sake of brevity i hope that you can gather the meaning and that is enough i find that i have a few moments to spare and will therefore address a word to those who may be inclined to ask what is the use of all these objections the schoolmaster is and will remain abroad the thirst of knowledge is spreading and will spread whether virtue and duty go along with it or no grant it but surely these observations may be of use if they tend to check unreasonable expectations one of the most difficult tasks is to keep benevolence in alliance with beneficence of the former there is no want but we do not see our way to the latter tenderness of heart is indispensable for a good man but a certain sternness of heart is as needful for a wise one we are as impatient under the evils of society as under our own and more so for in the latter case necessity enforces submission it is hard to look upon the condition in which so many of our fellow creatures are born but they are not to be raised from it by partial and temporary expedients it is not enough to rush headlong into any new scheme that may be proposed be it benefit societies savings banks infant schools mechanic institutes or any other circumstances have forced this nation to do by its manufacturers an undue portion of the dirty and unwholesome work of the globe the revolutions among which we have lived have unsettled the value of all kinds of property and of labour the most precious of all to that degree that misery and privation are frightfully prevalent we must bear the sight of this and endure its pressure till we have by reflection discovered the cause and not till then can we hope even to palliate the evil it is a thousand to one but that the means resorted to will aggravate it       farewell ever affectionately yours w wordsworth   quereis the education in the parish schools of scotland gratuitous or if not in what degree is it so35  35 memoirs vol ii pp 18392 g  d education of duty  letter to the rev dr wordsworth                             rydal mount april 27 1830  my dear brother  was mr roses course of sermons upon education the more i reflect upon the subject the more i am convinced that positive instruction even of a religious character is much overrated the education of man and above all of a christian is the education of duty which is most forcibly taught by the business and concerns of life of which even for children especially the children of the poor booklearning is but a small part there is an officious disposition on the part of the upper and middle classes to precipitate the tendency of the people towards intellectual culture in a manner subversive of their own happiness and dangerous to the peace of society it is mournful to observe of how little avail are lessons of piety taught at school if household attentions and obligations be neglected in consequence of the time taken up in school tuition and if the head be stuffed with vanity from the gentlemanliness of the employment of reading farewell  w w36  36 memoirs vol ii p 193 g  e speech on laying the foundationstone of the new school in the village of bowness windermere 1836   standing here as mr boltons substitute at his own request an honour of which i am truly sensible it gives me peculiar pleasure to see in spite of this stormy weather so numerous a company of his friends and neighbours upon this occasion how happy would it have made him to have been eyewitness of an assemblage which may fairly be regarded as a proof of the interest felt in his benevolent undertaking and an earnest that the good work will not be done in vain sure i am also that there is no one present who does not deeply regret the cause why that excellent man cannot appear among us the public spirit of mr bolton has ever been remarkable both for its comprehensiveness and the judicious way in which it has been exerted many years ago when we were threatened with foreign invasion he equipped and headed a body of volunteers for the defence of our country not long since the inhabitants of ulverston his native place i believe were indebted to him for a large contribution towards erecting a church in that town his recent munificent donations to the public charities of liverpool are well known and i only echo the sentiments of this meeting when i say that every one would have rejoiced to see a gentleman who has completed his 80th year taking the lead in this days proceedings for which there would have been no call but for his desire permanently to benefit a district in which he has so long been a resident proprietor it may be gathered from old documents that upwards of 200 years ago this place was provided with a school which early in the reign of charles ii was endowed by the liberality of certain persons of the neighbourhood the building originally small and low has long been in a state which rendered the erection of a new one very desirable this mr bolton has undertaken to do at his sole expense the structure which is to supersede the old schoolhouse will have two apartments airy spacious and lofty one for boys the other for girls in which they will be instructed by respective teachers and not crowded together as in the old schoolroom under one and the same person each room will be capable of containing at least 100 children within the enclosure there will be spacious and separate playgrounds for the boys and girls with distinct covered sheds to play in in wet weather there will also be a libraryroom for the school and to contain books for the benefit of the neighbourhood and in short every arrangement that could be desired it may be added that the building from the elegance of its architecture and its elevated conspicuous situation will prove a striking ornament to the beautiful country in the midst of which it will stand such being the advantages proposed allow me to express a hope that they will be turned to the best possible account the privilege of the school being free will not i trust tempt parents to withdraw their children from punctual attendance upon slight and trivial occasions and they will take care as far as depends upon themselves that the wishes of the present benefactor may be met and his intentions fulfilled those wishes and intentions i will take upon me to say are consonant to what has been expressed in the original trustdeed of the pious and sensible men already spoken of who in that instrument declare that they have provided a fund towards the finding and maintenance of an able schoolmaster and repairing the schoolhouse from time to time for ever for teaching and instructing of youth within the said hamlets in grammar writing reading and other good learning and discipline meet and convenient for them for the honour of god for the better advancement and preferment of the said youth and to the perpetual and thankful remembrance of the founders and authors of so good a work the effect of this beautiful summary upon your minds will not i hope be weakened if i make a brief comment upon the several clauses of it which will comprise nearly the whole of what i feel prompted to say upon this occasion i will take the liberty however of inverting the order in which the purposes of these good men are mentioned beginning at what they end with the perpetual and thankful remembrance of the founders and authors of so good a work do not let it be supposed that your forefathers when they looked onwards to this issue did so from vanity and love of applause uniting with local attachment they wished their good works to be remembered principally because they were conscious that such remembrance would be beneficial to the hearts of those whom they desired to serve and would effectually promote the particular good they had in view let me add for them what their modesty and humility would have prevented their insisting upon that such tribute of grateful recollection was and is still their due for if gratitude be not the most perfect shape of justice it is assuredly her most beautiful crowna halo and glory with which she delights to have her brows encircled so much of this gratitude as those good men hoped for i may bespeak for your neighbour who is now animated by the same spirit and treading in their steps  the second point to which i shall advert is that where it is said that such and such things shall be taught for the better advancement and preferment of the said youth this purpose is as honourable as it is natural and recalls to remembrance the time when the northern counties had in this particular great advantages over the rest of england by the zealous care of many pious and good men among whom i cannot but name from his connection with this neighbourhood and the benefits he conferred upon it archbishop sandys free schools were founded in these parts of the kingdom in much greater numbers than elsewhere the learned professions derived many ornaments from this source but a more remarkable consequence was that till within the last 40 years or so merchants countinghouses and offices in the lower departments of which a certain degree of scholastic attainment was requisite were supplied in a great measure from cumberland and westmoreland numerous and large fortunes were the result of the skill industry and integrity which the young men thus instructed carried with them to the metropolis that superiority no longer exists not so much i trust from a slackening on the part of the teachers or an indisposition of the inhabitants to profit by their free schools but because the kingdom at large has become sensible of the advantages of school instruction and we of the north consequently have competitors from every quarter let not this discourage but rather stimulate us to more strenuous endeavours so that if we do not keep ahead of the rest of our countrymen we may at least take care not to be left behind in the race of honourable ambition but after all worldly advancement and preferment neither are nor ought to be the main end of instruction either in schools or elsewhere and particularly in those which are in rural places and scantily endowed it is in the order of providence as we are all aware that most men must end their temporal course pretty much as they began it nor will the thoughtful repine at this dispensation in lands where nature in the many is not trampled upon by injustice feelingly may the peasant say to the courtier      the sun that bids your diamond blaze     to deck our lily deigns  contentment according to the common adage is better than riches and why is it better not merely because there can be no happiness without it but for the sake also of its moral dignity mankind we know are placed on earth to have their hearts and understandings exercised and improved some in one sphere and some in another to undergo various trials and to perform divers duties that duty which in the worlds estimation may seem the least often being the most important in the eyes of our heavenly father well and wisely has it been said in words which i need not scruple to quote here where extreme poverty and abject misery are unknown        god doth not need     either mans work or his own gifts who best     bear his mild yoke they serve him best his state     is kinglythousands at his bidding speed     and post oer land and ocean without rest     they also serve who only stand and wait  thus am i naturally led to the third and last point in the declaration of the ancient trustdeed which i mean to touch uponyouth shall lie instructed in grammar writing reading and other good discipline meet and convenient for them for the honour of god now my friends and neighbours much as we must admire the zeal and activity which have of late years been shewn in the teaching of youth i will candidly ask those among you who have had sufficient opportunities to observe whether the instruction given in many schools is in fact meet and convenient in the building about to be erected here i have not the smallest reason for dreading that it will be otherwise but i speak in the hearing of persons who may be active in the management of schools elsewhere and they will excuse me for saying that many are conducted at present so as to afford melancholy proof that instruction is neither meet nor convenient for the pupils there taught nor indeed for the human mind in any rank or condition of society i am not going to say that religious instruction the most important of all is neglected far from it but i affirm that it is too often given with reference less to the affections to the imagination and to the practical duties than to subtile distinctions in points of doctrine and to facts in scripture history of which a knowledge may be brought out by a catechetical process this error great though it be ought to be looked at with indulgence because it is a tempting thing for teachers unduly to exercise the understanding and memory inasmuch as progress in the departments in which these faculties are employed is most obviously proved to the teacher himself and most flatteringly exhibited to the inspectors of schools and casual lookers on a still more lamentable error which proceeds much from the same cause is an overstrained application to mental processes of arithmetic and mathematics and a too minute attention to departments of natural and civil history how much of trick may mix with this we will not ask but the display of precocious intellectual power in these branches is often astonishing and in proportion as it is so may for the most part be pronounced not only useless but injurious the training that fits a boxer for victory in the ring gives him strength that cannot and is not required to be kept up for ordinary labour and often lays the foundation of subsequent weakness and fatal disease in like manner there being in after life no call for these extraordinary powers of mind and little use for the knowledge the powers decay and the knowledge withers and drops off here is then not only a positive injury but a loss of opportunities for culture of intellect and acquiring information which as being in a course of regular demand would be hereafter the one strengthened and the other naturally increased all this mischief my friends originates in a decay of that feeling which our fathers had uppermost in their hearts viz that the business of education should be conducted for the honour of god and here i must direct your attention to a fundamental mistake by which this age so distinguished for its marvellous progress in arts and sciences is unhappily characterizeda mistake manifested in the use of the word education which is habitually confounded with tuition or school instruction this is indeed a very important part of education but when it is taken for the whole we are deceived and betrayed education according to the derivation of the word and in the only use of which it is strictly justifiable comprehends all those processes and influences come from whence they may that conduce to the best development of the bodily powers and of the moral intellectual and spiritual faculties which the position of the individual admits of in this just and high sense of the word the education of a sincere christian and a good member of society upon christian principles does not terminate with his youth but goes on to the last moment of his conscious earthly existencean education not for time but for eternity to education like this is indispensably necessary as cooperating with schoolmasters and ministers of the gospel the neverceasing vigilance of parents not so much exercised in superadding their pains to that of the schoolmaster or minister in teaching lessons or catechisms or by enforcing maxims or precepts though this part of their duty ought to be habitually kept in mind but by care over their own conduct it is through the silent operation of example in their own wellregulated behaviour and by accustoming their children early to the discipline of daily and hourly life in such offices and employment as the situation of the family requires and as are suitable to tender years that parents become infinitely the most important tutors of their children without appearing or positively meaning to be so this education of circumstances has happily in this district not yet been much infringed upon by experimental novelties parents here are anxious to send their offspring to those schools where knowledge substantially useful is inculcated and those arts most carefully taught for which in after life there will be most need this is especially true of the judgments of parents respecting the instruction of their daughters which i know they would wish to be confined to reading writing and arithmetic and plain needlework or any other art favourable to economy and homecomforts their shrewd sense perceives that hands full of employment and a head not above it afford the best protection against restlessness and discontent and all the perilous temptations to which through them youthful females are exposed it is related of burns the celebrated scottish poet that once while in the company of a friend he was looking from an eminence over a wide tract of country he said that the sight of so many smoking cottages gave a pleasure to his mind that none could understand who had not witnessed like himself the happiness and worth which they contained how were those happy and worthy people educated by the influence of hereditary good example at home and by their parochial schoolmasters opening the way for the admonitions and exhortations of their clergy that was at a time when knowledge was perhaps better than now distinguished from smatterings of information and when knowledge itself was more thought of in due subordination to wisdom how was the evening before the sabbath then spent by the families among which the poet was brought up he has himself told us in imperishable verse the bible was brought forth and after the father of the family had reverently laid aside his bonnet passages of scripture were read and the poet thus describes what followed      then kneeling down to heavens eternal king        the saint the father and the husband prays     hope springs exulting on triumphant wing        that thus they all shall meet in future days     there ever bask in uncreated rays        no more to sigh or shed the bitter tear     together hymning their creators praise        in such society yet still more dear     while circling time moves round in an eternal sphere  may he who enlightened the understanding of those cottagers with a knowledge of himself for the entertainment of such hope who sanctified their affections that they might love him and put his fear into their hearts that they might dread to offend himmay he who in preparing for these blessed effects disdained not the humble instrumentality of parochial schools enable this of ours by the discipline and teaching pursued in it to sow seeds for a like harvest in this wish i am sure my friends you will all fervently join and now after renewing our expression of regret that the benevolent founder is not here to perform the

that it may become a fountainhead of blessing to this place and neighbourhood thou hast directed us o lord to bring up our children in thy nurture and admonition bless we pray thee this effort to secure the constant fulfilment of so important a duty one so entirely bound up with our own and our childrens welfare grant that here from age to age the youth of these hamlets may receive such faithful instruction as may fit them for usefulness in this life and for happiness in the next grant that the one school may send out numbers endued with such principles and knowledge as may make them

dutiful members of that pure and scriptural establishment with which thou hast blessed our land and as crowning and including all resolved and pious followers of our redeemer christ grant too o lord

thy blessing on their instruction they may become obedient and dutiful children modest and virtuous women faithful and affectionate wives and mothers pious and unassuming christians so that with regard to both it may be widely and gratefully owned that here was sown the good seed which shall have borne fruit abundantly in all the relations of life and which at the great day of harvest

the life of burns by dr currie and of the selection made by him from his letters  by william wordsworth   london  printed for longman hurst rees orme and brown paternosterrow  1816  a a letter to a friend of robert burns  to james gray esq edinburgh  dear sir  i have carefully perused the review of the life of your friend robert burns2 which you kindly transmitted to me the author has rendered a substantial service to the poets memory and the annexed letters are all important to the subject after having expressed this opinion i shall not trouble you by commenting upon the publication but will confine myself to the request of mr gilbert burns that i would furnish him with my notions upon the best mode of conducting the defence of his brothers injured reputation a favourable opportunity being now afforded him to convey his sentiments to the world along with a republication of dr curries book which he is about to superintend from the respect which i have long felt for the character of the person who has thus honoured me and from the gratitude which as a lover of poetry i owe to the genius of his departed relative i should most gladly comply with this wish if i could hope that any suggestions of mine would be of service to the cause but really i feel it a thing of much delicacy to give advice upon this occasion as it appears to me mainly not a question of opinion or of taste but a matter of conscience mr gilbert burns must know if any man living does what his brother was and no one will deny that he who possesses this knowledge is a man of unimpeachable veracity he has already spoken to the world in contradiction of the injurious assertions that have been made and has told why he forbore to do this on their first appearance  2 a review of the life of robert burns and of various criticisms on his character and writings by alexander peterkin 1814  if it be deemed adviseable to reprint dr curries narrative without striking out such passages as the author if he were now alive would probably be happy to efface let there be notes attached to the most obnoxious of them in which the misrepresentations may be corrected and the exaggerations exposed i recommend this course if dr curries life is to be republished as it now stands in connexion with the poems and letters and especially if prefixed to them but in my judgment it would be best to copy the example which mason has given in his second edition of grays works there inverting the order which had been properly adopted when the life and letters were new matter the poems are placed first and the rest takes its place as subsidiary to them if this were done in the intended edition of burnss works i should strenuously recommend that a concise life of the poet be prefixed from the pen of gilbert burns who has already given public proof how well qualified he is for the undertaking i know no better model as to proportion and the degree of detail required nor indeed as to the general execution than the life of milton by fenton prefixed to many editions of the paradise lost but a more copious narrative would be expected from a brother and some allowance ought to be made in this and other respects for an expectation so natural  in this prefatory memoir when the author has prepared himself by reflecting that fraternal partiality may have rendered him in some points not so trustworthy as others less favoured by opportunity it will be incumbent upon him to proceed candidly and openly as far as such a procedure will tend to restore to his brother that portion of public estimation of which he appears to have been unjustly deprived nay when we recall to mind the black things which have been written of this great man and the frightful ones that have been insinuated against him and as far as the public knew till lately without complaint remonstrance or disavowal from his nearest relatives i am not sure that it would not be best at this day explicitly to declare to what degree robert burns had given way to pernicious habits and as nearly as may be to fix the point to which his moral character had been degraded it is a disgraceful feature of the times that this measure should be necessary most painful to think that a brother should have such an office to perform but if gilbert burns be conscious that the subject will bear to be so treated he has no choice the duty has been imposed upon him by the errors into which the former biographer has fallen in respect to the very principles upon which his work ought to have been conducted  i well remember the acute sorrow with which by my own fireside i first perused dr curries narrative and some of the letters particularly of those composed in the latter part of the poets life if my pity for burns was extreme this pity did not preclude a strong indignation of which he was not the object if said i it were in the power of a biographer to relate the truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth the friends and surviving kindred of the deceased for the sake of general benefit to mankind might endure that such heartrending communication should be made to the world but in no case is this possible and in the present the opportunities of directly acquiring other than superficial knowledge have been most scanty for the writer has barely seen the person who is the subject of his tale nor did his avocations allow him to take the pains necessary for ascertaining what portion of the information conveyed to him was authentic so much for facts and actions and to what purpose relate them even were they true if the narrative cannot be heard without extreme pain unless they are placed in such a light and brought forward in such order that they shall explain their own laws and leave the reader in as little uncertainty as the mysteries of our nature will allow respecting the spirit from which they derived their existence and which governed the agent but hear on this pathetic and awful subject the poet himself pleading for those who have transgressed      one point must still be greatly dark     the moving why they do it     and just as lamely can ye mark     how far perhaps they rue it      who made the heart tis he alone     decidedly can try us     he knows each chordits various tone     each spring its various bias      then at the balance lets be mute     we never can adjust it     whats done we partly may compute     but know not whats resisted  how happened it that the recollection of this affecting passage did not check so amiable a man as dr currie while he was revealing to the world the infirmities of its author he must have known enough of human nature to be assured that men would be eager to sit in judgment and pronounce decidedly upon the guilt or innocence of burns by his testimony nay that there were multitudes whose main interest in the allegations would be derived from the incitements which they found therein to undertake this presumptuous office and where lies the collateral benefit or what ultimate advantage can be expected to counteract the injury that the many are thus tempted to do to their own minds and to compensate the sorrow which must be fixed in the hearts of the considerate few by language that proclaims so much and provokes conjectures as unfavourable as imagination can furnish here said i being moved beyond what it would become me to express here is a revolting account of a man of exquisite genius and confessedly of many high moral qualities sunk into the lowest depths of vice and misery but the painful story notwithstanding its minuteness is incompletein essentials it is deficient so that the most attentive and sagacious reader cannot explain how a mind so well established by knowledge felland continued to fall without power to prevent or retard its own ruin  would a bosom friend of the author his counsellor and confessor have told such things if true as this book contains and who but one possessed of the intimate knowledge which none but a bosom friend can acquire could have been justified in making these avowals such a one himself a pure spirit having accompanied as it were upon wings the pilgrim along the sorrowful road which he trod on foot such a one neither hurried down by its slippery descents nor entangled among its thorns nor perplexed by its windings nor discomfited by its founderous passagesfor the instruction of othersmight have delineated almost as in a map the way which the afflicted pilgrim had pursued till the sad close of his diversified journey in this manner the venerable spirit of isaac walton was qualified to have retraced the unsteady course of a highlygifted man who in this lamentable point and in versatility of genius bore no unobvious resemblance to the scottish bard i mean his friend cottonwhom notwithstanding all that the sage must have disapproved in his life he honoured with the title of son nothing like this however has the biographer of burns accomplished and with his means of information copious as in some respects they were it would have been absurd to attempt it the only motive therefore which could authorize the writing and publishing matter so distressing to readis wanting  nor is dr curries performance censurable from these considerations alone for information which would have been of absolute worth if in his capacity of biographer and editor he had known when to stop short is rendered unsatisfactory and inefficacious through the absence of this reserve and from being coupled with statements of improbable and irreconcileable facts we have the authors letters discharged upon us in showers but how few readers will take the trouble of comparing those letters with each other and with the other documents of the publication in order to come at a genuine knowledge of the writers characterthe life of johnson by boswell had broken through many preexisting delicacies and afforded the british public an opportunity of acquiring experience which before it had happily wanted nevertheless at the time when the illselected medley of burnss correspondence first appeared little progress had been made nor is it likely that by the mass of mankind much ever will be made in determining what portion of these confidential communications escapes the pen in courteous yet often innocent complianceto gratify the several tastes of correspondents and as little towards distinguishing opinions and sentiments uttered for the momentary amusement merely of the writers own fancy from those which his judgment deliberately approves and his heart faithfully cherishes but the subject of this book was a man of extraordinary genius whose birth education and employments had placed and kept him in a situation far below that in which the writers and readers of expensive volumes are usually found critics upon works of fiction have laid it down as a rule that remoteness of place in fixing the choice of a subject and in prescribing the mode of treating it is equal in effect to distance of timerestraints may be thrown off accordingly judge then of the delusions which artificial distinctions impose when to a man like doctor currie writing with views so honourable the social condition of the individual of whom he was treating could seem to place him at such a distance from the exalted reader that ceremony might he discarded with him and his memory sacrificed as it were almost without compunction the poet was laid where these injuries could not reach him but he had a parent i understand an admirable woman still surviving a brother like gilbert burnsa widow estimable for her virtues and children at that time infants with the world before them which they must face to obtain a maintenance who remembered their father probably with the tenderest affectionand whose opening minds as their years advanced would become conscious of so many reasons for admiring himillfated child of nature too frequently thine own enemyunhappy favourite of genius too often misguidedthis is indeed to be crushed beneath the furrows weight  why sir do i write to you at this length when all that i had to express in direct answer to the request which occasioned this letter lay in such narrow compassbecause having entered upon the subject i am unable to quit ityour feelings i trust go along with mine and rising from this individual case to a general view of the subject you will probably agree with me in opinion that biography though differing in some essentials from works of fiction is nevertheless like them an artan art the laws of which are determined by the imperfections of our nature and the constitution of society truth is not here as in the sciences and in natural philosophy to be sought without scruple and promulgated for its own sake upon the mere chance of its being serviceable but only for obviously justifying purposes moral or intellectual  silence is a privilege of the grave a right of the departed let him therefore who infringes that right by speaking publicly of for or against those who cannot speak for themselves take heed that he opens not his mouth without a sufficient sanction de mortuis nil nisi bonum is a rule in which these sentiments have been pushed to an extreme that proves how deeply humanity is interested in maintaining them and it was wise to announce the precept thus absolutely both because there exist in that same nature by which it has been dictated so many temptations to disregard itand because there are powers and influences within and without us that will prevent its being literally fulfilledto the suppression of profitable truth penalties of law conventions of manners and personal fear protect the reputation of the living and something of this protection is extended to the recently deadwho survive to a certain degree in their kindred and friends few are so insensible as not to feel this and not to be actuated by the feeling but only to philosophy enlightened by the affections does it belong justly to estimate the claims of the deceased on the one hand and of the present age and future generations on the other and to strike a balance between themsuch philosophy runs a risk of becoming extinct among us if the coarse intrusions into the recesses the gross breaches upon the sanctities of domestic life to which we have lately been more and more accustomed are to be regarded as indications of a vigorous state of public feelingfavourable to the maintenance of the liberties of our countryintelligent lovers of freedom are from necessity bold and hardy lovers of truth but according to the measure in which their love is intelligent is it attended with a finer discrimination and a more sensitive delicacy the wise and good and all others being lovers of licence rather than of liberty are in fact slaves respect as one of the noblest characteristics of englishmen that jealousy of familiar approach which while it contributes to the maintenance of private dignity is one of the most efficacious guardians of rational public freedom  the general obligation upon which i have insisted is especially binding upon those who undertake the biography of authors assuredly there is no cause why the lives of that class of men should be pried into with the same diligent curiosity and laid open with the same disregard of reserve which may sometimes be expedient in composing the history of men who have borne an active part in the world such thorough knowledge of the good and bad qualities of these latter as can only be obtained by a scrutiny of their private lives conduces to explain not only their own public conduct but that of those with whom they have acted nothing of this applies to authors considered merely as authors our business is with their booksto understand and to enjoy them and of poets more especially it is truethat if their works be good they contain within themselves all that is necessary to their being comprehended and relished it should seem that the ancients thought in this manner for of the eminent greek and roman poets few and scanty memorials were i believe ever prepared and fewer still are preserved it is delightful to read what in the happy exercise of his own genius horace chooses to communicate of himself and his friends but i confess i am not so much a lover of knowledge independent of its quality as to make it likely that it would much rejoice me were i to hear that records of the sabine poet and his contemporaries composed upon the boswellian plan had been unearthed among the ruins of herculaneum you will interpret what i am writing liberally with respect to the light which such a discovery might throw upon roman manners there would be reasons to desire it but i should dread to disfigure the beautiful ideal of the memories of those illustrious persons with incongruous features and to sully the imaginative purity of their classical works with gross and trivial recollections the least weighty objection to heterogeneous details is that they are mainly superfluous and therefore an incumbrance  but you will perhaps accuse me of refining too much and it is i own comparatively of little importance while we are engaged in reading the iliad the eneid the tragedies of othello and king lear whether the authors of these poems were good or bad men whether they lived happily or miserably should a thought of the kind cross our minds there would be no doubt if irresistible external evidence did not decide the question unfavourably that men of such transcendant genius were both good and happy and if unfortunately it had been on record that they were otherwise sympathy with the fate of their fictitious personages would banish the unwelcome truth whenever it obtruded itself so that it would but slightly disturb our pleasure far otherwise is it with that class of poets the principal charm of whose writings depends upon the familiar knowledge which they convey of the personal feelings of their authors this is eminently the case with the effusions of burnsin the small quantity of narrative that he has given he himself bears no inconsiderable part and he has produced no drama neither the subjects of his poems nor his manner of handling them allow us long to forget their author on the basis of his human character he has reared a poetic one which with more or less distinctness presents itself to view in almost every part of his earlier and in my estimation his most valuable verses this poetic fabric dug out of the quarry of genuine humanity is airy and spiritualand though the materials in some parts are coarse and the disposition is often fantastic and irregular yet the whole is agreeable and strikingly attractive plague then upon your remorseless hunters after matter of fact who after all rank among the blindest of human beings when they would convince you that the foundations of this admirable edifice are hollow and that its frame is unsound granting that all which has been raked up to the prejudice of burns were literally true and that it added which it does not to our better understanding of human nature and human life for that genius is not incompatible with vice and that vice leads to miserythe more acute from the sensibilities which are the elements of geniuswe needed not those communications to inform us how poor would have been the compensation for the deduction made by this extrinsic knowledge from the intrinsic efficacy of his poetryto please and to instruct  in illustration of this sentiment permit me to remind you that it is the privilege of poetic genius to catch under certain restrictions of which perhaps at the time of its being exerted it is but dimly conscious a spirit of pleasure wherever it can be foundin the walks of nature and in the business of menthe poet trusting to primary instincts luxuriates among the felicities of love and wine and is enraptured while he describes the fairer aspects of war nor does he shrink from the company of the passion of love though immoderatefrom convivial pleasure though intemperatenor from the presence of war though savage and recognized as the handmaid of desolation frequently and admirably has burns given way to these impulses of nature both with reference to himself and in describing the condition of others who but some impenetrable dunce or narrowminded puritan in works of art ever read without delight the picture which he has drawn of the convivial exaltation of the rustic adventurer tam oshanter the poet fears not to tell the reader in the outset that his hero was a desperate and sottish drunkard whose excesses were frequent as his opportunities this reprobate sits down to his cups while the storm is roaring and heaven and earth are in confusionthe night is driven on by song and tumultuous noiselaughter and jest thicken as the beverage improves upon the palateconjugal fidelity archly bends to the service of general benevolenceselfishness is not absent but wearing the mask of social cordialityand while these various elements of humanity are blended into one proud and happy composition of elated spirits the anger of the tempest without doors only heightens and sets off the enjoyment withini pity him who cannot perceive that in all this though there was no moral purpose there is a moral effect      kings may be blest but tam was glorious     oer a the ills of life victorious  what a lesson do these words convey of charitable indulgence for the vicious habits of the principal actor in this scene and of those who resemble himmen who to the rigidly virtuous are objects almost of loathing and whom therefore they cannot serve the poet penetrating the unsightly and disgusting surfaces of things has unveiled with exquisite skill the finer ties of imagination and feeling that often bind these beings to practices productive of so much unhappiness to themselves and to those whom it is their duty to cherishand as far as he puts the reader into possession of this intelligent sympathy he qualifies him for exercising a salutary influence over the minds of those who are thus deplorably enslaved  not less successfully does burns avail himself of his own character and situation in society to construct out of them a poetic selfintroduced as a dramatic personagefor the purpose of inspiriting his incidents diversifying his pictures recommending his opinions and giving point to his sentiments his brother can set me right if i am mistaken when i express a belief that at the time when he wrote his story of death and dr hornbook he had very rarely been intoxicated or perhaps even much exhilarated by liquor yet how happily does he lead his reader into that track of sensations and with what lively humour does he describe the disorder of his senses and the confusion of his understanding put to test by a deliberate attempt to count the horns of the moon        but whether she had three or four     he could na tell  behold a sudden apparition that disperses this disorder and in a moment chills him into possession of himself coming upon no more important mission than the grisly phantom was charged with what mode of introduction could have been more efficient or appropriate  but in those early poems through the veil of assumed habits and pretended qualities enough of the real man appears to show that he was conscious of sufficient cause to dread his own passions and to bewail his errors we have rejected as false sometimes in the letter and of necessity as false in the spirit many of the testimonies that others have borne against him but by his own handin words the import of which cannot be mistakenit has been recorded that the order of his life but faintly corresponded with the clearness of his views it is probable that he would have proved a still greater poet if by strength of reason he could have controlled the propensities which his sensibility engendered but he would have been a poet of a different class and certain it is had that desirable restraint been early established many peculiar beauties which enrich his verses could never have existed and many accessary influences which contribute greatly to their effect would have been wanting for instance the momentous truth of the passage already quoted one point must still be greatly dark c could not possibly have been conveyed with such pathetic force by any poet that ever lived speaking in his own voice unless it were felt that like burns he was a man who preached from the text of his own errors and whose wisdom beautiful as a flower that might have risen from seed sown from above was in fact a scion from the root of personal suffering whom did the poet intend should be thought of as occupying that grave over which after modestly setting forth the moral discernment and warm affections of its poor inhabitant it is supposed to be inscribed that      thoughtless follies laid him low     and stained his name  who but himselfhimself anticipating the too probable termination of his own course here is a sincere and solemn avowala public declaration from his own willa confession at once devout poetical and humana history in the shape of a prophecy what more was required of the biographer than to have put his seal to the writing testifying that the foreboding had been realized and that the record was authenticlastingly is it to be regretted in respect to this memorable being that inconsiderate intrusion has not left us at liberty to enjoy his mirth or his love his wisdom or his wit without an admixture of useless irksome and painful details that take from his poems so much of that rightwhich with all his carelessness and frequent breaches of selfrespect he was not negligent to maintain for themthe right of imparting solid instruction through the medium of unalloyed pleasure  you will have noticed that my observations have hitherto been confined to dr curries book if by fraternal piety the poison can be sucked out of this wound those inflicted by meaner hands may be safely left to heal of themselves of the other writers who have given their names only one lays claim to even a slight acquaintance with the author whose moral character they take upon them publicly to anatomize the edinburgh reviewerand him i single out because the author of the vindication of burns has treated his offences with comparative indulgence to which he has no claim and which from whatever cause it might arise has interfered with the dispensation of justicethe edinburgh reviewer thus writes3 the leading vice in burnss character and the cardinal deformity indeed of all his productions was his contempt or affectation of contempt for prudence decency and regularity and his admiration of thoughtlessness oddity and vehement sensibility his belief in short in the dispensing power of genius and social feeling in all matters of morality and common sense adding that these vices and erroneous notions have communicated to a great part of his productions a character of immorality at once contemptible and hateful we are afterwards told that he is perpetually making a parade of his thoughtlessness inflammability and imprudence and in the next paragraph that he is perpetually doing something else ie boasting of his own independencemarvellous address in the commission of faults not less than caesar showed in the management of business who it is said could dictate to three secretaries upon three several affairs at one and the same moment but to be serious when a man selfelected into the office of a public judge of the literature and life of his contemporaries can have the audacity to go these lengths in framing a summary of the contents of volumes that are scattered over every quarter of the globe and extant in almost every cottage of scotland to give the lie to his labours we must not wonder if in the plenitude of his concern for the interests of abstract morality the infatuated slanderer should have found no obstacle to prevent him from insinuating that the poet whose writings are to this degree stained and disfigured was one of the sons of fancy and of song who spend in vain superfluities the money that belongs of right to the pale industrious tradesman and his famishing infants and who rave about friendship and philosophy in a tavern while their wives hearts c c  3 from mr peterkins pamphlet who vouches for the accuracy of his citations omitting however to apologize for their length  it is notorious that this persevering aristarch4 as often as a work of original genius comes before him avails himself of that opportunity to reproclaim to the world the narrow range of his own comprehension the happy selfcomplacency the unsuspecting vainglory and the cordial bonhommie with which this part of his duty is performed do not leave him free to complain of being hardly dealt with if any one should declare the truth by pronouncing much of the foregoing attack upon the intellectual and moral character of burns to be the trespass for reasons that will shortly appear it cannot be called the venial trespass of a mind obtuse superficial and inept what portion of malignity such a mind is susceptible of the judicious admirers of the poet and the discerning friends of the man will not trouble themselves to enquire but they will wish that this evil principle had possessed more sway than they are at liberty to assign to it the offenders condition would not then have been so hopeless for malignity selects its diet but where is to be found the nourishment from which vanity will revolt malignity may be appeased by triumphs real or supposed and will then sleep or yield its place to a repentance producing dispositions of good will and desires to make amends for past injury but vanity is restless reckless intractable unappeasable insatiable  4 a friend who chances to be present while the author is correcting the proof sheets observes that aristarchus is libelled by this application of his name and advises that zoilus should be substituted the question lies between spite and presumption and it is not easy to decide upon a case where the claims of each party are so strong but the name of aristarch who simple man would allow no verse to pass for homers which he did not approve of is retained for reasons that will be deemed cogent  fortunate is it for the world when this spirit incites only to actions that meet with an adequate punishment in derision such as in a scheme of poetical justice would be aptly requited by assigning to the agents when they quit this lower world a station in that not uncomfortable limbothe paradise of fools but assuredly we shall have here another proof that ridicule is not the test of truth if it prevent us from perceiving that depravity has no ally more active more inveterate nor from the difficulty of divining to what kind and degree of extravagance it may prompt more pernicious than selfconceit where this alliance is too obvious to be disputed the culprit ought not to be allowed the benefit of contemptas a shelter from detestation much less should he be permitted to plead in excuse for his transgressions that especial malevolence had little or no part in them it is not recorded that the ancient who set fire to the temple of diana had a particular dislike to the goddess of chastity or held idolatry in abhorrence he was a fool an egregious fool but not the less on that account a most odious monster the tyrant who is described as having rattled his chariot along a bridge of brass over the heads of his subjects was no doubt inwardly laughed at but what if this mock jupiter not satisfied with an empty noise of his own making had amused himself with throwing firebrands upon the housetops as a substitute for lightning and from his elevation had hurled stones upon the heads of his people to show that he was a master of the destructive bolt as well as of the harmless voice of the thunderthe lovers of all that is honourable to humanity have recently had occasion to rejoice over the downfall of an intoxicated despot whose vagaries furnish more solid materials by which the philosopher will exemplify how strict is the connection between the ludicrously and the terribly fantastic we know also that robespierre was one of the vainest men that the most vain country upon earth has producedand from this passion and from that cowardice which naturally connects itself with it flowed the horrors of his administration it is a descent which i fear you will scarcely pardon to compare these redoubtable enemies of mankind with the anonymous conductor of a perishable publication but the moving spirit is the same in them all and as far as difference of circumstances and disparity of powers will allow manifests itself in the same way by professions of reverence for truth and concern for dutycarried to the giddiest heights of ostentation while practice seems to have no other reliance than on the omnipotence of falsehood  the transition from a vindication of robert burns to these hints for a picture of the intellectual deformity of one who has grossly outraged his memory is too natural to require an apology but i feel sir that i stand in need of indulgence for having detained you so long let me beg that you would impart to any judicious friends of the poet as much of the contents of these pages as you think will be serviceable to the cause but do not give publicity to any portion of them unless it be thought probable that an open circulation of the whole may be useful5 the subject is delicate and some of the opinions are of a kind which if torn away from the trunk that supports them will be apt to wither and in that state to contract poisonous qualities like the branches of the yew which while united by a living spirit to their native tree are neither noxious nor without beauty but being dissevered and cast upon the ground become deadly to the cattle that incautiously feed upon them  to mr gilbert burns especially let my sentiments be conveyed with my sincere respects and best wishes for the success of his praiseworthy enterprize and if through modest apprehension he should doubt of his own ability to do justice to his brothers memory let him take encouragement from the assurance that the most odious part of the charges owed its credit to the silence of those who were deemed best entitled to speak and who it was thought would not have been mute had they believed that they could speak beneficially moreover it may be relied on as a general truth which will not escape his recollection that tasks of this kind are not so arduous as to those who are tenderly concerned in their issue they may at first appear to be for if the many be hasty to condemn there is a reaction of generosity which stimulates themwhen forcibly summonedto redress the wrong and for the sensible part of mankind they are neither dull to understand nor slow to make allowance for the aberrations of men whose intellectual powers do honour to their species                 i am dear sir respectfully yours                         william wordsworth  rydal mount january 1816  5 it was deemed that it would be so and the letter is published accordingly     b of monuments to literary men  letter to a friend                                 rydal mount april 21 1819  sir  the letter with which you have honoured me bearing date the 31st of march i did not receive until yesterday and therefore could not earlier express my regret that notwithstanding a cordial approbation of the feeling which has prompted the undertaking and a genuine sympathy in admiration with the gentlemen who have subscribed towards a monument for burns i cannot unite my humble efforts with theirs in promoting this object  sincerely can i affirm that my respect for the motives which have swayed these gentlemen has urged me to trouble you with a brief statement of the reasons of my dissent  in the first place eminent poets appear to me to be a class of men who less than any others stand in need of such marks of distinction and hence i infer that this mode of acknowledging their merits is one for which they would not in general be themselves solicitous burns did indeed erect a monument to fergusson but i apprehend his gratitude took this course because he felt that fergusson had been prematurely cut off and that his fame bore no proportion to his deserts in neither of these particulars can the fate of burns justly be said to resemble that of his predecessor his years were indeed few but numerous enough to allow him to spread his name far and wide and to take permanent root in the affections of his countrymen in short he has raised for himself a monument so conspicuous and of such imperishable materials as to render a local fabric of stone superfluous and therefore comparatively insignificant  but why if this be granted should not his fond admirers be permitted to indulge their feelings and at the same time to embellish the metropolis of scotland if this may be justly objected to and in my opinion it may it is because the showy tributes to genius are apt to draw off attention from those efforts by which the interests of literature might be substantially promoted and to exhaust public spirit in comparatively unprofitable exertions when the wrongs of literary men are crying out for redress on all sides it appears to me that towards no class of his majestys subjects are the laws so unjust and oppressive the attention of parliament has lately been directed by petition to the exaction of copies of newly published works for certain libraries but this is a trifling evil compared with the restrictions imposed upon the duration of copyright which in respect to works profound in philosophy or elevated abstracted and refined in imagination is tantamount almost to an exclusion of the author from all pecuniary recompence and even where works of imagination and manners are so constituted as to be adapted to immediate demand as is the case of those of burns justly may it be asked what reason can be assigned that an author who dies young should have the prospect before him of his children being left to languish in poverty and dependence while booksellers are revelling in luxury upon gains derived from works which are the delight of many nations  this subject might be carried much further and we might ask if the course of things insured immediate wealth and accompanying rank and honourshonours and wealth often entailed on their families to men distinguished in the other learned professionswhy the laws should interfere to take away those pecuniary emoluments which are the natural inheritance of the posterity of authors whose pursuits if directed by genius and sustained by industry yield in importance to none in which the members of a community can be engaged  but to recur to the proposal in your letter i would readily assist according to my means in erecting a monument to the memory of the poet chatterton who with transcendent genius was cut off while he was yet a boy in years this could he have anticipated the tribute might have soothed his troubled spirit as an expression of general belief in the existence of those powers which he was too impatient and too proud to develope at all events it might prove an awful and a profitable warning i should also be glad to see a monument erected on the banks of loch leven to the memory of the innocent and tenderhearted michael bruce who after a short life spent in poverty and obscurity was called away too early to have left behind him more than a few trustworthy promises of pure affections and unvitiated imagination  let the gallant defenders of our country be liberally rewarded with monuments their noble actions cannot speak for themselves as the writings of men of genius are able to do gratitude in respect to them stands in need of admonition and the very multitude of heroic competitors which increases the demand for this sentiment towards our naval and military defenders considered as a body is injurious to the claims of individuals let our great statesmen and eminent lawyers our learned and eloquent divines and they who have successfully devoted themselves to the abstruser sciences be rewarded in like manner but towards departed genius exerted in the fine arts and more especially in poetry i humbly think in the present state of things the sense of our obligation to it may more satisfactorily be expressed by means pointing directly to the general benefit of literature  trusting that these opinions of an individual will be candidly interpreted i have the honour to be                   your obedient servant                          w wordsworth6  6 memoirs ii 8891     c of sir thomas browne a monument to southey c  letter to john

modern times i should prefer their being put in public places in the town with which the party was connected by birth or otherwise or in the country if he were a person who lived apart from the bustle

feb 22 1810  it needs scarcely be said that an epitaph presupposes a monument upon which it is to be engraven almost all nations have wished that certain external signs should point out the places where their dead are interred among savage tribes unacquainted with letters this has mostly been done either by rude stones placed near the graves or by mounds of earth raised over them this custom proceeded obviously from a twofold desire first to guard the remains of the deceased from irreverent approach or from savage violation and secondly to preserve their memory never any says camden neglected burial but some savage nations as the bactrians which cast their dead to the dogs some varlet philosophers as diogenes who desired to be devoured of fishes some dissolute courtiers as maecenas who was wont to say non tumulum euro sepelit natura relictos       im careless of a gravenature her dead will save  as soon as nations had learned the use of letters epitaphs were inscribed upon these monuments in order that their intention might be more surely and adequately fulfilled i have derived monuments and epitaphs from two sources of feeling but these do in fact resolve themselves into one the invention of epitaphs weever in his discourse of funeral monuments says rightly proceeded from the presage of forefeeling of immortality implanted in all men naturally and is referred to the scholars of linus the theban poet who flourished about the year of the world two thousand seven hundred who first bewailed this linus their master when he was slain in doleful verses then called of him aelina afterwards epitaphia for that they were first sung at burials after engraved upon the sepulchres  and verily without the consciousness of a principle of immortality in the human soul man could never have had awakened in him the desire to live in the remembrance of his fellows mere love or the yearning of kind towards kind could not have produced it the dog or horse perishes in the field or in the stall by the side of his companions and is incapable of anticipating the sorrow with which his surrounding associates shall bemoan his death or pine for his loss he cannot preconceive this regret he can form no thought of it and therefore cannot possibly have a desire to leave such regret or remembrance behind him add to the principle of love which exists in the inferior animals the faculty of reason which exists in man alone will the conjunction of these account for the desire doubtless it is a necessary consequence of this conjunction yet not i think as a direct result but only to be come at through an intermediate thought viz that of an intimation or assurance within us that some part of our nature is imperishable at least the precedence in order of birth of one feeling to the other is unquestionable if we look back upon the days of childhood we shall find that the time is not in remembrance when with respect to our own individual being the mind was without this assurance whereas the wish to be remembered by our friends or kindred after death or even in absence is as we shall discover a sensation that does not form itself till the social feelings have been developed and the reason has connected itself with a wide range of objects forlorn and cut off from communication with the best part of his nature must that man be who should derive the sense of immortality as it exists in the mind of a child from the same unthinking gaiety or liveliness of animal spirits with which the lamb in the meadow or any other irrational creature is endowed who should ascribe it in short to blank ignorance in the child to an inability arising from the imperfect state of his faculties to come in any point of his being into contact with a notion of death or to an unreflecting acquiescence in what had been instilled into him has such an unfolder of the mysteries of nature though he may have forgotten his former self ever noticed the early obstinate and unappeasable inquisitiveness of children upon the subject of origination this single fact proves outwardly the monstrousness of those suppositions for if we had no direct external testimony that the minds of very young children meditate feelingly upon death and immortality these inquiries which we all know they are perpetually making concerning the whence do necessarily include correspondent habits of interrogation concerning the whither origin and tendency are notions inseparably corelative never did a child stand by the side of a running stream pondering within himself what power was the feeder of the perpetual current from what neverwearied sources the body of water was supplied but he must have been inevitably propelled to follow this question by another towards what abyss is it in progress what receptacle can contain the mighty influx and the spirit of the answer must have been though the word might be sea or ocean accompanied perhaps with an image gathered from a map or from the real object in naturethese might have been the letter but the spirit of the answer must have been as inevitablya receptacle without bounds or dimensionsnothing less than infinity we may then be justified in asserting that the sense of immortality if not a coexistent and twin birth with reason is among the earliest of her offspring and we may further assert that from these conjoined and under their countenance the human affections are gradually formed and opened out this is not the place to enter into the recesses of these investigations but the subject requires me here to make a plain avowal that for my own part it is to me inconceivable that the sympathies of love towards each other which grow with our growth could ever attain any new strength or even preserve the old after we had received from the outward senses the impression of death and were in the habit of having that impression daily renewed and its accompanying feeling brought home to ourselves and to those we love if the same were not counteracted by those communications with our internal being which are anterior to all these experiences and with which revelation coincides and has through that coincidence alone for otherwise it could not possess it a power to affect us i confess with me the conviction is absolute that if the impression and sense of death were not thus counterbalanced such a hollowness would pervade the whole system of things such a want of correspondence and consistency a disproportion so astounding betwixt means and ends that there could be no repose no joy were we to grow up unfostered by this genial warmth a frost would chill the spirit so penetrating and powerful that there could be no motions of the life of love and infinitely less could we have any wish to be remembered after we had passed away from a world in which each man had moved about like a shadowif then in a creature endowed with the faculties of foresight and reason the social affections could not have unfolded themselves uncountenanced by the faith that man is an immortal being and if consequently neither could the individual dying have had a desire to survive in the remembrance of his fellows nor on their side could they have felt a wish to preserve for future times vestiges of the departed it follows as a final inference that without the belief in immortality wherein these several desires originate neither monuments nor epitaphs in affectionate or laudatory commemoration of the deceased could have existed in the world  simonides it is related upon landing in a strange country found the corpse of an unknown person lying by the seaside he buried it and was honoured throughout greece for the piety of that act another ancient philosopher chancing to fix his eyes upon a dead body regarded the same with slight if not with contempt saying see the shell of the flown bird but it is not to be supposed that the moral and tenderhearted simonides was incapable of the lofty movements of thought to which that other sage gave way at the moment while his soul was intent only upon the indestructible being nor on the other hand that he in whose sight a lifeless human body was of no more value than the worthless shell from which the living fowl had departed would not in a different mood of mind have been affected by those earthly considerations which had incited the philosophic poet to the performance of that pious duty and with regard to this latter we may be assured that if he had been destitute of the capability of communing with the more exalted thoughts that appertain to human nature he would have cared no more for the corpse of the stranger than for the dead body of a seal or porpoise which might have been cast up by the waves we respect the corporeal frame of man not merely because it is the habitation of a rational but of an immortal soul each of these sages was in sympathy with the best feelings of our nature feelings which though they seem opposite to each other have another and a finer connection than that of contrastit is a connection formed through the subtle process by which both in the natural and the moral world qualities pass insensibly into their contraries and things revolve upon each other as in sailing upon the orb of this planet a voyage towards the regions where the sun sets conducts gradually to the quarter where we have been accustomed to behold it come forth at its rising and in like manner a voyage towards the east the birthplace in our imagination of the morning leads finally to the quarter where the sun is last seen when he departs from our eyes so the contemplative soul travelling in the direction of mortality advances to the country of everlasting life and in like manner may she continue to explore those cheerful tracts till she is brought back for her advantage and benefit to the land of transitory thingsof sorrow and of tears  on a midway point therefore which commands the thoughts and feelings of the two sages whom we have represented in contrast does the author of that species of composition the laws of which it is our present purpose to explain take his stand accordingly recurring to the twofold desire of guarding the remains of the deceased and preserving their memory it may be said that a sepulchral monument is a tribute to a man as a human being and that an epitaph in the ordinary meaning attached to the word includes this general feeling and something more and is a record to preserve the memory of the dead as a tribute due to his individual worth for a satisfaction to the sorrowing hearts of the survivors and for the common benefit of the living which record is to be accomplished not in a general manner but where it can in close connection with the bodily remains of the deceased and these it may be added among the modern nations of europe are deposited within or contiguous to their places of worship in ancient times as is well known it was the custom to bury the dead beyond the walls of towns and cities and among the greeks and romans they were frequently interred by the waysides  i could here pause with pleasure and invite the reader to indulge with me in contemplation of the advantages which must have attended such a practice we might ruminate upon the beauty which the monuments thus placed must have borrowed from the surrounding images of naturefrom the trees the wild flowers from a stream running perhaps within sight or hearing from the beaten road stretching its weary length hard by many tender similitudes must these objects have presented to the mind of the traveller leaning upon one of the tombs or reposing in the coolness of its shade whether he had halted from weariness or in compliance with the invitation pause traveller so often found upon the monuments and to its epitaph also must have been supplied strong appeals to visible appearances or immediate impressions lively and affecting analogies of life as a journeydeath as a sleep overcoming the tired wayfarerof misfortune as a storm that falls suddenly upon himof beauty as a flower that passeth away or of innocent pleasure as one that may be gatheredof virtue that standeth firm as a rock against the beating wavesof hope undermined insensibly like the poplar by the side of the river that has fed it or blasted in a moment like a pinetree by the stroke of lightning upon the mountaintopof admonitions and heartstirring remembrances like a refreshing breeze that comes without warning or the taste of the waters of an unexpected fountain these and similar suggestions must have given formerly to the language of the senseless stone a voice enforced and endeared by the benignity of that nature with which it was in unisonwe in modern times have lost much of these advantages and they are but in a small degree counterbalanced to the inhabitants of large towns and cities by the custom of depositing the dead within or contiguous to their places of worship however splendid or imposing may be the appearance of those edifices or however interesting or salutary the recollections associated with them even were it not true that tombs lose their monitory virtue when thus obtruded upon the notice of men occupied with the cares of the world and too often sullied and defiled by those cares yet still when death is in our thoughts nothing can make amends for the want of the soothing influences of nature and for the absence of those types of renovation and decay which the fields and woods offer to the notice of the serious and contemplative mind to feel the force of this sentiment let a man only compare in imagination the unsightly manner in which our monuments are crowded together in the busy noisy unclean and almost grassless churchyard of a large town with the still seclusion of a turkish cemetery in some remote place and yet further sanctified by the grove of cypress in which it is embosomed thoughts in the same temper as these have already been expressed with true sensibility by an ingenuous poet of the present day the subject of his poem is all saints church derby he has been deploring the forbidding and unseemly appearance of its burialground and uttering a wish that in past times the practice had been adopted of interring the inhabitants of large towns in the country      then in some rural calm sequestered spot     where healing nature her benignant look     neer changes save at that lorn season when     with tresses drooping oer her sable stole     she yearly mourns the mortal doom of man     her noblest work so israels virgins erst     with annual moan upon the mountains wept     their fairest gone there in that rural scene     so placid so congenial to the wish     the christian feels of peaceful rest within     the silent grave i would have stayed                                           wandered forth where the cold dew of heaven     lay on the humbler graves around what time     the pale moon gazed upon the turfy mounds     pensive as though like me in lonely muse     twere brooding on the dead inhumed beneath     there while with him the holy man of uz     oer human destiny i sympathised     counting the long long periods prophecy     decrees to roll ere the great day arrives     of resurrection oft the blueeyed spring     had met me with her blossoms as the dove     of old returned with olive leaf to cheer     the patriarch mourning oer a world destroyed     and i would bless her visit for to me     tis sweet to trace the consonance that links     as one the works of nature and the word     of godjohn edwards  a village churchyard lying as it does in the lap of nature may indeed be most favourably contrasted with that of a town of crowded population and sepulture therein combines many of the best tendencies which belong to the mode practised by the ancients with others peculiar to itself the sensations of pious cheerfulness which attend the celebration of the sabbathday in rural places are profitably chastised by the sight of the graves of kindred and friends gathered together in that general home towards which the thoughtful yet happy spectators themselves are journeying hence a parishchurch in the stillness of the country is a visible centre of a community of the living and the dead a point to which are habitually referred the nearest concerns of both  as then both in cities and villages the dead are deposited in close connection with our places of worship with us the composition of an epitaph naturally turns still more than among the nations of antiquity upon the most serious and solemn affections of the human mind upon departed worthupon personal or social sorrow and admirationupon religion individual and socialupon time and upon eternity accordingly it suffices in ordinary cases to secure a composition of this kind from censure that it contain nothing that shall shock or be inconsistent with this spirit but to entitle an epitaph to praise more than this is necessary it ought to contain some thought or feeling belonging to the mortal or immortal part of our nature touchingly expressed and if that be done however general or even trite the sentiment may be every man of pure mind will read the words with pleasure and gratitude a husband bewails a wife a parent breathes a sigh of disappointed hope over a lost child a son utters a sentiment of filial reverence for a departed father or mother a friend perhaps inscribes an encomium recording the companionable qualities or the solid virtues of the tenant of the grave whose departure has left a sadness upon his memory this and a pious admonition to the living and a humble expression of christian confidence in immortality is the language of a thousand churchyards and it does not often happen that anything in a greater degree discriminate or appropriate to the dead or to the living is to be found in them this want of discrimination has been ascribed by dr johnson in his essay upon the epitaphs of pope to two causes first the scantiness of the objects of human praise and secondly the want of variety in the characters of men or to use his own words to the fact that the greater part of mankind have no character at all such language may be holden without blame among the generalities of common conversation but does not become a critic and a moralist speaking seriously upon a serious subject the objects of admiration in human nature are not scanty but abundant and every man has a character of his own to the eye that has skill to perceive it the real cause of the acknowledged want of discrimination in sepulchral memorials is this that to analyse the characters of others especially of those whom we love is not a common or natural employment of men at any time we are not anxious unerringly to understand the constitution of the minds of those who have soothed who have cheered who have supported us with whom we have been long and daily pleased or delighted the affections are their own justification the light of love in our hearts is a satisfactory evidence that there is a body of worth in the minds of our friends or kindred whence that light has proceeded we shrink from the thought of placing their merits and defects to be weighed against each other in the nice balance of pure intellect nor do we find much temptation to detect the shades by which a good quality or virtue is discriminated in them from an excellence known by the same general name as it exists in the mind of another and least of all do we incline to these refinements when under the pressure of sorrow admiration or regret or when actuated by any of those feelings which incite men to prolong the memory of their friends and kindred by records placed in the bosom of the alluniting and equalising receptacle of the dead  the first requisite then in an epitaph is that it should speak in a tone which shall sink into the heart the general language of humanity as connected with the subject of deaththe source from which an epitaph proceedsof death and of life to be born and to die are the two points in which all men feel themselves to be in absolute coincidence this general language may be uttered so strikingly as to entitle an epitaph to high praise yet it cannot lay claim to the highest unless other excellencies be superadded passing through all intermediate steps we will attempt to determine at once what these excellencies are and wherein consists the perfection of this species of compositionit will be found to lie in a due proportion of the common or universal feeling of humanity to sensations excited by a distinct and clear conception conveyed to the readers mind of the individual whose death is deplored and whose memory is to be preserved at least of his character as after death it appeared to those who loved him and lament his loss the general sympathy ought to be quickened provoked and diversified by particular thoughts actions imagescircumstances of age occupation manner of life prosperity which the deceased had known or adversity to which he had been subject and these ought to be bound together and solemnised into one harmony by the general sympathy the two powers should temper restrain and exalt each other the reader ought to know who and what the man was whom he is called upon to think of with interest a distinct conception should be given implicitly where it can rather than explicitly of the individual lamentedbut the writer of an epitaph is not an anatomist who dissects the internal frame of the mind he is not even a painter who executes a portrait at leisure and in entire tranquillity his delineation we must remember is performed by the side of the grave and what is more the grave of one whom he loves and admires what purity and brightness is that virtue clothed in the image of which must no longer bless our living eyes the character of a deceased friend or beloved kinsman is not seen nonor ought to be seen otherwise than as a tree through a tender haze or a luminous mist that spiritualises and beautifies it that takes away indeed but only to the end that the parts which are not abstracted may appear more dignified and lovely may impress and affect the more shall we say then that this is not truth not a faithful image and that accordingly the purposes of commemoration cannot be answeredit is truth and of the highest order for though doubtless things are not apparent which did exist yet the object being looked at through this medium parts and proportions are brought into distinct view which before had been only imperfectly or unconsciously seen it is truth hallowed by lovethe joint offspring of the worth of the dead and the affections of the living this may easily be brought to the test let one whose eyes have been sharpened by personal hostility to discover what was amiss in the character of a good man hear the tidings of his death and what a change is wrought in a moment enmity melts away and as it disappears unsightliness disproportion and deformity vanish and through the influence of commiseration a harmony of love and beauty succeeds bring such a man to the tombstone on which shall be inscribed an epitaph on his adversary composed in the spirit which we have recommended would he turn from it as from an idle tale nothe thoughtful look the sigh and perhaps the involuntary tear would testify that it had a sane a generous and good meaning and that on the writers mind had remained an impression which was a true abstract of the character of the deceased that his gifts and graces were remembered in the simplicity in which they ought to be remembered the composition and quality of the mind of a virtuous man contemplated by the side of the grave where his body is mouldering ought to appear and be felt as something midway between what he was on earth walking about with his living frailties and what he may be presumed to be as a spirit in heaven  it suffices therefore that the trunk and the main branches of the worth of the deceased be boldly and unaffectedly represented any further detail minutely and scrupulously pursued especially if this be done with laborious and antithetic discriminations must inevitably frustrate its own purpose forcing the passing spectator to this conclusioneither that the dead did not possess the merits ascribed to him or that they who have raised a monument to his memory and must therefore be supposed to have been closely connected with him were incapable of perceiving those merits or at least during the act of composition had lost sight of them for the understanding having been so busy in its petty occupation how could the heart of the mourner be other than cold and in either of these cases whether the fault be on the part of the buried person or the survivors the memorial is unaffecting and profitless  much better is it to fall short in discrimination than to pursue it too far or to labour it unfeelingly for in no place are we so much disposed to dwell upon those points of nature and condition wherein all men resemble each other as in the temple where the universal father is worshipped or by the side of the grave which gathers all human beings to itself and equalises the lofty and the low we suffer and we weep with the same heart we love and are anxious for one another in one spirit our hopes look to the same quarter and the virtues by which we are all to be furthered and supported as patience meekness goodwill justice temperance and temperate desires are in an equal degree the concern of us all let an epitaph then contain at least these acknowledgments to our common nature nor let the sense of their importance be sacrificed to a balance of opposite qualities or minute distinctions in individual character which if they do not as will for the most part be the case when examined resolve themselves into a trick of words will even when they are true and just for the most part be grievously out of place for as it is probable that few only have explored these intricacies of human nature so can the tracing of them be interesting only to a few but an epitaph is not a proud writing shut up for the studious it is exposed to allto the wise and the most ignorant it is condescending perspicuous and lovingly solicits regard its story and admonitions are brief that the thoughtless the busy and indolent may not be deterred nor the impatient tired the stooping old man cons the engraven record like a second hornbookthe child is proud that he can read itand the stranger is introduced through its mediation to the company of a friend it is concerning all and for allin the churchyard it is open to the day the sun looks down upon the stone and the rains of heaven beat against it  yet though the writer who would excite sympathy is bound in this case more than in any other to give proof that he himself has been moved it is to be remembered that to raise a monument is a sober and a reflective act that the inscription which it bears is intended to be permanent and for universal perusal and that for this reason the thoughts and feelings expressed should be permanent alsoliberated from that weakness and anguish of sorrow which is in nature transitory and which with instinctive decency retires from notice the passions should be subdued the emotions controlled strong indeed but nothing ungovernable or wholly involuntary seemliness requires this and truth requires it also for how can the narrator otherwise be trusted moreover a grave is a tranquillising object resignation in course of time springs up from it as naturally as the wild flowers besprinkling the turf with which it may be covered or gathering round the monument by which it is defended the very form and substance of the monument which has received the inscription and the appearance of the letters testifying with what a slow and laborious hand they must have been engraven might seem to reproach the author who had given way upon this occasion to transports of mind or to quick turns of conflicting passion though the same might constitute the life and beauty of a funeral oration or elegiac poem  these sensations and judgments acted upon perhaps unconsciously have been one of the main causes why epitaphs so often personate the deceased and represent him as speaking from his own tombstone the departed mortal is introduced telling you himself that his pains are gone that a state of rest is come and he conjures you to weep for him no longer he admonishes with the voice of one experienced in the vanity of those affections which are confined to earthly objects and gives a verdict like a superior being performing the office of a judge who has no temptations to mislead him and whose decision cannot but be dispassionate thus is death disarmed of its sting and affliction unsubstantialised by this tender fiction the survivors bind themselves to a sedater sorrow and employ the intervention of the imagination in order that the reason may speak her own language earlier than she would otherwise have been enabled to do this shadowy interposition also harmoniously unites the two worlds of the living and the dead by their appropriate affections and it may be observed that here we have an additional proof of the propriety with which sepulchral inscriptions were referred to the consciousness of immortality as their primal source  i do not speak with a wish to recommend that an epitaph should be cast in this mould preferably to the still more common one in which what is said comes from the survivors directly but rather to point out how natural those feelings are which have induced men in all states and ranks of society so frequently to adopt this mode and this i have done chiefly in order that the laws which ought to govern the composition of the other may be better understood this latter mode namely that in which the survivors speak in their own persons seems to me upon the whole greatly preferable as it admits a wider range of notices and above all because excluding the fiction which is the groundwork of the other it rests upon a more solid basis  enough has been a said to convey our notion of a perfect epitaph but it must be borne in mind that one is meant which will best answer the general ends of that species of composition according to the course pointed out the worth of private life through all varieties of situation and character will be most honourably and profitably preserved in memory nor would the model recommended less suit public men in all instances save of those persons who by the greatness of their services in the employments of peace or war or by the surpassing excellence of their works in art literature or science have made themselves not only universally known but have filled the heart of their country with everlasting gratitude yet i must here pause to correct myself in describing the general tenor of thought which epitaphs ought to hold i have omitted to say that if it be the actions of a man or even some one conspicuous or beneficial act of local or general utility which have distinguished him and excited a desire that he should be remembered then of course ought the attention to be directed chiefly to those actions or that act and such sentiments dwelt upon as naturally arise out of them or it having made this necessary distinction i proceedthe mighty benefactors of mankind as they are not only known by the immediate survivors but will continue to be known familiarly to latest posterity do not stand in need of biographic sketches in such a place nor of delineations of character to individualise them this is already done by their works in the memories of men their naked names and a grand comprehensive sentiment of civic gratitude patriotic love or human admirationor the utterance of some elementary principle most essential in the constitution of true virtueor a declaration touching that pious humility and selfabasement which are ever most profound as minds are most susceptible of genuine exaltationor an intuition communicated in adequate words of the sublimity of intellectual powerthese are the only tribute which can here be paidthe only offering that upon such an altar would not be unworthy      what needs my shakspeare for his honoured bones     the labour of an age in piled stones     or that his hallowed reliques should be hid     under a star ypointing pyramid     dear son of memory great heir of fame     what needst thou such weak witness of thy name     thou in our wonder and astonishment     hast built thyself a livelong monument     and so sepulchred in such pomp dost lie     that kings for such a tomb would wish to die     b the country churchyard and critical examination of ancient epitaphs  from the authors mss       yet even these bones from insult to protect       some frail memorial still erected nigh     with uncouth rhymes and shapeless sculpture deckd       implores the passing tribute of a sigh     their name their years spelt by the unletterd muse       the place of fame and elegy supply     and many a holy text around she strews       that teach the rustic moralist to die  when a stranger has walked round a country churchyard and glanced his eye over so many brief chronicles as the tombstones usually contain of faithful wives tender husbands dutiful children and good men of all classes he will be tempted to exclaim in the language of one of the characters of a modern tale in a similar situation where are all the bad people buried he may smile to himself an answer to this question and may regret that it has intruded upon him so soon for my own part such has been my lot and indeed a man who is in the habit of suffering his mind to be carried passively towards truth as well as of going with conscious effort in search of it may be forgiven if he has sometimes insensibly yielded to the delusion of those flattering recitals and found a pleasure in believing that the prospect of real life had been as fair as it was in that picture represented and such a transitory oversight will without difficulty be forgiven by those who have observed a trivial fact in daily life namely how apt in a series of calm weather we are to forget that rain and storms have been and will return to interrupt any scheme of business or pleasure which our minds are occupied in arranging amid the quiet of a churchyard thus decorated as it seemed by the hand of memory and shining if i may so say in the light of love i have been affected by sensations akin to those which have risen in my mind while i have been standing by the side of a smooth sea on a summers day it is such a happiness to have in an unkind world one enclosure where the voice of detraction is not heard where the traces of evil inclinations are unknown where contentment prevails and there is no jarring tone in the peaceful concert of amity and gratitude i have been rouzed from this reverie by a consciousness suddenly flashing upon me of the anxieties the perturbations and in many instances the vices and rancorous dispositions by which the hearts of those who lie under so smooth a surface and so fair an outside have been agitated the image of an unruffled sea has still remained but my fancy has penetrated into the depths of that seawith accompanying thoughts of shipwreck of the destruction of the mariners hopes the bones of drowned men heaped together monsters of the deep and all the hideous and confused sights which clarence saw in his dream  nevertheless i have been able to return and who may not to a steady contemplation of the benign influence of such a favourable register lying open to the eyes of all without being so far lulled as to imagine i saw in a village churchyard the eye or central point of a rural arcadia i have felt that with all the vague and general expressions of love gratitude and praise with which it is usually crowded it is a far more faithful representation of homely life as existing among a community in which circumstances have not been untoward than any report which might be made by a rigorous observer deficient in that spirit of forbearance and those kindly prepossessions without which human life can in no condition be profitably looked at or described for we must remember that it is the nature of vice to force itself upon notice both in the act and by its consequences drunkenness cruelty brutal manners sensuality and impiety thoughtless prodigality and idleness are obstreperous while they are in the height and heyday of their enjoyment and when that is passed away long and obtrusive is the train of misery which they draw after them but on the contrary the virtues especially those of humble life are retired and many of the highest must be sought for or they will be overlooked industry economy temperance and cleanliness are indeed made obvious by flourishing fields rosy complexions and smiling countenances but how few know anything of the trials to which men in a lonely condition are subject or of the steady and triumphant manner in which those trials are often sustained but they themselves the afflictions which peasants and rural citizens have to struggle with are for the most part secret the tears which they wipe away and the sighs which they stiflethis is all a labour of privacy in fact their victories are to themselves known only imperfectly for it is inseparable from virtue in the pure sense of the word to be unconscious of the might of her own prowess this is true of minds the most enlightened by reflection who have forecast what they may have to endure and prepared themselves accordingly it is true even of these when they are called into action that they necessarily lose sight of their own accomplishments and support their conflicts in selfforgetfulness and humility that species of happy ignorance which is the consequence of these noble qualities must exist still more frequently and in a greater degree in those persons to whom duty has never been matter of laborious speculation and who have no intimations of the power to act and to resist which is in them till they are summoned to put it forth i could illustrate this by many examples which are now before my eyes but it would detain me too long from my principal subject which was to suggest reasons for believing that the encomiastic language of rural tombstones does not so far exceed reality as might lightly be supposed doubtless an inattentive or illdisposed observer who should apply to surrounding cottages the knowledge which he may possess of any rural neighbourhood would upon the first impulse confidently report that there was little in their living inhabitants which reflected the concord and the virtue there dwelt upon so fondly much has been said in a former paper tending to correct this disposition and which will naturally combine with the present considerations besides to slight the uniform language of these memorials as on that account not trustworthy would obviously be unjustifiable  enter a churchyard by the seacoast and you will be almost sure to find the tombstones crowded with metaphors taken from the sea and a seafaring life these are uniformly in the same strain but surely we ought not thence to infer that the words are used of course without any heartfelt sense of their propriety would not the contrary conclusion be right but i will adduce a fact which more than a hundred analogical arguments will carry to the mind a conviction of the strength and sanctity of those feelings which persons in humble stations of society connect with their departed friends and kindred we learn from the statistical account of scotland that in some districts a general transfer of inhabitants has taken place and that a great majority of those who live and labour and attend public worship in one part of the country are buried in another strong and unconquerable still continues to be the desire of all that their bones should rest by the side of their forefathers and very poor persons provide that their bodies should be conveyed if necessary to a great distance to obtain that last satisfaction nor can i refrain from saying that this natural interchange by which the living inhabitants of a parish have small knowledge of the dead who are buried in their churchyard is grievously to be lamented wherever it exists for it cannot fail to preclude not merely much but the best part of the wholesome influence of that communion between living and dead which the conjunction in rural districts of the place of burial and place of worship tends so effectually to promote finally let us remember that if it be the nature of man to be insensible to vexations and afflictions when they have passed away he is equally insensible to the height and depth of his blessings till they are removed from him an experienced and wellregulated mind will not therefore be insensible to this monotonous language of sorrow and affectionate admiration but will find under that veil a substance of individual truth yet upon all men and upon such a mind in particular an epitaph must strike with a gleam of pleasure when the expression is of that kind which carries conviction to the heart at once that the author was a sincere mourner and that the inhabitant of the grave deserved to be so lamented this may be done sometimes by a naked ejaculation as in an instance which a friend of mine met with in a churchyard in germany thus literally translated ah they have laid in the grave a brave man he was to me more than many      ach sie haben     einen braven     mann begraben     mir war er mehr als viele  an effect as pleasing is often produced by the recital of an affliction endured with fortitude or of a privation submitted to with contentment or by a grateful display of the temporal blessings with which providence had favoured the deceased and the happy course of life through which he had passed and where these individualities are untouched upon it may still happen that the estate of man in his helplessness in his dependence upon his maker or some other inherent of his nature shall be movingly and profitably expressed every reader will be able to supply from his own observation instances of all these kinds and it will be more pleasing for him to refer to his memory than to have the page crowded with unnecessary quotations i will however give one or two from an old book cited before the following of general application was a great favourite with our forefathers      farwel my frendys the tyd abidyth no man       i am departed hens and so sal ye     but in this passage the best song i can       is requiem eternam now jesu grant it me     when i have ended all myn adversity     grant me in paradys to have a mansion     that shedst thy bloud for my redemption  this epitaph might seem to be of the age of chaucer for it has the very tone and manner of the prioresss tale  the next opens with a thought somewhat interrupting that complacency and gracious repose which the language and imagery of a churchyard tend to diffuse but the truth is weighty and will not be less acceptable for the rudeness of the expression      when the bells be mearely roung     and the masse devoutly soung     and the meate merrely eaten     then sall robert trappis his wyffs and his chyldren be            forgotten     wherfor iesu that of mary sproung     set their soulys thy saynts among     though it be undeservyd on their syde     yet good lord let them evermor thy mercy abyde  it is well known how fond our ancestors were of a play upon the name of the deceased when it admitted of a double sense the following is an instance of this propensity not idly indulged it brings home a general truth to the individual by the medium of a pun which will be readily pardoned for the sake of the image suggested by it for the happy mood of mind in which the epitaph is composed for the beauty of the language and for the sweetness of the versification which indeed the date considered is not a little curious it is upon a man whose name was palmer i have modernized the spelling in order that its uncouthness may not interrupt the readers gratification      palmers all our fathers were     i a palmer livèd here     and travelled still till worn with age     i ended this worlds pilgrimage     on the blest ascensionday     in the chearful month of may     one thousand with four hundred seven     and took my journey hence to heaven  with this join the following which was formerly to be seen upon a fair marble under the portraiture of one of the abbots of st albans      hic quidem terra tegitur     peccati solvens debitum     cujus nomen non impositum     in libro vitae sit inscriptum  the spirit of it may be thus given here lies covered by the earth and paying his debt to sin one whose name is not set forth may it be inscribed in the book of life  but these instances of the humility the pious faith and simplicity of our forefathers have led me from the scene of our contemplationsa country churchyard and from the memorials at this day commonly found in it i began with noticing such as might be wholly uninteresting from the uniformity of the language which they exhibit because without previously participating the truths upon which these general attestations are founded it is impossible to arrive at that state of disposition of mind necessary to make those epitaphs thoroughly felt which have an especial recommendation with the same view i will venture to say a few words upon another characteristic of these compositions almost equally striking namely the homeliness of some of the inscriptions the strangeness of the illustrative images the grotesque spelling with the equivocal meaning often struck out by it and the quaint jingle of the rhymes these have often excited regret in serious minds and provoked the unwilling to goodhumoured laughter yet for my own part without affecting any superior sanctity i must say that i have been better satisfied with myself when in these evidences i have seen a proof how deeply the piety of the rude forefathers of the hamlet is seated in their natures i mean how habitual and constitutional it is and how awful the feeling which they attach to the situation of their departed friendsa proof of this rather than of their ignorance or of a deadness in their faculties to a sense of the ridiculous and that this deduction may be just is rendered probable by the frequent occurrence of passages according to our present notion full as ludicrous in the writings of the most wise and learned men of former ages divines and poets who in the earnestness of their souls have applied metaphors and illustrations taken either from holy writ or from the usages of their own country in entire confidence that the sacredness of the theme they were discussing would sanctify the meanest object connected with it or rather without ever conceiving it was possible that a ludicrous thought could spring up in any mind engaged in such meditations and certainly these odd and fantastic combinations are not confined to epitaphs of the peasantry or of the lower orders of society but are perhaps still more commonly produced among the higher in a degree equally or more striking for instance what shall we say to this upon sir george vane the noted secretary of state to king charles i      his honour wonne ith field lies here in dust     his honour got by grace shall never rust     the former fades the latter shall fade never     for why he was sr george once but st george ever  the date is 1679 when we reflect that the father of this personage must have had his taste formed in the punning court of james i and that the epitaph was composed at a time when our literature was stuffed with quaint or outoftheway thoughts it will seem not unlikely that the author prided himself upon what he might call a clever hit i mean his better affections were less occupied with the several associations belonging to the two ideas than his vanity delighted with that act of ingenuity by which they had been combined but the first couplet consists of a just thought naturally expressed and i should rather conclude the whole to be a work of honest simplicity and that the sense of worldly dignity associated with the title in a degree habitual to our ancestors but which at this time we can but feebly sympathize with and the imaginative feeling involvedviz the saintly and chivalrous name of the champion of england were unaffectedly linked together and that both were united and consolidated in the authors mind and in the minds of his contemporaries whom no doubt he had pleased by a devout contemplation of a happy immortality the reward of the just  at all events leaving this particular case undecided the general propriety of these notices cannot be doubted and i gladly avail myself of this opportunity to place in a clear view the power and majesty of impassioned faith whatever be its object to shew how it subjugates the lighter motions of the mind and sweeps away superficial difference in things and this i have done not to lower the witling and the worldling in their own esteem but with a wish to bring the ingenuous into still closer communion with those primary sensations of the human heart which are the vital springs of sublime and pathetic composition in this and in every other kind and as from these primary sensations such composition speaks so unless correspondent ones listen promptly and submissively in the inner cell of the mind to whom it is addressed the voice cannot be heard its highest powers are wasted  these suggestions may be further useful to establish a criterion of sincerity by which a writer may be judged and this is of high import for when a man is treating an interesting subject or one which he ought not to treat at all unless he be interested no faults have such a killing power as those which prove that he is not in earnest that he is acting a part has leisure for affectation and feels that without it he could do nothing this is one of the most odious of faults because it shocks the moral sense and is worse in a sepulchral inscription precisely in the same degree as that mode of composition calls for sincerity more urgently than any other and indeed where the internal evidence proves that the writer was moved in other words where this charm of sincerity lurks in the language of a tombstone and secretly pervades it there are no errors in style or manner for which it will not be in some degree a recompence but without habits of reflection a test of this inward simplicity cannot be come at and as i have said i am now writing with a hope to assist the welldisposed to attain it  let us take an instance where no one can be at a loss the following lines are said to have been written by the illustrious marquis of montrose with the point of his sword upon being informed of the death of his master charles i      great good and just could i but rate     my griefs and thy so rigid fate     id weep the world to such a strain     as it should deluge once again     but since thy loudtongued blood demands supplies     more from briareus hands than argus eyes     ill sing thy obsequies with trumpets sounds     and write thy epitaph with blood and wounds  these funereal verses would certainly be wholly out of their place upon a tombstone but who can doubt that the writer was transported to the height of the occasion that he was moved as it became an heroic soldier holding those principles and opinions to be moved his soul laboursthe most tremendous event in the history of the planetnamely the deluge is brought before his imagination by the physical image of tearsa connection awful from its very remoteness and from the slender band that unites the ideasit passes into the region of fable likewise for all modes of existence that forward his purpose are to be pressed into the service the whole is instinct with spirit and every word has its separate life like the chariot of the messiah and the wheels of that chariot as they appeared to the imagination of milton aided by that of the prophet ezekiel it had power to move of itself but was conveyed by cherubs                     with stars their bodies all     and wings were set with eyes with eyes the wheels     of beryl and careering fires between  compare with the above verses of montrose the following epitaph upon sir philip sidney which was formerly placed over his grave in st

hath been styled the worldmourned sidney so fondly did the admiration of his contemporaries settle upon him that the sudden removal of a man so good great and thoroughly accomplished wrought upon many even to repining and to the questioning the dispensations of providence yet he whom spenser and all the men of genius of his age had tenderly bemoaned is thus commemorated upon his tombstone and to add to the indignity the memorial is nothing more than the secondhand coat of a french commander it is a servile translation from a french epitaph which says weever was by some english wit happily imitated and ingeniously applied to the honour of our worthy chieftain yet weever in a foregoing paragraph thus expresses himself upon the same subject giving without his own knowledge in my opinion an example of the manner in which an epitaph ought to have been composed but i cannot pass over in silence sir philip sidney the elder brother being to use camdens words the glorious star of this family a lively pattern of virtue and the lovely joy of all the learned sort who fighting valiantly with the enemy before zutphen in geldesland dyed manfully this is that sidney whom as gods will was he should therefore be born into the world even to shew unto our age a sample of ancient virtues so his good pleasure was before any man looked for it to call for him again and take him out of the world as being more worthy of heaven than earth thus we may see perfect virtue suddenly vanisheth out of sight and the best men continue not long  there can be no need to analyse this simple effusion of the moment in order to contrast it with the laboured composition before given the difference will flash upon the reader at once but i may say it is not likely that such a frigid composition as the former would have ever been applied to a man whose death had so stirred up the hearts of his contemporaries if it had not been felt that something different from that nature which each man carried in his own breast was in his case requisite and that a certain straining of mind was inseparable from the subject accordingly an epitaph is adopted in which the writer had turned from the genuine affections and their selfforgetting inspirations to the end that his understanding or the faculty designated by the word head as opposed to heart might curiously construct a fabric to be wondered at hyperbole in the language of montrose is a mean instrument made mighty because wielded by an afflicted soul and strangeness is here the order of nature montrose stretched after remote things but was at the same time propelled towards them the french writer goes deliberately in search of them no wonder then if what he brings home does not prove worth the carriage  let us return to an instance of common life i quote it with reluctance not so much for its absurdity as that the expression in one place will strike at first sight as little less than impious and it is indeed though unintentionally so most irreverent but i know no other example that will so forcibly illustrate the important truth i wish to establish the following epitaph is to be found in a churchyard in westmoreland which the present writer has reason to think of with interest as it contains the remains of some of his ancestors and kindred the date is 1678      under this stone reader interd doth lye       beauty and virtues true epitomy     at her appearance the nooneson       blushd and shrunk in cause quite outdon     in her concentered did all graces dwell       god pluckd my rose that he might take a smel     ill say no more but weeping wish i may       soone with thy dear chaste ashes com to lay                                        sic efflevit maritus   can anything go beyond this in extravagance yet if the fundamental thoughts be translated into a natural style they will be found reasonable and affectingthe woman who lies here interred was in my eyes a perfect image of beauty and virtue she was to me a brighter object than the sun in heaven god took her who was my delight from this earth to bring her nearer to himself nothing further is worthy to be said than that weeping i wish soon to lie by thy dear chaste ashes thus did the husband pour out his tears  these verses are preceded by a brief account of the lady in latin prose in which the little that is said is the uncorrupted language of affection but without this introductory communication i should myself have had no doubt after recovering from the first shock of surprize and disapprobation that this man notwithstanding his extravagant expressions was a sincere mourner and that his heart during the very act of composition was moved these fantastic images though they stain the writing stained not her soulthey did not even touch it but hung like globules of rain suspended above a green leaf along which they may roll and leave no trace that they have passed over it this simplehearted man must have been betrayed by a common notion that what was natural in prose would be out of place in versethat it is not the muse which puts on the garb but the garb which makes the muse and having adopted this notion at a time when vicious writings of this kind accorded with the public taste it is probable that in the excess of his modesty the blankness of his inexperience and the intensity of his affection he thought that the further he wandered from nature in his language the more would he honour his departed consort who now appeared to him to have surpassed humanity in the excellence of her endowments the quality of his fault and its very excess are both in favour of this conclusion  let us contrast this epitaph with one taken from a celebrated writer of the last century       to the memory of lucy lyttleton daughter c who departed this      life c aged 20 having employed the short time assigned to her      here in the uniform practice of religion and virtue      made to engage all hearts and charm all eyes     though meek magnanimous though witty wise     polite as all her life in courts had been     yet good as she the world had never seen     the noble fire of an exalted mind     with gentle female tenderness combined     her speech was the melodious voice of love     her song the warbling of the vernal grove     her eloquence was sweeter than her song     soft as her heart and as her reason strong     her form each beauty of the mind expressd     her mind was virtue by the graces drest  the prose part of this inscription has the appearance of being intended for a tombstone but there is nothing in the verse that would suggest such a thought the composition is in the style of those laboured portraits in words which we sometimes see placed at the bottom of a print to fill up lines of expression which the bungling artist had left imperfect we know from other evidence that lord lyttleton dearly loved his wife he has indeed composed a monody to her memory which proves this and she was an amiable woman neither of which facts could have been gathered from these inscriptive verses this epitaph would derive little advantage from being translated into another style as the former was for there is no under current no skeleton or staminae of thought and feeling the reader will perceive at once that nothing in the heart of the writer had determined either the choice the order or the expression of the ideas that there is no interchange of action from within and from without that the connections are mechanical and arbitrary and the lowest kind of theseheart and eyes petty alliterations as meek and magnanimous witty and wise combined with oppositions in thoughts where there is no necessary or natural opposition then follow voice song eloquence form mindeach enumerated by a separate act as if the author had been making a catalogue raisonné  these defects run through the whole the only tolerable verse is      her speech was the melodious voice of love  observe the question is not which of these epitaphs is better or worse but which faults are of a worse kind in the former case we have a mourner whose soul is occupied by grief and urged forward by his admiration he deems in his simplicity that no hyperbole can transcend the perfections of her whom he has lost for the version which i have given fairly demonstrates that in spite of his outrageous expressions the under current of his thoughts was natural and pure we have therefore in him the example of a mind during the act of composition misled by false taste to the highest possible degree and in that of lord lyttleton we have one of a feeling heart not merely misled but wholly laid asleep by the same power lord lyttleton could not have written in this way upon such a subject if he had not been seduced by the example of pope whose sparkling and tuneful manner had bewitched the men of letters his contemporaries and corrupted the judgment of the nation through all ranks of society so that a great portion of original genius was necessary to embolden a man to write faithfully to nature upon any affecting subject if it belonged to a class of composition in which pope had furnished examples  i am anxious not to be misunderstood it has already been stated that in this species of composition above every other our sensations and judgments depend upon our opinion or feeling of the authors state of mind literature is here so far identified with morals the quality of the act so far determined by our notion of the aim and purpose of the agent that nothing can please us however well executed in its kind if we are persuaded that the primary virtues of sincerity earnestness and a moral interest in the main object are wanting insensibility here shocks us and still more so if manifested by a writer going wholly out of his way in search of supposed beauties which if he were truly moved he could set no value upon could not even think of we are struck in this case not merely with a sense of disproportion and unfitness but we cannot refrain from attributing no small part of his intellectual to a moral demerit and here the difficulties of the question begin namely in ascertaining what errors in the choice of or the mode of expressing the thoughts most surely indicate the want of that which is most indispensible bad taste whatever shape it may put on is injurious to the heart and the understanding if a man attaches much interest to the faculty of taste as it exists in himself and employs much time in those studies of which this faculty i use the word taste in its comprehensive though most unjustifiable sense is reckoned the arbiter certain it is his moral notions and dispositions must either be purified and strengthened or corrupted and impaired how can it be otherwise when his ability to enter into the spirit of works in literature must depend upon his feelings his imagination and his understanding that is upon his recipient upon his creative or active and upon his judging powers and upon the accuracy and compass of his knowledge in fine upon all that makes up the moral and intellectual man what is true of individuals is equally true of nations nevertheless a man called to a task in which he is not practised may have his expression thoroughly defiled and clogged by the style prevalent in his age yet still through the force of circumstances that have roused him his under feeling may remain strong and pure yet this may be wholly concealed from common view indeed the favourite style of different ages is so different and wanders so far from propriety that if it were not that first rate writers in all nations and tongues are governed by common principles we might suppose that truth and nature were things not to be looked for in books hence to an unpractised reader the productions of every age will present obstacles in various degrees hard to surmount a deformity of style not the worst in itself but of that kind with which he is least familiar will on the one hand be most likely to render him insensible to a pith and power which may be within and on the other hand he will be the least able to see through that sort of falsehood which is most prevalent in the works of his own time many of my readers to apply these general observations to the present case must have derived pleasure from the epitaph of lord lyttleton and no doubt will be startled at the comparison i have made but bring it to the test recommended it will then be found that its faults though not in degree so intolerable are in kind more radical and deadly than those of the strange composition with which it has been compared  the course which we have taken having brought us to the name of this distinguished writerpopei will in this place give a few observations upon his epitaphsthe largest collection we have in our language from the pen of any writer of eminence as the epitaphs of pope and also those of chiabrera which occasioned this dissertation are in metre it may be proper here to enquire how far the notion of a perfect epitaph as given in a former paper may be modified by the choice of metre for the vehicle in preference to prose if our opinions be just it is manifest that the basis must remain the same in either case and that the difference can only lie in the superstructure and it is equally plain that a judicious man will be less disposed in this case than in any other to avail himself of the liberty given by metre to adopt phrases of fancy or to enter into the more remote regions of illustrative imagery for the occasion of writing an epitaph is matteroffact in its intensity and forbids more authoritatively than any other species of composition all modes of fiction except those which the very strength of passion has created which have been acknowledged by the human heart and have become so familiar that they are converted into substantial realities when i come to the epitaphs of chiabrera i shall perhaps give instances in which i think he has not written under the impression of this truth where the poetic imagery does not elevate deepen or refine the human passion which it ought always to do or not to act at all but excludes it in a far greater degree are popes epitaphs debased by faults into which he could not i think have fallen if he had written in prose as a plain man and not as a metrical wit i will transcribe from popes epitaphs the one upon mrs corbet who died of a cancer dr johnson having extolled it highly and pronounced it the best of the collection      here rests a woman good without pretence     blest with plain reason and with sober sense     no conquest she but oer herself desird     no arts essayed but not to be admird     passion and pride were to her soul unknown     convincd that virtue only is our own     so unaffected so composd a mind     so firm yet soft so strong yet so refind     heaven as its purest gold by tortures tried     the saint sustaind it but the woman died  this may be the best of popes epitaphs but if the standard which we have fixed be a just one it cannot be approved of first it must be observed that in the epitaphs of this writer the true impulse is wanting and that his motions must of necessity be feeble for he has no other aim than to give a favourable portrait of the character of the deceased now mark the process by which this is performed nothing is represented implicitly that is with its accompaniment of circumstances or conveyed by its effects the author forgets that it is a living creature that must interest us and not an intellectual existence which a mere character is insensible to this distinction the brain of the writer is set at work to report as flatteringly as he may of the mind of his subject the good qualities are separately abstracted can it be otherwise than coldly and unfeelingly and put together again as coldly and unfeelingly the epitaph now before us owes what exemption it may have from these defects in its general plan to the excruciating disease of which the lady died but it is liable to the same censure and is like the rest further objectionable in this namely that the thoughts have their nature changed and moulded by the vicious expression in which they are entangled to an excess rendering them wholly unfit for the place they occupy      here rests a woman good without pretence     blest with plain reason  from which sober sense is not sufficiently distinguishable this verse and a half and the one so unaffected so composed a mind are characteristic and the expression is true to nature but they are if i may take the liberty of saying it the only parts of the epitaph which have this merit minute criticism is in its nature irksome and as commonly practiced in books and conversation is both irksome and injurious yet every mind must occasionally be exercised in this discipline else it cannot learn the art of bringing words rigorously to the test of thoughts and these again to a comparison with things their archetypes contemplated first in themselves and secondly in relation to each other in all which processes the mind must be skilful otherwise it will be perpetually imposed upon in the next couplet the word conquest is applied in a manner that would have been displeasing even from its triteness in a copy of complimentary verses to a fashionable beauty but to talk of making conquests in an epitaph is not to be endured no arts essayed but not to be admiredare words expressing that she had recourse to artifices to conceal her amiable and admirable qualities and the context implies that there was a merit in this which surely no sane mind would allow but the meaning of the author simply and honestly given was nothing more than that she shunned admiration probably with a more apprehensive modesty than was common and more than this would have been inconsistent with the praise bestowed upon herthat she had an unaffected mind this couplet is further objectionable because the sense of love and peaceful admiration which such a character naturally inspires is disturbed by an oblique and illtimed stroke of satire she is not praised so much as others are blamed and is degraded by the author in thus being made a covert or stalkinghorse for gratifying a propensity the most abhorrent from her own naturepassion and pride were to her soul unknown it cannot be meant that she had no passions but that they were moderate and kept in subordination to her reason but the thought is not here expressed nor is it clear that a conviction in the understanding that virtue only is our own though it might suppress her pride would be itself competent to govern or abate many other affections and passions to which our frail nature is and ought in various degrees to be subject in fact the author appears to have had no precise notion of his own meaning if she was good without pretence it seems unnecessary to say that she was not proud dr johnson making an exception of the verse convinced that virtue only is our own praises this epitaph for containing nothing taken from common places now in fact as may be deduced from the principles of this discourse it is not only no fault but a primary requisite in an epitaph that it shall contain thoughts and feelings which are in their substance commonplace and even trite it is grounded upon the universal intellectual property of mansensations which all men have felt and feel in some degree daily and hourlytruths whose very interest and importance have caused them to be unattended to as things which could take care of themselves but it is required that these truths should be instinctively ejaculated or should rise irresistibly from circumstances in a word that they should be uttered in such connection as shall make it felt that they are not adopted not spoken by rote but perceived in their whole compass with the freshness and clearness of an original intuition the writer must introduce the truth with such accompaniment as shall imply that he has mounted to the sources of things penetrated the dark cavern from which the river that murmurs in every ones ear has flowed from generation to generation the line virtue only is our ownis objectionable not from the commonplaceness of the truth but from the vapid manner in which it is conveyed a similar sentiment is expressed with appropriate dignity in an epitaph by chiabrera where he makes the archbishop of albino say of himself that he was               smitten by the great ones of the world     but did not fall for virtue braves all shocks     upon herself resting immoveably  so firm yet soft so strong yet so refined these intellectual operations while they can be conceived of as operations of intellect at all for in fact one half of the process is mechanical words doing their own work and one half of the line manufacturing the rest remind me of the motions of a posturemaster or of a man balancing a sword upon his finger which must be kept from falling at all hazards the saint sustained it but the woman died let us look steadily at this antithesis the saint that is her soul strengthened by religion supported the anguish of her disease with patience and resignation but the woman that is her body for if anything else is meant by the word woman it contradicts the former part of the proposition and the passage is nonsense was overcome why was not this simply expressed without playing with the readers fancy to the delusion and dishonour of his understanding by a trifling epigramatic point but alas ages must pass away before men will have their eyes open to the beauty and majesty of truth and will be taught to venerate poetry no further than as she is a handmaid pure as her mistressthe noblest handmaid in her train     c celebrated epitaphs considered from the authors mss  i vindicate the rights and dignity of nature and as long as i condemn nothing without assigning reasons not lightly given i cannot suffer any individual however highly and deservedly honoured by my countrymen to stand in my way if my notions are right the epitaphs of pope cannot well be too severely condemned for not only are they almost wholly destitute of those universal feelings and simple movements of mind which we have called for as indispensible but they are little better than a tissue of false thoughts languid and vague expressions unmeaning antithesis and laborious attempts at discrimination popes mind had been employed chiefly in observation upon the vices and follies of men now vice and folly are in contradiction with the moral principle which can never be extinguished in the mind and therefore wanting the contrast are irregular capricious and inconsistent with themselves if a man has once said see friend no evil be thou my good and has acted accordingly however strenuous may have been his adherence to this principle it will be well known by those who have had an opportunity of observing him narrowly that there have been perpetual obliquities in his course evil passions thwarting each other in various ways and now and then revivals of his better nature which check him for a short time or lead him to remeasure his stepsnot to speak of the various necessities of counterfeiting virtue which the furtherance of his schemes will impose upon him and the division which will be consequently introduced into his nature  it is reasonable then that cicero when holding up catiline to detestation and without going to such an extreme case that dryden and pope when they are describing characters like buckingham shaftsbury and the duchess of marlborough should represent qualities and actions at war with each other and with themselves and that the page should be suitably crowded with antithetical expressions but all this argues an obtuse moral sensibility and a consequent want of knowledge if applied where virtue ought to be described in the language of affectionate admiration in the mind of the truly great and good everything that is of importance is at peace with itself all is stillness sweetness and stable grandeur accordingly the contemplation of virtue is attended with repose a lovely quality if its loveliness be clearly perceived fastens the mind with absolute sovereignty upon itself permitting or inciting it to pass by smooth gradation or gentle transition to some other kindred quality thus a perfect image of meekness i refer to an instance before given when looked at by a tender mind in its happiest mood might easily lead on to thoughts of magnanimity for assuredly there is nothing incongruous in those virtues but the mind would not then be separated from the person who is the object of its thoughts it would still be confined to that person or to others of the same general character that is would be kept within the circle of qualities which range themselves quietly by each others sides whereas when meekness and magnanimity are represented antithetically the mind is not only carried from the main object but is compelled to turn to a subject in which the quality exists divided from some other as noble its natural ally a painful feeling that checks the course of love and repels the sweet thoughts that might be settling round the person whom it was the authors wish to endear to us but for whom after this interruption we no longer care if then a man whose duty it is to praise departed excellence not without some sense of regret or sadness to do this or to be silent should upon all occasions exhibit that mode of connecting thoughts which is only natural while we are delineating vice under certain relations we may be assured that the nobler sympathies are not alive in him that he has no clear insight into the internal constitution of virtue nor has himself been soothed cheared harmonized by those outward effects which follow everywhere her goingsdeclaring the presence of the invisible deity and though it be true that the most admirable of them must fall far short of perfection and that the majority of those whose work is commemorated upon their tombstones must have been persons in whom good and evil were intermixed in various proportions and stood in various degrees of opposition to each other yet the reader will remember what has been said before upon that medium of love sorrow and admiration through which a departed friend is viewed how it softens down or removes these harshnesses and contradictions which moreover must be supposed never to have been grievous for there can be no true love but between the good and no epitaph ought to be written upon a bad man except for a warning  the purpose of the remarks given in the last essay was chiefly to assist the reader in separating truth and sincerity from falsehood and affectation presuming that if the unction of a devout heart be wanting everything else is of no avail it was shewn that a current of just thought and feeling may flow under a surface of illustrative imagery so impure as to produce an effect the opposite of that which was intended yet though this fault may be carried to an intolerable degree the reader will have gathered that in our estimation it is not in kind the most offensive and injurious we have contrasted it in its excess with instances where the genuine current or vein was wholly wanting where the thoughts and feelings had no vital union but were artificially connected or formally accumulated in a manner that would imply discontinuity and feebleness of mind upon any occasion but still more reprehensible here  i will proceed to give milder examples not in this last kind but in the former namely of failure from various causes where the groundwork is good      take holy earth all that my soul holds dear     take that best gift which heaven so lately gave     to bristols fount i bore with trembling care     her faded form she bowd to taste the wave     and died does youth does beauty read the line     does sympathetic fear their breasts alarm     speak dead maria breathe a strain divine     even from the grave thou shalt have power to charm     bid them in dutys sphere as meekly move     and if so fair from vanity as free     as firm in friendship and as fond in love     tell them tho tis an awful thing to die     twas een to thee yet the dread path once trod     heaven lifts its everlasting portals high     and bids the pure in heart behold their god  this epitaph has much of what we have demanded but it is debased in some instances by weakness of expression in others by false prettiness she bowd to taste the wave and died the plain truth was she drank the bristol waters which failed to restore her and her death soon followed but the expression involves a multitude of petty occupations for the fancy she bowd was there any truth in this to taste the wave the water of a mineral spring which must have been drunk out of a goblet strange application of the word wave and died this would have been a just expression if the water had killed her but as it is the tender thought involved in the disappointment of a hope however faint is left unexpressed and a shock of surprise is given entertaining perhaps to a light fancy but to a steady mind unsatisfactory because false speak dead maria breathe a strain divine this sense flows nobly from the heart and the imagination but perhaps it is not one of those impassioned thoughts which should be fixed in language upon a sepulchral stone it is in its nature too poignant and transitory a husband meditating by his wifes grave would throw off such a feeling and would give voice to it and it would be in its place in a monody to her memory but if i am not mistaken ought to have been suppressed here or uttered after a different manner the implied impersonation of the deceased according to the tenor of what has before been said ought to have been more general and shadowy      and if so fair from vanity as free     as firm in friendship and as fond in love     tell them  these are two sweet verses but the word fair is improper for unquestionably it was not intended that their title to receive this assurance should depend at all upon their personal beauty moreover in this couplet and in what follows the long suspension of the sense excites the expectation of a thought less common than the concluding one and is an instance of a failure in doing what is most needful and most difficult in an epitaph to do namely to give to universally received truths a pathos and spirit which shall readmit them into the soul like revelations of the moment  i have said that this excellence is difficult to attain and why is it because nature is weak no where the soul has been thoroughly stricken and heaven knows the course of life must have placed all men at some time or other in that condition there is never a want of positive strength but because the adversary of nature call that adversary art or by what name you will is comparatively strong the farsearching influence of the power which for want of a better name we will denominate taste is in nothing more evinced than in the changeful character and complexion of that species of composition which we have been reviewing upon a call so urgent it might be expected that the affections the memory and the imagination would be constrained to speak their genuine language yet if the few specimens which have been given in the course of this enquiry do not demonstrate the fact the reader need only look into any collection of epitaphs to be convinced that the faults predominant in the literature of every age will be as strongly reflected in the sepulchral inscriptions as any where nay perhaps more so from the anxiety of the author to do justice to the occasion and especially if the composition be in verse for then it comes more avowedly in the shape of a work of art and of course is more likely to be coloured by the work of art holden in most esteem at the time in a bulky volume of poetry entitled elegant extracts in verse which must be known to most of my readers as it is circulated everywhere and in fact constitutes at this day the poetical library of our schools i find a number of epitaphs in verse of the last century and there is scarcely one which is not thoroughly tainted by the artifices which have overrun our writings in metre since the days of dryden and pope energy stillness grandeur tenderness those feelings which are the pure emanations of nature those thoughts which have the infinitude of truth and those expressions which are not what the garb is to the body but what the body is to the soul themselves a constituent part and power or function in the thoughtall these are abandoned for their oppositesas if our countrymen through successive generations had lost the sense of solemnity and pensiveness not to speak of deeper emotions and resorted to the tombs of their forefathers and contemporaries only to be tickled and surprised would we not recoil from such gratification in such a place if the general literature of the country had not cooperated with other causes insidiously to weaken our sensibilities and deprave our judgments doubtless there are shocks of event and circumstance public and private by which for all minds the truths of nature will be elicited but sorrow for that individual or people to whom these special interferences are necessary to bring them into communion with the inner spirit of things for such intercourse must be profitless in proportion as it is unfrequently irregular and transient words are too awful an instrument for good and evil to be trifled with they hold above all other external powers a dominion over thoughts if words be not recurring to a metaphor before used an incarnation of the thought but only a clothing for it then surely will they prove an ill gift such a one as those possessed vestments read of in the stories of superstitious times which had power to consume and to alienate from his right mind the victim who put them on language if it do not uphold and feed and leave in quiet like the power of gravitation or the air we breathe is a counterspirit unremittingly and noiselessly at work to subvert to lay waste to vitiate and to dissolve from a deep conviction then that the excellence of writing whether in prose or verse consists in a conjunction of reason and passion a conjunction which must be of necessity benign and that it might be deduced from what has been said that the taste intellectual power and morals of a country are inseparably linked in mutual dependence i have dwelt thus long upon this argument and the occasion justifies me for how could the tyranny of bad taste be brought home to the mind more aptly than by showing in what degree the feelings of nature yield to it when we are rendering to our friends the solemn testimony of our love more forcibly than by giving proof that thoughts cannot even upon this impulse assume an outward life without a transmutation and a fall       epitaph on miss drummond in the church of broadsworth yorkshire      mason      here sleeps what once was beauty once was grace     grace that with tenderness and sense combind     to form that harmony of soul and face     where beauty shines the mirror of the mind     such was the maid that in the morn of youth     in virgin innocence in natures pride     blest with each art that owes its charm to truth     sunk in her fathers fond embrace and died     he weeps o venerate the holy tear     faith lends her aid to ease afflictions load     the parent mourns his child upon the bier     the christian yields an angel to his god  the following is a translation from the latin communicated to a lady in her childhood and by her preserved in memory i regret that i have not seen the original        she is gonemy beloved daughter eliza is gone           fair cheerful benign my child is gone       thee long to be regretted a father mourns     regrettedbut thanks to the most perfect god not lost           for a happier age approaches       when again my child i shall behold

epitaphs is very far from being the worst of its kind and on that account i have placed the two in contrast unquestionably as the father in the latter speaks in his own person the situation is much more pathetic but making due allowance for this advantage who does not here feel a superior truth and sanctity which is not dependent upon this circumstance but merely the result of the expression and the connection of the thoughts i am not so fortunate as to have any knowledge of the author of this affecting composition but i much fear if he had called in the assistance of english verse the better to convey his thoughts such sacrifices would from various influences have been made even by him that though he might have excited admiration in thousands he would have truly moved no one the latter part of the following by gray is almost the only instance among the metrical epitaphs in our language of the last century which i remember of affecting thoughts rising naturally and keeping themselves pure from vicious diction and therefore retaining their appropriate power over the mind      epitaph on mrs clark     lo where the silent marble weeps     a friend a wife a mother sleeps     a heart within whose sacred cell     the peaceful virtues lovd to dwell     affection warm and love sincere     and soft humanity were there     in agony in death resigned     she felt the wound she left behind     her infant image here below     sits smiling on a fathers woe     whom what awaits while yet he strays     along the lonely vale of days     a pang to secret sorrow dear     a sigh an unavailing tear     till time shall every grief remove     with life with meaning and with love  i have been speaking of faults which are aggravated by temptations thrown in the way of modern writers when they compose in metre the first six lines of this epitaph are vague and languid more so than i think would have been possible had it been written in prose yet gray who was so happy in the remaining part especially the last four lines has grievously failed in prose upon a subject which it might have been expected would have bound him indissolubly to the propriety of nature and comprehensive reason i allude to the conclusion of the epitaph upon his mother where he says she was the careful tender mother of many children one of whom alone had the misfortune to survive her this is a searching thought but wholly out of place had it been said of an idiot of a palsied child or of an adult from any cause dependent upon his mother to a degree of helplessness which nothing but maternal tenderness and watchfulness could answer that he had the misfortune to survive his mother the thought would have been just the same might also have been wrung from any man thinking of himself when his soul was smitten with compunction or remorse through the consciousness of a misdeed from which he might have been preserved as he hopes or believes by his mothers prudence by her anxious care if longer continued or by the reverential fear of offending or disobeying her but even then unless accompanied with a detail of extraordinary circumstances if transferred to her monument it would have been misplaced as being too peculiar and for reasons which have been before alleged namely as too transitory and poignant but in an ordinary case for a man permanently and conspicuously to record that this was his fixed feeling what is it but to run counter to the course of nature which has made it matter of expectation and congratulation that parents should die before their children what is it if searched to the bottom but lurking and sickly selfishness does not the regret include a wish that the mother should have survived all her offspring have witnessed that bitter desolation where the order of things is disturbed and inverted and finally does it not withdraw the attention of the reader from the subject to the author of the memorial as one to be commiserated for his strangely unhappy condition or to be condemned for the morbid constitution of his feelings or for his deficiency in judgment a fault of the same kind though less in degree is found in the epitaph of pope upon harcourt of whom it is said that he never gave his father grief but when he died i need not point out how many situations there are in which such an expression of feeling would be natural and becoming but in a permanent inscription things only should be admitted that have an enduring place in the mind and a nice selection is required even among these the duke of ormond said of his son ossory that he preferred his dead son to any living son in christendoma thought which to adopt an expression used before has the infinitude of truth but though in this there is no momentary illusion nothing fugitive it would still have been unbecoming had it been placed in open view over the sons grave inasmuch as such expression of it would have had an ostentatious air and would have implied a disparagement of others the sublimity of the sentiment consists in its being the secret possession of the father  having been engaged so long in the ungracious office of sitting in judgment where i have found so much more to censure than to approve though wherever it was in my power i have placed good by the side of evil that the reader might intuitively receive the truths which i wished to communicate i now turn back with pleasure to chiabrera of whose productions in this department the reader of the friend may be enabled to form a judgment who has attentively perused the few specimens only which have been given an epitaph says weever is a superscription either in verse or prose or an astrict pithic diagram writ carved or engraven upon the tomb grave or sepulchre of the defunct briefly declaring and that with a kind of commiseration the name the age the deserts the dignities the state the praises both of body and minde the good and bad fortunes in the life and the manner and time of the death of the person therein interred this account of an epitaph which as far as it goes is just was no doubt taken by weever from the monuments of our own country and it shews that in his conception an epitaph was not to be an abstract character of the deceased but an epitomized biography blended with description by which an impression of the character was to be conveyed bring forward the one incidental expression a kind of commiseration unite with it a concern on the part of the dead for the wellbeing of the living made known by exhortation and admonition and let this commiseration and concern pervade and brood over the whole so that what was peculiar to the individual shall still be subordinate to a sense of what he had in common with the species our notion of a perfect epitaph would then be realized and it pleases me to say that this is the very model upon which those of chiabrera are for the most part framed observe how exquisitely this is exemplified in the one beginning pause courteous stranger balbi supplicates given in the friend some weeks ago the subject of the epitaph is introduced intreating not directly in his own person but through the mouth of the author that according to the religious belief of his country a prayer for his soul might be preferred to the redeemer of the world placed in counterpoize with this right which he has in common with all the dead his individual earthly accomplishments appear light to his funeral biographer as they did to the person of whom he speaks when alive nor could chiabrera have ventured to touch upon them but under the sanction of this persons acknowledgment he then goes on to say how various and profound was his learning and how deep a hold it took upon his affections but that he weaned himself from these things as vanities and was devoted in later life exclusively to the divine truths of the gospel as the only knowledge in which he could find perfect rest here we are thrown back upon the introductory supplication and made to feel its especial propriety in this case his life was long and every part of it bore appropriate fruits urbina his birthplace might be proud of him and the passenger who was entreated to pray for his soul has a wish breathed for his welfare this composition is a perfect whole there is nothing arbitrary or mechanical but it is an organized body of which the members are bound together by a common life and are all justly proportioned if i had not gone so much into detail i should have given further instances of chiabreras epitaphs but i must content myself with saying that if he had abstained from the introduction of heathen mythology of which he is lavishan inexcusable fault for an inhabitant of a christian country yet admitting of some palliation in an italian who treads classic soil and has before his eyes the ruins of the temples which were dedicated to those fictitious beings of objects of worship by the majestic people his ancestorshad omitted also some uncharacteristic particulars and had not on some occasions forgotten that truth is the soul of passion he would have left his readers little to regret i do not mean to say that higher and nobler thoughts may not be found in sepulchral inscriptions than his contain but he understood his work the principles upon which he composed are just the reader of the friend has had proofs of this one shall be given of his mixed manner exemplifying some of the points in which he has erred      o lelius beauteous flower of gentleness     the fair anglaias friend above all friends     o darling of the fascinating loves     by what dire envy moved did death uproot     thy days eer yet full blown and what ill chance     hath robbed savona of her noblest grace     she weeps for thee and shall for ever weep     and if the fountain of her tears should fail     she would implore sabete to supply     her need sabete sympathizing stream     who on his margin saw thee close thine eyes     on the chaste bosom of thy lady dear     ah what do riches what does youth avail     dust are our hopes i weeping did inscribe     in bitterness thy monument and pray     of every gentle spirit bitterly     to read the record with as copious tears  this epitaph is not without some tender thoughts but a comparison of it with the one upon the youthful pozzobonelli see friend no will more clearly shew that chiabrera has here neglected to ascertain whether the passions expressed were in kind and degree a dispensation of reason or at least commodities issued under her licence and authority  the epitaphs of chiabrera are twentynine in number all of them save two probably little known at this day in their own country and scarcely at all beyond the limits of it and the reader is generally made acquainted with the moral and intellectual excellence which distinguished them by a brief history of the course of their lives or a selection of events and circumstances and thus they are individualized but in the two other instances namely those of tasso and raphael he enters into no particulars but contents himself with four lines expressing one sentiment upon the principle laid down in the former part of this discourse where the subject of an epitaph is a man of prime note      torquato tasso rests within this tomb     this figure weeping from her inmost heart     is poesy from such impassioned grief     let every one conclude what this man was  the epitaph which chiabrera composed for himself has also an appropriate brevity and is distinguished for its grandeur the sentiment being the same as that which the reader has before seen so happily enlarged upon  as i am brought back to men of first rate distinction and public benefactors i cannot resist the pleasure of transcribing the metrical part of an epitaph which formerly was inscribed in the church of st pauls to that bishop of london who prevailed with william the conqueror to secure to the inhabitants of the city all the liberties and privileges which they had enjoyed in the time of edward the confessor      these marble monuments to thee thy citizens assigne     rewards o father farre unfit to those deserts of thine     thee unto them a faithful friend thy london people found     and to this towne of no small weight a stay both sure and sound     their liberties restorde to them by means of thee have beene     their publicke weale by means of thee large gifts have felt and seene     thy riches stocke and beauty brave one hour hath them supprest     yet these thy virtues and good deeds with us for ever rest  thus have i attempted to determine what a sepulchral inscription ought to be and taken at the same time a survey of what epitaphs are good and bad and have shewn to what deficiencies in sensibility and to what errors in taste and judgement most commonly are to be ascribed it was my intention to have given a few specimens from those of the ancients but i have already i fear taken up too much of the readers time i have not animadverted upon such alas far too numerous as are reprehensible from the want of moral rectitude in those who have composed them or given it to be understood that they should he so composed boastful and haughty panegyrics ludicrously contradicting the solid remembrance of those who knew the deceased shocking the common sense of mankind by their extravagance and affronting the very altar with their impious falsehood those i leave to general scorn not however without a general recommendation that they who have offended or may be disposed to offend in this manner would take into serious thought the heinousness of their transgression  upon reviewing what has been written i think it better here to add a few favourable specimens such as are ordinarily found in our country churchyards at this day if those primary sensations upon which i have dwelt so much be not stifled in the heart of the reader they will be read with pleasure otherwise neither these nor more exalted strains can by him be truly interpreted      aged 87 and 83      not more with silver hairs than virtue crownd     the good old pair take up this spot of ground     tread in their steps and you will surely find     their rest above below their peace of mind                                           at the last day im sure i shall appear     to meet with jesus christ my saviour dear     where i do hope to live with him in bliss     oh what a joy at my last hour was this                                           aged 3 months      what christ said once he said to all     come unto me ye children small     none shall do you any wrong     for to my kingdom you belong                                           aged 10 weeks      the babe was sucking at the breast     when god did call him to his rest   in an obscure corner of a country churchyard i once espied half overgrown with hemlock and nettles a very small stone laid upon the ground bearing nothing more than the name of the deceased with the date of birth and death importing that it was an infant which had been born one day and died the following i know not how far the reader may be in sympathy with me but more awful thoughts of rights conferred of hopes awakened of remembrances stealing away or vanishing were imparted to my mind by that inscription there before my eyes than by any other that it has ever been my lot to meet with upon a tombstone  the most numerous class of sepulchral inscriptions do indeed record nothing else but the name of the buried person but that he was born upon one day and died upon another addison in the spectator making this observation says that he cannot look upon those registers of existence whether of brass or marble but as a kind of satire upon the departed persons who had left no other memorial of them than that they were born and that they died in certain moods of mind this is a natural reflection yet not perhaps the most salutary which the appearance might give birth to as in these registers the name is mostly associated with others of the same family this is a prolonged companionship however shadowy even a tomb like this is a shrine to which the fancies of a scattered family may return in pilgrimage the thoughts of the individuals without any communication with each other must oftentimes meet here such a frail memorial then is not without its tendency to keep families together it feeds also local attachment which is the taproot of the tree of patriotism  i know not how i can withdraw more satisfactorily from this long disquisition than by offering to the reader as a farewell memorial the following verses suggested to me by a concise epitaph which i met with some time ago in one of the most retired vales among the mountains of westmoreland there is nothing in the detail of the poem which is not either founded upon the epitaph or gathered from enquiries concerning the deceased made in the neighbourhood      beneath that pine which rears its dusky head     aloft and covered by a plain blue stone     briefly inscribed a gentle dalesman lies     from whom in early childhood was withdrawn     the precious gift of hearing he grew up     from year to year in loneliness of soul     and this deep mountain valley was to him     soundless with all its streams the bird of dawn     did never rouse this cottager from sleep     with startling summons not for his delight     the vernal cuckoo shouted not for him     murmured the labouring bee when stormy winds     were working the broad bosom of the lake     into a thousand thousand sparkling waves     rocking the trees or driving cloud on cloud     along the sharp edge of yon lofty crags     the agitated scene before his eye     was silent as a picture evermore     were all things silent wheresoeer he moved     yet by the solace of his own calm thoughts     upheld he duteously pursued the round     of rural labours the steep mountain side     ascended with his staff and faithful dog     the plough he guided and the scythe he swayed     and the ripe corn before his sickle fell     among the jocund reapers for himself     all watchful and industrious as he was     he wrought not neither field nor flock he owned     no wish for wealth had place within his mind     no husbands love nor fathers hope or care     though born a younger brother need was none     that from the floor of his paternal home     he should depart to plant himself anew     and when mature in manhood he beheld     his parents laid in earth no loss ensued     of rights to him but he remained well pleased     by the pure bond of independent love     an inmate of a second family     the fellowlabourer and friend of him     to whom the small inheritance had fallen     nor deem that his mild presence was a weight     that pressed upon his brothers house for books     were ready comrades whom he could not tire     of whose society the blameless man     was never satiate their familiar voice     even to old age with unabated charm     beguiled his leisure hours refreshed his thoughts     beyond its natural elevation raised     his introverted spirit and bestowed     upon his life an outward dignity     which all acknowledged the dark winter night     the stormy day had each its own resource     song of the muses sage historic tale     science severe or word of holy writ     announcing immortality and joy     to the assembled spirits of the just     from imperfection and decay secure     thus soothed at home thus busy in the field     to no perverse suspicion he gave way     no languour peevishness nor vain complaint     and they who were about him did not fail     in reverence or in courtesy they prized     his gentle manners and his peaceful smiles     the gleams of his slowvarying countenance     were met with answering sympathy and love        at length when sixty years and five were told     a slow disease insensibly consumed     the powers of nature and a few short steps     of friends and kindred bore him from his home     yon cottage shaded by the woody cross     to the profounder stillness of the grave     nor was his funeral denied the grace     of many tears virtuous and thoughtful grief     heartsorrow rendered sweet by gratitude     and now that monumental stone preserves     his name and unambitiously relates     how long and by what kindly outward aids     and in what pure contentedness of mind     the sad privation was by him endured     and yon tall pinetree whose composing sound     was wasted on the good mans living ear     hath now its own peculiar sanctity     and at the touch of every wandering breeze     murmurs not idly oer his peaceful grave     iii

division see preface in vol i g     a of the principles of poetry and the lyrical ballads 17981802   the first volume of these poems has already been submitted to general perusal it was published as an experiment which i hoped might be of some use to ascertain how far by fitting to metrical arrangement a selection of the real language of men in a state of vivid sensation that sort of pleasure and that quantity of pleasure may be imparted which a poet may rationally endeavour to impart  i had formed no very inaccurate estimate of the probable effect of those poems i flattered myself that they who should be pleased with them would read them with more than common pleasure and on the other hand i was well aware that by those who should dislike them they would be read with more than common dislike the result has differed from my expectation in this only that a greater number have been pleased than i ventured to hope i should please                                       several of my friends are anxious for the success of these poems from a belief that if the views with which they were composed were indeed realised a class of poetry would be produced well adapted to interest mankind permanently and not unimportant in the quality and in the multiplicity of its moral relations and on this account they have advised me to prefix a systematic defence of the theory upon which the poems were written but i was unwilling to undertake the task knowing that on this occasion the reader would look coldly upon my arguments since i might be suspected of having been principally influenced by the selfish and foolish hope of reasoning him into an approbation of these particular poems and i was still more unwilling to undertake the task because adequately to display the opinions and fully to enforce the arguments would require a space wholly disproportionate to a preface for to treat the subject with the clearness and coherence of which it is susceptible it would be necessary to give a full account of the present state of the public taste in this country and to determine how far this taste is healthy or depraved which again could not be determined without pointing out in what manner language and the human mind act and react on each other and without retracing the revolutions not of literature alone but likewise of society itself i have therefore altogether declined to enter regularly upon this defence yet i am sensible that there would be something like impropriety in abruptly obtruding upon the public without a few words of introduction poems so materially different from those upon which general approbation is at present bestowed  it is supposed that by the act of writing in verse an author makes a formal engagement that he will gratify certain known habits of association that he not only thus apprises the reader that certain classes of ideas and expressions will be found in his book but that others will be carefully excluded this exponent or symbol held forth by metrical language must in different eras of literature have excited very different expectations for example in the age of catullus terence and lucretius and that of statius or claudian and in our own country in the age of shakspeare and beaumont and fletcher and that of donne and cowley or dryden or pope i will not take upon me to determine the exact import of the promise which by the act of writing in verse an author in the present day makes to his reader but it will undoubtedly appear to many persons that i have not fulfilled the terms of an engagement thus voluntarily contracted they who have been accustomed to the gaudiness and inane phraseology of many modern writers if they persist in reading this book to its conclusion will no doubt frequently have to struggle with feelings of strangeness and awkwardness they will look round for poetry and will be induced to inquire by what species of courtesy these attempts can be permitted to assume that title i hope therefore the reader will not censure me for attempting to state what i have proposed to myself to perform and also as far as the limits of a preface will permit to explain some of the chief reasons which have determined me in the choice of my purpose that at least he may be spared any unpleasant feeling of disappointment and that i myself may be protected from one of the most dishonourable accusations which can be brought against an author namely that of an indolence which prevents him from endeavouring to ascertain what is his duty or when his duty is ascertained prevents him from performing it  the principal object then proposed in these poems was to choose incidents and situations from common life and to relate or describe them throughout as far as was possible in a selection of language really used by men and at the same time to throw over them a certain colouring of imagination whereby ordinary things should be presented to the mind in an unusual aspect and further and above all to make these incidents and situations interesting by tracing in them truly though not ostentatiously the primary laws of our nature chiefly as far as regards the manner in which we associate ideas in a state of excitement humble and rustic life was generally chosen because in that condition the essential passions of the heart find a better soil in which they can attain their maturity are less under restraint and speak a plainer and more emphatic language because in that condition of life our elementary feelings coexist in a state of greater simplicity and consequently may be more accurately contemplated and more forcibly communicated because the manners of rural life germinate from those elementary feelings and from the necessary character of rural occupations are more easily comprehended and are more durable and lastly because in that condition the passions of men are incorporated with the beautiful and permanent forms of nature the language too of these men has been adopted purified indeed from what appear to be its real defects from all lasting and rational causes of dislike or disgust because such men hourly communicate with the best objects from which the best part of language is originally derived and because from their rank in society and the sameness and narrow circle of their intercourse being less under the influence of social vanity they convey their feelings and notions in simple and unelaborated expressions accordingly such a language arising out of repeated experience and regular feelings is a more permanent and a far more philosophical language than that which is frequently substituted for it by poets who think that they are conferring honour upon themselves and their art in proportion as they separate themselves from the sympathies of men and indulge in arbitrary and capricious habits of expression in order to furnish food for fickle tastes and fickle appetites of their own creation8  i cannot however be insensible to the present outcry against the triviality and meanness both of thought and language which some of my contemporaries have occasionally introduced into their metrical compositions and i acknowledge that this defect where it exists is more dishonourable to the writers own character than false refinement or arbitrary innovation though i should contend at the same time that it is far less pernicious in the sum of its consequences from such verses the poems in these volumes will be found distinguished at least by one mark of difference that each of them has a worthy purpose not that i always began to write with a distinct purpose formally conceived but habits of meditation have i trust so prompted and regulated my feelings that my descriptions of such objects as strongly excite those feelings will be found to carry along with them a purpose if this opinion be erroneous i can have little right to name of a poet for all good poetry is the spontaneous overflow of powerful feelings and though this be true poems to which any value can be attached were never produced on any variety of subjects but by a man who being possessed of more than usual organic sensibility had also thought long and deeply for our continued influxes of feeling are modified and directed by our thoughts which are indeed the representatives of all our past feelings and as by contemplating the relation of these general representatives to each other we discover what is really important to men so by the repetition and continuance of this act our feelings will be connected with important subjects till at length if we be originally possessed of much sensibility such habits of mind will be produced that by obeying blindly and mechanically the impulses of those habits we shall describe objects and utter sentiments of such a nature and in such connection with each other that the understanding of the reader must necessarily be in some degree enlightened and his affections strengthened and purified  8 it is worth while here to observe that the affecting parts of chaucer are almost always expressed in language pure and universally intelligible even to this day  it has been said that each of these poems has a purpose another circumstance must be mentioned which distinguishes these poems from the popular poetry of the day it is this that the feeling therein developed gives importance to the action and situation and not the action and situation to the feeling  a sense of false modesty shall not prevent me from asserting that the readers attention is pointed to this mark of distinction far less for the sake of these particular poems than from the general importance of the subject the subject is indeed important for the human mind is capable of being excited without the application of gross and violent stimulants and he must have a very faint perception of its beauty and dignity who does not know this and who does not further know that one being is elevated above another in proportion as he possesses this capability it has therefore appeared to me that to endeavour to produce or enlarge this capability is one of the best services in which at any period a writer can be engaged but this service excellent at all times is especially so at the present day for a multitude of causes unknown to former times are now acting with a combined force to blunt the discriminating powers of the mind and unfitting it for all voluntary exertion to reduce it to a state of almost savage torpor the most effective of these causes are the great national events which are daily taking place and the increasing accumulation of men in cities where the uniformity of their occupations produces a craving for extraordinary incident which the rapid communication of intelligence hourly gratifies to this tendency of life and manners the literature and theatrical exhibitions of the country have conformed themselves the invaluable works of our elder writers i had almost said the works of shakspeare and milton are driven into neglect by frantic novels sickly and stupid german tragedies and deluges of idle and extravagant stories in versewhen i think upon this degrading thirst after outrageous stimulation i am almost ashamed to have spoken of the feeble endeavour made in these volumes to counteract it and reflecting upon the magnitude of the general evil i should be oppressed with no dishonourable melancholy had i not a deep impression of certain inherent and indestructible qualities of the human mind and likewise of certain powers in the great and permanent objects that act upon it which are equally inherent and indestructible and were there not added to this impression a belief that the time is approaching when the evil will be systematically opposed by men of greater powers and with far more distinguished success  having dwelt thus long on the subjects and aim of these poems i shall request the readers permission to apprise him of a few circumstances relating to their style in order among other reasons that he may not censure me for not having performed what i never attempted the reader will find that personifications of abstract ideas rarely occur in these volumes and are utterly rejected as an ordinary device to elevate the style and raise it above prose my purpose was to imitate and as far as is possible to adopt the very language of men and assuredly such personifications do not make any natural or regular part of that language they are indeed a figure of speech occasionally prompted by passion and i have made use of them as such but have endeavoured utterly to reject them as a mechanical device of style or as a family language which writers in metre seem to lay claim to by prescription i have wished to keep the reader in the company of flesh and blood persuaded that by so doing i shall interest him others who pursue a different track will interest him likewise i do not interfere with their claim but wish to prefer a claim of my own there will also be found in these volumes little of what is usually called poetic diction as much pains has been taken to avoid it as is ordinarily taken to produce it this has been done for the reason already alleged to bring my language near to the language of men and further because the pleasure which i have proposed to myself to impart is of a kind very different from that which is supposed by many persons to be the proper object of poetry without being culpably particular i do not know how to give my reader a more exact notion of the style in which it was my wish and intention to write than by informing him that i have at all times endeavoured to look steadily at my subject consequently there is i hope in these poems little falsehood of description and my ideas are expressed in language fitted to their respective importance something must have been gained by this practice as it is friendly to one property of all good poetry namely good sense but it has necessarily cut me off from a large portion of phrases and figures of speech which from father to son have long been regarded as the common inheritance of poets i have also thought it expedient to restrict myself still further having abstained from the use of many expressions in themselves proper and beautiful but which have been foolishly repeated by bad poets till such feelings of disgust are connected with them as it is scarcely possible by any art of association to overpower  if in a poem there should be found a series of lines or even a single line in which the language though naturally arranged and according to the strict laws of metre does not differ from that of prose there is a numerous class of critics who when they stumble upon these prosaisms as they call them imagine that they have made a notable discovery and exult over the poet as over a man ignorant of his own profession now these men would establish a canon of criticism which the reader will conclude he must utterly reject if he wishes to be pleased with these volumes and it would be a most easy task to prove to him that not only the language of a large portion of every good poem even of the most elevated character must necessarily except with reference to the metre in no respect differ from that of good prose but likewise that some of the most interesting parts of the best poems will be found to be strictly the language of prose when prose is well written the truth of this assertion might be demonstrated by innumerable passages from almost all the poetical writings even of milton himself to illustrate the subject in a general manner i will here adduce a short composition of gray who was at the head of those who by their reasonings have attempted to widen the space of separation betwixt prose and metrical composition and was more than any other man curiously elaborate in the structure of his own poetic diction      in vain to me the smiling mornings shine     and reddening phoebus lifts his golden fire     the birds in vain their amorous descant join     or cheerful fields resume their green attire     these ears alas for other notes repine     a different object do these eyes require     my lonely anguish melts no heart but mine     and in my breast the imperfect joys expire     yet morning smiles the busy race to cheer     and newborn pleasure brings to happier men     the fields to all their wonted tribute bear     to warm their little loves the birds complain     i fruitless mourn to him that cannot hear     and weep the more because i weep in vain  it will easily be perceived that the only part of this sonnet which is of any value is the lines printed in italics it is equally obvious that except in the rhyme and in the use of the single word fruitless for fruitlessly which is so far a defect the language of these lines does in no respect differ from that of prose  by the foregoing quotation it has been shown that the language of prose may yet be well adapted to poetry and it was previously asserted that a large portion of the language of every good poem can in no respect differ from that of good prose we will go further it may be safely affirmed that there neither is nor can be any essential difference between the language of prose and metrical composition we are fond of tracing the resemblance between poetry and painting and accordingly we call them sisters but where shall we find bonds of connection sufficiently strict to typify the affinity betwixt metrical and prose composition they both speak by and to the same organs the bodies in which both of them are clothed may be said to be of the same substance their affections are kindred and almost identical not necessarily differing even in degree poetry9 sheds no tears such as angels weep but natural and human tears she can boast of no celestial ichor that distinguishes her vital juices from those of prose the same human blood circulates through the veins of them both  9 i here use the word poetry though against my own judgment as opposed to the word prose and synonymous with metrical composition but much confusion has been introduced into criticism by this contradistinction of poetry and prose instead of the more philosophical one of poetry and matter of fact or science the only strict antithesis to prose is metre nor is this in truth a strict antithesis because lines and passages of metre so naturally occur in writing prose that it would be scarcely possible to avoid them even were it desirable  if it be affirmed that rhyme and metrical arrangement of themselves constitute a distinction which overturns what has just been said on the strict affinity of metrical language with that of prose and paves the way for other artificial distinctions which the mind voluntarily admits i answer that the language of such poetry as is here recommended is as far as is possible a selection of the language really spoken by men that this selection wherever it is made with true taste and feeling will of itself form a distinction far greater than would at first be imagined and will entirely separate the composition from the vulgarity and meanness of ordinary life and if metre be superadded thereto i believe that a dissimilitude will he produced altogether sufficient for the gratification of a rational mind what other distinction would we have whence is it to come and where is it to exist not surely where the poet speaks through the mouths of his characters it cannot be necessary here either for elevation of style or any of its supposed ornaments for if the poets subject be judiciously chosen it will naturally and upon fit occasion lead him to passions the language of which if selected truly and judiciously must necessarily be dignified and variegated and alive with metaphors and figures i forbear to speak of an incongruity which would shock the intelligent reader should the poet interweave any foreign splendour of his own with that which the passion naturally suggests it is sufficient to say that such addition is unnecessary and surely it is more probable that those passages which with propriety abound with metaphors and figures will have their due effect if upon other occasions where the passions are of a milder character the style also be subdued and temperate  but as the pleasure which i hope to give by the poems now presented to the reader must depend entirely on just notions upon this subject and as it is in itself of high importance to our taste and moral feelings i cannot content myself with these detached remarks and if in what i am about to say it shall appear to some that my labour is unnecessary and that i am like a man fighting a battle without enemies such persons may be reminded that whatever be the language outwardly holden by men a practical faith in the opinions which i am wishing to establish is almost unknown if my conclusions are admitted and carried as far as they must be carried if admitted at all our judgments concerning the works of the greatest poets both ancient and modern will be far different from what they are at present both when we praise and when we censure and our moral feelings influencing and influenced by these judgments will i believe be corrected and purified  taking up the subject then upon general grounds let me ask what is meant by the word poet what is a poet to whom does he address himself and what language is to be expected from himhe is a man speaking to men a man it is true endowed with more lively sensibility more enthusiasm and tenderness who has a greater knowledge of human nature and a more comprehensive soul than are supposed to be common among mankind a man pleased with his own passions and volitions and who rejoices more than other men in the spirit of life that is in him delighting to contemplate similar volitions and passions as manifested in the goingson of the universe and habitually impelled to create them where he does not find them to these qualities he has added a disposition to be affected more than other men by absent things as if they were present an ability of conjuring up in himself passions which are indeed far from being the same as those produced by real events yet especially in those parts of the general sympathy which are pleasing and delightful do more nearly resemble the passions produced by real events than anything which from the motions of their own minds merely other men are accustomed to feel in themselveswhence and from practice he has acquired a greater readiness and power in expressing what he thinks and feels and especially those thoughts and feelings which by his own choice or from the structure of his own mind arise in him without immediate external excitement  but whatever portion of this faculty we may suppose even the greatest poet to possess there cannot be a doubt that the language which it will suggest to him must often in liveliness and truth fall short of that which is uttered by men in real life under the actual pressure of those passions certain shadows of which the poet thus produces or feels to be produced in himself  however exalted a notion we would wish to cherish of the character of a poet it is obvious that while he describes and imitates passions his employment is in some degree mechanical compared with the freedom and power of real and substantial action and suffering so that it will be the wish of the poet to bring his feelings near to those of the persons whose feelings he describes nay for short spaces of time perhaps to let himself slip into an entire delusion and even confound and identify his own feelings with theirs modifying only the language which is thus suggested to him by a consideration that he describes for a particular purpose that of giving pleasure here then he will apply the principle of selection which has been already insisted upon he will depend upon this for removing what would otherwise be painful or disgusting in the passion he will feel that there is no necessity to trick out or to elevate nature and the more industriously he applies this principle the deeper will be his faith that no words which his fancy or imagination can suggest will be to be compared with those which are the emanations of reality and truth  but it may be said by those who do not object to the general spirit of these remarks that as it is impossible for the poet to produce upon all occasions language as exquisitely fitted for the passion as that which the real passion itself suggests it is proper that he should consider himself as in the situation of a translator who does not scruple to substitute excellencies of another kind for those which are unattainable by him and endeavours occasionally to surpass his original in order to make some amends for the general inferiority to which he feels that he must submit but this would be to encourage idleness and unmanly despair further it is the language of men who speak of what they do not understand who talk of poetry as of a matter of amusement and idle pleasure who will converse with us as gravely about a taste for poetry as they express it as if it were a thing as indifferent as a taste for ropedancing or frontiniac or sherry aristotle i have been told has said that poetry is the most philosophic of all writing it is so its object is truth not individual and local but general and operative not standing upon external testimony but carried alive into the heart by passion truth which is its own testimony which gives competence and confidence to the tribunal to which it appeals and receives them from the same tribunal poetry is the image of man and nature the obstacles which stand in the way of the fidelity of the biographer and historian and of their consequent utility are incalculably greater than those which are to be encountered by the poet who comprehends the dignity of his art the poet writes under one restriction only namely the necessity of giving immediate pleasure to a human being possessed of that information which may be expected from him not as a lawyer a physician a mariner an astronomer or a natural philosopher but as a man except this one restriction there is no object standing between the poet and the image of things between this and the biographer and historian there are a thousand  nor let this necessity of producing immediate pleasure be considered as a degradation of the poets art it is far otherwise it is an acknowledgment of the beauty of the universe an acknowledgment the more sincere because not formal but indirect it is a task light and easy to him who looks at the world in the spirit of love further it is a homage paid to the native and naked dignity of man to the grand elementary principle of pleasure by which he knows and feels and lives and moves we have no sympathy but what is propagated by pleasure i would not be misunderstood but wherever we sympathise with pain it will be found that the sympathy is produced and carried on by subtle combinations with pleasure we have no knowledge that is no general principles drawn from the contemplation of particular facts but what has been built up by pleasure and exists in us by pleasure alone the man of science the chemist and mathematician whatever difficulties and disgusts they may have had to struggle with know and feel this however painful may be the objects with which the anatomists knowledge is connected he feels that his knowledge is pleasure and where he has no pleasure he has no knowledge what then does the poet he considers man and the objects that surround him as acting and reacting upon each other so as to produce an infinite complexity of pain and pleasure he considers man in his own nature and in his ordinary life as contemplating this with a certain quantity of immediate knowledge with certain convictions intuitions and deductions which from habit acquire the quality of intuitions he considers him as looking upon this complex scene of ideas and sensations and finding every where object that immediately excite in him sympathies which from the necessities of his nature are accompanied by an overbalance of enjoyment  to this knowledge which all men carry about with them and to these sympathies in which without any other discipline than that of our daily life we are fitted to take delight the poet principally directs his attention he considers man and nature as essentially adapted to each other and the mind of man as naturally the mirror of the fairest and most interesting properties of nature and thus the poet prompted by this feeling of pleasure which accompanies him through the whole course of his studies converses with general nature with affections akin to those which through labour and length of time the man of science has raised up in himself by conversing with those particular parts of nature which are the objects of his studies the knowledge both of the poet and the man of science is pleasure but the knowledge of the one cleaves to us as a necessary part of our existence our natural and unalienable inheritance the other is a personal and individual acquisition slow to come to us and by no habitual and direct sympathy connecting us with our fellowbeings the man of science seeks truth as a remote and unknown benefactor he cherishes and loves it in his solitude the poet singing a song in which all human beings join with him rejoices in the presence of truth as our visible friend and hourly companion poetry is the breath and finer spirit of all knowledge it is the impassioned expression which is in the countenance of all science emphatically may it be said of the poet as shakspeare hath said of man that he looks before and after he is the rock of defence for human nature an upholder and preserver carrying every where with him relationship and love in spite of difference of soil and climate of language and manners of laws and customs in spite of things silently gone out of mind and things violently destroyed the poet binds together by passion and knowledge the vast empire of human society as it is spread over the whole earth and over all time the objects of the poets thoughts are every where though the eyes and senses of man are it is true his favourite guides yet he will follow wheresoever he can find an atmosphere of sensation in which to move his wings poetry is the first and last of all knowledgeit is as immortal as the heart of man if the labours of men of science should ever create any material revolution direct or indirect in our condition and in the impressions which we habitually receive the poet will sleep then no more than at present he will be ready to follow the steps of the man of science not only in those general indirect effects but he will be at his side carrying sensation into the midst of the objects of the science itself the remotest discoveries of the chemist the botanist or mineralogist will be as proper objects of the poets art as any upon which it can be employed if the time should ever come when these things shall be familiar to us and the relations under which they are contemplated by the followers of these respective sciences shall be manifestly and palpably material to us as enjoying and suffering beings if the time should ever come when what is now called science thus familiarised to men shall be ready to put on as it were a form of flesh and blood the poet will lend his divine spirit to aid the transfiguration and will welcome the being thus produced as a dear and genuine inmate of the household of manit is not then to be supposed that any one who holds that sublime notion of poetry which i have attempted to convey will break in upon the sanctity and truth of his pictures by transitory and accidental ornaments and endeavour to excite admiration of himself by arts the necessity of which must manifestly depend upon the assumed meanness of his subject  what has been thus far said applies to poetry in general but especially to those parts of composition where the poet speaks through the mouths of his characters and upon this point it appears to authorise the conclusion that there are few persons of good sense who would not allow that the dramatic parts of composition are defective in proportion as they deviate from the real language of nature and are coloured by a diction of the poets own either peculiar to him as an individual poet or belonging simply to poets in general to a body of men who from the circumstance of their composition being in metre it is expected will employ a particular language  it is not then in the dramatic parts of composition that we look for this distinction of language but still it may be proper and necessary where the poet speaks to us in his own person and character to this i answer by referring the reader to the description before given of a poet among the qualities there enumerated as principally conducing to form a poet is implied nothing differing in kind from other men but only in degree the sum of what was said is that the poet is chiefly distinguished from other men by a greater promptness to think and feel without immediate external excitement and a greater power in expressing such thoughts and feelings as are produced in him in that manner but these passions and thoughts and feelings are the general passions and thoughts and feelings of men and with what are they connected undoubtedly with our moral sentiments and animal sensations and with the causes which excite these with the operations of the elements and the appearances of the visible universe with storm and sunshine with the revolutions of the seasons with cold and heat with loss of friends and kindred with injuries and resentments gratitude and hope with fear and sorrow these and the like are the sensations and objects which the poet describes as they are the sensations of other men and the objects which interest them the poet thinks and feels in the spirit of human passions how then can his language differ in any material degree from that of all other men who feel vividly and see clearly it might be proved that it is impossible but supposing that this were not the case the poet might then be allowed to use a peculiar language when expressing his feelings for his own gratification or that of men like himself but poets do not write for poets alone but for men unless therefore we are advocates for that admiration which subsists upon ignorance and that pleasure which arises from hearing what we do not understand the poet must descend from this supposed height and in order to excite rational sympathy he must express himself as other men express themselves to this it may be added that while he is only selecting from the real language of men or which amounts to the same thing composing accurately in the spirit of such selection he is treading upon safe ground and we know what we are to expect from him our feelings are the same with respect to metre for as it may be proper to remind the reader the distinction of metre is regular and uniform and not like that which is produced by what is usually called poetic diction arbitrary and subject to infinite caprices upon which no calculation whatever can be made in the one case the reader is utterly at the mercy of the poet respecting what imagery or diction he may choose to connect with the passion whereas in the other the metre obeys certain laws to which the poet and reader both willingly submit because they are certain and because no interference is made by them with the passion but such as the concurring testimony of ages has shown to heighten and improve the pleasure which coexists with it  it will now be proper to answer an obvious question namely why professing these opinions have i written in verse to this in addition to such answer as is included in what has been already said i reply in the first place because however i may have restricted myself there is still left open to me what confessedly constitutes the most valuable object of all writing whether in prose or verse the great and universal passions of men the most general and interesting of their occupations and the entire world of nature before meto supply endless combinations of forms and imagery now supposing for a moment that whatever is interesting in these objects may be as vividly described in prose why should i be condemned for attempting to superadd to such description the charm which by the consent of all nations is acknowledged to exist in metrical language to this by such as are yet unconvinced it may be answered that a very small part of the pleasure given by poetry depends upon the metre and that it is injudicious to write in metre unless it be accompanied with the other artificial distinctions of style with which metre is usually accompanied and that by such deviation more will be lost from the shock which will thereby be given to the readers associations than will be counterbalanced by any pleasure which he can derive from the general power of numbers in answer to those who still contend for the necessity of accompanying metre with certain appropriate colours of style in order to the accomplishment of its appropriate end and who also in my opinion greatly underrate the power of metre in itself it might perhaps as far as relates to these volumes have been almost sufficient to observe that poems are extant written upon more humble subjects and in a still more naked and simple style which have continued to give pleasure from generation to generation now if nakedness and simplicity be a defect the fact here mentioned affords a strong presumption that poems somewhat less naked and simple are capable of affording pleasure at the present day and what i wished chiefly to attempt at present was to justify myself for having written under the impression of this belief  but various causes might be pointed out why when the style is manly and the subject of some importance words metrically arranged will long continue to impart such a pleasure to mankind as he who proves the extent of that pleasure will be desirous to impart the end of poetry is to produce excitement in coexistence with an overbalance of pleasure but by the supposition excitement is an unusual and irregular state of the mind ideas and feelings do not in that state succeed each other in accustomed order if the words however by which this excitement is produced be in themselves powerful or the images and feelings have an undue proportion of pain connected with them there is some danger that the excitement may he carried beyond its proper bounds now the copresence of something regular something to which the mind has been accustomed in various moods and in a less excited state cannot but have great efficacy in tempering and restraining the passion by an intertexture of ordinary feeling and of feeling not strictly and necessarily connected with the passion this is unquestionably true and hence though the opinion will at first appear paradoxical from the tendency of metre to divest language in a certain degree of its reality and thus to throw a sort of halfconsciousness of unsubstantial existence over the whole composition there can be little doubt but that more pathetic situations and sentiments that is those which have a greater proportion of pain connected with them may be endured in metrical composition especially in rhyme than in prose the metre of the old ballads is very artless yet they contain many passages which would illustrate this opinion and i hope if the following poems be attentively perused similar instances will be found in them this opinion may be further illustrated by appealing to the readers own experience of the reluctance with which he comes to the reperusal of the distressful parts of clarissa harlowe or the gamester while shakspeares writings in the most pathetic scenes never act upon us as pathetic beyond the bounds of pleasurean effect which in a much greater degree than might at first be imagined is to be ascribed to small but continual and regular impulses of pleasurable surprise from the metrical arrangementon the other hand what it must be allowed will much more frequently happen if the poets words should be incommensurate with the passion and inadequate to raise the reader to a height of desirable excitement then unless the poets choice of his metre has been grossly injudicious in the feelings of pleasure which the reader has been accustomed to connect with metre in general and in the feeling whether cheerful or melancholy which he has been accustomed to connect with that particular movement of metre there will be found something which will greatly contribute to impart passion to the words and to effect the complex end which the poet proposes to himself  if i had undertaken a systematic defence of the theory here maintained it would have been my duty to develop the various causes upon which the pleasure received from metrical language depends among the chief of these causes is to be reckoned a principle which must be well known to those who have made any of the arts the object of accurate reflection namely the pleasure which the mind derives from the perception of similitude in dissimilitude this principle is the great spring of the activity of our minds and their chief feeder from this principle the direction of the sexual appetite and all the passions connected with it take their origin it is the life of our ordinary conversation and upon the accuracy with which similitude in dissimilitude and dissimilitude in similitude are perceived depend our taste and our moral feelings it would not be a useless employment to apply this principle to the consideration of metre and to show that metre is hence enabled to afford much pleasure and to point out in what manner that pleasure is produced but my limits will not permit me to enter upon this subject and i must content myself with a general summary  i have said that poetry is the spontaneous overflow of powerful feelings it takes its origin from emotion recollected in tranquillity the emotion is contemplated till by a species of reaction the tranquillity gradually disappears and an emotion kindred to that which was before the subject of contemplation is gradually produced and does itself actually exist in the mind in this mood successful composition generally begins and in a mood similar to this it is carried on but the emotion of whatever kind and in whatever degree from various causes is qualified by various pleasures so that in describing any passions whatsoever which are voluntarily described the mind will upon the whole be in a state of enjoyment if nature be thus cautious to preserve in a state of enjoyment a being so employed the poet ought to profit by the lesson held forth to him and ought especially to take care that whatever passions he communicates to his reader those passions if his readers mind be sound and vigorous should always be accompanied with an overbalance of pleasure now the music of harmonious metrical language the sense of difficulty overcome and the blind association of pleasure which has been previously received from works of rhyme or metre of the same or similar construction an indistinct perception perpetually renewed of language closely resembling that of real life and yet in the circumstance of metre differing from it so widelyall these imperceptibly make up a complex feeling of delight which is of the most important use in tempering the painful feeling always found intermingled with powerful descriptions of the deeper passions this effect is always produced in pathetic and impassioned poetry while in lighter compositions the ease and gracefulness with which the poet manages his numbers are themselves confessedly a principal source of the gratification of the reader all that it is necessary to say however upon this subject may be effected by affirming what few persons will deny that of two descriptions either of passions manners or characters each of them equally well executed the one in prose and the other in verse the verse will be read a hundred times where the prose is read once  having thus explained a few of my reasons for writing in verse and why i have chosen subjects from common life and endeavoured to bring my language near to the real language of men if i have been too minute in pleading my own cause i have at the same time been treating a subject of general interest and for this reason a few words shall be added with reference solely to these particular poems and to some defects which will probably be found in them i am sensible that my associations must have sometimes been particular instead of general and that consequently giving to things a false importance i may have sometimes written upon unworthy subjects but i am less apprehensive on this account than that my language may frequently have suffered from those arbitrary connections of feelings and ideas with particular words and phrases from which no man can altogether protect himself hence i have no doubt that in some instances feelings even of the ludicrous may be given to my readers by expressions which appeared to me tender and pathetic such faulty expressions were i convinced they were faulty at present and that they must necessarily continue to be so i would willingly take all reasonable pains to correct but it is dangerous to make these alterations on the simple authority of a few individuals or even of certain classes of men for where the understanding of an author is not convinced or his feelings altered this cannot be done without great injury to himself for his own feelings are his stay and support and if he set them aside in one instance he may be induced to repeat this act till his mind shall lose all confidence in itself and become utterly debilitated to this it may be added that the critic ought never to forget that he is himself exposed to the same errors as the poet and perhaps in a much greater degree for there can be no presumption in saying of most readers that it is not probable they will be so well acquainted with the various stages of meaning through which words have passed or with the fickleness or stability of the relations of particular ideas to each other and above all since they are so much less interested in the subject they may decide lightly and carelessly  long as the reader has been detained i hope he will permit me to caution him against a mode of false criticism which has been applied to poetry in which the language closely resembles that of life and nature such verses have been triumphed over in parodies of which dr johnsons stanza is a fair specimen      i put my hat upon my head     and walked into the strand     and there i met another man     whose hat was in his hand  immediately under these lines let us place one of the most justlyadmired stanzas of the babes in the wood      these pretty babes with hand in hand     went wandering up and down     but never more they saw the man     approaching from the town  in both these stanzas the words and the order of the words in no respect differ from the most unimpassioned conversation there are words in both for example the strand and the town connected with none but the most familiar ideas yet the one stanza we admit as admirable and the other as a fair example of the superlatively contemptible whence arises this difference not from the metre not from the language not from the order of the words but the matter expressed in dr johnsons stanza is contemptible the proper method of treating trivial and simple verses to which dr johnsons stanza would be a fair parallelism is not to say this is a bad kind of poetry or this is not poetry but this wants sense it is neither interesting in itself nor can lead to any thing interesting the images neither originate in that sane state of feeling which arises out of thought nor can excite thought or feeling in the reader this is the only sensible manner of dealing with such verses why trouble yourself about the species till you have previously decided upon the genus why take pains to prove that an ape is not a newton when it is selfevident that he is not a man  one request i must make of my reader which is that in judging these poems he would decide by his own feelings genuinely and not by reflection upon what will probably be the judgment of others how common is it to hear a person say i myself do not object to this style of composition or this or that expression but to such and such classes of people it will appear mean or ludicrous this mode of criticism so destructive of all sound unadulterated judgment is almost universal let the reader then abide independently by his own feelings and if he finds himself affected let him not suffer such conjectures to interfere with his pleasure  if an author by any single composition has impressed us with respect for his talents it is useful to consider this as affording a presumption that on other occasions where we have been displeased he nevertheless may not have written ill or absurdly and further to give him so much credit for this one composition as may induce us to review what has displeased us with more care than we should otherwise have bestowed upon it this is not only an act of justice but in our decisions upon poetry especially may conduce in a high degree to the improvement of our own taste for an accurate taste in poetry and in all the other arts as sir joshua reynolds has observed is an acquired talent which can only be produced by thought and a longcontinued intercourse with the best models of composition this is mentioned not with so ridiculous a purpose as to prevent the most inexperienced reader from judging for himself i have already said that i wish him to judge for himself but merely to temper the rashness of decision and to suggest that if poetry be a subject on which much time has not been bestowed the judgment may be erroneous and that in many cases it necessarily will be so  nothing would i know have so effectually contributed to further the end which i have in view as to have shown of what kind the pleasure is and how that pleasure is produced which is confessedly produced by metrical composition essentially different from that which i have here endeavoured to recommend for the reader will say that he has been pleased by such composition and what more can be done for him the power of any art is limited and he will suspect that if it be proposed to furnish him with new friends that can be only upon condition of his abandoning his old friends besides as i have said the reader is himself conscious of the pleasure which he has received from such composition composition to which he has peculiarly attached the endearing name of poetry and all men feel an habitual gratitude and something of an honourable bigotry for the objects which have long continued to please them we not only wish to be pleased but to be pleased in that particular way in which we have been accustomed to be pleased there is in these feelings enough to resist a host of arguments and i should be the less able to combat them successfully as i am willing to allow that in order entirely to enjoy the poetry which i am recommending it would be necessary to give up much of what is ordinarily enjoyed but would my limits have permitted me to point out how this pleasure is produced many obstacles might have been removed and the reader assisted in perceiving that the powers of language are not so limited as he may suppose and that it is possible for poetry to give other enjoyments of a purer more lasting and more exquisite nature this part of the subject has not been altogether neglected but it has not been so much my present aim to prove that the interest excited by some other kinds of poetry is less vivid and less worthy of the nobler powers of the mind as to offer reasons for presuming that if my purpose were fulfilled a species of poetry would be produced which is genuine poetry in its nature well adapted to interest mankind permanently and likewise important in the multiplicity and quality of its moral relations  from what has been said and from a perusal of the poems the reader will be able clearly to perceive the object which i had in view he will determine how far it has been attained and what is a much more important question whether it be worth attaining and upon the decision of these two questions will rest my claim to the approbation of the public     b of poetic diction  what is usually called poetic diction essay i page 84 line 22   perhaps as i have no right to expect that attentive perusal without which confined as i have been to the narrow limits of a preface my meaning cannot be thoroughly understood i am anxious to give an exact notion of the sense in which the phrase poetic diction has been used and for this purpose a few words shall here be added concerning the origin and characteristics of the phraseology which i have condemned under that name  the earliest poets of all nations generally wrote from passion excited by real events they wrote naturally and as men feeling powerfully as they did their language was daring and figurative in succeeding times poets and men ambitious of the fame of poets perceiving the influence of such language and desirous of producing the same effect without being animated by the same passion set themselves to a mechanical adoption of these figures of speech and made use of them sometimes with propriety but much more frequently applied them to feelings and thoughts with which they had no natural connection whatsoever a language was thus insensibly produced differing materially from the real language of men in any situation the reader or hearer of this distorted language found himself in a perturbed and unusual state of mind when affected by the genuine language of passion he had been in a perturbed and unusual state of mind also in both cases he was willing that his common judgment and understanding should be laid asleep and he had no instinctive and infallible perception of the true to make him reject the false the one served as a passport for the other the emotion was in both cases delightful and no wonder if he confounded the one with the other and believed them both to be produced by the same or similar causes besides the poet spake to him in the character of a man to be looked up to a man of genius and authority thus and from a variety of other causes this distorted language was received with admiration and poets it is probable who had before contented themselves for the most part with misapplying only expressions which at first had been dictated by real passion carried the abuse still further and introduced phrases composed apparently in the spirit of the original figurative language of passion yet altogether of their own invention and characterised by various degrees of wanton deviation from good sense and nature  it is indeed true that the language of the earliest poets was felt to differ materially from ordinary language because it was the language of extraordinary occasions but it was really spoken by men language which the poet himself had uttered when he had been affected by the events which he described or which he had heard uttered by those around him to this language it is probable that metre of some sort or other was early superadded this separated the genuine language of poetry still further from common life so that whoever read or heard the poems of these earliest poets felt himself moved in a way in which he had not been accustomed to be moved in real life and by causes manifestly different from those which acted upon him in real life this was the great temptation to all the corruptions which have followed under the protection of this feeling succeeding poets constructed a phraseology which had one thing it is true in common with the genuine language of poetry namely that it was not heard in ordinary conversation that it was unusual but the first poets as i have said spake a language which though unusual was still the language of men this circumstance however was disregarded by their successors they found that they could please by easier means they became proud of modes of expression which they themselves had invented and which were uttered only by themselves in process of time metre became a symbol or promise of this unusual language and whoever took upon him to write in metre according as he possessed more or less of true poetic genius introduced less or more of this adulterated phraseology into his compositions and the true and the false were inseparably interwoven until the taste of men becoming gradually perverted this language was received as a natural language and at length by the influence of books upon men did to a certain degree really become so abuses of this kind were imported from one nation to another and with the progress of refinement this diction became daily more and more corrupt thrusting out of sight the plain humanities of nature by a motley masquerade of tricks quaintnesses hieroglyphics and enigmas  it would not be uninteresting to point out the causes of the pleasure given by this extravagant and absurd diction it depends upon a great variety of causes but upon none perhaps more than its influence in impressing a notion of the peculiarity and exaltation of the poets character and in flattering the readers selflove by bringing him nearer to a sympathy with that character an effect which is accomplished by unsettling ordinary habits of thinking and thus assisting the reader to approach to that perturbed and dizzy state of mind in which if he does not find himself he imagines that he is balked of a peculiar enjoyment which poetry can and ought to bestow  the sonnet quoted from gray in the preface except the lines printed in italics consists of little else but this diction though not of the worst kind and indeed if one may be permitted to say so it is far too common in the best writers both ancient and modern perhaps in no way by positive example could more easily be given a notion of what i mean by the phrase poetic diction than by referring to a comparison between the metrical paraphrase which we have of passages in the old and new testament and those passages as they exist in our common translation see popes messiah throughout priors did sweeter sounds adorn my flowing tongue etc etc though i speak with the tongues of

the fact is it would be bad prose so bad that it is scarcely worse in metre the epithet churchgoing applied to a bell and that by so chaste a writer as cowper is an instance of the strange abuses which poets have introduced into their language till they and their readers take them as matters of course if they do not single them out expressly as objects of admiration the two lines neer sighd at the sound c are in my opinion an instance of the language of passion wrested from its proper use and from the mere circumstance of the composition being in metre applied upon an occasion that does not justify such violent expressions and i should condemn the passage though perhaps few readers will agree with me as vicious poetic diction the last stanza is throughout admirably expressed it would be equally good whether in prose or verse except that the reader has an exquisite pleasure in seeing such natural language so naturally connected with metre the beauty of this stanza tempts me to conclude with a principle which ought never to be lost sight of and which has been my chief guide in all i have saidnamely that in works of imagination and sentiment for of these only have i been treating in proportion as ideas and feelings are valuable whether the composition be in prose or in verse they require and exact one and the same language metre is but adventitious to composition and the phraseology for which that passport is necessary even where it may be graceful at all will be little valued by the judicious     c poetry as a study  with the young of both sexes poetry is like love a passion but for much the greater part of those who have been proud of its power over their minds a necessity soon arises of breaking the pleasing bondage or it relaxes of itselfthe thoughts being occupied in domestic cares or the time engrossed by business poetry then becomes only an occasional recreation while to those whose existence passes away in a course of fashionable pleasure it is a species of luxurious amusement in middle and declining age a scattered number of serious persons resort to poetry as to religion for a protection against the pressure of trivial employments and as a consolation for the afflictions of life and lastly there are many who having been enamoured of this art in their youth have found leisure after youth was spent to cultivate general literature in which poetry has continued to be comprehended as a study  into the above classes the readers of poetry may be divided critics abound in them all but from the last only can opinions be collected of absolute value and worthy to be depended upon as prophetic of the destiny of a new work the young who in nothing can escape delusion are especially subject to it in their intercourse with poetry the cause not so obvious as the fact is unquestionable is the same as that from which erroneous judgments in this art in the minds of men of all ages chiefly proceed but upon youth it operates with peculiar force the appropriate business of poetry which nevertheless if genuine is as permanent as pure science her appropriate employment her privilege and her duty is to treat of things not as they are but as they appear not as they exist in themselves but as they seem to exist to the senses and to the passions what a world of delusion does this acknowledged obligation prepare for the inexperienced what temptations to go astray are here held forth for them whose thoughts have been little disciplined by the understanding and whose feelings revolt from the sway of reasonwhen a juvenile reader is in the height of his rapture with some vicious passage should experience throw in doubts or commonsense suggest suspicions a lurking consciousness that the realities of the muse are but shows and that her liveliest excitements are raised by transient shocks of conflicting feeling and successive assemblages of contradictory thoughtsis ever at hand to justify extravagance and to sanction absurdity but it may be asked as these illusions are unavoidable and no doubt eminently useful to the mind as a process what good can be gained by making observations the tendency of which is to diminish the confidence of youth in its feelings and thus to abridge its innocent and even profitable pleasures the reproach implied in the question could not be warded off if youth were incapable of being delighted with what is truly excellent or if these errors always terminated of themselves in due season but with the majority though their force be abated they continue through life moreover the fire of youth is too vivacious an element to be extinguished or damped by a philosophical remark and while there is no danger that what has been said will be injurious or painful to the ardent and the confident it may prove beneficial to those who being enthusiastic are at the same time modest and ingenuous the intimation may unite with their own misgivings to regulate their sensibility and to bring in sooner than it would otherwise have arrived a more discreet and sound judgment  if it should excite wonder that men of ability in later life whose understandings have been rendered acute by practice in affairs should be so easily and so far imposed upon when they happen to take up a new work in verse this appears to be the causethat having discontinued their attention to poetry whatever progress may have been made in other departments of knowledge they have not as to this art advanced in true discernment beyond the age of youth if then a new poem fall in their way whose attractions are of that kind which would have enraptured them during the heat of youth the judgment not being improved to a degree that they shall be disgusted they are dazzled and prize and cherish the faults for having had power to make the present time vanish before them and to throw the mind back as by enchantment into the happiest season of life as they read powers seem to be revived passions are regenerated and pleasures restored the book was probably taken up after an escape from the burden of business and with a wish to forget the world and all its vexations and anxieties having obtained this wish and so much more it is natural that they should make report as they have felt  if men of mature age through want of practice be thus easily beguiled into admiration of absurdities extravagances and misplaced ornaments thinking it proper that their understandings should enjoy a holiday while they are unbending their minds with verse it may be expected that such readers will resemble their former selves also in strength of prejudice and an inaptitude to be moved by the unostentatious beauties of a pure style in the higher poetry an enlightened critic chiefly looks for a reflection of the wisdom of the heart and the grandeur of the imagination wherever these appear simplicity accompanies them magnificence herself when legitimate depending upon a simplicity of her own to regulate her ornaments but it is a wellknown property of human nature that our estimates are ever governed by comparisons of which we are conscious with various degrees of distinctness is it not then inevitable confining these observations to the effects of style merely that an eye accustomed to the glaring hues of diction by which such readers are caught and excited will for the most part be rather repelled than attracted by an original work the colouring of which is disposed according to a pure and refined scheme of harmony it is in the fine arts as in the affairs of life no man can serve ie obey with zeal and fidelity two masters  as poetry is most just to its own divine origin when it administers the comforts and breathes the spirit of religion they who have learned to perceive this truth and who betake themselves to reading verse for sacred purposes must be preserved from numerous illusions to which the two classes of readers whom we have been considering are liable but as the mind grows serious from the weight of life the range of its passions is contracted accordingly and its sympathies become so exclusive that many species of high excellence wholly escape or but languidly excite its notice besides men who read from religious or moral inclinations even when the subject is of that kind which they approve are beset with misconceptions and mistakes peculiar to themselves attaching so much importance to the truths which interest them they are prone to overrate the authors by whom those truths are expressed and enforced they come prepared to impart so much passion to the poets language that they remain unconscious how little in fact they receive from it and on the other hand religious faith is to him who holds it so momentous a thing and error appears to be attended with such tremendous consequences that if opinions touching upon religion occur which the reader condemns he not only cannot sympathise with them however animated the expression but there is for the most part an end put to all satisfaction and enjoyment love if it before existed is converted into dislike and the heart of the reader is set against the author and his bookto these excesses they who from their professions ought to be the most guarded against them are perhaps the most liable i mean those sects whose religion being from the calculating understanding is cold and formal for when christianity the religion of humility is founded upon the proudest faculty of our nature what can be expected but contradictions accordingly believers of this cast are at one time contemptuous at another being troubled as they are and must be with inward misgivings they are jealous and suspiciousand at all seasons they are under temptation to supply by the heat with which they defend their tenets the animation which is wanting to the constitution of the religion itself  faith was given to man that his affections detached from the treasures of time might be inclined to settle upon those of eternitythe elevation of his nature which this habit produces on earth being to him a presumptive evidence of a future state of existence and giving him a title to partake of its holiness the religious man values what he sees chiefly as an imperfect shadowing forth of what he is incapable of seeing the concerns of religion refer to indefinite objects and are too weighty for the mind to support them without relieving itself by resting a great part of the burthen upon words and symbols the commerce between man and his maker cannot be carried on but by a process where much is represented in little and the infinite being accommodates himself to a finite capacity in all this may be perceived the affinity between religion and poetry between religionmaking up the deficiencies of reason by faith and poetrypassionate for the instruction of reason between religionwhose element is infinitude and whose ultimate trust is the supreme of things submitting herself to circumscription and reconciled to substitutions and poetryethereal and transcendent yet incapable to sustain her existence without sensuous incarnation in this community of nature may be perceived also the lurking incitements of kindred errorso that we shall find that no poetry has been more subject to distortion than that species the argument and scope of which is religious and no lovers of the art have gone farther astray than the pious and the devout  whither then shall we turn for that union of qualifications which must necessarily exist before the decisions of a critic can be of absolute value for a mind at once poetical and philosophical for a critic whose affections are as free and kindly as the spirit of society and whose understanding is severe as that of dispassionate government where are we to look for that initiatory composure of mind which no selfishness can disturb for a natural sensibility that has been tutored into correctness without losing anything of its quickness and for active faculties capable of answering the demands which an author of original imagination shall make upon them associated with a judgment that cannot be duped into admiration by aught that is unworthy of itamong those and those only who never having suffered their youthful love of poetry to remit much of its force have applied to the consideration of the laws of this art the best power of their understandings at the same time it must be observedthat as this class comprehends the only judgments which are trustworthy so does it include the most erroneous and perverse for to be mistaught is worse than to be untaught and no perverseness equals that which is supported by system no errors are so difficult to root out as those which the understanding has pledged its credit to uphold in this class are contained censors who if they be pleased with what is good are pleased with it only by imperfect glimpses and upon false principles who should they generalise rightly to a certain point are sure to suffer for it in the end who if they stumble upon a sound rule are fettered by misapplying it or by straining it too far being incapable of perceiving when it ought to yield to one of higher order in it are found critics too petulant to be passive to a genuine poet and too feeble to grapple with him men who take upon them to report of the course which he holds whom they are utterly unable to accompanyconfounded if he turn quick upon the wing dismayed if he soar steadily into the regionmen of palsied imaginations and indurated hearts in whose minds all healthy action is languid who therefore feed as the many direct them or with the many are greedy after vicious provocativesjudges whose censure is auspicious and whose praise ominous in this class meet together the two extremes of best and worst  the observations presented in the foregoing series are of too ungracious a nature to have been made without reluctance and were it only on this account i would invite the reader to try them by the test of comprehensive experience if the number of judges who can be confidently relied upon be in reality so small it ought to follow that partial notice only or neglect perhaps long continued or attention wholly inadequate to their meritsmust have been the fate of most works in the higher departments of poetry and that on the other hand numerous productions have blazed into popularity and have passed away leaving scarcely a trace behind them it will be further found that when authors shall have at length raised themselves into general admiration and maintained their ground errors and prejudices have prevailed concerning their genius and their works which the few who are conscious of those errors and prejudices would deplore if they were not recompensed by perceiving that there are select spirits for whom it is ordained that their fame shall be in the world an existence like that of virtue which owes its being to the struggles it makes and its vigour to the enemies whom it provokesa vivacious quality ever doomed to meet with opposition and still triumphing over it and from the nature of its dominion incapable of being brought to the sad conclusion of alexander when he wept that there were no more worlds for him to conquer  let us take a hasty retrospect of the poetical literature of this country for the greater part of the last two centuries and see if the facts support these inferences  who is there that now reads the creation of dubartas yet all europe once resounded with his praise he was caressed by kings and when his poem was translated into our language the faery queen faded before it the name of spenser whose genius is of a higher order than even that of ariosto is at this day scarcely known beyond the limits of the british isles and if the value of his works is to be estimated from the attention now paid to them by his countrymen compared with that which they bestow on those of some other writers it must be pronounced small indeed      the laurel meed of mighty conquerors     and poets sage  are his own words but his wisdom has in this particular been his worst enemy while its opposite whether in the shape of folly or madness has been their best friend but he was a great power and bears a high name the laurel has been awarded to him  a dramatic author if he write for the stage must adapt himself to the taste of the audience or they will not endure him accordingly the mighty genius of shakspeare was listened to the people were delighted but i am not sufficiently versed in stage antiquities to determine whether they did not flock as eagerly to the representation of many pieces of contemporary authors wholly undeserving to appear upon the same boards had there been a formal contest for superiority among dramatic writers that shakspeare like his predecessors sophocles and euripides would have often been subject to the mortification of seeing the prize adjudged to sorry competitors becomes too probable when we reflect that the admirers of settle and shadwell were in a later age as numerous and reckoned as respectable in point of talent as those of dryden at all events that shakspeare stooped to accommodate himself to the people is sufficiently apparent and one of the most striking proofs of his almost omnipotent genius is that he could turn to such glorious purpose those materials which the prepossessions of the age compelled him to make use of yet even this marvellous skill appears not to have been enough to prevent his rivals from having some advantage over him in public estimation else how can we account for passages and scenes that exist in his works unless upon a supposition that some of the grossest of them a fact which in my own mind i have no doubt of were foisted in by the players for the gratification of the many  but that his works whatever might be their reception upon the stage made but little impression upon the ruling intellects of the time may be inferred from the fact that lord bacon in his multifarious writings nowhere either quotes or alludes to him10his dramatic excellence enabled him to resume possession of the stage after the restoration but dryden tells us that in his time two of the plays of beaumont and fletcher were acted for one of shakspeares and so faint and limited was the perception of the poetic beauties of his dramas in the time of pope that in his edition of the plays with a view of rendering to the general reader a necessary service he printed between inverted commas those passages which he thought most worthy of notice  10 the learned hakewill a third edition of whose book bears date 1635 writing to refute the error touching natures perpetual and universal decay cites triumphantly the names of ariosto tasso bartas and spenser as instances that poetic genius had not degenerated but he makes no mention of shakspeare  at this day the french critics have abated nothing of their aversion to this darling of our nation the english with their bouffon de shakspeare is as familiar an expression among them as in the time of voltaire baron grimm is the only french writer who seems to have perceived his infinite superiority to the first names of the french theatre an advantage which the parisian critic owed to his german blood and german education the most enlightened italians though well acquainted with our language are wholly incompetent to measure the proportions of shakspeare the germans only of foreign nations are approaching towards a knowledge and feeling of what he is in some respects they have acquired a superiority over the fellowcountrymen of the poet for among us it is a current i might say an established opinion that shakspeare is justly praised when he is pronounced to be a wild irregular genius in whom great faults are compensated by great beauties how long may it be before this misconception passes away and it becomes universally acknowledged that the judgment of shakspeare in the selection of his materials and in the manner in which he has made them heterogeneous as they often are constitute a unity of their own and contribute all to one great end is not less admirable than his imagination his invention and his intuitive knowledge of human nature  there is extant a small volume of miscellaneous poems in which shakspeare expresses his own feelings in his own person it is not difficult to conceive that the editor george steevens should have been insensible to the beauties of one portion of that volume the sonnets though in no part of the writings of this poet is found in an equal compass a greater number of exquisite feelings felicitously expressed but from regard to the critics own credit he would not have ventured to talk of an11 act of parliament not being strong enough to compel the perusal of those little pieces if he had not known that the people of england were ignorant of the treasures contained in them and if he had not moreover shared the too common propensity of human nature to exult over a supposed fall into the mire of a genius whom he had been compelled to regard with admiration as an inmate of the celestial regionsthere sitting where he durst not soar  11 this flippant insensibility was publicly reprehended by mr coleridge in a course of lectures upon poetry given by him at the royal institution for the various merits of thought and language in shakspeares sonnets see numbers 27 29 30 32 33 54 64 66 68 73 76 86 91 92 93 97 98 105 107 108 109 111 113 114 116 117 129 and many others  nine years before the death of shakspeare milton was born and early in life he published several small poems which though on their first appearance they were praised by a few of the judicious were afterwards neglected to that degree that pope in his youth could borrow from them without risk of its being known whether these poems are at this day justly appreciated i will not undertake to decide nor would it imply a severe reflection upon the mass of readers to suppose the contrary seeing that a man of the acknowledged genius of voss the german poet could suffer their spirit to evaporate and could change their character as is done in the translation made by him of the most popular of those pieces at all events it is certain that these poems of milton are now much read and loudly praised yet were they little heard of till more than 150 years after their publication and of the sonnets dr johnson as appears from boswells life of him was in the habit of thinking and speaking as contemptuously as steevens wrote upon those of shakspeare  about the time when the pindaric odes of cowley and his imitators and the productions of that class of curious thinkers whom dr johnson has strangely styled metaphysical poets were beginning to lose something of that extravagant admiration which they had excited the paradise lost made its appearance fit audience find though few was the petition addressed by the poet to his inspiring muse i have said elsewhere that he gained more than he asked this i believe to be true but dr johnson has fallen into a gross mistake when he attempts to prove by the sale of the work that miltons countrymen were just to it upon its first appearance thirteen hundred copies were sold in two years an uncommon example he asserts of the prevalence of genius in opposition to so much recent enmity as miltons public conduct had excited but be it remembered that if miltons political and religious opinions and the manner in which he announced them had raised him many enemies they had procured him numerous friends who as all personal danger was passed away at the time of publication would be eager to procure the masterwork of a man whom they revered and whom they would be proud of praising take from the number of purchasers persons of this class and also those who wished to possess the poem as a religious work and but few i fear would be left who sought for it on account of its poetical merits the demand did not immediately increase for says dr johnson many more readers he means persons in the habit of reading poetry than were supplied at first the nation did not afford how careless must a writer be who can make this assertion in the face of so many existing titlepages to belie it turning to my own shelves i find the folio of cowley seventh edition 1681 a book near it is flatmans poems fourth edition 1686 waller fifth edition same date the poems of norris of bemerton not long after went i believe through nine editions what further demand there might be for these works i do not know but i well remember that twentyfive years ago the booksellers stalls in london swarmed with the folios of cowley this is not mentioned in disparagement of that able writer and amiable man but merely to showthat if miltons work were not more read it was not because readers did not exist at the time the early editions of the paradise lost were printed in a shape which allowed them to be sold at a low price yet only three thousand copies of the work were sold in eleven years and the nation says dr johnson had been satisfied from 1623 to 1664 that is fortyone years with only two editions of the works of shakspeare which probably did not together make one thousand copies facts adduced by the critic to prove the paucity of readersthere were readers in multitudes but their money went for other purposes as their admiration was fixed elsewhere we are authorized then to affirm that the reception of the paradise lost and the slow progress of its fame are proofs as striking as can be desired that the positions which i am attempting to establish are not erroneous12how amusing to shape to ones self such a critique as a wit of charless days or a lord of the miscellanies or trading journalist of king williams time would have brought forth if he had set his faculties industriously to work upon this poem every where impregnated with original excellence  so strange indeed are the obliquities of admiration that they whose opinions are much influenced by authority will often be tempted to think that there are no fixed principles13 in human nature for this art to rest upon i have been honoured by being permitted to peruse in ms a tract composed between the period of the revolution and the close of that century it is the work of an english peer of high accomplishments its object to form the character and direct the studies of his son perhaps nowhere does a more beautiful treatise of the kind exist the good sense and wisdom of the thoughts the delicacy of the feelings and the charm of the style are throughout equally conspicuous yet the author selecting among the poets of his own country those whom he deems most worthy of his sons perusal particularises only lord rochester sir john denham and cowley writing about the same time shaftesbury an author at present unjustly depreciated describes the english muses as only yet lisping in their cradles  the arts by which pope soon afterwards contrived to procure to himself a more general and a higher reputation than perhaps any english poet ever attained during his lifetime are known to the judicious and as well known is it to them that the undue exertion of those arts is the cause why pope has for some time held a rank in literature to which if he had not been seduced by an overlove of immediate popularity and had confided more in his native genius he never could have descended  12 hughes is express upon this subject in his dedication of spensers works to lord somers he writes thus it was your lordships encouraging a beautiful edition of paradise lost that first brought that incomparable poem to be generally known and esteemed  13 this opinion seems actually to have been entertained by adam smith the worst critic david hume not excepted that scotland a soil to which this sort of weed seems natural has produced  he bewitched the nation by his melody and dazzled it by his polished style and was himself blinded by his own success having wandered from humanity in his eclogues with boyish inexperience the praise which these compositions obtained tempted him into a belief that nature was not to be trusted at least in pastoral poetry to prove this by example he put his friend gay upon writing those eclogues which their author intended to be burlesque the instigator of the work and his admirers could perceive in them nothing but what was ridiculous nevertheless though these poems contain some detestable passages the effect as dr johnson well observes of reality and truth became conspicuous even when the intention was to show them grovelling and degraded the pastorals ludicrous to such as prided themselves upon their refinement in spite of those disgusting passages became popular and were read with delight as just representations of rural manners and occupations  something less than sixty years after the publication of the paradise lost appeared thomsons winter which was speedily followed by his other seasons it is a work of inspiration much of it is written from himself and nobly from himself how was it received it was no sooner read says one of his contemporary biographers than universally admired those only excepted who had not been used to feel or to look for any thing in poetry beyond a point of satirical or epigrammatic wit a smart antithesis richly trimmed with rhyme or the softness of an elegiac complaint to such his manly classical spirit could not readily commend itself till after a more attentive perusal they had got the better of their prejudices and either acquired or affected a truer taste a few others stood aloof merely because they had long before fixed the articles of their poetical creed and resigned themselves to an absolute despair of ever seeing any thing new and original these were somewhat mortified to find their notions disturbed by the appearance of a poet who seemed to owe nothing but to nature and his own genius but in a short time the applause became unanimous every one wondering how so many pictures and pictures so familiar should have moved them but faintly to what they felt in his descriptions his digressions too the overflowings of a tender benevolent heart charmed the reader no less leaving him in doubt whether he should more admire the poet or love the man  this case appears to bear strongly against usbut we must distinguish between wonder and legitimate admiration the subject of the work is the changes produced in the appearances of nature by the revolution of the year and by undertaking to write in verse thomson pledged himself to treat his subject as became a poet now it is remarkable that excepting the nocturnal reverie of lady winchilsea and a passage or two in the windsor forest of pope the poetry of the period intervening between the publication of the paradise lost and the seasons does not contain a single new image of external nature and scarcely presents a familiar one from which it can be inferred that the eye of the poet had been steadily fixed upon his object much less that his feelings had urged him to work upon it in the spirit of genuine imagination to what a low state knowledge of the most obvious and important phenomena had sunk is evident from the style in which dryden has executed a description of night in one of his tragedies and pope his translation of the celebrated moonlight scene in the iliad a blind man in the habit of attending accurately to descriptions casually dropped from the lips of those around him might easily depict these appearances with more truth drydens lines are vague bombastic and senseless14 those of pope though he had homer to guide him are throughout false and contradictory the verses of dryden once highly celebrated are forgotten those of pope still retain their hold upon public estimationnay there is not a passage of descriptive poetry which at this day finds so many and such ardent admirers strange to think of an enthusiast as may have been the case with thousands reciting those verses under the cope of a moonlight sky without having his raptures in the least disturbed by a suspicion of their absurdityif these two distinguished writers could habitually think that the visible universe was of so little consequence to a poet that it was scarcely necessary for him to cast his eyes upon it we may be assured that those passages of the older poets which faithfully and poetically describe the phenomena of nature were not at that time holden in much estimation and that there was little accurate attention paid to those appearances  14 cortes alone in a nightgown  all things are hushd as natures self lay dead the mountains seem to nod their drowsy head the little birds in dreams their songs repeat and sleeping flowers beneath the nightdew sweat even lust and envy sleep yet love denies rest to my soul and slumber to my eyes  drydens indian emperor  wonder is the natural product of ignorance and as the soil was in such good condition at the time of the publication of the seasons the crop was doubtless abundant neither individuals nor nations become corrupt all at once nor are they enlightened in a moment thomson was an inspired poet but he could not work miracles in cases where the art of seeing had in some degree been learned the teacher would further the proficiency of his pupils but he could do little more though so far does vanity assist men in acts of selfdeception that many would often fancy they recognised a likeness when they knew nothing of the original having shown that much of what his biographer deemed genuine admiration must in fact have been blind wondermenthow is the rest to be accounted forthomson was fortunate in the very title of his poem which seemed to bring it home to the prepared sympathies of every one in the next place notwithstanding his high powers he writes a vicious style and his false ornaments are exactly of that kind which would be most likely to strike the undiscerning he likewise abounds with sentimental commonplaces that from the manner in which they were brought forward bore an imposing air of novelty in any wellused copy of the seasons the book generally opens of itself with the rhapsody on love or with one of the stories perhaps damon and musidora these also are prominent in our collections of extracts and are the parts of his work which after all were probably most efficient in first recommending the author to general notice pope repaying praises which he had received and wishing to extol him to the highest only styles him an elegant and philosophical poet nor are we able to collect any unquestionable proofs that the true characteristics of thomsons genius as an imaginative poet15 were perceived till the elder warton almost forty years after the publication of the seasons pointed them out by a note in his essay on the life and writings of pope in the castle of indolence of which gray speaks so coldly these characteristics were almost as conspicuously displayed and in verse more harmonious and diction more pure yet that fine poem was neglected on its appearance and is at this day the delight only of a few  15 since these observations upon thomson were written i have perused the second edition of his seasons and find that even that does not contain the most striking passages which warton points out for admiration these with other improvements throughout the whole work must have been added at a later period  when thomson died collins breathed forth his regrets in an elegiac poem in which he pronounces a poetical curse upon him who should regard with insensibility the place where the poets remains were deposited the poems of the mourner himself have now passed through innumerable editions and are universally known but if when collins died the same kind of imprecation had been pronounced by a surviving admirer small is the number whom it would not have comprehended the notice which his poems attained during his lifetime was so small and of course the sale so insignificant that not long before his death he deemed it right to repay to the bookseller the sum which he had advanced for them and threw the edition into the fire  next in importance to the seasons of thomson though at considerable distance from that work in order of time come the reliques of ancient english poetry collected newmodelled and in many instances if such a contradiction in terms may be used composed by the editor dr percy this work did not steal silently into the world as is evident from the number of legendary tales that appeared not long after its publication and had been modelled as the authors persuaded themselves after the old ballad the compilation was however ill suited to the then existing taste of city society and dr johnson mid the little senate to which he gave laws was not sparing in his exertions to make it an object of contempt the critic triumphed the legendary imitators were deservedly disregarded and as undeservedly their illimitated models sank in this country into temporary neglect while bürger and other able writers of germany were translating or imitating these reliques and composing with the aid of inspiration thence derived poems which are the delight of the german nation dr percy was so abashed by the ridicule flung upon his labours from the ignorance and insensibility of the persons with whom he lived that though while he was writing under a mask he had not wanted resolution to follow his genius into the regions of true simplicity and genuine pathos as is evinced by the exquisite ballad of sir cauline and by many other pieces yet when he appeared in his own person and character as a poetical writer he adopted as in the tale of the hermit of warkworth a diction scarcely in any one of its features distinguishable from the vague the glossy and unfeeling language of his day i mention this remarkable fact16 with regret esteeming the genius of dr percy in this kind of writing superior to that of any other man by whom in modern times it has been cultivated that even bürger to whom klopstock gave in my hearing a commendation which he denied to goethe and schiller pronouncing him to be a genuine poet and one of the few among the germans whose works would last had not the fine sensibility of percy might be shown from many passages in which he has deserted his original only to go astray for example      now daye was gone and night was come     and all were fast

itself the blue waves of ullin roll in light the green hills are covered with day trees shake their dusky heads in the breeze grey torrents pour their noisy streams two green hills with aged oaks surround a narrow plain the blue course of a stream is there on its banks stood cairbar of atha his spear supports the king the red eyes of his fear are sad cormac rises on his soul with all his ghastly wounds precious memorandums from the pocketbook of the blind ossian  if it be unbecoming as i acknowledge that for the most part it is to speak disrespectfully of works that have enjoyed for a length of time a widelyspread reputation without at the same time producing irrefragable proofs of their unworthiness let me be forgiven upon this occasionhaving had the good fortune to be born and reared in a mountainous country from my very childhood i have felt the falsehood that pervades the volumes imposed upon the world under the name of ossian from what i saw with my own eyes i knew that the imagery was spurious in nature everything is distinct yet nothing defined into absolute independent singleness in macphersons work it is exactly the reverse every thing that is not stolen is in this manner defined insulated dislocated deadenedyet nothing distinct it will always be so when words are substituted for things to say that the characters never could exist that the manners are impossible and that a dream has more substance than the whole state of society as there depicted is doing nothing more than pronouncing a censure which macpherson defied when with the steeps of morven before his eyes he could talk so familiarly of his carborne heroesof morven which if one may judge from its appearance at the distance of a few miles contains scarcely an acre of ground sufficiently accommodating for a sledge to be trailed along its surfacemr malcolm laing has ably shown that the diction of this pretended translation is a motley assemblage from all quarters but he is so fond of making out parallel passages as to call poor macpherson to account for his ands and his buts and he has weakened his argument by conducting it as if he thought that every striking resemblance was a conscious plagiarism it is enough that the coincidences are too remarkable for its being probable or possible that they could arise in different minds without communication between them now as the translators of the bible and shakspeare milton and pope could not be indebted to macpherson it follows that he must have owed his fine feathers to them unless we are prepared gravely to assert with madame de staël that many of the characteristic beauties of our most celebrated english poets are derived from the ancient fingallian in which case the modern translator would have been but giving back to ossian his ownit is consistent that lucien buonaparte who could censure milton for having surrounded satan in the infernal regions with courtly and regal splendour should pronounce the modern ossian to be the glory of scotlanda country that has produced a dunbar a buchanan a thomson and a burns these opinions are of illomen for the epic ambition of him who has given them to the world  yet much as those pretended treasures of antiquity have been admired they have been wholly uninfluential upon the literature of the country no succeeding writer appears to have caught from them a ray of inspiration no author in the least distinguished has ventured formally to imitate themexcept the boy chatterton on their first appearance he had perceived from the successful trials which he himself had made in literary forgery how few critics were able to distinguish between a real ancient medal and a counterfeit of modern manufacture and he set himself to the work of filling a magazine with saxon poemscounterparts of those of ossian as like his as one of his misty stars is to another this incapability to amalgamate with the literature of the island is in my estimation a decisive proof that the book is essentially unnatural nor should i require any other to demonstrate it to be a forgery audacious as worthless contrast in this respect the effect of macphersons publication with the reliques of percy so unassuming so modest in their pretensionsi have already stated how much germany is indebted to this latter work and for our own country its poetry has been absolutely redeemed by it i do not think that there is an able writer in verse of the present day who would not be proud to acknowledge his obligations to the reliques i know that it is so with my friends and for myself i am happy in this occasion to make a public avowal of my own  dr johnson more fortunate in his contempt of the labours of macpherson than those of his modest friend was solicited not long after to furnish prefaces biographical and critical for the works of some of the most eminent english poets the booksellers took upon themselves to make the collection they referred probably to the most popular miscellanies and unquestionably to their books of accounts and decided upon the claim of authors to be admitted into a body of the most eminent from the familiarity of their names with the readers of that day and by the profits which from the sale of his works each had brought and was bringing to the trade the editor was allowed a limited exercise of discretion and the authors whom he recommended are scarcely to be mentioned without a smile we open the volume of prefatory lives and to our astonishment the first name we find is that of cowleywhat is become of the morningstar of english poetry where is the bright elizabethan constellation or if names be more acceptable than images where is the evertobehonoured chaucer where is spenser where sidney and lastly where he whose rights as a poet contradistinguished from those which he is universally allowed to possess as a dramatist we have vindicatedwhere shakspearethese and a multitude of others not unworthy to be placed near them their contemporaries and successors we have not but in their stead we have could better be expected when precedence was to be settled by an abstract of reputation at any given period made as in this case before us roscommon and stepney and phillips and walsh and smith and duke and king and spratthalifax granville sheffield congreve broome and other reputed magnatesmetrical writers utterly worthless and useless except for occasions like the present when their productions are referred to as evidence what a small quantity of brain is necessary to procure a considerable stock of admiration provided the aspirant will accommodate himself to the likings and fashions of his day  as i do not mean to bring down this retrospect to our own times it may with propriety be closed at the era of this distinguished event from the literature of other ages and countries proofs equally cogent might have been adduced that the opinions announced in the former part of this essay are founded upon truth it was not an agreeable office nor a prudent undertaking to declare them but their importance seemed to render it a duty it may still be asked where lies the particular relation of what has been said to these volumesthe question will be easily answered by the discerning reader who is old enough to remember the taste that prevailed when some of these poems were first published seventeen years ago who has also observed to what degree the poetry of this island has since that period been coloured by them and who is further aware of the unremitting hostility with which upon some principle or other they have each and all been opposed a sketch of my own notion of the constitution of fame has been given and as far as concerns myself i have cause to be satisfied the love the admiration the indifference the slight the aversion and even the contempt with which these poems have been received knowing as i do the source within my own mind from which they have proceeded and the labour and pains which when labour and pains appeared needful have been bestowed upon them must all if i think consistently be received as pledges and tokens bearing the same general impression though widely different in valuethey are all proofs that for the present time i have not laboured in vain and afford assurances more or less authentic that the products of my industry will endure  if there be one conclusion more forcibly pressed upon us than another by the review which has been given of the fortunes and fate of poetical works it is thisthat every author as far as he is great and at the same time original has had the task of creating the taste by which he is to be enjoyed so has it been so will it continue to be this remark was long since made to me by the philosophical friend for the separation of whose poems from my own i have previously expressed my regret the predecessors of an original genius of a high order will have smoothed the way for all that he has in common with themand much he will have in common but for what is peculiarly his own he will be called upon to clear and often to shape his own roadhe will be in the condition of hannibal among the alps  and where lies the real difficulty of creating that taste by which a truly original poet is to be relished is it in breaking the bonds of custom in overcoming the prejudices of false refinement and displacing the aversions of inexperience or if he labour for an object which here and elsewhere i have proposed to myself does it consist in divesting the reader of the pride that induces him to dwell upon those points wherein men differ from each other to the exclusion of those in which all men are alike or the same and in making him ashamed of the vanity that renders him insensible of the appropriate excellence which civil arrangements less unjust than might appear and nature illimitable in her bounty have conferred on men who may stand below him in the scale of society finally does it lie in establishing that dominion over the spirits of readers by which they are to be humbled and humanised in order that they may be purified and exalted  if these ends are to be attained by the mere communication of knowledge it does not lie heretaste i would remind the reader like imagination is a word which has been forced to extend its services far beyond the point to which philosophy would have confined them it is a metaphor taken from a passive sense of the human body and transferred to things which are in their essence not passiveto intellectual acts and operations the word imagination has been overstrained from impulses honourable to mankind to meet the demands of the faculty which is perhaps the noblest of our nature in the instance of taste the process has been reversed and from the prevalence of dispositions at once injurious and discreditable being no other than that selfishness which is the child of apathywhich as nations decline in productive and creative power makes them value themselves upon a presumed refinement of judging poverty of language is the primary cause of the use which we make of the word imagination but the word taste has been stretched to the sense which it bears in modern europe by habits of selfconceit inducing that inversion in the order of things whereby a passive faculty is made paramount among the faculties conversant with the fine arts proportion and congruity the requisite knowledge being supposed are subjects upon which taste may be trusted it is competent to this officefor in its intercourse with these the mind is passive and is affected painfully or pleasurably as by an instinct but the profound and the exquisite in feeling the lofty and universal in thought and imagination or in ordinary language the pathetic and the sublimeare neither of them accurately speaking objects of a faculty which could ever without a sinking in the spirit of nations have been designated by the metaphortaste and why because without the exertion of a cooperating power in the mind of the reader there can be no adequate sympathy with either of these emotions without this auxiliary impulse elevated or profound passion cannot exist  passion it must be observed is derived from a word which signifies suffering but the connection which suffering has with effort with exertion and action is immediate and inseparable how strikingly is this property of human nature exhibited by the fact that in popular language to be in a passion is to be angrybut      anger in hasty words or blows     itself discharges on its foes  to be moved then by a passion is to be excited often to external and always to internal effort whether for the continuance and strengthening of the passion or for its suppression accordingly as the course which it takes may be painful or pleasurable if the latter the soul must contribute to its support or it never becomes vividand soon languishes and dies and this brings us to the point if every great poet with whose writings men are familiar in the highest exercise of his genius before he can be thoroughly enjoyed has to call forth and to communicate power this service in a still greater degree falls upon an original writer at his first appearance in the worldof genius the only proof is the act of doing well what is worthy to be done and what was never done before of genius in the fine arts the only infallible sign is the widening the sphere of human sensibility for the delight honour and benefit of human nature genius is the introduction of a new element into the intellectual universe or if that be not allowed it is the application of powers to objects on which they had not before been exercised or the employment of them in such a manner as to produce effects hitherto unknown what is all this but an advance or a conquest made by the soul of the poet is it to be supposed that the reader can make progress of this kind like an indian prince or generalstretched on his palanquin and borne by his slaves no he is invigorated and inspirited by his leader in order that he may exert himself for he cannot proceed in quiescence he cannot be carried like a dead weight therefore to create taste is to call forth and bestow power of which knowledge is the effect and there lies the true difficulty  as the pathetic participates of an animal sensation it might seemthat if the springs of this emotion were genuine all men possessed of competent knowledge of the facts and circumstances would be instantaneously affected and doubtless in the works of every true poet will be found passages of that species of excellence which is proved by effects immediate and universal but there are emotions of the pathetic that are simple and direct and othersthat are complex and revolutionary someto which the heart yields with gentleness othersagainst which it struggles with pride these varieties are infinite as the combinations of circumstance and the constitutions of character remember also that the medium through which in poetry the heart is to be affectedis language a thing subject to endless fluctuations and arbitrary associations the genius of the poet melts these down for his purpose but they retain their shape and quality to him who is not capable of exerting within his own mind a corresponding energy there is also a meditative as well as a human pathos an enthusiastic as well as an ordinary sorrow a sadness that has its seat in the depths of reason to which the mind cannot sink gently of itselfbut to which it must descend by treading the steps of thought and for the sublimeif we consider what are the cares that occupy the passing day and how remote is the practice and the course of life from the sources of sublimity in the soul of man can it be wondered that there is little existing preparation for a poet charged with a new mission to extend its kingdom and to augment and spread its enjoyments  away then with the senseless iteration of the word popular applied to new works in poetry as if there were no test of excellence in this first of the fine arts but that all men should run after its productions as if urged by an appetite or constrained by a spellthe qualities of writing best fitted for eager reception are either such as startle the world into attention by their audacity and extravagance or they are chiefly of a superficial kind lying upon the surfaces of manners or arising out of a selection and arrangement of incidents by which the mind is kept upon the stretch of curiosity and the fancy amused without the trouble of thought but in every thing which is to send the soul into herself to be admonished of her weakness or to be made conscious of her powerwherever life and nature are described as operated upon by the creative or abstracting virtue of the imagination wherever the instinctive wisdom of antiquity and her heroic passions uniting in the heart of the poet with the meditative wisdom of later ages have produced that accord of sublimated humanity which is at once a history of the remote past and a prophetic enunciation of the remotest future there the poet must reconcile himself for a season to few and scattered hearersgrand thoughts and shakspeare must often have sighed over this truth as they are most naturally and most fitly conceived in solitude so can they not be brought forth in the midst of plaudits without some violation of their sanctity go to a silent exhibition of the productions of the sister art and be convinced that the qualities which dazzle at first sight and kindle the admiration of the multitude are essentially different from those by which permanent influence is secured let us not shrink from following up these principles as far as they will carry us and conclude with observingthat there never has been a period and perhaps never will be in which vicious poetry of some kind or other has not excited more zealous admiration and been far more generally read than good but this advantage attends the good that the individual as well as the species survives from age to age whereas of the depraved though the species be immortal the individual quickly perishes the object of present admiration vanishes being supplanted by some other as easily produced which though no better brings with it at least the irritation of noveltywith adaptation more or less skilful to the changing humours of the majority of those who are most at leisure to regard poetical works when they first solicit their attention  is it the result of the whole that in the opinion of the writer the judgment of the people is not to be respected the thought is most injurious and could the charge be brought against him he would repel it with indignation the people have already been justified and their eulogium pronounced by implication when it was said abovethat of good poetry the individual as well as the species survives and how does it survive but through the people what preserves it but their intellect and their wisdom      past and future are the wings     on whose support harmoniously conjoined     moves the great spirit of human knowledgems  the voice that issues from this spirit is that vox populi which the deity inspires foolish must he be who can mistake for this a local acclamation or a transitory outcrytransitory though it be for years local though from a nation still more lamentable is his error who can believe that there is any thing of divine infallibility in the clamour of that small though loud portion of the community ever governed by factitious influence which under the name of the public passes itself upon the unthinking for the people towards the public the writer hopes that he feels as much deference as it is entitled to but to the people philosophically characterised and to the embodied spirit of their knowledge so far as it exists and moves at the present faithfully supported by its two wings the past and the future his devout respect his reverence is due he offers it willingly and readily and this done takes leave of his readers by assuring themthat if he were not persuaded that the contents of these volumes and the work to which they are subsidiary evince something of the vision and the faculty divine and that both in words and things they will operate in their degree to extend the domain of sensibility for the delight the honour and the benefit of human nature notwithstanding the many happy hours which he has employed in their composition and the manifold comforts and enjoyments they have procured to him he would not if a wish could do it save them from immediate destructionfrom becoming at this moment to the world as a thing that had never been  1815     d of poetry as observation and description  the powers requisite for the production of poetry are first those of observation and descriptionie the ability to observe with accuracy things as they are in themselves and with fidelity to describe them unmodified by any passion or feeling existing in the mind of the describer whether the things depicted be actually present to the senses or have a place only in the memory this power though indispensable to a poet is one which he employs only in submission to necessity and never for a continuance of time as its exercise supposes all the higher qualities of the mind to be passive and in a state of subjection to external objects much in the same way as a translator or engraver ought to be to his original 2ndly sensibilitywhich the more exquisite it is the wider will be the range of a poets perceptions and the more will he be incited to observe objects both as they exist in themselves and as reacted upon by his own mind the distinction between poetic and human sensibility has been marked in the character of the poet delineated in the original preface 3dly reflectionwhich makes the poet acquainted with the value of actions images thoughts and feelings and assists the sensibility in perceiving their connection with each other 4thly imagination and fancyto modify to create and to associate 5thly inventionby which characters are composed out of materials supplied by observation whether of the poets own heart and mind or of external life and nature and such incidents and situations produced as are most impressive to the imagination and most fitted to do justice to the characters sentiments and passions which the poet undertakes to illustrate and lastly judgmentto decide how and where and in what degree each of these faculties ought to be exerted so that the less shall not be sacrificed to the greater nor the greater slighting the less arrogate to its own injury more than its due by judgment also is determined what are the laws and appropriate graces of every species of composition17  17 as sensibility to harmony of numbers and the power of producing it are invariably attendants upon the faculties above specified nothing has been said upon those requisites  the materials of poetry by these powers collected and produced are cast by means of various moulds into divers forms the moulds may be enumerated and the forms specified in the following order 1st the narrativeincluding the epopoeia the historic poem the tale the romance the mockheroic and if the spirit of homer will tolerate such neighbourhood that dear production of our days the metrical novel of this class the distinguishing mark is that the narrator however liberally his speaking agents be introduced is himself the source from which every thing primarily flows epic poets in order that their mode of composition may accord with the elevation of their subject represent themselves as singing from the inspiration of the muse arma virumque cano but this is a fiction in modern times of slight value the iliad or the paradise lost would gain little in our estimation by being chanted the other poets who belong to this class are commonly content to tell their taleso that of the whole it may be affirmed that they neither require nor reject the accompaniment of music  2ndly the dramaticconsisting of tragedy historic drama comedy and masque in which the poet does not appear at all in his own person and where the whole action is carried on by speech and dialogue of the agents music being admitted only incidentally and rarely the opera may be placed here inasmuch as it proceeds by dialogue though depending to the degree that it does upon music it has a strong claim to be ranked with the lyrical the characteristic and impassioned epistle of which ovid and pope have given examples considered as a species of monodrama may without impropriety be placed in this class  3dly the lyricalcontaining the hymn the ode the elegy the song and the ballad in all which for the production of their full effect an accompaniment of music is indispensable  4thly the idylliumdescriptive chiefly either of the processes and appearances of external nature as the seasons of thomson or of characters manners and sentiments as are shenstones schoolmistress the cotters saturday night of burns the twa dogs of the same author or of these in conjunction with the appearances of nature as most of the pieces of theocritus the allegro and penseroso of milton beatties minstrel goldsmiths deserted village the epitaph the inscription the sonnet most of the epistles of poets writing in their own persons and all locodescriptive poetry belong to this class  5thly didacticthe principal object of which is direct instruction as the poem of lucretius the georgics of virgil the fleece of dyer masons english garden c  and lastly philosophical satire like that of horace and juvenal personal and occasional satire rarely comprehending sufficient of the general in the individual to be dignified with the name of poetry  out of the three last has been constructed a composite order of which youngs night thoughts and cowpers task are excellent examples  it is deducible from the above that poems apparently miscellaneous may with propriety be arranged either with reference to the powers of mind predominant in the production of them or to the mould in which they are cast or lastly to the subjects to which they relate from each of these considerations the following poems have been divided into classes which that the work may more obviously correspond with the course of human life and for the sake of exhibiting in it the three requisites of a legitimate whole a beginning a middle and an end have been also arranged as far as it was possible according to an order of time commencing with childhood and terminating with old age death and immortality my guiding wish was that the small pieces of which these volumes consist thus discriminated might be regarded under a twofold view as composing an entire work within themselves and as adjuncts to the philosophical poem the recluse this arrangement has long presented itself habitually to my own mind nevertheless i should have preferred to scatter the contents of these volumes at random if i had been persuaded that by the plan adopted any thing material would be taken from the natural effect of the pieces individually on the mind of the unreflecting reader i trust there is a sufficient variety in each class to prevent this while for him who reads with reflection the arrangement will serve as a commentary unostentatiously directing his attention to my purposes both particular and general but as i wish to guard against the possibility of misleading by this classification it is proper first to remind the reader that certain poems are placed according to the powers of mind in the authors conception predominant in the production of them predominant which implies the exertion of other faculties in less degree where there is more imagination than fancy in a poem it is placed under the head of imagination and vice versâ both the above classes might without impropriety have been enlarged from that consisting of poems founded on the affections as might this latter from those and from the class proceeding from sentiment and reflection the most striking characteristics of each piece mutual illustration variety and proportion have governed me throughout  none of the other classes except those of fancy and imagination require any particular notice but a remark of general application may be made all poets except the dramatic have been in the practice of feigning that their works were composed to the music of the harp or lyre with what degree of affectation this has been done in modern times i leave to the judicious to determine for my own part i have not been disposed to violate probability so far or to make such a large demand upon the readers charity some of these pieces are essentially lyrical and therefore cannot have their due force without a supposed musical accompaniment but in much the greatest part as a substitute for the classic lyre or romantic harp i require nothing more than an animated or impassioned recitation adapted to the subject poems however humble in their kind if they be good in that kind cannot read themselves the law of long syllable and short must not be so inflexiblethe letter of metre must not be so impassive to the spirit of versificationas to deprive the reader of all voluntary power to modulate in subordination to the sense the music of the poemin the same manner as his mind is left at liberty and even summoned to act upon its thoughts and images but though the accompaniment of a musical instrument be frequently dispensed with the true poet does not therefore abandon his privilege distinct from that of the mere proseman      he murmurs near the running brooks     a music sweeter than their own  let us come now to the consideration of the words fancy and imagination as employed in the classification of the following poems a man says an intelligent author has imagination in proportion as he can distinctly copy in idea the impressions of sense it is the faculty which images within the mind the phenomena of sensation a man has fancy in proportion as he can call up connect or associate at pleasure those internal images greek phantazein is to cause to appear so as to complete ideal representations of absent objects imagination is the power of depicting and fancy of evoking and combining the imagination is formed by patient observation the fancy by a voluntary activity in shifting the scenery of the mind the more accurate the imagination the more safely may a painter or a poet undertake a delineation or a description without the presence of the objects to be characterised the more versatile the fancy the more original and striking will be the decorations producedbritish synonyms discriminated by w taylor  is not this as if a man should undertake to supply an account of a building and be so intent upon what he had discovered of the foundation as to conclude his task without once looking up at the superstructure here as in other instances throughout the volume the judicious authors mind is enthralled by etymology he takes up the original word as his guide and escort and too often does not perceive how soon he becomes its prisoner without liberty to tread in any path but that to which it confines him it is not easy to find out how imagination thus explained differs from distinct remembrance of images or fancy from quick and vivid recollection of them each is nothing more than a mode of memory if the two words bear the above meaning and no other what term is left to designate that faculty of which the poet is all compact he whose eye glances from earth to heaven whose spiritual attributes body forth what his pen is prompt in turning to shape or what is left to characterise fancy as insinuating herself into the heart of objects with creative activity imagination in the sense of the word as giving title to a class of the following poems has no reference to images that are merely a faithful copy existing in the mind of absent external objects but is a word of higher import denoting operations of the mind upon those objects and processes of creation or of composition governed by certain fixed laws i proceed to illustrate my meaning by instances a parrot hangs from the wires of his cage by his beak or by his claws or a monkey from the bough of a tree by his paws or his tail each creature does so literally and actually in the first eclogue of virgil the shepherd thinking of the time when he is to take leave of his farm thus addresses his goats      non ego vos posthac viridi projectus in antro     dumosa pendere procul de rupe videbo                    half way down     hangs one who gathers samphire  is the wellknown expression of shakspeare delineating an ordinary image upon the cliffs of dover in these two instances is a slight exertion of the faculty which i denominate imagination in the use of one word neither the goats nor the samphiregatherer do literally hang as does the parrot or the monkey but presenting to the senses something of such an appearance the mind in its activity for its own gratification contemplates them as hanging      as when far off at sea a fleet descried     hangs in the clouds by equinoctial wind     close sailing from bengala or the isles     of ternate or tidore whence merchants bring     their spicy drugs they on the trading flood     through the wide ethiopian to the cape     ply stemming nightly toward the pole so seemed     far off the flying fiend   here is the full strength of the imagination involved in the word hangs and exerted upon the whole image first the fleet an aggregate of many ships is represented as one mighty person whose track we know and feel is upon the waters but taking advantage of its appearance to the senses the poet dares to represent it as hanging in the clouds both for the gratification of the mind in contemplating the image itself and in reference to the motion and appearance of the sublime objects to which it is compared  from impressions of sight we will pass to those of sound which as they must necessarily be of a less definite character shall be selected from these volumes      over his own sweet voice the stockdove broods  of the same bird      his voice was buried among trees     yet to be come at by the breeze      o cuckoo shall i call thee bird     or but a wandering voice  the stockdove is said to coo a sound well imitating the note of the bird but by the intervention of the metaphor broods the affections are called in by the imagination to assist in marking the manner in which the bird reiterates and prolongs her soft note as if herself delighting to listen to it and participating of a still and quiet satisfaction like that which may be supposed inseparable from the continuous process of incubation his voice was buried among the trees a metaphor expressing the love of seclusion by which this bird is marked and characterising its note as not partaking of the shrill and the piercing and therefore more easily deadened by the intervening shade yet a note so peculiar and withal so pleasing that the breeze gifted with that love of the sound which the poet feels penetrates the shades in which it is entombed and conveys it to the ear of the listener      shall i call thee bird     or but a wandering voice  this concise interrogation characterises the seeming ubiquity of the voice of the cuckoo and dispossesses the creature almost of a corporeal existence the imagination being tempted to this exertion of her power by a consciousness in the memory that the cuckoo is almost perpetually heard throughout the season of spring but seldom becomes an object of sight  thus far of images independent of each other and immediately endowed by the mind with properties that do not inhere in them upon an incitement from properties and qualities the existence of which is inherent and obvious these processes of imagination are carried on either by conferring additional properties upon an object or abstracting from it some of those which it actually possesses and thus enabling it to react upon the mind which hath performed the process like a new existence  i pass from the imagination acting upon an individual image to a consideration of the same faculty employed upon images in a conjunction by which they modify each other the reader has already had a fine instance before him in the passage quoted from virgil where the apparently perilous situation of the goat hanging upon the shaggy precipice is contrasted with that of the shepherd contemplating it from the seclusion of the cavern in which he lies stretched at ease and in security take these images separately and how unaffecting the picture compared with that produced by their being thus connected with and opposed to each other      as a huge stone is sometimes seen to lie     couched on the bald top of an eminence     wonder to all who do the same espy     by what means it could thither come and whence     so that it seems a thing endued with sense     like a seabeast crawled forth which on a shelf     of rock or sand reposeth there to sun himself      such seemed this man not all alive or dead     nor all asleep in his extreme old age                                           motionless as a cloud the old man stood     that heareth not the loud winds when they call     and moveth altogether if it move at all  in these images the conferring the abstracting and the modifying powers of the imagination immediately and mediately acting are all brought into conjunction the stone is endowed with something of the power of life to approximate it to the seabeast and the seabeast stripped of some of its vital qualities to assimilate it to the stone which intermediate image is thus treated for the purpose of bringing the original image that of the stone to a nearer resemblance to the figure and condition of the aged man who is divested of so much of the indications of life and motion as to bring him to the point where the two objects unite and coalesce in just comparison after what has been said the image of the cloud need not be commented upon  thus far of an endowing or modifying power but the imagination also shapes and creates and how by innumerable processes and in none does it more delight than in that of consolidating numbers into unity and dissolving and separating unity into numberalternations proceeding from and governed by a sublime consciousness of the soul in her own mighty and almost divine powers recur to the passage already cited from milton when the compact fleet as one person has been introduced sailing from bengala they ie the merchants representing the fleet resolved into a multitude of ships ply their voyage towards the extremities of the earth so referring to the word as in the commencement seemed the flying fiend the image of his person acting to recombine the multitude of ships into one bodythe point from which the comparison set out so seemed and to whom seemed to the heavenly muse who dictates the poem to the eye of the poets mind and to that of the reader present at one moment in the wide ethiopian and the next in the solitudes then first broken in upon of the infernal regions      modo me thebis modo ponit athenis  here again this mighty poetspeaking of the messiah going forth to expel from heaven the rebellious angels      attended by ten thousand thousand saints     he onward came far off his coming shone  the retinue of saints and the person of the messiah himself lost almost and merged in the splendour of that indefinite abstraction his coming  as i do not mean here to treat this subject further than to throw some light upon the present volumes and especially upon one division of them i shall spare myself and the reader the trouble of considering the imagination as it deals with thoughts and sentiments as it regulates the composition of characters and determines the course of actions i will not consider it more than i have already done by implication as that power which in the language of one of my most esteemed friends draws all things to one which makes things animate or inanimate beings with their attributes subjects with their accessaries take one colour and serve to one effect18 the grand storehouses of enthusiastic and meditative imagination of poetical as contradistinguished from human and dramatic imagination are the prophetic and lyrical parts of the holy scriptures and the works of milton to which i cannot forbear to add those of spenser i select these writers in preference to those of ancient greece and rome because the anthropomorphitism of the pagan religion subjected the minds of the greatest poets in those countries too much to the bondage of definite form from which the hebrews were preserved by their abhorrence of idolatry this abhorrence was almost as strong in our great epic poet both from circumstances of his life and from the constitution of his mind however imbued the surface might be with classical literature he was a hebrew in soul and all things tended in him towards the sublime spenser of a gentler nature maintained his freedom by aid of his allegorical spirit at one time inciting him to create persons out of abstractions and at another by a superior effort of genius to give the universality and permanence of abstractions to his human beings by means of attributes and emblems that belong to the highest moral truths and the purest sensationsof which his character of una is a glorious example of the human and dramatic imagination the works of shakspeare are an inexhaustible source  18 charles lamb upon the genius of hogarth      i tax not you ye elements with unkindness     i never gave you kingdoms calld you daughters   and if bearing in mind the many poets distinguished by this prime quality whose names i omit to mention yet justified by recollection of the insults which the ignorant the incapable and the presumptuous have heaped upon these and my other writings i may be permitted to anticipate the judgment of posterity upon myself i shall declare censurable i grant if the notoriety of the fact above stated does not justify me that i have given in these unfavourable times evidence of exertions of this faculty upon its worthiest objects the external universe the moral and religious sentiments of man his natural affections and his acquired passions which have the same ennobling tendency as the productions of men in this kind worthy to be holden in undying remembrance  to the mode in which fancy has already been characterised as the power of evoking and combining or as my friend mr coleridge has styled it the aggregative and associative power my objection is only that the definition is too general to aggregate and to associate to evoke and to combine belong as well to the imagination as to the fancy but either the materials evoked and combined are different or they are brought together under a different law and for a different purpose fancy does not require that the materials which she makes use of should be susceptible of change in their constitution from her touch and where they admit of modification it is enough for her purpose if it be slight limited and evanescent directly the reverse of these are the desires and demands of the imagination she recoils from everything but the plastic the pliant and the indefinite she leaves it to fancy to describe queen mab as coming      in shape no bigger than an agatestone     on the forefinger of an alderman  having to speak of stature she does not tell you that her gigantic angel was as tall as pompeys pillar much less that he was twelve cubits or twelve hundred cubits high or that his dimensions equalled those of teneriffe or atlasbecause these and if they were a million times as high it would be the same are bounded the expression is his stature reached the sky the illimitable firmamentwhen the imagination frames a comparison if it does not strike on the first presentation a sense of the truth of the likeness from the moment that it is perceived growsand continues to growupon the mind the resemblance depending less upon outline of form and feature than upon expression and effect less upon casual and outstanding than upon inherent and internal properties moreover the images invariably modify each otherthe law under which the processes of fancy are carried on is as capricious as the accidents of things and the effects are surprising playful ludicrous amusing tender or pathetic as the objects happen to be appositely produced or fortunately combined fancy depends upon the rapidity and profusion with which she scatters her thoughts and images trusting that their number and the felicity with which they are linked together will make amends for the want of individual value or she prides herself upon the curious subtilty and the successful elaboration with which she can detect their lurking affinities if she can win you over to her purpose and impart to you her feelings she cares not how unstable or transitory may be her influence knowing that it will not be out of her power to resume it upon an apt occasion but the imagination is conscious of an indestructible dominionthe soul may fall away from it not being able to sustain its grandeur but if once felt and acknowledged by no act of any other faculty of the mind can it be relaxed impaired or diminishedfancy is given to quicken and to beguile the temporal part of our nature imagination to incite and to support the eternalyet is it not the less true that fancy as she is an active is also under her own laws and in her own spirit a creative faculty in what manner fancy ambitiously aims at a rivalship with imagination and imagination stoops to work with materials of fancy might be illustrated from the compositions of all eloquent writers whether in prose or verse and chiefly from those of our own country scarcely a page of the impassioned parts of bishop taylors works can be opened that shall not afford examplesreferring the reader to those inestimable volumes i will content myself with placing a conceit ascribed to lord chesterfield in contrast with a passage from the paradise lost      the dews of the evening most carefully shun     they are the tears of the sky for the loss of the sun  after the transgression of adam milton with other appearances of sympathising nature thus marks the immediate consequence      sky lowered and muttering thunder some sad drops     wept at completion of the mortal sin  the associating link is the same in each instance dew and rain not distinguishable from the liquid substance of tears are employed as indications of sorrow a flash of surprise is the effect in the former case a flash of surprise and nothing more for the nature of things does not sustain the combination in the latter the effects from the act of which there is this immediate consequence and visible sign are so momentous that the mind acknowledges the justice and reasonableness of the sympathy in nature so manifested and the sky weeps drops of water as if with human eyes as earth had before trembled from her entrails and nature given a second groan  finally i will refer to cottons ode upon winter an admirable composition though stained with some peculiarities of the age in which he lived for a general illustration of the characteristics of fancy the middle part of this ode contains a most lively description of the entrance of winter with his retinue as a palsied king and yet a military monarchadvancing for conquest with his army the several bodies of which and their arms and equipments are described with a rapidity of detail and a profusion of fanciful comparisons which indicate on the part of the poet extreme activity of intellect and a correspondent hurry of delightful feeling winter retires from the foe into his fortress where            a magazine     of sovereign juice is cellared in     liquor that will the siege maintain     should phoebus neer return again  though myself a waterdrinker i cannot resist the pleasure of transcribing what follows as an instance still more happy of fancy employed in the treatment of feeling than in its preceding passages the poem supplies of her management of forms      tis that that gives the poet rage     and thaws the gellyd blood of age     matures the young restores the old     and makes the fainting coward bold      it lays the careful head to rest     calms palpitations in the breast     renders our lives misfortune sweet                                           then let the chill sirocco blow     and gird us round with hills of snow     or else go whistle to the shore     and make the hollow mountains roar      whilst we together jovial sit     careless and crowned with mirth and wit     where though bleak winds confine us home     our fancies round the world shall roam      well think of all the friends we know     and drink to all worth drinking to     when having drunk all thine and mine     we rather shall want healths than wine      but where friends fail us well supply     our friendships with our charity     men that remote in sorrows live     shall by our lusty brimmers thrive      well drink

write this preface it was my intention to have made it more comprehensive but thinking that i ought rather to apologise for detaining the reader so long i will here conclude                                       dedication prefixed to the edition of 1815   to sir george howland beaumont bart  my dear sir george  accept my thanks for the permission given me to dedicate these volumes to you in addition to a lively pleasure derived from general considerations i feel a particular satisfaction for by inscribing these poems with your name i seem to myself in some degree to repay by an appropriate honour the great obligation which i owe to one part of the collectionas having been the means of first making us personally known to each other upon much of the remainder also you have a peculiar claimfor some of the best pieces were composed under the shade of your own groves upon the classic ground of coleorton where i was animated by the recollection of those illustrious poets of your name and family who were born in that neighbourhood and we may be assured did not wander with indifference by the dashing stream of grace dieu and among the rocks that diversify the forest of charnwoodnor is there any one to whom such parts of this collection as have been inspired or coloured by the beautiful country from which i now address you could be presented with more propriety than to yourselfto whom it has suggested so many admirable pictures early in life the sublimity and beauty of this region excited your admiration and i know that you are bound to it in mind by a still strengthening attachment  wishing and hoping that this work with the embellishments it has received from your pencil may survive as a lasting memorial of a friendship which i reckon among the blessings of my life  i have the honour to be my dear sir george         yours most affectionately and faithfully                          william wordsworth rydal mount westmoreland       february 1 1815     e of the excursion  the titlepage announces that this is only a portion of a poem and the reader must be here apprised that it belongs to the second part of a long and laborious work which is to consist of three partsthe author will candidly acknowledge that if the first of these had been completed and in such a manner as to satisfy his own mind he should have preferred the natural order of publication and have given that to the world first but as the second division of the work was designed to refer more to passing events and to an existing state of things than the others were meant to do more continuous exertion was naturally bestowed upon it and greater progress made here than in the rest of the poem and as this part does not depend upon the preceding to a degree which will materially injure its own peculiar interest the author complying with the earnest entreaties of some valued friends presents the following pages to the public  it may be proper to state whence the poem of which the excursion is a part derives its title of the recluseseveral years ago when the author retired to his native mountains with the hope of being enabled to construct a literary work that might live it was a reasonable thing that he should take a review of his own mind and examine how far nature and education had qualified him for such employment as subsidiary to this preparation he undertook to record in verse the origin and progress of his own powers as far as he was acquainted with them that work addressed to a dear friend most distinguished for his knowledge and genius and to whom the authors intellect is deeply indebted has been long finished and the result of the investigation which gave rise to it was a determination to compose a philosophical poem containing views of man nature and society and to be entitled the recluse as having for its principal subject the sensations and opinions of a poet living in retirementthe preparatory poem is biographical and conducts the history of the authors mind to the point when he was emboldened to hope that his faculties were sufficiently matured for entering upon the arduous labour which he had proposed to himself and the two works have the same kind of relation to each other if he may so express himself as the antechapel has to the body of a gothic church continuing this allusion he may be permitted to add that his minor pieces which have been long before the public when they shall be properly arranged will be found by the attentive reader to have such connection with the main work as may give them claim to be likened to the little cells oratories and sepulchral recesses ordinarily included in those edifices  the author would not have deemed himself justified in saying upon this occasion so much of performances either unfinished or unpublished if he had not thought that the labour bestowed by him upon what he has heretofore and now laid before the public entitled him to candid attention for such a statement as he thinks necessary to throw light upon his endeavours to please and he would hope to benefit his countrymennothing further need be added than that the first and third parts of the recluse will consist chiefly of meditations in the authors own person and that in the intermediate part the excursion the intervention of characters speaking is employed and something of a dramatic form adopted  it is not the authors intention formally to announce a system it was more animating to him to proceed in a different course and if he shall succeed in conveying to the mind clear thoughts lively images and strong feelings the reader will have no difficulty in extracting the system for himself and in the mean time the following passage taken from the conclusion of the first book of the recluse may be acceptable as a kind of prospectus of the design and scope of the whole poem      on man on nature and on human life     musing in solitude i oft perceive     fair trains of imagery before me rise     accompanied by feelings of delight     pure or with no unpleasing sadness mixed     and i am conscious of affecting thoughts     and dear remembrances whose presence soothes     or elevates the mind intent to weigh     the good and evil of our mortal state     to these emotions whencesoeer they come     whether from breath of outward circumstance     or from the soulan impulse to herself     i would give utterance in numerous verse     of truth of grandeur beauty love and hope     and melancholy fear subdued by faith     of blessed consolations in distress     of

letter to sir george h beaumont bart                             grasmere 14th october 1803  dear sir george  if any person were to be informed of the particulars of your kindness to meif it were described to him in all its delicacy and noblenessand he should afterwards be told that i suffered eight weeks to elapse without writing to you one word of thanks or acknowledgment he would deem it a thing absolutely impossible it is nevertheless true this is in fact the first time that i have taken up a pen not for writing letters but on any account whatsoever except once since mr coleridge showed me the writings of the applethwaite estate and told me the little history of what you had done for me the motives c i need not say that it gave me the most heartfelt pleasure not for my own sake chiefly though in that point of view it might well be most highly interesting to me but as an act which considered in all its relations as to matter and manner it would not be too much to say did honour to human nature at least i felt it as such and it overpowered me  owing to a set of painful and uneasy sensations which i have more or less at all times about my chest from a disease which chiefly affects my nerves and digestive organs and which makes my aversion from writing little less than madness i deferred writing to you being at first made still more uncomfortable by travelling and loathing to do violence to myself in what ought to be an act of pure pleasure and enjoyment viz the expression of my deep sense of your goodness this feeling was indeed so strong in me as to make me look upon the act of writing to you not as the work of a moment but as a business with something little less than awful in it a task a duty a thing not to be done but in my best my purest and my happiest moments many of these i had but then i had not my pen and ink and my paper before me my conveniences my appliances and means to boot all which the moment that i thought of them seemed to disturb and impair the sanctity of my pleasure i contented myself with thinking over my complacent feelings and breathing forth solitary gratulations and thanksgivings which i did in many a sweet and many a wild place during my late tour in this shape procrastination became irresistible to me at last i said i will write at home from my own fireside when i shall be at ease and in comfort i have now been more than a fortnight at home but the uneasiness in my chest has made me beat off the time when the pen was to be taken up i do not know from what cause it is but during the last three years i have never had a pen in my hand for five minutes before my whole frame becomes one bundle of uneasiness a perspiration starts out all over me and my chest is oppressed in a manner which i cannot describe this is a sad weakness for i am sure though it is chiefly owing to the state of my body that by exertion of mind i might in part control it so however it is and i mention it because i am sure when you are made acquainted with the circumstances though the extent to which it exists nobody can well conceive you will look leniently upon my silence and rather pity than blame me though i must still continue to reproach myself as i have done bitterly every day for these last eight weeks one thing in particular has given me great uneasiness it is least in the extreme delicacy of your mind which is well known to me you for a moment may have been perplexed by a single apprehension that there might be any error anything which i might misconceive in your kindness to me when i think of the possibility of this i am vexed beyond measure that i had not resolution to write immediately but i hope that these fears are all groundless and that you have as i know your nature will lead you to do suspended your judgment upon my silence blaming me indeed but in that qualified way in which a good man blames what he believes will be found an act of venial infirmity when it is fully explained but i have troubled you far too much with this such i am however and deeply i regret that i am such i shall conclude with solemnly assuring you late as it is that nothing can wear out of my heart as long as my faculties remain the deep feeling which i have of your delicate and noble conduct towards me  it is now high time to speak of the estate and what is to be done with it it is a most delightful situation and few things would give me greater pleasure than to realise the plan which you had in view for me of building a house there but i am afraid i am sorry to say that the chances are very much against this partly on account of the state of my own affairs and still more from the improbability of mr coleridges continuing in the country the writings are at present in my possession and what i should wish is that i might be considered at present as steward of the land with liberty to lay out the rent in planting or any other improvement which might be thought advisable with a view to building upon it and if it should be out of my power to pitch my own tent there i would then request that you would give me leave to restore the property to your own hands in order that you might have the opportunity of again presenting it to some worthy person who might be so fortunate as to be able to make that pleasant use of it which it was your wish that i should have done  mr coleridge informed me that immediately after you left keswick he had as i requested returned you thanks for those two elegant drawings which you were so good as to leave for me the present is valuable in itself and i consider it as a high honour conferred on me how often did we wish for five minutes command of your pencil while we were in scotland or rather that you had been with us sometimes i am sure you would have been highly delighted in one thing scotland is superior to every country i have travelled in i mean the graceful beauty of the dresses and figures there is a tone of imagination about them beyond anything i have seen elsewhere  mr coleridge i understand has written to you several times lately so of course he will have told you when and why he left us i am glad he did as i am sure the solitary part of his tour did him much the most service he is still unwell though wonderfully strong he is attempting to bring on a fit of the gout which he is sure will relieve him greatly i was at keswick last sunday and saw both him and mr southey whom i liked very much coleridge looks better i think than when you saw him and is i also think upon the whole much better lady beaumont will be pleased to hear that our carriage though it did not suit mr coleridge the noise of it being particularly unpleasant to him answered wonderfully well for my sister and me and that the whole tour far surpassed our most sanguine expectations  they are sadly remiss at keswick in putting themselves to trouble in defence of the country they came forward very cheerfully some time ago but were so thwarted by the orders and counterorders of the ministry and their servants that they have thrown up the whole in disgust at grasmere we have turned out almost to a man we are to go to ambleside on sunday to be mustered and put on for the first time our military apparel i remain dear sir george with the most affectionate and respectful regard for you and lady beaumont              yours sincerely                w wordsworth  my sister will transcribe three sonnets19 which i do not send you from any notion i have of their merit but merely because they are the only verses i have written since i had the pleasure of seeing you and lady beaumont at the sight of kilchurn castle an ancient residence of the breadalbanes upon an island in loch awe i felt a real poetical impulse but i did not proceed i began a poem apostrophising the castle thus      child of loudthroated war the mountain stream     roars in thy hearing but thy hour of rest     is come and thou art silent in

sister told her some time ago that it was your intention to have written to me but knowing my aversion to letter writing you were unwilling to impose upon me the trouble of answering i am much obliged to you for the honour you intended me and deeply sensible of your delicacy if a man were what he ought to be with such feelings and such motives as i have it would be as easy for him to write to sir george beaumont as to take his food when he was hungry or his repose when he was weary but we suffer bad habits to grow upon us and that has been the case with me as you have had reason to find and forgive already i cannot quit the subject without regretting that any weakness of mine should have prevented my hearing from you which would always give me great delight and though i cannot presume to say that i should be a punctual correspondent i am sure i should not be insensible of your kindness but should also do my best to deserve it  a few days ago i received from mr southey your very acceptable present of sir joshua reynoldss works which with the life i have nearly read through several of the discourses i had read before though never regularly together they have very much added to the high opinion which i before entertained of sir joshua reynolds of a great part of them never having had an opportunity of studying any pictures whatsoever i can be but a very inadequate judge but of such parts of the discourses as relate to general philosophy i may be entitled to speak with more confidence and it gives me great pleasure to say to you knowing your great regard for sir joshua that they appear to me highly honourable to him the sound judgment universally displayed in these discourses is truly admirablei mean the deep conviction of the necessity of unwearied labour and diligence the reverence for the great men of his art and the comprehensive and unexclusive character of his taste is it not a pity sir george that a man with such a high sense of the dignity of his art and with such industry should not have given more of his time to the nobler departments of painting i do not say this so much on account of what the world would have gained by the superior excellence and interest of his pictures though doubtless that would have been very considerable but for the sake of example it is such an animating sight to see a man of genius regardless of temporary gains whether of money or praise fixing his attention solely upon what is intrinsically interesting and permanent and finding his happiness in an entire devotion of himself to such pursuits as shall most ennoble human nature we have not yet seen enough of this in modern times and never was there a period in society when such examples were likely to do more good than at present the industry and love of truth which distinguish sir joshuas mind are most admirable but he appears to me to have lived too much for the age in which he lived and the people among whom he lived though this in an infinitely less degree than his friend burke of whom goldsmith said with such truth long ago that      born for the universe he narrowed his mind     and to party gave up what was meant for mankind  i should not have said thus much of reynolds which i have not said without pain but because i have so great a respect for his character and because he lived at a time when being the first englishman distinguished for excellence in the higher department of painting he had the field fairly open for him to have given an example upon which all eyes needs must have been fixed of a man preferring the cultivation and exertion of his own powers in the highest possible degree to any other object of regard my writing is growing quite illegible i must therefore either mend it or throw down the pen  how sorry we all are under this roof that we cannot have the pleasure of seeing you and lady beaumont down this summer the weather has been most glorious and the country of course most delightful our own valley in particular was last night by the light of the full moon and in the perfect stillness of the lake a scene of loveliness and repose as affecting as was ever beheld by the eye of man we have had a day and a half of mr davys company at grasmere and no more he seemed to leave us with great regret being posthaste on his way to edinburgh i went with him to paterdale on his road to penrith where he would take coach we had a deal of talk about you and lady beaumont he was in your debt a letter as i found and exceedingly sorry that he had not been able to get over to see you having been engaged at mr cokes sheepshearing which had not left him time to cross from the duke of bedfords to your place we had a very pleasant interview though far too short he is a most interesting man whose views are fixed upon worthy objects  that loughrigg tarn beautiful pool of water as it is is a perpetual mortification to me when i think that you and lady beaumont were so near having a summernest there this is often talked over among us and we always end the subject with a heigh ho of regret but i must think of concluding my sister thanks lady beaumont for her last letter and will write to her in a few days but i must say to her myself how happy i was to hear that her sister had derived any consolation from coleridges poems and mine i must also add how much pleasure it gives me that lady beaumont is so kindly so affectionately disposed to my dear and good sister and also to the other unknown parts of my family could we but have coleridge back among us again there is no happiness in this life but in intellect and virtue those were very pretty verses which lady beaumont sent and we were much obliged to her for them  what shocking bad writing i have sent you i dont know how it is but it seems as if i could not write any better  farewell believe me with the sincerest love and affection for you and lady beaumont              yours           wm wordsworth21  21 memoirs vol i pp

indisposition in her eyes may last some time as soon as she is able she will do herself the pleasure of writing to lady beaumont mrs wordsworth and lady bs little goddaughter22 are both doing very well had the child been a boy we should have persisted in our right to avail ourselves of lady beaumonts goodness in offering to stand sponsor for it the name of dorothy obsolete as it is now grown had been so long devoted in my own thoughts to the first daughter that i might have that i could not break this promise to myselfa promise in which my wife participated though the name of mary to my ear the most musical and truly english in sound we have would have otherwise been most welcome to me including as it would lady beaumont and its mother this last sentence though in a letter to you sir george is intended for lady beaumont  22 dora wordsworth born aug 16 1804                                       when i ventured to express my regret at sir joshua reynolds giving so much of his time to portraitpainting and to his friends i did not mean to recommend absolute solitude and seclusion from the world as an advantage to him or anybody else i think it a great evil and indeed in the case of a painter frequent intercourse with the living world seems absolutely necessary to keep the mind in health and vigour i spoke in some respects in compliment to sir joshua reynolds feeling deeply as i do the power of his genius and loving passionately the labours of genius in every way in which i am capable of comprehending them mr malone in the account prefixed to the discourses tells us that sir joshua generally passed the time from eleven till four every day in portraitpainting this it was that grieved me as a sacrifice of great things to little ones it will give me great pleasure to hear from you at your leisure i am anxious to know that you are satisfied with the site and intended plan of your house i suppose no man ever built a house without finding when it was finished that something in it might have been better done internal architecture seems to have arrived at great excellence in england but i dont know how it is i scarcely ever see the outside of a new house that pleases me but i must break off believe me with best remembrances from my wife and sister to yourself and lady beaumont              yours           with the greatest respect and regard                                w wordsworth  my poetical labours have been entirely suspended during the last two months i am most anxious to return to them23  23 memoirs vol i pp 2702 g                                       of nature and art c  letter to sir george h beaumont            august 28 1811 cottage 7 minutes walk from              the seaside near bootle cumberland  my dear sir george  how shall i appear before you again after so long an interval it seems that now i ought rather to begin with an apology for writing than for not having written during a space of almost twelve months i have blamed myself not a little yet not so much as i should have done had i not known that the main cause of my silence has been the affection i feel for you on which account it is not so easy to me to write upon trifling or daily occurrences to you as it would be to write to another whom i loved less accordingly these have not had power to tempt me to take up the pen and in the mean while from my more intimate concerns i have abstained partly because i do not in many cases myself like to see the reflection of them upon paper and still more because it is my wish at all times when i think of the state in which your health and spirits may happen to be that my letter should be wholly free from melancholy and breathe nothing but cheerfulness and pleasure having made this avowal i trust that what may be wanting to my justification will be made up by your kindness and forgiving disposition  it was near about this time last year that we were employed in our pleasant tour to the leasowes and hagley the twelve months that have elapsed have not impaired the impressions which those scenes made upon me nor weakened my remembrance of the delight which the places and objects and the conversations they led to awakened in our minds                                       it is very late to mention that when in wales last autumn i contrived to pass a day and a half with your friend price at foxley he was very kind and took due pains to show me all the beauties of his place i should have been very insensible not to be pleased with and grateful for his attentions and certainly i was gratified by the sight of the scenes through which he conducted me                                       i was less able to do justice in my own mind to the scenery of foxley you will perhaps think it a strange fault that i am going to find with it considering the acknowledged taste of the owner viz that small as it is compared with hundreds of places the domain is too extensive for the character of the country wanting both rock and water it necessarily wants variety and in a district of this kind the portion of a gentlemans estate which he keeps exclusively to himself and which he devotes wholly or in part to ornament may very easily exceed the proper boundsnot indeed as to the preservation of wood but most easily as to every thing else a man by little and little becomes so delicate and fastidious with respect to forms in scenery where he has a power to exercise a control over them that if they do not exactly please him in all moods and every point of view his power becomes his law he banishes one and then rids himself of another impoverishing and monotonising landscapes which if not originally distinguished by the bounty of nature must be ill able to spare the inspiriting varieties which art and the occupations and wants of life in a country left more to itself never fail to produce this relish of humanity foxley wants and is therefore to me in spite of all its recommendations a melancholy spoti mean that part of it which the owner keeps to himself and has taken so much pains with i heard the other day of two artists who thus expressed themselves upon the subject of a scene among our lakes plague upon those vile enclosures said one they spoil everything oh said the other i never see them glover was the name of this last now for my part i should not wish to be either of these gentlemen but to have in my own mind the power of turning to advantage wherever it is possible every object of art and nature as they appear before me what a noble instance as you have often pointed out to me has rubens given of this in that picture in your possession where he has brought as it were a whole county into one landscape and made the most formal partitions of cultivation hedgerows of pollard willows conduct the eye into the depths and distances of his picture and thus more than by any other means has given it that appearance of immensity which is so striking as i have slipped into the subject of painting i feel anxious to inquire whether your pencil has been busy last winter in the solitude and uninterrupted quiet of dunmow most likely you know that we have changed our residence in grasmere which i hope will be attended with a great overbalance of advantages one we are certain ofthat we have at least one sittingroom clear of smoke i trust in all winds over the chimneypiece is hung your little picture from the neighbourhood of coleorton in our other house on account of the frequent fits of smoke from the chimneys both the pictures which i have from your hand were confined to bedrooms a few days after i had enjoyed the pleasure of seeing in different moods of mind your coleorton landscape from my fireside it suggested to me the following sonnet which having walked out to the side of grasmere brook where it murmurs through the meadows near the church i composed immediately      praised be the art whose subtle power could stay     yon cloud and fix it in that glorious shape     nor would permit the thin smoke to escape     nor those bright sunbeams to forsake the day     which stopped that band of travellers on their way     ere they were lost within the shady wood     and showed the bark upon the glassy flood     for ever anchored in her sheltering bay  the images of the smoke and the travellers are taken from your picture the rest were added in order to place the thought in a clear point of view and for the sake of variety i hope coleorton continues to improve upon you and lady beaumont and that mr taylors new laws and regulations are at least peaceably submitted to mrs w and i return in a few days to grasmere we cannot say that the child for whose sake we came down to the seaside has derived much benefit from the bathing the weather has been very unfavourable we have however contrived to see every thing that lies within a reasonable walk of our present residence among other places mulcasterat least as much of it as can be seen from the public road but the noble proprietor has contrived to shut himself up so with plantations and chained gates and locks that whatever prospects he may command from his stately prison or rather fortification can only be guessed at by the passing traveller in the state of blindness and unprofitable peeping in which we were compelled to pursue our way up a long and steep hill i could not help observing to my companion that the hibernian peer had completely given the lie to the poet thomson when in a strain of proud enthusiasm he boasts      i care not fortune what you me deny         you cannot rob me of free natures grace     you cannot shut the windows of the sky         through which aurora shows her brightening face     you cannot bar my constant feet to trace         the woods and lawns by living stream c               castle of indolence  the windows of the sky were not shut indeed but the business was done more thoroughly for the sky was nearly shut out altogether this is like most others a bleak and treeless coast but abounding in cornfields and with a noble beach which is delightful either for walking or riding the isle of man is right opposite our window and though in this unsettled weather often invisible its appearance has afforded us great amusement one afternoon above the whole length of it was stretched a body of clouds shaped and coloured like a magnificent grove in winter when whitened with snow and illuminated by the morning sun which having melted the snow in part has intermingled black masses among the brightness the whole sky was scattered over with fleecy dark clouds such as any sunshiny day produces and which were changing their shapes and position every moment but this line of clouds immoveably attached themselves to the island and manifestly took their shape from the influence of its mountains there appeared to be just span enough of sky to allow the hand to slide between the top of snâfell the highest peak in the island and the base of this glorious forest in which little change was noticeable for more than the space of half an hour we had another fine sight one evening walking along a rising ground about two miles distant from the shore it was about the hour of sunset and the sea was perfectly calm and in a quarter where its surface was indistinguishable from the western sky hazy and luminous with the setting sun appeared a tall slooprigged vessel magnified by the atmosphere through which it was viewed and seeming rather to hang in the air than to float upon the waters milton compares the appearance of satan to a fleet descried far off at sea the visionary grandeur and beautiful form of this single vessel could words have conveyed to the mind the picture which nature presented to the eye would have suited his purpose as well as the largest company of vessels that ever associated together with the help of a trade wind in the wide ocean yet not exactly so and for this reason that his image is a permanent one not dependent upon accident  i have not left myself room to assure you how sincerely i remain                     your affectionate friend                              w wordsworth24  24 memoirs vol i pp 2728 g                                       the recluse reynolds c  to sir george beaumont bart                        grasmere dec 25th 1804  my dear sir george  long since ought i to have thanked you for your last affectionate letter but i knew how indulgent you were and therefore fell i wont say more easily but surely with far less pain to myself into my old trick of procrastination i was deeply sensible of your kindness in inviting me to grosvenor square and then felt and still feel a strong inclination to avail myself of the opportunity of cultivating your friendship and that of lady beaumont and of seeing a little of the world at the same time but as the wish is strong there are also strong obstacles against it first though i have lately been tolerably industrious i am far behindhand with my appointed work and next my nervous system is so apt to be deranged by going from home that i am by no means sure that i should not be so much of a dependent invalid i mean a person obliged to manage himself as to make it absolutely improper for me to obtrude myself where neither my exertions of mind or body could enable me to be tolerable company i say nothing of my family because a short absence would be abundantly recompensed by the pleasure of a sweet return at all events i must express my sincere thanks for your kindness and the pleasure which i received from your letter breathing throughout such favourable dispositions i may say such earnest friendship towards me  i think we are completely agreed upon the subject of sir joshua that is we both regret that he did not devote more of his time to the higher branches of the art and further i think you join with me in lamenting to a certain degree at least that he did not live more to himself i have since read the rest of his discourses with which i have been greatly pleased and wish most heartily that i could have an opportunity of seeing in your company your own collection of pictures and some others in town mr angersteins for instance to have pointed out to me some of those finer and peculiar beauties of painting which i am afraid i shall never have an occasion of becoming sufficiently familiar with pictures to discover of myself there is not a day in my life when i am at home in which that exquisite little drawing of yours of applethwaite does not affect me with a sense of harmony and grace which i cannot describe mr edridge an artist whom you know saw this drawing along with a mr duppa another artist who published hints from raphael and michael angelo and they were both most enthusiastic in their praise of it to my great delight by the bye i thought mr edridge a man of very mild and pleasing manners and as far as i could judge of delicate feelings in the province of his art duppa is publishing a life of michael angelo and i received from him a few days ago two proofsheets of an appendix which contains the poems of ma which i shall read and translate one or two of them if i can do it with decent success i have peeped into the sonnets and they do not appear at all unworthy of their great author  you will be pleased to hear that i have been advancing with my work i have written upwards of 2000 verses during the last ten weeks i do not know if you are exactly acquainted with the plan of my poetical labour it is twofold first a poem to be called the recluse in which it will be my object to express in verse my most interesting feelings concerning man nature and society and next a poem in which i am at present chiefly engaged on my earlier life or the growth of my own mind taken up upon a large scale this latter work i expect to have finished before the month of may and then i purpose to fall with all my might on the former which is the chief object upon which my thoughts have been fixed these many years of this poem that of the pedlar25 which coleridge read you is part and i may have written of it altogether about 2000 lines it will consist i hope of about ten or twelve thousand  25 the excursion the pedlar was the title once proposed from the character of the wanderer but abandoned memoirs vol i p304  may we not hope for the pleasure of seeing you and lady beaumont down here next summer i flatter myself that coleridge will then be returnd and though we would not on any account that he should fix himself in this rainy part of england yet perhaps we may have the happiness of meeting all together for a few weeks we have lately built in our little rocky orchard a little circular hut lined with moss like a wrens nest and coated on the outside with heath that stands most charmingly with several views from the different sides of it of the lake the valley and the churchsadly spoiled however lately by being whitewashed the little retreat is most delightful and i am sure you and lady beaumont would be highly pleased with it coleridge has never seen it what a happiness would it be to us to see him there and entertain you all next summer in our homely way under its shady thatch i will copy a dwarf inscription which i wrote for it the other day before the building was entirely finished which indeed it is not yet      no whimsy of the purse is here     no pleasurehouse forlorn     use comfort do this roof endear     a tributary shed to chear     the little cottage that is near     to help it and adorn  i hope the young roscius if he go on as he has begun will rescue the english theatre from the infamy that has fallen upon it and restore the reign of good sense and nature from what you have seen sir george do you think he could manage a character of shakspeare neither selin nor douglas require much power but even to perform them as he does talents and genius i should think must be necessary i had very little hope i confess thinking it very natural that a theatre which had brought a dog upon the stage as a principal performer would catch at a wonder whatever shape it might put on  we have had no tidings of coleridge these several months he spoke of papers which he had sent by private hands none of which we have received it must be most criminal neglect somewhere if the fever be suffered to enter malta farewell and believe me my dear sir george your affectionate and sincere friend                      w wordsworth26  26 memoirs vol i p304 et seq with important additions from the original g                                            the recluse young roscius c       letter to sir george h beaumont bart grasmere may 1st 1805       my dear sir george  i have wished to write to you every day this long time but i have also had another wish which has interfered to prevent me i mean the wish to resume my poetical labours time was stealing away fast from me and nothing done and my mind still seeming unfit to do anything at first i had a strong impulse to write a poem that should record my brothers virtues and be worthy of his memory i began to give vent to my feelings with this view but i was overpowered by my subject and could not proceed i composed much but it is all lost except a few lines as it came from me in such a torrent that i was unable to remember it i could not hold the pen myself and the subject was such that i could not employ mrs wordsworth or my sister as my amanuensis this work must therefore rest awhile till i am something calmer i shall however never be at peace till as far as in me lies i have done justice to my departed brothers memory his heroic death the particulars of which i have now accurately collected from several of the survivors exacts this from me and still more his singularly interesting character and virtuous and innocent life  unable to proceed with this work i turned my thoughts again to the poem on my own life and you will be glad to hear that i have added 300 lines to it in the course of last week two books more will conclude it it will be not much less than 9000 linesnot hundred but thousand lines longan alarming length and a thing unprecedented in literary history that a man should talk so much about himself it is not selfconceit as you will know well that has induced me to do this but real humility i began the work because i was unprepared to treat any more arduous subject and diffident of my own powers here at least i hoped that to a certain degree i should be sure of succeeding as i had nothing to do but describe what i had felt and thought therefore could not easily be bewildered this might certainly have been done in narrower compass by a man of more address but i have done my best if when the work shall be finished it appears to the judicious to have redundancies they shall be lopped off if possible but this is very difficult to do when a man has written with thought and this defect whenever i have suspected it or found it to exist in any writings of mine i have always found incurable the fault lies too deep and is in the first conception if you see coleridge before i do do not speak of this to him as i should like to have his judgment unpreoccupied by such an apprehension i wish much to have your further opinion of the young roscius above all of his hamlet it is certainly impossible that he should understand the character that is the composition of the character but many of the sentiments which are put into hamlets mouth he may be supposed to be capable of feeling and to a certain degree of entering into the spirit of some of the situations i never saw hamlet acted myself nor do i know what kind of a play they make of it i think i have heard that some parts which i consider among the finest are omitted in particular hamlets wild language after the ghost has disappeared the players have taken intolerable liberties with shakspeares plays especially with richard the third which though a character admirably conceived and drawn is in some scenes bad enough in shakspeare himself but the play as it is now acted has always appeared to me a disgrace to the english stage hamlet i suppose is treated by them with more reverence they are both characters far far above the abilities of any actor whom i have ever seen henderson was before my time and of course garrick  we are looking anxiously for coleridge perhaps he may be with you now we were afraid that he might have had to hear other bad news of our family as lady beaumonts little goddaughter has lately had that dangerous complaint the croup particularly dangerous here where we are thirteen miles from any medical advice on which we can have the least reliance her case has been a mild one but sufficient to alarm us much and mrs wordsworth and her aunt have undergone much fatigue in sitting up as for nearly a fortnight she had very bad nights she yet requires much care and attention  is your building going on i was mortified that the sweet little valley of which you spoke some time ago was no longer in the possession of your family it is the place i believe where that illustrious and most extraordinary man beaumont the poet and his brother were born one is astonished when one thinks of that man having been only eightandtwenty years of age for i believe he was no more when he died shakspeare we are told had scarcely written a single play at that age i hope for the sake of poets you are proud of these men  lady beaumont mentioned some time ago that you were painting a picture from the thorn is it finished i should like to see it the poem is a favourite with me and i shall love it the better for the honour you have done it we shall be most happy to have the other drawing which you promised us some time ago the dimensions of the applethwaite one are eight inches high and a very little above ten broad this of course exclusive of the margin  i am anxious to know how your health goes on we are better than we had reason to expect when we look back upon this spring it seems like a dreary dream to us but i trust in god that we shall yet bear up and steer right onward  farewell i am your affectionate friend                                  w wordsworth   my sister thanks lady beaumont for her letter the short one of the other day and hopes to be able to write soon have you seen southeys madoc we have it in the house but have deferred reading it having been too busy with the child i should like to know how it pleases you27  27 memoirs vol i

my dear sir george  i write to you from the mosshut at the top of my orchard the sun just sinking behind the hills in front of the entrance and his light falling upon the green moss of the side opposite me a linnet is singing in the tree above and the children of some of our neighbours who have been today little johns visitors are playing below equally noisy and happy the green fields in the level area of the vale and part of the lake lie before me in quietness i have just been reading two newspapers full of factious brawls about lord melville and his delinquencies ravage of the french in the west indies victories of the english in the east fleets of ours roaming the sea in search of enemies whom they cannot find c c c and i have asked myself more than once lately if my affections can be in the right place caring as i do so little about what the world seems to care so much for all this seems to me a tale told by an idiot full of sound and fury signifying nothing it is pleasant in such a mood to turn ones thoughts to a good man and a dear friend i have therefore taken up the pen to write to you and first let me thank you which i ought to have done long ago and should have done but that i knew i had a licence from you to procrastinate for your most acceptable present of coleridges portrait welcome in itself and more so as coming from you it is as good a resemblance as i expect to see of coleridge taking it all together for i consider cs as a face absolutely impracticable mrs wordsworth was overjoyed at the sight of the print dorothy and i much pleased we think it excellent about the eyes and forehead which are the finest parts of cs face and the general contour of the face is well given but to my sister and me it seems to fail sadly about the middle of the face particularly at the bottom of the nose mrs w feels this also and my sister so much that except when she covers the whole of the middle of the face it seems to her so entirely to alter the expression as rather to confound than revive in her mind the remembrance of the original we think as far as mere likeness goes hazlitts is better but the expression in hazlitts is quite dolorous and funereal that in this is much more pleasing though certainly falling far below what one would wish to see infused into a picture of c mrs c received a day or two ago a letter from a friend who had letters from malta not from coleridge but a miss stoddart who is there with her brother these letters are of the date of the fifth of march and speak of him as looking well and quite well and talking of coming home but doubtful whether by land or sea  i have the pleasure to say that i finished my poem about a fortnight ago i had looked forward to the day as a most happy one and i was indeed grateful to god for giving me life to complete the work such as it is but it was not a happy day for me i was dejected on many accounts when i looked back upon the performance it seemed to have a dead weight about itthe reality so far short of the expectation it was the first long labour that i had finished and the doubt whether i should ever live to write the recluse and the sense which i had of this poem being so far below what i seemed capable of executing depressed me much above all many heavy thoughts of my poor departed brother hung upon me the joy which i should have had in showing him the manuscript and a thousand other vain fancies and dreams i have spoken of this because it was a state of feeling new to me the occasion being new this work may be considered as a sort of portico to the recluse part of the same building which i hope to be able ere long to begin with in earnest and if i am permitted to bring it to a conclusion and to write further a narrative poem of the epic kind i shall consider the task of my life as over i ought to add that i have the satisfaction of finding the present poem not quite of so alarming a length as i apprehended  i wish much to hear from you if you have leisure but as you are so indulgent to me it would be the highest injustice were i otherwise to you  we have read madoc and been highly pleased with it it abounds in beautiful pictures and descriptions happily introduced and there is an animation diffused through the whole story though it cannot perhaps be said that any of the characters interest you much except perhaps young llewellyn whose situation is highly interesting and he appears to me the best conceived and sustained character in the piece his speech to his uncle at their meeting in the island is particularly interesting the poem fails in the highest gifts of the poets mind imagination in the true sense of the word and knowledge of human nature and the human heart there is nothing that shows the hand of the great master but the beauties in description are innumerable for instance that of the figure of the bard towards the beginning of the convention of the bards receiving the poetic inspiration that of the wife of tlalala the savage going out to meet her husband that of madoc and the atzecan king with a long name preparing for battle everywhere indeed you have beautiful descriptions and it is a work which does the author high credit i think i should like to know your opinion of it farewell best remembrances and love to lady beaumont believe me               my dear sir george              your most sincere friend                     w wordsworth  my sister thanks lady beaumont for her letter and will write in a few days i find that lady b has been pleased much by madoc28  28 memoirs vol i

hearing that you are so much better i write now chiefly on account of a mistake which you seem to be under concerning coleridge i guess from your letter that you suppose him to be appointed to the place of secretary to sir a ball this is by no means the case he is an occasional substitute for mr chapman who is secretary and no doubt must have resumed his office long before this as he had been expected every day some time before the date of cs last letter the paragraph in the paper which we also saw positively states that c is appointed secretary this is an error and has been merely put in upon common rumour  when you were ill i had a thought which i will mention to you it was this i wished to know how you were at present situated as to houseroom at coleorton that is whether you could have found a corner for me to put my head in in case i could have contrived to have commanded three weeks time or so i am at present and shall be for some time engaged with a sick friend who has come all the way from bristol on purpose to see us and has taken lodgings in the village but should you be unwell again and my company be like to tend in the least to exhilarate you i should like to know that were it in my power to go and see you i might have the liberty to do so  having such reason to expect coleridge at present were we at liberty in other respects i cannot think of taking my family on tour agreeable to your kind suggestion something has however already been added by your means to our comforts in the way of books and probably we shall be able to make an excursion ere the summer be over  by the bye are you possessed of houbraken and vertues heads of illustrious persons with anecdotes of their lives by birch i had an opportunity of purchasing a handsome copy far below the price at which it now sells i believe in london at penrith a few weeks ago and if you have not a copy and think the work has any merit you would please me greatly by giving it a place in your library  i am glad you like the passage in madoc about llewellyn southeys mind does not seem strong enough to draw the picture of a hero the character of madoc is often very insipid and contemptible for instance when he is told that the foemen have surprised caer madoc and of course he has reason to believe butchered or carried away all the women and children what does the author make him do think of goervyl and llayan very tenderly forsooth but not a word about his people in short according to my notion the character is throughout languidly conceived and as you observe the contrast between her and llewellyn makes him look very mean i made a mistake when i pointed out a beautiful passage as being in the beginning of the meeting of the bards it occurs before and ends thus                  his eyes were closed     his head as if in reverence to receive     the inspiration bent and as he raised     his glowing countenance and brighter eye     and swept with passionate hands the ringing harp  the verses of your ancestor francis beaumont the younger are very elegant and harmonious and written with true feeling is this the only poem of his extant there are some pleasing verses i think by corbet bishop of norwich on the death of francis beaumont the elder they end i remember thus alluding to his short life              by whose sole death appears     wits a disease consumes men in few years  i have never seen the works of the brother of the dramatic poet but i know he wrote a poem upon the battle of bosworth field probably it will be in the volume which you have found which it would give me great pleasure to see as also charnwood rocks which must have a striking effect in that country i am highly flattered by lady beaumonts favourable opinion of me and my poems  my sister will answer her affectionate letter very soon she would have done it before now but she has been from home three days and unwell or entirely engrossed with some visitors whom we have had the rest of her time  the letter which you will find accompanying this is from an acquaintance of ours to his wife he lives at patterdale and she was over at grasmere we thought it would interest you farewell i remain in hopes of good news of your health your affectionate and sincere friend                    w wordsworth  from mr luff of patterdale to his wife  patterdale july 23d 1805  an event happened here last night which has greatly affected the whole village and particularly myself  the body or more properly speaking bones of a poor fellow were yesterday found by willy harrison in the rocks at the head of red tarn it appears that he was attempting to descend the pass from helvellyn to the tarn when he lost his footing and was dashed to pieces  his name appears to have been charles gough several things were found in his pockets fishing tackle memorandums a gold watch silver pencil claude lorraine glasses c  poor fellow it is very strange but we met him when we were last reviewed in april and he then wanted john harrison to turn back with him and go to the tarn but he was told that his request could not be complied with it appears that he proceeded forward and met his fate  you will be much interested to know that a spaniel bitch was found alive by his side where she has remained upwards of three months guarding the bones of her master but she had become so wild that it was with difficulty she was taken she is in good condition and what is more odd had whelped a pup which from its size must have lived some weeks but when found was lying dead by the bones the bones are as completely freed from flesh as if they had been anatomised and perfectly white and dry the head can nowhere be found the arms one thigh and a leg were all that remained in the clothes all the rest were scattered about here and there  when i reflect on my own wanderings and the many dangerous situations i have found myself in in the pursuit of game i cannot help thanking providence that i am now here to relate to you this melancholy tale i wonder whether poor fans affection would under similar circumstances have equalled that of the little spaniel   of lord nelson and the happy warrior and pitt and on building gardening c  letter to sir george h beaumont bart                             grasmere feb 11th 1806  my dear sir george  upon opening this letter you must have seen that it is accompanied with a copy of verses29 i hope they will give you some pleasure as it will be the best way in which they can repay me for a little vexation of which they have been the cause they were written several weeks ago and i wished to send them to you but could not muster up resolution as i felt that they were so unworthy of the subject accordingly i kept them by me from week to week with a hope which has proved vain that in some happy moment a new fit of inspiration would help me to mend them and hence my silence which with your usual goodness i know you will excuse  29 the happy warrior  you will find that the verses are allusive to lord nelson and they will show that i must have sympathised with you in admiration of the man and sorrow for our loss yet considering the matter coolly there was little to regret the state of lord nelsons health i suppose was such that he could not have lived long and the first burst of exultation upon landing in his native country and his reception here would have been dearly bought perhaps by pain and bodily weakness and distress among his friends which he could neither remove nor alleviate few men have ever died under circumstances so likely to make their deaths of benefit to their country it is not easy to see what his life could have done comparable to it the loss of such men as lord nelson is indeed great and real but surely not for the reason which makes most people grieve a supposition that no other such man is in the country the old ballad has taught us how to feel on these occasions      i trust i have within my realm     five hundred good as he  but this is the evil that nowhere is merit so much under the power of what to avoid a more serious expression one may call that of fortune as in military and naval service and it is five hundred to one that such men will not have attained situations where they can show themselves so that the country may know in whom to trust lord nelson had attained that situation and therefore i think and not for the other reason ought we chiefly to lament that he is taken from us  mr pitt is also gone by tens of thousands looked upon in like manner as a great loss for my own part as probably you know i have never been able to regard his political life with complacency i believe him however to have been as disinterested a man and as true a lover of his country as it was possible for so ambitious a man to be his first wish though probably unknown to himself was that his country should prosper under his administration his next that it should prosper could the order of these wishes have been reversed mr pitt would have avoided many of the grievous mistakes into which i think he fell i know my dear sir george you will give me credit for speaking without arrogance and i am aware it is not unlikely you may differ greatly from me in these points but i like in some things to differ with a friend and that he should know i differ from him it seems to make a more healthy friendship to act as a relief to those notions and feelings which we have in common and to give them a grace and spirit which they could not otherwise possess  there were some parts in the long letter which i wrote about laying out grounds in which the expression must have been left imperfect i like splendid mansions in their proper places and have no objection to large or even obtrusive houses in themselves my dislike is to that system of gardening which because a house happens to be large or splendid and stands at the head of a large domain establishes it therefore as a principle that the house ought to dye all the surrounding country with a strength of colouring and to an extent proportionate to its own importance this system i think is founded in false taste false feeling and its effects disgusting in the highest degree the reason you mention as having induced you to build was worthy of you and gave me the highest pleasure but i hope god will grant you and lady beaumont life to enjoy yourselves the fruit of your exertions for many years  we have lately had much anxiety about coleridge what can have become of him it must be upwards of three months since he landed at trieste has he returned to malta think you or what can have befallen him he has never since been heard of  lady beaumont spoke of your having been ill of a cold i hope you are better we have all here been more or less deranged in the same way  we have to thank you for a present of game which arrived in good time  never have a moments uneasiness about answering my letters we are all well at present and unite in affectionate wishes to you and lady beaumont believe me                      your sincere friend                            w wordsworth   i have thoughts of sending the verses to a newspaper30   30 memoirs vol i p321 et seq with important additions from the original by a curious inadvertence this letter is dated 1796quite plainlyfor 1806 as shown by the postmark outside g                                        of his own poems as falsely criticised  letter to lady beaumont                             coleorton may 21 1807  my dear lady beaumont  though i am to see you so soon i cannot but write a word or two to thank you for the interest you take in my poems as evinced by your solicitude about their immediate reception i write partly to thank you for this and to express the pleasure it has given me and partly to remove any uneasiness from your mind which the disappointments you sometimes meet with in this labour of love may occasion i see that you have many battles to fight for memore than in the ardour and confidence of your pure and elevated mind you had ever thought of being summoned to but be assured that this opposition is nothing more than what i distinctly foresaw that you and my other friends would have to encounter i say this not to give myself credit for an eye of prophecy but to allay any vexatious thoughts on my account which this opposition may have produced in you  it is impossible that any expectations can be lower than mine concerning the immediate effect of this little work upon what is called the public i do not here take into consideration the envy and malevolence and all the bad passions which always stand in the way of a work of any merit from a living poet but merely think of the pure absolute honest ignorance in which all worldlings of every rank and situation must be enveloped with respect to the thoughts feelings and images on which the life of my poems depends the things which i have taken whether from within or without what have they to do with routs dinners morning calls hurry from door to door from street to street on foot or in carriage with mr pitt or mr fox mr paul or sir francis burdett the westminster election or the borough of honiton in a wordfor i cannot stop to make my way through the hurry of images that present themselves to mewhat have they to do with endless talking about things nobody cares any thing for except as far as their own vanity is concerned and this with persons they care nothing for but as their vanity or selfishness is concernedwhat have they to do to say all at once with a life without love in such a life there can be no thought for we have no thought save thoughts of pain but as far as we have love and admiration  it is an awful truth that there neither is nor can be any genuine enjoyment of poetry among nineteen out of twenty of those persons who live or wish to live in the broad light of the worldamong those who either are or are striving to make themselves people of consideration in society this is a truth and an awful one because to be incapable of a feeling of poetry in my sense of the word is to be without love of human nature and reverence for god  upon this i shall insist elsewhere at present let me confine myself to my object which is to make you my dear friend as easyhearted as myself with respect to these poems trouble not yourself upon their present reception of what moment is that compared with what i trust is their destinyto console the afflicted to add sunshine to daylight by making the happy happier to teach the young and the gracious of every age to see to think and feel and therefore to become more actively and securely virtuous this is their office which i trust they will faithfully perform long after we that is all that is mortal of us are mouldered in our graves i am well aware how far it would seem to many i overrate my own exertions when i speak in this way in direct connection with the volume i have just made public  i am not however afraid of such censure insignificant as probably the majority of those poems would appear to very respectable persons i do not mean london wits and witlings for these have too many foul passions about them to be respectable even if they had more intellect than the benign laws of providence will allow to such a heartless existence as theirs is but grave kindlynatured worthy persons who would be pleased if they could i hope that these volumes are not without some recommendations even for readers of this class but their imagination has slept and the voice which is the voice of my poetry without imagination cannot be heard leaving these i was going to say a word to such readers as mr  suchhow would he be offended if he knew i considered him only as a representative of a class and not an unique pity says mr  that so many trifling things should be admitted to obstruct the view of those that have merit now let this candid judge take by way of example the sonnets which probably with the exception of two or three other poems for which i will not contend appear to him the most trifling as they are the shortest i would say to him omitting things of higher consideration there is one thing which must strike you at once if you will only read these poemsthat those to liberty at least have a connection with or a bearing upon each other and therefore if individually they want weight perhaps as a body they may not be so deficient at least this ought to induce you to suspend your judgment and qualify it so far as to allow that the writer aims at least at comprehensiveness  but dropping this i would boldly say at once that these sonnets while they each fix the attention upon some important sentiment separately considered do at the same time collectively make a poem on the subject of civil liberty and national independence which either for simplicity of style or grandeur of moral sentiment is alas likely to have few parallels in the poetry of the present day again turn to the moods of my own mind there is scarcely a poem here of above thirty lines and very trifling these poems will appear to many but omitting to speak of them individually do they not taken collectively fix the attention upon a subject eminently poetical viz the interest which objects in nature derive from the predominance of certain affections more or less permanent more or less capable of salutary renewal in the mind of the being contemplating these objects this is poetic and essentially poetic and why because it is creative  but i am wasting words for it is nothing more than you know and if said to those for whom it is intended it would not be understood  i see by your last letter that mrs fermor has entered into the spirit of these moods of my own mind your transcript from her letter gave me the greatest pleasure but i must say that even she has something yet to receive from me i say this with confidence from her thinking that i have fallen below myself in the sonnet beginning      with ships the sea was sprinkled far and nigh  as to the other which she objects to i will only observe that there is a misprint in the last line but two      and though this wilderness  for      and through this wilderness  that makes it unintelligible this latter sonnet for many reasons though i do not abandon it i will not now speak of but upon the other i could say something important in conversation and will attempt now to illustrate it by a comment which i feel will be inadequate to convey my meaning there is scarcely one of my poems which does not aim to direct the attention to some moral sentiment or to some general principle or law of thought or of our intellectual constitution for instance in the present case who is there that has not felt that the mind can have no rest among a multitude of objects of which it either cannot make one whole or from which it cannot single out one individual whereupon may be concentrated the attention divided among or distracted by a multitude after a certain time we must either select one image or object which must put out of view the rest wholly or must subordinate them to itself while it stands forth as a head          how glowed the firmament     with living sapphires hesperus that led     the starry host rode brightest till the moon     rising in clouded majesty at length     apparent queen unveiled her peerless light     and oer the dark her silver mantle threw  having laid this down as a general principle take the case before us i am represented in the sonnet as casting my eyes over the sea sprinkled with a multitude of ships like the heavens with stars my mind may be supposed to float up and down among them in a kind of dreamy indifference with respect either to this or that one only in a pleasurable state of feeling with respect to the whole prospect joyously it showed this continued till that feeling may be supposed to have passed away and a kind of comparative listlessness or apathy to have succeeded as at this line      some veering up and down one knew not why  all at once while i am in this state comes forth an object an individual and my mind sleepy and unfixed is awakened and fastened in a moment                 hesperus that led     the starry host  is a poetical object because the glory of his own nature gives him the preeminence the moment he appears he calls forth the poetic faculty receiving its exertions as a tribute but this ship in the sonnet may in a manner still more appropriate be said to come upon a mission of the poetic spirit because in its own appearance and attributes it is barely sufficiently distinguished to rouse the creative faculty of the human mind to exertions at all times welcome but doubly so when they come upon us when in a state of remissness the mind being once fixed and roused all the rest comes from itself it is merely a lordly ship nothing more      this ship was nought to me nor i to her     yet i pursued her with a lovers look  my mind wantons with grateful joy in the exercise of its own powers and loving its own creation      this ship to all the rest i did prefer  making her a sovereign or a regent and thus giving body and life to all the rest mingling up this idea with fondness and praise      where she comes the winds must stir  and concluding the whole with      on went she and due north her journey took  thus taking up again the reader with whom i began letting him know how long i must have watched this favourite vessel and inviting him to rest his mind as mine is resting  having said so much upon mere fourteen lines which mrs fermor did not approve i cannot but add a word or two upon my satisfaction in finding that my mind has so much in common with hers and that we participate so many of each others pleasures i collect this from her having singled out the two little poems the daffodils and the rock crowned with snowdrops i am sure that whoever is much pleased with either of these quiet and tender delineations must be fitted to walk through the recesses of my poetry with delight and will there recognise at every turn something or other in which and over which it has that property and right which knowledge and love confer the line      come blessed barrier c  in the sonnet upon sleep which mrs f points out had before been mentioned to me by coleridge and indeed by almost every body who had heard it as eminently beautiful my letter as this second sheet which i am obliged to take admonishes me is growing to an enormous length and yet saving that i have expressed my calm confidence that these poems will live i have said nothing which has a particular application to the object of it which was to remove all disquiet from your mind on account of the condemnation they may at present incur from that portion of my contemporaries who are called the public i am sure my dear lady beaumont if you attach any importance to it it can only be from an apprehension that it may affect me upon which i have already set you at ease or from a fear that this present blame is ominous of their future or final destiny if this be the case your tenderness for me betrays you be assured that the decision of these persons has nothing to do with the question they are altogether incompetent judges these people in the senseless hurry of their idle lives do not read books they merely snatch a glance at them that they may talk about them and even if this were not so never forget what i believe was observed to you by coleridge that every great and original writer in proportion as he is great or original must himself create the taste by which he is to be relished he must teach the art by which he is to be seen this in a certain degree even to all persons however wise and pure may be their lives and however unvitiated their taste but for those who dip into books in order to give an opinion of them or talk about them to take up an opinionfor this multitude of unhappy and misguided and misguiding beings an entire regeneration must be produced and if this be possible it must be a work of time to conclude my ears are stonedead to this idle buzz and my flesh as insensible as iron to these petty stings and after what i have said i am sure yours will be the same i doubt not that you will share with me an invincible confidence that my writings and among them these little poems will cooperate with the benign tendencies in human nature and society wherever found and that they will in their degree be efficacious in making men wiser better and happier farewell i will not apologise for this letter though its length demands an apology believe me eagerly wishing for the happy day when i shall see you and sir george here       most affectionately yours                  w wordsworth  do not hurry your coming hither on our account my sister regrets that she did not press this upon you as you say in your letter we cannot possibly come before the first week in june from which we infer that your kindness will induce you to make sacrifices for our sakes whatever pleasure we may have in thinking of grasmere we have no impatience to be gone and think with full as much regret of leaving coleorton i had for myself indeed a wish to be at grasmere with as much of the summer before me as might be but to this i attach no importance whatever as far as the gratification of that wish interferes with any inclination or duty of yours i could not be satisfied without seeing you here and shall have great pleasure in waiting31  31 memoirs vol i pp 33140   of peter bell and other poems letter to sir george h beaumont bart       my dear sir george  i am quite delighted to hear of your picture for peter bell i was much pleased with the sketch and i have no doubt that the picture will surpass it as far as a picture ought to do i long much to see it i should approve of any engraver approved by you but remember that no poem of mine will ever be popular and i am afraid that the sale of peter would not carry the expence of the engraving and that the poem in the estimation of the public would be a weight upon the print i say not this in modest disparagement of the poem but in sorrow for the sickly taste of the public in verse the people would love the poem of peter bell but the public a very different being will never love it thanks for dear lady bs transcript from your friends letter it is written with candour but i must say a word or two not in praise of it instances of what i mean says your friend are to be found in a poem on a daisy by the by it is on the daisy a mighty difference and on daffodils reflected in the water is this accurately transcribed by lady beaumont if it be what shall we think of criticism or judgment founded upon and exemplified by a poem which must have been so inattentively perused my language is precise and therefore it would be false modesty to charge myself with blame                beneath the trees     ten thousand dancing in the breeze     the waves beside them danced but they     outdid the sparkling waves in glee  can expression be more distinct and let me ask your friend how it is possible for flowers to be reflected in water where there are waves they may indeed in still water but the very object of my poem is the trouble or agitation both of the flowers and the water i must needs respect the understanding of every one honoured by your friendship but sincerity compels me to say that my poems must be more nearly looked at before they can give rise to any remarks of much value even from the strongest minds with respect to this individual poem lady b will recollect how mrs fermor expressed herself upon it a letter also was sent to me addressed to a friend of mine and by him communicated to me in which this identical poem was singled out for fervent approbation what then shall we say why let the poet first consult his own heart as i have done and leave the rest to posterityto i hope an improving posterity the fact is the english public are at this moment in the same state of mind with respect to my poems if small things may be compared with great as the french are in respect to shakspeare and not the french alone but almost the whole continent in short in your friends letter i am condemned for the very thing for which i ought to have been praised viz that i have not written down to the level of superficial observers and unthinking minds every great poet is a teacher i wish either to be considered as a teacher or as nothing  to turn to a more pleasing subject have you painted anything else beside this picture from peter bell your two oilpaintings and indeed everything i have of yours have been much admired by the artists who have seen them and for our own parts we like them better every day this in particular is the case with the small picture from the neighbourhood of coleorton which indeed pleased me much at the first sight but less impressed the rest of our household who now see as many beauties in it as i do myself havill the watercolour painter was much pleased with these things he is painting at ambleside and has done a view of rydal water looking down upon it from rydal park of which i should like to know your opinion it will be exhibited in the spring in the watercolour exhibition i have purchased a blacklead pencil sketch of mr green of ambleside which i think has great merit the materials being uncommonly picturesque and well put together i should dearly like to have the same subject it is the cottage at glencoign by ulleswater treated by you in the poem i have just written you will find one situation which if the work should ever become familiarly known would furnish as fine a subject for a picture as any thing i remember in poetry ancient or modern i need not mention what it is as when you read the poem you cannot miss it we have at last had by the same post two letters from coleridge long and melancholy and also from keswick an account so depressing as to the state of his health that i should have set off immediately to london to see him if i had not myself been confined by indisposition  i hope that davy is by this time perfectly restored to health believe me my dear sir george                 most sincerely yours                       w wordsworth32  32 memoirs vol i pp 3403   of building and gardening and laying out of grounds letter to sir george h beaumont bart                             grasmere october 17th 1805  my dear sir george  i was very glad to learn that you had room for me at coleorton and far more so that your health was so much mended lady beaumonts last letter to my sister has made us wish that you were fairly through your present engagements with workmen and builders and as to improvements had smoothed over the first difficulties and gotten things into a way of improving themselves i do not suppose that any man ever built a house without finding in the progress of it obstacles that were unforeseen and something that might have been better planned things teazing and vexatious when they come however the mind may have been made up at the outset to a general expectation of the kind  with respect to the grounds you have there the advantage of being in good hands namely those of nature and assuredly whatever petty crosses from contrariety of opinion or any other cause you may now meet with these will soon disappear and leave nothing behind but satisfaction and harmony setting out from the distinction made by coleridge which you mentioned that your house will belong to the country and not the country be an appendage to your house you cannot be wrong indeed in the present state of society i see nothing interesting either to the imagination or the heart and of course nothing which true taste can approve in any interference with nature grounded upon any other principle in times when the feudal system was in its vigor and the personal importance of every chieftain might be said to depend entirely upon the extent of his landed property and rights of seignory when the king in the habits of peoples minds was considered as the primary and true proprietor of the soil which was granted out by him to different lords and again by them to their several tenants under them for the joint defence of all there might have been something imposing to the imagination in the whole face of a district testifying obtrusively even its dependence upon its chief such an image would have been in the spirit of the society implying power grandeur military state and security and less directly in the person of the chief high birth and knightly education and accomplishments in short the most of what was then deemed interesting or affecting yet with the exception of large parks and forests nothing of this kind was known at that time and these were left in their wild state so that such display of ownership so far from taking from the beauty of nature was itself a chief cause of that beauty being left unspoiled and unimpaired the improvements when the place was sufficiently tranquil to admit of any though absurd and monstrous in themselves were confined as our present laureate has observed i remember in one of his essays to an acre or two about the house in the shape of garden with terraces c so that nature had greatly the advantage in those days when what has been called english gardening was unheard of this is now beginning to be perceived and we are setting out to travel backwards painters and poets have had the credit of being reckoned the fathers of english gardening they will also have hereafter the better praise of being fathers of a better taste error is in general nothing more than getting hold of good things as every thing has two handles by the wrong one it was a misconception of the meaning and principles of poets and painters which gave countenance to the modern system of gardening which is now i hope on the decline in other words we are submitting to the rule which you at present are guided by that of having our houses belong to the country which will of course lead us back to the simplicity of nature and leaving your own individual sentiments and present work out of the question what good can come of any other guide under any circumstances we have indeed distinctions of rank hereditary legislators and large landed proprietors but from numberless causes the state of society is so much altered that nothing of that lofty or imposing interest formerly attached to large property in land can now exist none of the poetic pride and pomp and circumstance nor anything that can be considered as making amends for violation done to the holiness of nature let us take an extreme case such as a residence of a duke of norfolk or northumberland of course you would expect a mansion in some degree answerable to their consequence with all conveniences the names of howard and percy will always stand high in the regards of englishmen but it is degrading not only to such families as these but to every really interesting one to suppose that their importance will be most felt where most displayed particularly in the way i am now alluding to this is contracting a general feeling into a local one besides were it not so as to what concerns the past a man would be sadly astray who should go for example to modernise alnwick and its dependencies with his head full of the ancient percies he would find nothing there which would remind him of them except by contrast and of that kind of admonition he would indeed have enough but this by the bye for it is against the principle itself i am contending and not the misapplication of it after what was said above i may ask if anything connected with the families of howard and percy and their rank and influence and thus with the state of government and society could in the present age be deemed a recompence for their thrusting themselves in between us and nature surely it is a substitution of little things for great when we would put a whole country into a noblemans livery i know nothing which to me would be so pleasing or affecting as to be able to say when i am in the midst of a large estatethis man is not the victim of his condition he is not the spoiled child of worldly grandeur the thought of himself does not take the lead in his enjoyments he is where he ought to be lowlyminded and has human feelings he has a true relish of simplicity and therefore stands the best chance of being happy at least without it there is no happiness because there can be no true sense of the bounty and beauty of the creation or insight into the constitution of the human mind let a man of wealth and influence shew by the appearance of the country in his neighbourhood that he treads in the steps of the good sense of the age and occasionally goes foremost let him give countenance to improvements in agriculture steering clear of the pedantry of it and showing that its grossest utilities will connect themselves harmoniously with the more intellectual arts and even thrive the best under such connection let him do his utmost to be surrounded with tenants living comfortably which will bring always with it the best of all graces which a country can haveflourishing fields and happylooking houses and in that part of his estate devoted to park and pleasureground let him keep himself as much out of sight as possible let nature be all in all taking care that everything done by man shall be in the way of being adopted by her if people chuse that a great mansion should be the chief figure in a country let this kind of keeping prevail through the picture and true taste will find no fault  i am writing now rather for writings sake than anything else for i have many remembrances beating about in my head which you would little suspect i have been thinking of you and coleridge and our scotch tour and lord lowthers grounds and heaven knows what i have had before me the tremendously long ellwide gravel walks of the duke of athol among the wild glens of blair bruar water and dunkeld brushed neatly without a blade of grass or weed upon them or anything that bore traces of a human footstep much indeed of human hands but wear or tear of foot was none thence i passd to our neighbour lord lowther you know that his predecessor greatly without doubt to the advantage of the place left it to take care of itself the present lord seems disposed to do something but not much he has a neighbour a quaker an amiable inoffensive man33 and a little of a poet too who has amused himself upon his own small estate upon the emont in twining pathways along the banks of the river making little cells and bowers with inscriptions of his own writing all very pretty as not spreading far this man is at present arbiter elegantiarum or master of the grounds at lowther and what he has done hitherto is very well as it is little more than making accessible what could not before be got at  33 mr thomas wilkinson see poem to his spade  you know something of lowther i believe a more delightful spot is not under the sun last summer i had a charming walk along the river for which i was indebted to this man whose intention is to carry the walk along the riverside till it joins the great road at lowther bridge which you will recollect just under brougham about a mile from penrith this to my great sorrow for the manufactured walk which was absolutely necessary in many places will in one place pass through a few hundred yards of forest ground and will there efface the most beautiful specimen of a forest pathway ever seen by human eyes and which i have paced many an hour when i was a youth with some of those i best love this path winds on under the trees with the wantonness of a river or a living creature and even if i may say so with the subtlety of a spirit contracting or enlarging itself visible or invisible as it likes there is a continued opening between the trees a narrow slip of green turf besprinkled with flowers chiefly daisies and here it is if i may use the same kind of language that this pretty path plays its pranks wearing away the turf and flowers at its pleasure when i took the walk i was speaking of last summer it was sunday i met several of the people of the country posting to and from church in different parts and in a retired spot by the riverside were two musicians belonging probably to some corps of volunteers playing upon the hautboy and clarionet you may guess i was not a little delighted and as you had been a visiter at lowther i could not help wishing you were with me and now i am brought to the sentiment which occasioned this detail i may say brought back to my subject which is thisthat all just and solid pleasure in natural objects rests upon two pillars god and man laying out grounds as it is called may be considered as a liberal art in some sort like poetry and painting and its object like that of all the liberal arts is or ought to be to move the affections under the controul of good sense that is those of the best and wisest but speaking with more precision it is to assist nature in moving the affections and surely as i have said the affections of those who have the deepest perception of the beauty of nature who have the most valuable feelings that is the most permanent the most independent the most ennobling connected with nature and human life no liberal art aims merely at the gratification of an individual or a class the painter or poet is degraded in proportion as he does so the true servants of the arts pay homage to the human kind as impersonated in unwarped and enlightened minds if this be so when we are merely putting together words or colours how much more ought the feeling to prevail when we are in the midst of the realities of things of the beauty and harmony of the joy and happiness of living creatures of men and children of birds and beasts of hills and streams and trees and flowers with the changes of night and day evening and morning summer and winter and all their unwearied actions and energies as benign in the spirit that animates them as they are beautiful and grand in that form and clothing which is given to them for the delight of our senses but i must stop for you feel these things as deeply as i more deeply if it were only for this that you have lived longer what then shall we say of many great mansions with their unqualified expulsion of human creatures from their neighbourhood happy or not houses which do what is fabled of the upas tree that they breathe out death and desolation i know you will feel with me here both as a man and a lover and professor of the arts i was glad to hear from lady beaumont that you did not think of removing your village of course much here will depend upon circumstances above all with what kind of inhabitants from the nature of the employments in that district the village is likely to be stocked but for my part strip my neighbourhood of human beings and i should think it one of the greatest privations i could undergo you have all the poverty of solitude nothing of its elevation in a word if i were disposed to write a sermon and this is something like one upon the subject of taste in natural beauty i should take for my text the little pathway in lowther woods and all which i had to say would begin and end in the human heart as under the direction of the divine nature conferring value on the objects of the senses and pointing out what is valuable in them  i began this subject with coleorton in my thoughts and a confidence that whatever difficulties or crosses as of many good things it is not easy to chuse the best you might meet with in the practical application of your principles of taste yet being what they are you will soon be pleased and satisfied only if i may take the freedom to say so do not give way too much to others considering what your studies and pursuits have been your own judgment must be the best professional men may suggest hints but i would keep the decision to myself  lady beaumont utters something like an apprehension that the slowness of workmen or other impediments may prevent our families meeting at coleorton next summer we shall be sorry for this the more so as the same cause will hinder your coming hither at all events we shall depend upon her frankness which we take most kindly indeed i mean on the promise she has made to let us know whether you are gotten so far through your work as to make it comfortable for us all to be together  i cannot close this letter without a word about myself i am sorry to say i am not yet settled to any serious employment the expectation of coleridge not a little unhinges me and still more the number of visitors we have had but winter is approaching and i have good hopes i mentioned michael angelos poetry some time ago it is the most difficult to construe i ever met with but just what you would expect from such a man shewing abundantly how conversant his soul was with great things there is a mistake in the world concerning the italian language the poetry of dante and michael angelo proves that if there be little majesty and strength in italian verse the fault is in the authors and not in the tongue i can translate and have translated two books of ariosto at the rate nearly of 100 lines a day but so much meaning has been put by michael angelo into so little room and that meaning sometimes so excellent in itself that i found the difficulty of translating him insurmountable i attempted at least fifteen of the sonnets but could not anywhere succeed i have sent you the only one i was able to finish it is far from being the best or most characteristic but the others were too much for me34  34 yes hope may with my strong desire keep pace c  i began this letter about a week ago having been interrupted i mention this because i have on this account to apologise to lady beaumont and to my sister also whose intention it was to have written but being very much engaged she put it off as i was writing we have been weaning dorothy and since she has had a return of the croup from an imprudent exposure on a very cold day but she is doing well again and my sister will write very soon lady beaumont inquired how game might be sent us there is a direct conveyance from manchester to kendal by the mail and a parcel directed for me to be delivered at kendal immediately to john brockbank ambleside postman would i dare say find its way to us expeditiously enough only you will have the goodness to mention in your letters when you do send anything otherwise we may not be aware of any mistake  i am glad the houbraken will be acceptable and will send it any way you shall think proper though perhaps as it would only make a small parcel there might be some risk in trusting it to the waggon or mail unless it could be conveniently inquired after no news of coleridge the length of this letter is quite formidable forgive it farewell and believe me my dear sir george       your truly affectionate friend                    w wordsworth35  35 memoirs vol i pp 34554 with very important additions from the original g   of the inscriptions at coleorton  letter to sir george h beaumont bart  my dear sir george  had there been room at the end of the small avenue of limetrees for planting a spacious circle of the same trees the urn might have been

here may some painter sit in future days     some future poet meditate his lays     not mindless of that distant age renowned     when inspiration hovered oer this ground     the haunt of him who sang how spear and shield     in civil conflict met on bosworth field     and of that famous youth full soon removed     from earth by mighty shakspeares self approved     fletchers associate jonsons friend beloved  the first couplet of the above as it before stood would have appeared ludicrous if the stone had remained after the tree might have been gone the couplet relating to the household virtues did not accord with the painter and the poet the former being allegorical figures the latter living men  what follows i composed yesterday morning thinking there might be no impropriety in placing it so as to be visible only to a person sitting within the niche which we hollowed out of the sandstone in the wintergarden i am told that this is in the present form of the niche impossible but i shall be most ready when i come to coleorton to scoop out a place for it if lady beaumont think it worth while      inscription      oft is the medal faithful to its trust     when temples columns towers are laid in dust     and tis a common ordinance of fate     that things obscure and small outlive the great     hence c  these inscriptions have all one fault they are too long but i was unable to do justice to the thoughts in less room the second has brought sir john beaumont and his brother francis so lively to my mind that i recur to the plan of republishing the formers poems perhaps in connection with those of francis could any further search be made after the crown of thorns if i recollect right southey applied without effect to the numerous friends he has among the collectors the best way perhaps of managing this republication would be to print it in a very elegant type and paper and not many copies to be sold high so that it might be prized by the collectors as a curiosity bearing in mind how many excellent things there are in sir john beaumonts little volume i am somewhat mortified at this mode of honouring his memory but in the present state of the taste of this country i cannot flatter myself that poems of that character would win their way into general circulation should it appear advisable another edition might afterwards be published upon a plan which would place the book within the reach of those who have little money to spare i remain my dear sir george                your affectionate friend                     w wordsworth36  36 memoirs vol i pp 35860   of poems coleridge c c  letter to sir george h beaumont bart                 grasmere sat nov 16 1811  my dear sir george  i have to thank you for two letters lady beaumont also will accept my acknowledgments for the interesting letter with which she favoured me                                       i learn from mrs coleridge who has lately heard from c that alston the painter has arrived in london coleridge speaks of him as a most interesting person he has brought with him a few pictures from his own pencil among others a cupid and psyche which in cs opinion has not for colouring been surpassed since titian c is about to deliver a course of lectures upon poetry at some institution in the city he is well and i learn that the friend has been a good deal inquired after lately for ourselves we never hear from him  i am glad that the inscriptions please you it did always appear to me that inscriptions particularly those in verse or in a dead language were never supposed necessarily to be the composition of those in whose name they appeared if a more striking or more dramatic effect could be produced i have always thought that in an epitaph or memorial of any kind a father or husband c might be introduced speaking without any absolute deception being intended that is the reader is understood to be at liberty to say to himselfthese verses or this latin may be the composition of some unknown person and not that of the father widow or friend from whose hand or voice they profess to proceed if the composition be natural affecting or beautiful it is all that is required this at least was my view of the subject or i should not have adopted that mode however in respect to your scruples which i feel are both delicate and reasonable i have altered the verses and i have only to regret that the alteration is not more happily done but i never found anything more difficult i wished to preserve the expression patrimonial grounds but i found this impossible on account of the awkwardness of the pronouns he and his as applied to reynolds and to yourself this even where it does not produce confusion is always inelegant i was therefore obliged to drop it so that we must be content i fear with the inscription as it stands below as you mention that the first copy was mislaid i will transcribe the first part from that but you can either choose the dome or the abbey as you like      ye limetrees ranged before this hallowed urn     shoot forth with lively power at springs return     and be not slow a stately growth to rear     of pillars branching off from year to year     till ye have framed at length a darksome aisle     like a recess within that sacred pile     where reynolds mid our countrys noblest dead     in the last sanctity of fame is laid c c  i hope this will do i tried a hundred different ways but cannot hit upon anything better i am sorry to learn from lady beaumont that there is reason to believe that our cedar is already perished i am sorry for it the verses upon that subject you and lady b praise highly and certainly if they have merit as i cannot but think they have your discriminating praises have pointed it out the alteration in the beginning i think with you is a great improvement and the first line is to my ear very rich and grateful as to the female and male i know not how to get rid of it for that circumstance gives the recess an appropriate interest i remember mr bowles the poet objected to the word ravishment at the end of the sonnet to the wintergarden yet it has the authority of all the firstrate poets for instance milton      in whose sight all things joy with ravishment     attracted by thy beauty still to gaze  objections upon these grounds merit more attention in regard to inscriptions than any other sort of composition and on this account the lines i mean those upon the niche had better be suppressed for it is not improbable that the altering of them might cost me more trouble than writing a hundred fresh ones  we were happy to hear that your mother lady beaumont was so surprisingly well you do not mention the school at coleorton pray how is wilkie in health and also as to progress in his art i do not doubt that i shall like arnolds picture but he would have been a better painter if his genius had led him to read more in the early part of his life wilkies style of painting does not require that the mind should be fed from books but i do not think it possible to excel in landscape painting without a strong tincture of the poetic spirit37   of the inscriptions at coleorton  letter to lady beaumont                             grasmere wednesday nov 20 1811  my dear lady beaumont  when you see this you will think i mean to overrun you with inscriptions i do not mean to tax you with putting them up only with reading them the following i composed yesterday morning in a walk from brathway whither i had been to accompany my sister      for a seat in the groves of coleorton      beneath yon eastern ridge the craggy bound     rugged and high of charnwoods forestground     stand yet but stranger hidden from thy view     the ivied ruins of forlorn grace dieu c c  i hope that neither you nor sir george will think that the above takes from the effect of the mention of francis beaumont in the poem upon the cedar grace dieu is itself so interesting a spot and has naturally and historically such a connection with coleorton that i could not deny myself the pleasure of paying it this mark of attention the thought of writing the inscription occurred to me many years ago i took the liberty of transcribing for sir george an alteration which i had made in the inscription for st herberts island i was not then quite satisfied with it i have since retouched it and will trouble you to read him the following which i hope will give you pleasure      this island guarded from profane approach     by mountains high and waters widely spread     gave to st herbert a benign retreat c c  i ought to mention that the line      and things of holy use unhallowed lie  is taken from the following of daniel      strait all that holy was unhallowed lies  37 memoirs vol i pp 3603  i will take this occasion of recommending to you if you happen to have daniels poems to read the epistle addressed to the lady margaret countess of cumberland beginning      he that of such a height hath built his mind  the whole poem is composed in a strain of meditative morality more dignified and affecting than anything of the kind i ever read it is besides strikingly applicable to the revolutions of the present times  my dear lady beaumont your letter and the accounts it contains of the wintergarden gave me great pleasure i cannot but think that under your care it will grow up into one of the most beautiful and interesting spots in england we all here have a longing desire to see it i have mentioned the high opinion we have of it to a couple of my friends persons of taste living in this country who are determined the first time they are called up to london to turn aside to visit it which i said they might without scruple do if they mentioned my name to the gardener my sister begs me to say that she is aware how long she has been in your debt and that she should have written before now but that as i have latterly been in frequent communication with coleorton she thought it as well to defer answering your letter do you see the courier newspaper at dunmow i ask on account of a little poem upon the comet which i have read in it today though with several defects and some feeble and constrained expressions it has great merit and is far superior to the run not merely of newspaper but of modern poetry in general i half suspect it to be coleridges for though it is in parts inferior to him i know no other writer of the day who can do so well it consists of five stanzas in the measure of the fairy queen it is to be found in last saturdays paper november 16th if you dont see the courier we will transcribe it for you as so much of this letter is taken up with my verses i will een trespass still further on your indulgence and conclude with a sonnet which i wrote some time ago upon the poet john dyer if you have not read the fleece i would strongly recommend it to you the character of dyer as a patriot a citizen and a tenderhearted friend of humanity was in some respects injurious to him as a poet and has induced him to dwell in his poem upon processes which however important in themselves were unsusceptible of being poetically treated accordingly his poem is in several places dry and heavy but its beauties are innumerable and of a high order in point of imagination and purity of style i am not sure that he is not superior to any writer in verse since the time of milton      sonnet      bard of the fleece whose skilful genius made     that work a living landscape fair and bright     nor hallowed less by musical delight     than those soft scenes through which thy childhood strayed     those southern tracts of cambria deep embayed c c  in the above is one whole line from the fleece and two other expressions when you read the fleece you will recognise them i remain my dear lady beaumont           your sincere friend               w wordsworth38  38 memoirs vol i pp 3636   excursion in north wales  letter to sir george h beaumont       hindwell radnor sept 20 1824 my dear sir george  after a three weeks ramble in north wales mrs wordsworth dora and myself are set down quietly here for three weeks more the weather has been delightful and everything to our wishes on a beautiful day we took the steampacket at liverpool passed the mouth of the dee coasted the extremity of the vale of clwyd sailed close under great orms head had a noble prospect of penmaenmawr and having almost touched upon puffins island we reached bangor ferry a little after six in the afternoon we admired the stupendous preparations for the bridge over the menai and breakfasted next morning at carnarvon we employed several hours in exploring the interior of the noble castle and looking at it from different points of view in the neighbourhood at halfpast four we departed for llanberris having fine views as we looked back of c castle the sea and anglesey a little before sunset we came in sight of llanberris lake snowdon and all the craggy hills and mountains surrounding it the foreground a beautiful contrast to this grandeur and desolationa green sloping hollow furnishing a shelter for one of the most beautiful collections of lowly welsh cottages with thatched roofs overgrown with plants anywhere to be met with the hamlet is called cumyglo and here we took boat while the solemn lights of evening were receding towards the tops of the mountains as we advanced dolbardin castle came in view and snowdon opened upon our admiration it was almost dark when we reached the quiet and comfortable inn at llanberris                                       there being no carriageroad we undertook to walk by the pass of llanberris eight miles to capel cerig this proved fatiguing but it was the only oppressive exertion we made during the course of our tour we arrived at capel cerig in time for a glance at the snowdonian range from the garden of the inn in connection with the lake or rather pool reflecting the crimson clouds of evening the outline of snowdon is perhaps seen nowhere to more advantage than from this place next morning five miles down a beautiful valley to the banks of the conway which stream we followed to llanrwst but the day was so hot that we could only make use of the morning and evening here we were joined according to previous arrangement by bishop hobart of new york who remained with us till two oclock next day and left us to complete his hasty tour through north and south wales in the afternoon arrived my old college friend and youthful companion among the alps the rev r jones and in his car we all proceeded to the falls of the conway thence up that river to a newlyerected inn on the irish road where we lodged having passed through bold and rocky scenery along the banks of a stream which is a feeder of the dee next morning we turned from the irish road three or four miles to visit the valley of meditation glyn mavyr where mr jones has at present a curacy with a comfortable parsonage we slept at corwen and went down the dee to llangollen which you and dear lady b know well called upon the celebrated recluses39 who hoped that you and lady b had not forgotten them they certainly had not forgotten you and they begged us to say that they retained a lively remembrance of you both we drank tea and passed a couple of hours with them in the evening having visited the aqueduct over the dee and chirk castle in the afternoon lady e has not been well and has suffered much in her eyes but she is surprisingly lively for her years miss p is apparently in unimpaired health next day i sent them the following sonnet from ruthin which was conceived and in a great measure composed in their grounds  39 the lady e butler and the hon miss ponsonby      a stream to mingle with your favourite dee     along the vale of meditation flows     so named by those fierce britons pleased to see     in natures face the expression of repose c c  we passed three days with mr joness friends in the vale of clwyd looking about us and on the tuesday set off again accompanied by our friend to complete our tour we dined at conway walked to bennarth the view from which is a good deal choked up with wood a small part of the castle has been demolished for the sake of the new road to communicate with the suspensionbridge which they are about to make to the small island opposite the castle to be connected by a long embankment with the opposite shore the bridge will i think prove rather ornamental when time has taken off the newness of its supporting masonry but the mound deplorably impairs the majesty of the water at hightide in fact it destroys its lakelike appearance our drive to aber in the evening was charming sun setting in glory we had also a delightful walk next morning up the vale of aber terminated by a lofty waterfall not much in itself but most striking as a closing accompaniment to the secluded valley here in the early morning i saw an odd sightfifteen milkmaids together laden with their brimming pails how cheerful and happy they appeared and not a little inclined to joke after the manner of the pastoral persons in theocritus that day brought us to capel cerig again after a charming drive up the banks of the ogwen having previously had beautiful views of bangor the sea and its shipping from capel cerig down the justly celebrated vale of nant gwynant to bethgelart in this vale are two small lakes the higher of which is the only welsh lake which has any pretensions to compare with our own and it has one great advantage over them that it remains wholly free from intrusive objects we saw it early in the morning and with the greenness of the meadows at its head the steep rocks on one of its shores and the bold mountains at both extremities a feature almost peculiar to itself it appeared to us truly enchanting the village of bethgelart is much altered for the worse new and formal houses have in a great measure supplanted the old rugged and tufted cottages and a smart hotel has taken the lead of the lowly publichouse in which i took refreshment almost thirty years ago previous to a midnight ascent to the summit of snowdon at b we were agreeably surprised by the appearance of mr hare of new college oxford we slept at tanybylch having employed the afternoon in exploring the beauties of the vale of festiniog next day to barmouth whence the following morning we took boat and rowed up its sublime estuary which may compare with the finest of scotland having the advantage of a superior climate from dolgelly we went to talyllyn a solitary and very interesting lake under cader idris next day being sunday we heard service performed in welsh and in the afternoon went part of the way down a beautiful valley to machynleth next morning to aberystwith and up the rhydiol to the devils bridge where we passed the following day in exploring those two rivers and hafod in the neighbourhood i had seen these things long ago but either my memory or my powers of observation had not done them justice it rained heavily in the night and we saw the waterfalls in perfection while dora was attempting to make a sketch from the chasm in the rain i composed by her side the following address to the torrent      how art thou named in search of what strange land     from what huge height descending can such force     of water issue from a british source  next day viz last wednesday we reached this place and found all our friends well except our good and valuable friend mr monkhouse who is here and in a very alarming state of health his physicians have ordered him to pass the winter in devonshire fearing a consumption but he is certainly not suffering under a regular hectic pulmonary decline his pulse is good so is his appetite and he has no fever but is deplorably emaciated he is a near relation of mrs w and one as you know of my best friends i hope to see mr price at foxley in a few days mrs ws brother is about to change his present residence for a farm close by foxley  now my dear sir george what chance is there of your being in wales during any part of the autumn i would strain a point to meet you anywhere were it only for a couple of days write immediately or should you be absent without lady b she will have the goodness to tell me of your movements i saw the lowthers just before i set off all well you probably have heard from my sister it is time to make an end of this long letter which might have been somewhat less dry if i had not wished to make you master of our whole route except ascending one of the high mountains snowdon or cader idris we omitted nothing and saw as much as the shortened days would allow with love to lady b and yourself dear sir george from us all i remain ever                      most faithfully yours                         wm wordsworth40  40 memoirs vol ii pp 1217     g letter to the right hon charles james fox  with the lyrical ballads 1801 with critical remarks on his poems             grasmere westmoreland january 14th 1801  sir  it is not without much difficulty that i have summoned the courage to request your acceptance of these volumes should i express my real feelings i am sure that i should seem to make a parade of diffidence and humility  several of the poems contained in these volumes are written upon subjects which are the common property of all poets and which at some period of your life must have been interesting to a man of your sensibility and perhaps may still continue to be so it would be highly gratifying to me to suppose that even in a single instance the manner in which i have treated these general topics should afford you any pleasure but such a hope does not influence me upon the present occasion in truth i do not feel it besides i am convinced that there must be many things in this collection which may impress you with an unfavourable idea of my intellectual powers i do not say this with a wish to degrade myself but i am sensible that this must be the case from the different circles in which we have moved and the different objects with which we have been conversant  being utterly unknown to you as i am i am well aware that if i am justified in writing to you at all it is necessary my letter should be short but i have feelings within me which i hope will so far show themselves as to excuse the trespass which i am afraid i shall make  in common with the whole of the english people i have observed in your public character a constant predominance of sensibility of heart necessitated as you have been from your public situation to have much to do with men in bodies and in classes and accordingly to contemplate them in that relation it has been your praise that you have not thereby been prevented from looking upon them as individuals and that you have habitually left your heart open to be influenced by them in that capacity this habit cannot but have made you dear to poets and i am sure that if since your first entrance into public life there has been a single true poet living in england he must have loved you  but were i assured that i myself had a just claim to the title of a poet all the dignity being attached to the word which belongs to it i do not think that i should have ventured for that reason to offer these volumes to you at present it is solely on account of two poems in the second volume the one entitled the brothers and the other michael that i have been emboldened to take this liberty  it appears to me that the most calamitous effect which has followed the measures which have lately been pursued in this country is a rapid decay of the domestic affections among the lower orders of society this effect the present rulers of this country are not conscious of or they disregard it for many years past the tendency of society amongst almost all the nations of europe has been to produce it but recently by the spreading of manufactures through every part of the country by the heavy taxes upon postage by workhouses houses of industry and the invention of soupshops c superadded to the increasing disproportion between the price of labour and that of the necessaries of life the bonds of domestic feeling among the poor as far as the influence of these things has extended have been weakened and in innumerable instances entirely destroyed the evil would be the less to be regretted if these institutions were regarded only as palliatives to a disease but the vanity and pride of their promoters are so subtly interwoven with them that they are deemed great discoveries and blessings to humanity in the meantime parents are separated from their children and children from their parents the wife no longer prepares with her own hands a meal for her husband the produce of his labour there is little doing in his house in which his affections can be interested and but little left in it that he can love i have two neighbours a man and his wife both upwards of eighty years of age they live alone the husband has been confined to his bed many months and has never had nor till within these few weeks has ever needed any body to attend to him but his wife she has recently been seized with a lameness which has often prevented her from being able to carry him his food to his bed the neighbours fetch water for her from the well and do other kind offices for them both but her infirmities increase she told my servant two days ago that she was afraid they must both be boarded out among some other poor of the parish they have long been supported by the parish but she said it was hard having kept house together so long to come to this and she was sure that it would burst her heart i mention this fact to show how deeply the spirit of independence is even yet rooted in some parts of the country these people could not express themselves in this way without an almost sublime conviction of the blessings of independent domestic life if it is true as i believe that this spirit is rapidly disappearing no greater curse can befall a land  i earnestly entreat your pardon for having detained you so long in the two poems the brothers and michael i have attempted to draw a picture of the domestic affections as i know they exist among a class of men who are now almost confined to the north of england they are small independent proprietors of land here called statesmen men of respectable education who daily labour on their own little properties the domestic affections will always be strong amongst men who live in a country not crowded with population if these men are placed above poverty but if they are proprietors of small estates which have descended to them from their ancestors the power which these affections will acquire amongst such men is inconceivable by those who have only had an opportunity of observing hired labourers farmers and the manufacturing poor their little tract of land serves as a kind of permanent rallying point for their domestic feelings as a tablet upon which they are written which makes them objects of memory in a thousand instances when they would otherwise be forgotten it is a fountain fitted to the nature of social man from which supplies of affection as pure as his heart was intended for are daily drawn this class of men is rapidly disappearing you sir have a consciousness upon which every good man will congratulate you that the whole of your public conduct has in one way or other been directed to the preservation of this class of men and those who hold similar situations you have felt that the most sacred of all property is the property of the poor the two poems which i have mentioned were written with a view to show that men who do not wear fine clothes can feel deeply pectus enim est quod disertos facit et vis mentis ideoque imperitis quoque si modo sint aliquo affectu concitati verba non desunt the poems are faithful copies from nature and i hope whatever effect they may have upon you you will at least be able to perceive that they may excite profitable sympathies in many kind and good hearts and may in some small degree enlarge our feelings of reverence for our species and our knowledge of human nature by showing that our best qualities are possessed by men whom we are too apt to consider not with reference to the points in which they resemble us but to those in which they manifestly differ from us i thought at a time when these feelings are sapped in so many ways that the two poems might cooperate however feebly with the illustrious efforts which you have made to stem this and other evils with which the country is labouring and it is on this account alone that i have taken the liberty of thus addressing you  wishing earnestly that the time may come when the country may perceive what it has lost by neglecting your advice and hoping that your latter days may be attended with health and comfort            i remain             with the highest respect and admiration             your most obedient and humble servant                         w wordsworth41  foxs reply was as follows  sir  i owe you many apologies for having so long deferred thanking you for your poems and your obliging letter accompanying them which i received early in march the poems have given me the greatest pleasure and if i were obliged to choose out of them i do not know whether i should not say that harry gill we are seven the mad mother and the idiot are my favourites i read with particular attention the two you pointed out but whether it be from early prepossessions or whatever other cause i am no great friend to blank verse for subjects which are to be treated of with simplicity  41 memoirs vol i pp 166171  you will excuse my stating my opinion to you so freely which i should not do if i did not really admire many of the poems in the collection and many parts even of those in blank verse of the poems which you state not to be yours that entitled love appears to me to be the best and i do not know who is the author the nightingale i understand to be mr coleridges who combats i think very successfully the mistaken prejudice of the nightingales note being melancholy i am with great truth      sir your most obedient servant           c j fox42  st anns hill may 25 1801  42 memoirs vol i pp 1712

ms he says       it is not a matter of indifference whether you are pleased with      his figure and employment it may be comparatively whether you are      pleased with this poem but it is of the utmost importance that      you should have had pleasure in contemplating the fortitude      independence persevering spirit and the general moral dignity of      this old mans character  43 entitled resolution and independence  and again on the same poem       i will explain to you in prose my feelings in writing that      poem i describe myself as having been exalted to the highest      pitch of delight by the joyousness and beauty of nature and then      as depressed even in the midst of those beautiful objects to the      lowest dejection and despair a young poet in the midst of the      happiness of nature is described as overwhelmed by the thoughts of      the miserable reverses which have befallen the happiest of all men      viz poets i think of this till i am so deeply impressed with it      that i consider the manner in which i was rescued from my dejection      and despair almost as an interposition of providence a person      reading the poem with feelings like mine will have been awed and      controlled expecting something spiritual or supernatural what is      brought forward a lonely place a pond by which an old man      was far from all house or home not stood nor sat but      wasthe figure presented in the most naked simplicity possible      this feeling of spirituality or supernaturalness is again referred      to as being strong in my mind in this passage how came he here      thought i or what can he be doing i then describe him whether      ill or well is not for me to judge with perfect confidence but      this i can confidently affirm that though i believe god has      given me a strong imagination i cannot conceive a figure more      impressive than that of an old man like this the survivor of a      wife and ten children travelling alone among the mountains and all      lonely places carrying with him his own fortitude and the      necessities which an unjust state of society has laid upon him you      speak of his speech as tedious everything is tedious when one does      not read with the feelings of the author the thorn is tedious to      hundreds and so is the idiot boy to hundreds it is in the      character of the old man to tell his story which an impatient      reader must feel tedious but good heavens such a figure in such      a place a pious selfrespecting miserably infirm and pleased old      man telling such a tale       your feelings upon the mother and the boy with the butterfly      were not indifferent it was an affair of whole continents of moral      sympathy       i am for the most part uncertain about my success in altering      poems but in this case speaking of an insertion i am sure i      have produced a great improvement44  44 memoirs vol i pp 166174     h of the principles of poetry and his own poems  letter to afterwards professor john wilson christopher north  to   my dear sir  had it not been for a very amiable modesty you could not have imagined that your letter could give me any offence it was on many accounts highly grateful to me i was pleased to find that i had given so much pleasure to an ingenuous and able mind and i further considered the enjoyment which you had had from my poems as an earnest that others might be delighted with them in the same or a like manner it is plain from your letter that the pleasure which i have given you has not been blind or unthinking you have studied the poems and prove that you have entered into the spirit of them they have not given you a cheap or vulgar pleasure therefore i feel that you are entitled to my kindest thanks for having done some violence to your natural diffidence in the communication which you have made to me  there is scarcely any part of your letter that does not deserve particular notice but partly from some constitutional infirmities and partly from certain habits of mind i do not write any letters unless upon business not even to my dearest friends except during absence from my own family i have not written five letters of friendship during the last five years i have mentioned this in order that i may retain your good opinion should my letter be less minute than you are entitled to expect you seem to be desirous of my opinion on the influence of natural objects in forming the character of nations this cannot be understood without first considering their influence upon men in general first with reference to such objects as are common to all countries and next such as belong exclusively to any particular country or in a greater degree to it than to another now it is manifest that no human being can be so besotted and debased by oppression penury or any other evil which unhumanises man as to be utterly insensible to the colours forms or smell of flowers the voices45 and motions of birds and beasts the appearances of the sky and heavenly bodies the general warmth of a fine day the terror and uncomfortableness of a storm c c how dead soever many fullgrown men may outwardly seem to these things all are more or less affected by them and in childhood in the first practice and exercise of their senses they must have been not the nourishers merely but often the fathers of their passions there cannot be a doubt that in tracts of country where images of danger melancholy grandeur or loveliness softness and ease prevail that they will make themselves felt powerfully in forming the characters of the people so as to produce an uniformity or national character where the nation is small and is not made up of men who inhabiting different soils climates c by their civil usages and relations materially interfere with each other it was so formerly no doubt in the highlands of scotland but we cannot perhaps observe much of it in our own island at the present day because even in the most sequestered places by manufactures traffic religion law interchange of inhabitants c distinctions are done away which would otherwise have been strong and obvious this complex state of society does not however prevent the characters of individuals from frequently receiving a strong bias not merely from the impressions of general nature but also from local objects and images but it seems that to produce these effects in the degree in which we frequently find them to be produced there must be a peculiar sensibility of original organisation combining with moral accidents as is exhibited in the brothers and in ruth i mean to produce this in a marked degree not that i believe that any man was ever brought up in the country without loving it especially in his better moments or in a district of particular grandeur or beauty without feeling some stronger attachment to it on that account than he would otherwise have felt i include you will observe in these considerations the influence of climate changes in the atmosphere and elements and the labours and occupations which particular districts require   45 parts of this letter have been torn and words have been lost some of which are here conjecturally supplied between brackets  you begin what you say upon the idiot boy with this observation that nothing is a fit subject for poetry which does not please but here follows a question does not please whom some have little knowledge of natural imagery of any kind and of course little relish for it some are disgusted with the very mention of the words pastoral poetry sheep or shepherds some cannot tolerate a poem with a ghost or any supernatural agency in it others would shrink from an animated description of the pleasures of love as from a thing carnal and libidinous some cannot bear to see delicate and refined feelings ascribed to men in low conditions in society because their vanity and selflove tell them that these belong only to themselves and men like themselves in dress station and way of life others are disgusted with the naked language of some of the most interesting passions of men because either it is indelicate or gross or vulgar as many fine ladies could not bear certain expressions in the mother and the thorn and as in the instance of adam smith who we are told could not endure the ballad of clym of the clough because the author had not written like a gentleman then there are professional and national prejudices for evermore some take no interest in the description of a particular passion or quality as love of solitariness we will say genial activity of fancy love of nature religion and so forth because they have little or nothing of it in themselves and so on without end i return then to the question please whom or what i answer human nature as it has been and ever will be but where are we to find the best measure of this i answer from with in by stripping our own hearts naked and by looking out of ourselves to wards men who lead the simplest lives and most according to nature men who have never known false refinements wayward and artificial desires false criticisms effeminate habits of thinking and feeling or who having known these things have outgrown them this latter class is the most to be depended upon but it is very small in number people in our rank in life are perpetually falling into one sad mistake namely that of supposing that human nature and the persons they associate with are one and the same thing whom do we generally associate with gentlemen persons of fortune professional men ladies persons who can afford to buy or can easily procure books of halfaguinea price hotpressed and printed upon superfine paper these persons are it is true a part of human nature but we err lamentably if we suppose them to be fair representatives of the vast mass of human existence and yet few ever consider books but with reference to their power of pleasing these persons and men of a higher rank few descend lower among cottages and fields and among children a man must have done this habitually before his judgment upon the idiot boy would be in any way decisive with me i know i have done this myself habitually i wrote the poem with exceeding delight and pleasure and whenever i read it i read it with pleasure you have given me praise for having reflected faithfully in my poems the feelings of human nature i would fain hope that i have done so but a great poet ought to do more than this he ought to a certain degree to rectify mens feelings to give them new compositions of feeling to render their feelings more sane pure and permanent in short more consonant to nature that is to eternal nature and the great moving spirit of things he ought to travel before men occasionally as well as at their sides i may illustrate this by a reference to natural objects what false notions have prevailed from generation to generation of the true character of the nightingale as far as my friends poem in the lyrical ballads is read it will contribute greatly to rectify these you will recollect a passage in cowper where speaking of rural sounds he says            and even the boding owl     that hails the rising moon has charms for me  cowper was passionately fond of natural objects yet you see he mentions it as a marvellous thing that he could connect pleasure with the cry of the owl in the same poem he speaks in the same manner of that beautiful plant the gorse making in some degree an amiable boast of his loving it unsightly and unsmooth as it is there are many aversions of this kind which though they have some foundation in nature have yet so slight a one that though they may have prevailed hundreds of years a philosopher will look upon them as accidents so with respect to many moral feelings either of love or dislike what excessive admiration was paid in former times to personal prowess and military success it is so with the latter even at the present day but surely not nearly so much as heretofore so with regard to birth and innumerable other modes of sentiment civil and religious but you will be inclined to ask by this time how all this applies to the idiot boy to this i can only say that the loathing and disgust which many people have at the sight of an idiot is a feeling which though having some foundation in human nature is not necessarily attached to it in any virtuous degree but is owing in a great measure to a false delicacy and if i may say it without rudeness a certain want of comprehensiveness of thinking and feeling persons in the lower classes of society have little or nothing of this if an idiot is born in a poor mans house it must be taken care of and cannot be boarded out as it would be by gentlefolks or sent to a public or private receptacle for such unfortunate beings poor people seeing frequently among their neighbours such objects easily forget whatever there is of natural disgust about them and have therefore a sane state so that without pain or suffering they perform their duties towards them i could with pleasure pursue this subject but i must now strictly adopt the plan which i proposed to myself when i began to write this letter namely that of setting down a few hints or memorandums which you will think of for my sake  i have often applied to idiots in my own mind that sublime expression of scripture that their life is hidden with god they are worshipped probably from a feeling of this sort in several parts of the east among the alps where they are numerous they are considered i believe as a blessing to the family to which they belong i have indeed often looked upon the conduct of fathers and mothers of the lower classes of society towards idiots as the great triumph of the human heart it is there that we see the strength disinterestedness and grandeur of love nor have i ever been able to contemplate an object that calls out so many excellent and virtuous sentiments without finding it hallowed thereby and having something in me which bears down before it like a deluge every feeble sensation of disgust and aversion  there are in my opinion several important mistakes in the latter part of your letter which i could have wished to notice but i find myself much fatigued these refer both to the boy and the mother i must content myself simply with observing that it is probable that the principal cause of your dislike to this particular poem lies in the word idiot if there had been any such word in our language to which we had attached passion as lackwit halfwit witless c i should have certainly employed it in preference but there is no such word observe this is entirely in reference to this particular poem my idiot is not one of those who cannot articulate and such as are usually disgusting in their persons      whether in cunning or in joy     and then his words were not a few c  and the last speech at the end of the poem the boy whom i had in my mind was by no means disgusting in his appearance quite the contrary and i have known several with imperfect faculties who are handsome in their persons and features there is one at present within a mile of my own house remarkably so though he has something of a stare and vacancy in his countenance a friend of mine knowing that some persons had a dislike to the poem such as you have expressed advised me to add a stanza describing the person of the boy so as entirely to separate him in the imaginations of my readers from that class of idiots who are disgusting in their persons but the narration in the poem is so rapid and impassioned that i could not find a place in which to insert the stanza without checking the progress of it and so leaving a deadness upon the feeling this poem has i know frequently produced the same effect as it did upon you and your friends but there are many also to whom it affords exquisite delight and who indeed prefer it to any other of my poems this proves that the feelings there delineated are such as men may sympathise with this is enough for my purpose it is not enough for me as a poet to delineate merely such feelings as all men do sympathise with but it is also highly desirable to add to these others such as all men may sympathise with and such as there is reason to believe they would be better and more moral beings if they did sympathise with  i conclude with regret because i have not said one half of what i intended to say but i am sure you will deem my excuse sufficient when i inform you that my head aches violently and i am in other respects unwell i must however again give you my warmest thanks for your kind letter i shall be happy to hear from you again and do not think it unreasonable that i should request a letter from you when i feel that the answer which i may make to it will not perhaps be above three or four lines this i mention to you with frankness and you will not take it ill after what i have before said of my remissness in writing letters             i am dear sir            with great respect            yours sincerely                 w wordsworth46  46 memoirs vol i pp 192200

316     directions and information for the tourist  in preparing this manual it was the authors principal wish to furnish a guide or companion for the minds of persons of taste and feeling for landscape who might be inclined to explore the district of the lakes with that degree of attention to which its beauty may fairly lay claim for the more sure attainment however of this primary object he will begin by undertaking the humble and tedious task of supplying the tourist with directions how to approach the several scenes in their best or most convenient order but first supposing the approach to be made from the south and through yorkshire there are certain interesting spots which may be confidently recommended to his notice if time can be spared before entering upon the lake district and the route may be changed in returning  there are three approaches to the lakes through yorkshire the least adviseable is the great north road by catterick and greta bridge and onwards to penrith the traveller however taking this route might halt at greta bridge and be well recompenced if he can afford to give an hour or two to the banks of the greta and of the tees at rokeby barnard castle also about two miles up the tees is a striking object and the main north road might be rejoined at bowes every one has heard of the great fall of the tees above middleham interesting for its grandeur as the avenue of rocks that leads to it is to the geologist but this place lies so far out of the way as scarcely to be within the compass of our notice it might however be visited by a traveller on foot or on horseback who could rejoin the main road upon stanemoor  the second road leads through a more interesting tract of country beginning at ripon from which place see fountains abbey and thence by hackfall and masham to jervaux abbey and up the vale of wensley turning aside before askrigg is reached to see aysgarthforce upon the ure and again near hawes to hardraw scar of which with its waterfall turner has a fine drawing thence over the fells to sedbergh and kendal  the third approach from yorkshire is through leeds four miles beyond that town are the ruins of kirkstall abbey should that road to skipton be chosen but the other by otley may be made much more interesting by turning off at addington to bolton bridge for the sake of visiting the abbey and grounds it would be well however for a party previously to secure beds if wanted at the inn as there is but one and it is much resorted to in summer  the traveller on foot or horseback would do well to follow the banks of the wharf upwards to burnsall and thence cross over the hills to gordalea noble scene beautifully described in grays tour and with which no one can be disappointed thence to malham where there is a respectable village inn and so on by malham cove to settle  travellers in carriages must go from bolton bridge to skipton where they rejoin the main road and should they be inclined to visit gordale a tolerable road turns off beyond skipton beyond settle under giggleswick scar the road passes an ebbing and flowing well worthy the notice of the naturalist four miles to the right of ingleton is weathercote cave a fine object but whoever diverges for this must return to ingleton near kirkby lonsdale observe the view from the bridge over the lune and descend to the channel of the river and by no means omit looking at the vale of lune from the churchyard  the journey towards the lake country through lancashire is with the exception of the vale of the ribble at preston uninteresting till you come near lancaster and obtain a view of the fells and mountains of lancashire and westmoreland with lancaster castle and the tower of the church seeming to make part of the castle in the foreground  they who wish to see the celebrated ruins of furness abbey and are not afraid of crossing the sands may go from lancaster to ulverston from which place take the direct road to dalton but by all means return through urswick for the sake of the view from the top of the hill before descending into the grounds of conishead priory from this quarter the lakes would be advantageously approached by coniston thence to hawkshead and by the ferry over windermere to bowness a much better introduction than by going direct from coniston to ambleside which ought not to be done as that would greatly take off from the effect of windermere  let us now go back to lancaster the direct road thence to kendal is 22 miles but by making a circuit of eight miles the vale of the lune to kirkby lonsdale will be included the whole tract is pleasing there is one view mentioned by gray and mason especially so in wests guide it is thus pointed outabout a quarter of a mile beyond the third milestone where the road makes a turn to the right there is a gate on the left which leads into a field where the station meant will be found thus far for those who approach the lakes from the south  travellers from the north would do well to go from carlisle by wigton and proceed along the lake of bassenthwaite to keswick or if convenience should take them first to penrith it would still be better to cross the country to keswick and begin with that vale rather than with ulswater it is worth while to mention in this place that the banks of the river eden about corby are well worthy of notice both on account of their natural beauty and the viaducts which have recently been carried over the bed of the river and over a neighbouring ravine in the church of wetherby close by is a fine piece of monumental sculpture by nollekens the scenes of nunnery upon the eden or rather that part of them which is upon croglin a mountain stream there falling into the eden are in their way unrivalled but the nearest road thither from corby is so bad that no one can be advised to take it in a carriage nunnery may be reached from corby by making a circuit and crossing the eden at armathwaite bridge a portion of this road however is bad enough  as much the greatest number of lake tourists begin by passing from kendal to bowness upon windermere our notices shall commence with that lake bowness is situated upon its eastern side and at equal distance from each extremity of the lake of  windermere  the lower part of this lake is rarely visited but has many interesting points of view especially at storrs hall and at fellfoot where the coniston mountains peer nobly over the western barrier which elsewhere along the whole lake is comparatively tame to one also who has ascended the hill from grathwaite on the western side the promontory called rawlinsons nab storrs hall and the troutbeck mountains about sunset make a splendid landscape the view from the pleasurehouse of the station near the ferry has suffered much from larch plantations this mischief however is gradually disappearing and the larches under the management of the proprietor mr curwen are giving way to the native wood windermere ought to be seen both from its shores and from its surface none of the other lakes unfold so many fresh beauties to him who sails upon them this is owing to its greater size to the islands and to its having two vales at the head with their accompanying mountains of nearly equal dignity nor can the grandeur of these two terminations be seen at once from any point except from the bosom of the lake the islands may be explored at any time of the day but one bright unruffled evening must if possible be set apart for the splendour the stillness and solemnity of a three hours voyage upon the higher division of the lake not omitting towards the end of the excursion to quit the expanse of water and peep into the close and calm river at the head which in its quiet character at such a time appears rather like an overflow of the peaceful lake itself than to have any more immediate connection with the rough mountains whence it has descended or the turbulent torrents by which it is supplied many persons content themselves with what they see of windermere during their progress in a boat from bowness to the head of the lake walking thence to ambleside but the whole road from bowness is rich in diversity of pleasing or grand scenery there is scarcely a field on the road side which if entered would not give to the landscape some additional charm lowwood inn a mile from the head of windermere is a most pleasant haltingplace no inn in the whole district is so agreeably situated for water views and excursions and the fields above it and the lane that leads to troutbeck present beautiful views towards each extremity of the lake from this place and from                      ambleside  rides may be taken in numerous directions and the interesting walks are inexhaustible47 a few out of the main road may be particularizedthe lane that leads from ambleside to skelgill the ride or walk by rothay bridge and up the stream under loughrigg fell continued on the western side of rydal lake and along the fell to the foot of grasmere lake and thence round by the church of grasmere or turning round loughrigg fell by loughrigg tarn and the river brathay back to ambleside from ambleside is another charming excursion by clappersgate where cross the brathay and proceed with the river on the right to the hamlet of skelwithfold when the houses are passed turn before you descend the hill through a gate on the right and from a rocky point is a fine view of the brathay river langdale pikes c then proceed to colwithforce and up little langdale to blea tarn the scene in which this small piece of water lies suggested to the author the following description given in his poem of the excursion supposing the spectator to look down upon it not from the road but from one of its elevated sides                behold     beneath our feet a little lowly vale     a lowly vale and yet uplifted high     among the mountains even as if the spot     had been from eldest time by wish of theirs     so placed to be shut out from all the world     urnlike it was in shape deep as an urn     with rocks encompassed save that to the south     was one small opening where a heathclad ridge     supplied a boundary less abrupt and close     a quiet treeless nook48 with two green fields     a liquid pool that glittered in the sun     and one bare dwelling one abode no more     it seemed the home of poverty and toil     though not of want the little fields made green     by husbandry of many thrifty years     paid cheerful tribute to the moorland house     there crows the cock single in his domain     the small birds find in spring no thicket there     to shroud them only from the neighbouring vales     the cuckoo straggling up to the hill tops     shouteth faint tidings of some gladder place  47 mr greens guide to the lakes in two vols contains a complete magazine of minute and accurate information of this kind with the names of mountains streams c  48 no longer strictly applicable on account of recent plantations  from this little vale return towards ambleside by great langdale stopping if there be time to see dungeonghyll waterfall  the lake of  coniston  may be conveniently visited from ambleside but is seen to most advantage by entering the country over the sands from lancaster the stranger from the moment he sets his foot on those sands seems to leave the turmoil and traffic of the world behind him and crossing the majestic plain whence the sea has retired he beholds rising apparently from its base the cluster of mountains among which he is going to wander and towards whose recesses by the vale of coniston he is gradually and peacefully led from the inn at the head of coniston lake a leisurely traveller might have much pleasure in looking into yewdale and tilberthwaite returning to his inn from the head of yewdale by a mountain track which has the farm of tarn hows a little on the right by this road is seen much the best view of coniston lake from the south at the head of coniston water there is an agreeable inn from which an enterprising tourist might go to the vale of the duddon over walna scar down to seathwaite newfield and to the rocks where the river issues from a narrow pass into the broad vale the stream is very interesting for the space of a mile above this point and below by ulpha kirk till it enters the sands where it is overlooked by the solitary mountain black comb the summit of which as that experienced surveyor colonel mudge declared commands a more extensive view than any point in britain ireland he saw more than once but not when the sun was above the horizon      close by the sea lone sentinel       blackcomb his forward station keeps     he breaks the seas tumultuous swell       and ponders oer the level deeps      he listens to the bugle horn       where eskdales lovely valley bends     eyes walneys early fields of corn       seabirds to holkers woods he sends      beneath his feet the sunk ship rests       in duddon sands its masts all bare                                       the minstrels of windermere by chas farish bd  the tourist may either return to the inn at coniston by broughton or by turning to the left before he comes to that town or which would be much better he may cross from  ulpha kirk  over birker moor to birkerforce at the head of the finest ravine in the country and thence up the vale of the esk by hardknot and wrynose back to ambleside near the road in ascending from eskdale are conspicuous remains of a roman fortress details of the duddon and donnerdale are given in the authors series of sonnets upon the duddon and in the accompanying notes in addition to its two vales at its head windermere communicates with two lateral vallies that of troutbeck distinguished by the mountains at its headby picturesque remains of cottage architecture and towards the lower part by bold foregrounds formed by the steep and winding banks of the river this vale as before mentioned may be most conveniently seen from low wood the other lateral valley that of hawkshead is visited to most advantage and most conveniently from bowness crossing the lake by the ferrythen pass the two villages of sawrey and on quitting the latter you have a fine view of the lake of esthwaite and the cone of one of the langdale pikes in the distance  before you leave ambleside give three minutes to looking at a passage of the brook which runs through the town it is to be seen from a garden on the right bank of the stream a few steps above the bridgethe garden at present is rented by mrs aireystockgillforce upon the same stream will have been mentioned to you as one of the sights of the neighbourhood and by a tourist halting a few days in ambleside the nook also might be visited a spot where there is a bridge over scandalebeck which makes a pretty subject for the pencil lastly for residents of a week or so at ambleside there are delightful rambles over every part of loughrigg fell and among the enclosures on its sides particularly about loughrigg tarn and on its eastern side about fox how and the properties adjoining to the northwards  road from ambleside to keswick  the waterfalls of rydal are pointed out to every one but it ought to be observed here that rydalmere is no where seen to advantage from the main road fine views of it may be had from rydal park but these grounds as well as those of rydal mount and ivy cottage from which also it is viewed to advantage are private a foot road passing behind rydal mount and under nab scar to grasmere is very favourable to views of the lake and the vale looking back towards ambleside the horse road also along the western side of the lake under loughrigg fell as before mentioned does justice to the beauties of this small mere of which the traveller who keeps the high road is not at all aware  grasmere  there are two small inns in the vale of grasmere one near the church from which it may be conveniently explored in every direction and a mountain walk taken up easedale to easedale tarn one of the finest tarns in the country thence to stickle tarn and to the top of langdale pikes see also the vale of grasmere from butterlip how a boat is kept by the innkeeper and this circular vale in the solemnity of a fine evening will make from the bosom of the lake an impression that will be scarcely ever effaced  the direct road from grasmere to keswick does not as has been observed of rydal mere shew to advantage thirlmere or wythburn lake with its surrounding mountains by a traveller proceeding at leisure a deviation ought to be made from the main road when he has advanced a little beyond the sixth milestone short of keswick from which point there is a noble view of the vale of legberthwaite with blencathra commonly called saddleback in front having previously enquired at the inn near wythburn chapel the best way from this milestone to the bridge that divides the lake he must cross it and proceed with the lake on the right to the hamlet a little beyond its termination and rejoin the main road upon shoulthwaite moss about four miles from keswick or if on foot the tourist may follow the stream that issues from thirlmere down the romantic vale of st johns and so enquiring the way at some cottage to keswick by a circuit of little more than a mile a more interesting tract of country is scarcely any where to be seen than the road between ambleside and keswick with the deviations that have been pointed out helvellyn may be conveniently ascended from the inn at wythburn  the vale of keswick  this vale stretches without winding nearly north and south from the head of derwent water to the foot of bassenthwaite lake it communicates with borrowdale on the south with the river greta and thirlmere on the east with which the traveller has become acquainted on his way from ambleside and with the vale of newlands on the westwhich last vale he may pass through in going to or returning from buttermere the best views of keswick lake are from crow park friers crag the stablefield close by the vicarage and from various points in taking the circuit of the lake more distant views and perhaps full as interesting are from the side of latrigg from ormathwaite and applethwaite and thence along the road at the foot of skiddaw towards bassenthwaite for about a quarter of a mile there are fine birds eye views from the castlehill from ashness on the road to watenlath and by following the watenlath stream downwards to the cataract of lodore this lake also if the weather be fine ought to be circumnavigated there are good views along the western side of bassenthwaite lake and from armathwaite at its foot but the eastern side from the high road has little to recommend it the traveller from carlisle approaching by way of ireby has from the old road on the top of bassenthwaitehawse much the most striking view of the plain and lake of bassenthwaite flanked by skiddaw and terminated by wallowcrag on the southeast of derwent lake the same point commands an extensive view of solway frith and the scotch mountains they who take the circuit of derwent lake may at the same time include borrowdale going as far as bowderstone or rosthwaite borrowdale is also conveniently seen on the way to wastdale over styhead or to buttermere by seatoller and honister crag or going over the stake through langdale to ambleside buttermere may be visited by a shorter way through newlands but though the descent upon the vale of buttermere by this approach is very striking as it also is to one entering by the head of the vale under honister crag yet after all the best entrance from keswick is from the lower part of the vale having gone over whinlater to scale hill where there is a roomy inn with very good accommodation the mountains of the vale of  buttermere and crummock  are no where so impressive as from the bosom of crummock water scaleforce near it is a fine chasm with a lofty though but slender fall of water  from scale hill a pleasant walk may be taken to an eminence in mr marshalls woods and another by crossing the bridge at the foot of the hill upon which the inn stands and turning to the right after the opposite hill has been ascended a little way then follow the road for half a mile or so that leads towards lorton looking back upon crummock water c between the openings of the fences turn back and make your way to  loweswater  but this small lake is only approached to advantage from the other end therefore any traveller going by this road to wastdale must look back upon it this road to wastdale after passing the village of lamplugh cross presents suddenly a fine view of the lake of ennerdale with its mountains and six or seven miles beyond leads down upon calder abbey little of this ruin is left but that little is well worthy of notice at calder bridge are two comfortable inns and a few miles beyond accommodations may be had at the strands at the foot of wastdale into  wastdale  are three horseroads viz over the stye from borrowdale a short cut from eskdale by burnmore tarn which road descends upon the head of the lake and the principal entrance from the open country by the strands at its foot this last is much the best approach wastdale is well worth the notice of the traveller who is not afraid of fatigue no part of the country is more distinguished by sublimity wastwater may also be visited from ambleside by going up langdale over hardknot and wrynosedown eskdale and by irton hall to the strands but this road can only be taken on foot or on horseback or in a cart  we will conclude with  ullswater  as being perhaps upon the whole the happiest combination of beauty and grandeur which any of the lakes affords it lies not more than ten miles from ambleside and the pass of kirkstone and the descent from it are very impressive but notwithstanding this vale like the others loses much of its effect by being entered from the head so that it is better to go from keswick through matterdale and descend upon gowbarrow park you are thus brought at once upon a magnificent view of the two higher reaches of the lake araforce thunders down the ghyll on the left at a small distance from the road if ullswater be approached from penrith a mile and a half brings you to the winding vale of eamont and the prospects increase in interest till you reach patterdale but the first four miles along ullswater by this road are comparatively tame and in order to see the lower part of the lake to advantage it is necessary to go round by pooley bridge and to ride at least three miles along the westmoreland side of the water towards martindale the views especially if you ascend from the road into the fields are magnificent yet this is only mentioned that the transient visitant may know what exists for it would be inconvenient to go in search of them they who take this course of three or four miles on foot should have a boat in readiness at the end of the walk to carry them across to the cumberland side of the lake near old church thence to pursue the road upwards to patterdale the churchyard yewtree still survives at old church but there are no remains of a place of worship a new chapel having been erected in a more central situation which chapel was consecrated by the then bishop of carlisle when on his way to crown queen elizabeth he being the only prelate who would undertake the office it may be here mentioned that bassenthwaite chapel yet stands in a bay as sequestered as the site of old church such situations having been chosen in disturbed times to elude marauders  the trunk or body of the vale of ullswater need not be further noticed as its beauties show themselves but the curious traveller may wish to know something of its tributary streams  at dalemain about three miles from penrith a stream is crossed called the dacre or dacor which name it bore as early as the time of the venerable bede this stream does not enter the lake but joins the eamont a mile below it rises in the moorish country about penruddock flows down a soft sequestered valley passing by the ancient mansions of hutton john and dacre castle the former is pleasantly situated though of a character somewhat gloomy and monastic and from some of the fields near dalemain dacre castle backed by the jagged summit of saddleback with the valley and stream in front forms a grand picture there is no other stream that conducts to any glen or valley worthy of being mentioned till we reach that which leads up to araforce and thence into matterdale before spoken of matterdale though a wild and interesting spot has no peculiar features that would make it worth the strangers while to go in search of them but in gowbarrow park the lover of nature might linger for hours here is a powerful brook which dashes among rocks through a deep glen hung on every side with a rich and happy intermixture of native wood here are beds of luxuriant fern aged hawthorns and hollies decked with honeysuckles and fallowdeer glancing and bounding over the lawns and through the thickets these are the attractions of the retired views or constitute a foreground for evervarying pictures of the majestic lake forced to take a winding course by bold promontories and environed by mountains of sublime form towering above each other at the outlet of gowbarrow park we reach a third stream which flows through a little recess called glencoin where lurks a single house yet visible from the road let the artist or leisurely traveller turn aside to it for the buildings and objects around them are romantic and picturesque having passed under the steeps of styebarrow crag and the remains of its native woods at glenridding bridge a fourth stream is crossed  the opening on the side of ullswater vale down which this stream flows is adorned with fertile fields cottages and natural groves that agreeably unite with the transverse views of the lake and the stream if followed up after the enclosures are left behind will lead along bold waterbreaks and waterfalls to a silent tarn in the recesses of helvellyn this desolate spot was formerly haunted by eagles that built in the precipice which forms its western barrier these birds used to wheel and hover round the head of the solitary angler it also derives a melancholy interest from the fate of a young man a stranger who perished some years ago by falling down the rocks in his attempt to cross over to grasmere his remains were discovered by means of a faithful dog that had lingered here for the space of three months selfsupported and probably retaining to the last an attachment to the skeleton of its master but to return to the road in the main vale of ullswaterat the head of the lake being now in patterdale we cross a fifth stream grisdale beck this would conduct through a woody steep where may be seen some unusually large ancient hollies up to the level area of the valley of grisdale hence there is a path for foottravellers and along which a horse may be led to grasmere a sublime combination of mountain forms appears in front while ascending the bed of this valley and the impression increases till the path leads almost immediately under the projecting masses of helvellyn having retraced the banks of the stream to patterdale and pursued the road up the main dale the next considerable stream would if ascended in the same manner conduct to deepdale the character of which valley may be conjectured from its name it is terminated by a cove a craggy and gloomy abyss with precipitous sides a faithful receptacle of the snows that are driven into it by the west wind from the summit of fairfield lastly having gone along the western side of brotherswater and passed hartsop hall a stream soon after issues from a cove richly decorated with native wood this spot is i believe never explored by travellers but from these sylvan and rocky recesses whoever looks back on the gleaming surface of brotherswater or forward to the precipitous sides and lofty ridges of dove crag c will be equally pleased with the beauty the grandeur and the wildness of the scenery  seven glens or vallies have been noticed which branch off from the cumberland side of the vale the opposite side has only two streams of any importance one of which would lead up from the point where it crosses the kirkstoneroad near the foot of brotherswater to the decaying hamlet of hartsop remarkable for its cottage architecture and thence to hayswater much frequented by anglers the other coming down martindale enters ullswater at sandwyke opposite to gowbarrow park no persons but such as come to patterdale merely to pass through it should fail to walk as far as blowick the only enclosed land which on this side borders the higher part of the lake the axe has here indiscriminately levelled a rich wood of birches and oaks that divided this favoured spot into a hundred pictures it has yet its landlocked bays and rocky promontories but those beautiful woods are gone which perfected its seclusion and scenes that might formerly have been compared to an inexhaustible volume are now spread before the eye in a single sheetmagnificent indeed but seemingly perused in a moment from blowick a narrow track conducts along the craggy side of placefell richly adorned with juniper and sprinkled over with birches to the village of sandwyke a few straggling houses that with the small estates attached to them occupy an opening opposite to lyulphs tower and gowbarrow park in martindale49 the road loses sight of the lake and leads over a steep hill bringing you again into view of ullswater its lowest reach four miles in length is before you and the view terminated by the long ridge of cross fell in the distance immediately under the eye is a deepindented bay with a plot of fertile land traversed by a small brook and rendered cheerful by two or three substantial houses of a more ornamented and showy appearance than is usual in those wild spots  from pooley bridge at the foot of the lake haweswater may be conveniently visited haweswater is a lesser ullswater with this advantage that it remains undefiled by the intrusion of bad taste  lowther castle is about four miles from pooley bridge and if during this tour the stranger has complained as he will have had reason to do of a want of majestic trees he may be abundantly recompensed for his loss in the farspreading woods which surround that mansion visitants for the most part see little of the beauty of these magnificent grounds being content with the view from the terrace but the whole course of the lowther from askham to the bridge under brougham hall presents almost at every step some new feature of river woodland and rocky landscape a portion of this tract has from its beauty acquired the name of the elysian fieldsbut the course of the stream can only be followed by the pedestrian  notevide p 227about 200 yards beyond the last house on the keswick side of rydal village the road is cut through a low wooded rock called thrang crag the top of it which is only a few steps on the south side affords the best view of the vale which is to be had by a traveller who confines himself to the public road  49 see page 308     description of the scenery of the lakes                                       section first  view of the country as formed by nature   at lucerne in switzerland is shewn a model of the alpine country which encompasses the lake of the four cantons the spectator ascends a little platform and sees mountains lakes glaciers rivers woods waterfalls and vallies with their cottages and every other object contained in them lying at his feet all things being represented in their appropriate colours it may be easily conceived that this exhibition affords an exquisite delight to the imagination tempting it to wander at will from valley to valley from mountain to mountain through the deepest recesses of the alps but it supplies also a more substantial pleasure for the sublime and beautiful region with all its hidden treasures and their bearings and relations to each other is thereby comprehended and understood at once  something of this kind without touching upon minute details and individualities which would only confuse and embarrass will here be attempted in respect to the lakes in the north of england and the vales and mountains enclosing and surrounding them the delineation if tolerably executed will in some instances communicate to the traveller who has already seen the objects new information and will assist in giving to his recollections a more orderly arrangement than his own opportunities of observing may have permitted him to make while it will be still more useful to the future traveller by directing his attention at once to distinctions in things which without such previous aid a length of time only could enable him to discover it is hoped also that this essay may become generally serviceable by leading to habits of more exact and considerate observation than as far as the writer knows have hitherto been applied to local scenery  to begin then with the main outlines of the countryi know not how to give the reader a distinct image of these more readily than by requesting him to place himself with me in imagination upon some given point let it be the top of either of the mountains great gavel or scawfell or rather let us suppose our station to be a cloud hanging midway between those two mountains at not more than half a miles distance from the summit of each and not many yards above their highest elevation we shall then see stretched at our feet a number of vallies not fewer than eight diverging from the point on which we are supposed to stand like spokes from the nave of a wheel first we note lying to the southeast the vale of langdale50 which will conduct the eye to the long lake of winandermere stretched nearly to the sea or rather to the sands of the vast bay of morcamb serving here for the rim of this imaginary wheellet us trace it in a direction from the southeast towards the south and we shall next fix our eyes upon the vale of coniston running up likewise from the sea but not as all the other vallies do to the nave of the wheel and therefore it may be not inaptly represented as a broken spoke sticking in the rim looking forth again with an inclination towards the west we see immediately at our feet the vale of duddon in which is no lake but a copious stream winding among fields rocks and mountains and terminating its course in the sands of duddon the fourth vale next to be observed viz that of the esk is of the same general character as the last yet beautifully discriminated from it by peculiar features its stream passes under the woody steep upon which stands muncaster castle the ancient seat of the penningtons and after forming a short and narrow aestuary enters the sea below the small town of ravenglass next almost due west look down into and along the deep valley of wastdale with its little chapel and half a dozen neat dwellings scattered upon a plain of meadow and cornground intersected with stone walls apparently innumerable like a large piece of lawless patchwork or an array of mathematical figures such as in the ancient schools of geometry might have been sportively and fantastically traced out upon sand beyond this little fertile plain lies within a bed of steep mountains the long narrow stern and desolate lake of wastdale and beyond this a dusky tract of level ground conducts the eye to the irish sea the stream that issues from wastwater is named the irt and falls into the aestuary of the river esk next comes in view ennerdale with its lake of bold and somewhat savage shores its stream the ehen or enna flowing through a soft and fertile country passes the town of egremont and the ruins of the castlethen seeming like the other rivers to break through the barrier of sand thrown up by the winds on this tempestuous coast enters the irish sea the vale of buttermere with the lake and village of that name and crummockwater beyond next present themselves we will follow the main stream the coker through the fertile and beautiful vale of lorton till it is lost in the derwent below the noble ruins of cockermouth castle lastly borrowdale of which the vale of keswick is only a continuation stretching due north brings us to a point nearly opposite to the vale of winandermere with which we began from this it will appear that the image of a wheel thus far exact is little more than one half complete but the deficiency on the eastern side may be supplied by the vales of wytheburn ulswater hawswater and the vale of grasmere and rydal none of these however run up to the central point between great gavel and scawfell from this hitherto our central point take a flight of not more than four or five miles eastward to the ridge of helvellyn and you will look down upon wytheburn and st johns vale which are a branch of the vale of keswick upon ulswater stretching due eastand not far beyond to the southeast though from this point not visible lie the vale and lake of hawswater and lastly the vale of grasmere rydal and ambleside brings you back to winandermere thus completing though on the eastern side in a somewhat irregular manner the representative figure of the wheel  50 anciently spelt langden and so called by the old inhabitants to this daydean from which the latter part of the word is derived being in many parts of england a name for a valley  such concisely given is the general topographical view of the country of the lakes in the north of england and it may be observed that from the circumference to the centre that is from the sea or plain country to the mountain stations specified there isin the several ridges that enclose these vales and divide them from each other i mean in the forms and surfaces first of the swelling grounds next of the hills and rocks and lastly of the mountainsan ascent of almost regular gradation from elegance and richness to their highest point of grandeur and sublimity it follows therefore from this first that these rocks hills and mountains must present themselves to view in stages rising above each other the mountains clustering together towards the central point and next that an observer familiar with the several vales must from their various position in relation to the sun have had before his eyes every possible embellishment of beauty dignity and splendour which light and shadow can bestow upon objects so diversified for example in the vale of winandermere if the spectator looks for gentle and lovely scenes his eye is turned towards the south if for the grand towards the north in the vale of keswick which as hath been said lies almost due north of this it is directly the reverse hence when the sun is setting in summer far to the northwest it is seen by the spectator from the shores or breast of winandermere resting among the summits of the loftiest mountains some of which will perhaps be half or wholly hidden by clouds or by the blaze of light which the orb diffuses around it and the surface of the lake will reflect before the eye correspondent colours through every variety of beauty and through all degrees of splendour in the vale of keswick at the same period the sun sets over the humbler regions of the landscape and showers down upon them the radiance which at once veils and glorifiessending forth meanwhile broad streams of rosy crimson purple or golden light towards the grand mountains in the south and southeast which thus illuminated with all their projections and cavities and with an intermixture of solemn shadows are seen distinctly through a cool and clear atmosphere of course there is as marked a difference between the noontide appearance of these two opposite vales the bedimming haze that overspreads the south and the clear atmosphere and determined shadows of the clouds in the north at the same time of the day are each seen in these several vales with a contrast as striking the reader will easily conceive in what degree the intermediate vales partake of a kindred variety  i do not indeed know any tract of country in which within so narrow a compass may be found an equal variety in the influences of light and shadow upon the sublime or beautiful features of landscape and it is owing to the combined circumstances to which the readers attention has been directed from a point between great gavel and scawfell a shepherd would not require more than an hour to descend into any one of eight of the principal vales by which he would be surrounded and all the others lie with the exception of hawswater at but a small distance yet though clustered together every valley has its distinct and separate character in some instances as if they had been formed in studied contrast to each other and in others with the united pleasing differences and resemblances of a sisterly rivalship this concentration of interest gives to the country a decided superiority over the most attractive districts of scotland and wales especially for the pedestrian traveller in scotland and wales are found undoubtedly individual scenes which in their several kinds cannot be excelled but in scotland particularly what long tracts of desolate country intervene so that the traveller when he reaches a spot deservedly of great celebrity would find it difficult to determine how much of his pleasure is owing to excellence inherent in the landscape itself and how much to an instantaneous recovery from an oppression left upon his spirits by the barrenness and desolation through which he has passed  but to proceed with our surveyand first of the mountains their forms are endlessly diversified sweeping easily or boldly in simple majesty abrupt and precipitous or soft and elegant in magnitude and grandeur they are individually inferior to the most celebrated of those in some other parts of this island but in the combinations which they make towering above each other or lifting themselves in ridges like the waves of a tumultuous sea and in the beauty and variety of their surfaces and colours they are surpassed by none  the general surface of the mountains is turf rendered rich and green by the moisture of the climate sometimes the turf as in the neighbourhood of newlands is little broken the whole covering being soft and downy pasturage in other places rocks predominate the soil is laid bare by torrents and burstings of water from the sides of the mountains in heavy rains and not unfrequently their perpendicular sides are seamed by ravines formed also by rains and torrents which meeting in angular points entrench and scar the surface with numerous figures like the letters w and y  in the ridge that divides eskdale from wasdale granite is found but the mountains are for the most part composed of the stone by mineralogists termed schist which as you approach the plain country gives place to limestone and freestone but schist being the substance of the mountains the predominant colour of their rocky parts is bluish or hoary greythe general tint of the lichens with which the bare stone is encrusted with this blue or grey colour is frequently intermixed a red tinge proceeding from the iron that interveins the stone and impregnates the soil the iron is the principle of decomposition in these rocks and hence when they become pulverized the elementary particles crumbling down overspread in many places the steep and almost precipitous sides of the mountains with an intermixture of colours like the compound hues of a doves neck when in the heat of advancing summer the fresh green tint of the herbage has somewhat faded it is again revived by the appearance of the fern profusely spread over the same ground and upon this plant more than upon anything else do the changes which the seasons make in the colouring of the mountains depend about the first week in october the rich green which prevailed through the whole summer is usually passed away the brilliant and various colours of the fern are then in harmony with the autumnal woods bright yellow or lemon colour at the base of the mountains melting gradually through orange to a dark russet brown towards the summits where the plant being more exposed to the weather is in a more advanced state of decay neither heath nor furze are generally found upon the sides of these mountains though in many places they are adorned by those plants so beautiful when in flower we may add that the mountains are of height sufficient to have the surface towards the summit softened by distance and to imbibe the finest aërial hues in common also with other mountains their apparent forms and colours are perpetually changed by the clouds and vapours which float round them the effect indeed of mist or haze in a country of this character is like that of magic i have seen six or seven ridges rising above each other all created in a moment by the vapours upon the side of a mountain which in its ordinary appearance shewed not a projecting point to furnish even a hint for such an operation  i will take this opportunity of observing that they who have studied the appearances of nature feel that the superiority in point of visual interest of mountainous over other countriesis more strikingly displayed in winter than in summer this as must be obvious is partly owing to the forms of the mountains which of course are not affected by the seasons but also in no small degree to the greater variety that exists in their winter than their summer colouring this variety is such and so harmoniously preserved that it leaves little cause of regret when the splendour of autumn is passed away the oakcoppices upon the sides of the mountains retain russet leaves the birch stands conspicuous with its silver stem and pucecoloured twigs the hollies with green leaves and scarlet berries have come forth to view from among the deciduous trees whose summer foliage had concealed them the ivy is now plentifully apparent upon the stems and boughs of the trees and upon the steep rocks in place of the deep summergreen of the herbage and fern many rich colours play into each other over the surface of the mountains turf the tints of which are interchangeably tawnygreen olive and brown beds of withered fern and grey rocks being harmoniously blended together the mosses and lichens are never so fresh and flourishing as in winter if it be not a season of frost and their minute beauties prodigally adorn the foreground wherever we turn we find these productions of nature to which winter is rather favourable than unkindly scattered over the walls banks of earth rocks and stones and upon the trunks of trees with the intermixture of several species of small fern now green and fresh and to the observing passenger their forms and colours are a source of inexhaustable admiration add to this the hoarfrost and snow with all the varieties they create and which volumes would not be sufficient to describe i will content myself with one instance of the colouring produced by snow which may not be uninteresting to painters it is extracted from the memorandumbook of a friend and for its accuracy i can speak having been an eyewitness of the appearance i observed says he the beautiful effect of the drifted snow upon the mountains and the perfect tone of colour from the top of the mountains downwards a rich olive was produced by the powdery snow and the grass which olive was warmed with a little brown and in this way harmoniously combined by insensible gradations with the white the drifting took away the monotony of snow and the whole vale of grasmere seen from the terrace walk in easedale was as varied perhaps more so than even in the pomp of autumn in the distance was loughriggfell the basinwall of the lake this from the summit downward was a rich orangeolive then the lake of a bright olivegreen nearly the same tint as the snowpowdered mountain tops and high slopes in easedale and lastly the church with its firs forming the centre of the view next to the church came nine distinguishable hills six of them with woody sides turned towards us all of them oakcopses with their bright red leaves and snowpowdered twigs these hillsso variously situated in relation to each other and to the view in general so variously powdered some only enough to give the herbage a rich brown tint one intensely white and lighting up all the otherswere yet so placed as in the most inobtrusive manner to harmonise by contrast with a perfect naked snowless bleak summit in the far distance  having spoken of the forms surface and colour of the mountains let us descend into the vales though these have been represented under the general image of the spokes of a wheel they are for the most part winding the windings of many being abrupt and intricate and it may be observed that in one circumstance the general shape of them all has been determined by that primitive conformation through which so many became receptacles of lakes for they are not formed as are most of the celebrated welsh vallies by an approximation of the sloping bases of the opposite mountains towards each other leaving little more between than a channel for the passage of a hasty river but the bottom of these vallies is mostly a spacious and gently declining area apparently level as the floor of a temple or the surface of a lake and broken in many cases by rocks and hills which rise up like islands from the plain in such of the vallies as make many windings these level areas open upon the traveller in succession divided from each other sometimes by a mutual approximation of the hills leaving only passage for a river sometimes by correspondent windings without such approximation and sometimes by a bold advance of one mountain towards that which is opposite it it may here be observed with propriety that the several rocks and hills which have been described as rising up like islands from the level area of the vale have regulated the choice of the inhabitants in the situation of their dwellings where none of these are found and the inclination of the ground is not sufficiently rapid easily to carry off the waters as in the higher part of langdale for instance the houses are not sprinkled over the middle of the vales but confined to their sides being placed merely so far up the mountain as to be protected from the floods but where these rocks and hills have been scattered over the plain of the vale as in grasmere donnerdale eskdale c the beauty which they give to the scene is much heightened by a single cottage or cluster of cottages that will be almost always found under them or upon their sides dryness and shelter having tempted the dalesmen to fix their habitations there  i shall now speak of the lakes of this country the form of the lake is most perfect when like derwentwater and some of the smaller lakes it least resembles that of a riveri mean when being looked at from any given point where the whole may be seen at once the width of it bears such proportion to the length that however the outline may be diversified by farreceding bays it never assumes the shape of a river and is contemplated with that placid and quiet feeling which belongs peculiarly to the lakeas a body of still water under the influence of no current reflecting therefore the clouds the light and all the imagery of the sky and surrounding hills expressing also and making visible the changes of the atmosphere and motions of the lightest breeze and subject to agitation only from the winds              the visible scene     would enter unawares into his mind     with all its solemn imagery its rocks     its woods and that uncertain heaven received     into the bosom of the steady lake  it must be noticed as a favourable characteristic of the lakes of this country that though several of the largest such as winandermere ulswater hawswater do when the whole length of them is commanded from an elevated point loose somewhat of the peculiar form of the lake and assume the resemblance of a magnificent river yet as their shape is winding particularly that of ulswater and hawswater when the view of the whole is obstructed by those barriers which determine the windings and the spectator is confined to one reach the appropriate feeling is revived and one lake may thus in succession present to the eye the essential characteristic of many but though the forms of the large lakes have this advantage it is nevertheless favourable to the beauty of the country that the largest of them are comparatively small and that the same vale generally furnishes a succession of lakes instead of being filled with one the vales in north wales as hath been observed are not formed for the reception of lakes those of switzerland scotland and this part of the north of england are so formed but in switzerland and scotland the proportion of diffused water is often too great as at the lake of geneva for instance and in most of the scotch lakes no doubt it sounds magnificent and flatters the imagination to hear at a distance of expanses of water so many leagues in length and miles in width and such ample room may be delightful to the freshwater sailor scudding with a lively breeze amid the rapidlyshifting scenery but who ever travelled along the banks of lochlomond variegated as the lower part is by islands without feeling that a speedier termination of the long vista of blank water would be acceptable and without wishing for an interposition of green meadows trees and cottages and a sparkling stream to run by his side in fact a notion of grandeur as connected with magnitude has seduced persons of taste into a general mistake upon this subject it is much more desirable for the purposes of pleasure that lakes should be numerous and small or middlesized than large not only for communication by walks and rides but for variety and for recurrence of similar appearances to illustrate this by one instancehow pleasing is it to have a ready and frequent opportunity of watching at the outlet of a lake the stream pushing its way among the rocks in lively contrast with the stillness from which it has escaped and how amusing to compare its noisy and turbulent motions with the gentle playfulness of the breezes that may be starting up or wandering here and there over the faintlyrippled surface of the broad water i may add as a general remark that in lakes of great width the shores cannot be distinctly seen at the same time and therefore contribute little to mutual illustration and ornament and if the opposite shores are out of sight of each other like those of the american and asiatic lakes then unfortunately the traveller is reminded of a nobler object he has the blankness of a seaprospect without the grandeur and accompanying sense of power  as the comparatively small size of the lakes in the north of england is favourable to the production of variegated landscape their boundaryline also is for the most part gracefully or boldly indented that uniformity which prevails in the primitive frame of the lower grounds among all chains or clusters of mountains where large bodies of still water are bedded is broken by the secondary agents of nature ever at work to supply the deficiences of the mould in which things were originally cast using the word deficiences i do not speak with reference to those stronger emotions which a region of mountains is peculiarly fitted to excite the bases of those huge barriers may run for a long space in straight lines and these parallel to each other the opposite sides of a profound vale may ascend as exact counterparts or in mutual reflection like the billows of a troubled sea and the impression be from its very simplicity more awful and sublime sublimity is the result of natures first great dealings with the superficies of the earth but the general tendency of her subsequent operations is towards the production of beauty by a multiplicity of symmetrical parts uniting in a consistent whole this is everywhere exemplified along the margins of these lakes masses of rock that have been precipitated from the heights into the area of waters lie in some places like stranded ships or have acquired the compact structure of jutting piers or project in little peninsulas crested with native wood the smallest rivuletone whose silent influx is scarcely noticeable in a season of dry weatherso faint is the dimple made by it on the surface of the smooth lakewill be found to have been not useless in shaping by its deposits of gravel and soil in time of flood a curve that would not otherwise have existed but the more powerful brooks encroaching upon the level of the lake have in course of time given birth to ample promontories of sweeping outline that contrast boldly with the longitudinal base of the steeps on the opposite shore while their flat or gentlyslopingsurfaces never fail to introduce into the midst of desolation and barrenness the elements of fertility even where the habitations of men may not have been raised these alluvial promontories however threaten in some places to bisect the waters which they have long adorned and in course of ages they will cause some of the lakes to dwindle into numerous and insignificant pools which in their turn will finally be filled up but checking these intrusive calculations let us rather be content with appearances as they are and pursue in imagination the meandering shores whether rugged steeps admitting of no cultivation descend into the water or gentlysloping lawns and woods or flat and fertile meadows stretch between the margin of the lake and the mountains among minuter recommendations will be noticed especially along bays exposed to the settingin of strong winds the curved rim of fine blue gravel thrown up in course of time by the waves half of it perhaps gleaming from under the water and the corresponding half of a lighter hue and in other parts bordering the lake groves if i may so call them of reeds and bulrushes or plots of waterlilies lifting up their large targetshaped leaves to the breeze while the white flower is heaving upon the wave  to these may naturally be added the birds that enliven the waters wildducks in springtime hatch their young in the islands and upon reedy shoresthe sandpiper flitting along the stony margins by its restless note attracts the eye to motions as restlessupon some jutting rock or at the edge of a smooth meadow the stately heron may be descried with folded wings that might seem to have caught their delicate hue from the blue waters by the side of which she watches for her sustenance in winter the lakes are sometimes resorted to by wild swans and in that season habitually by widgeons goldings and other aquatic fowl of the smaller species let me be allowed the aid of verse to describe the evolutions which these visitants sometimes perform on a fine day towards the close of winter      mark how the featherd tenants of the flood     with grace of motion that might scarcely seem     inferior to angelical prolong     their curious pastime shaping in mid air     and sometimes with ambitious wing that soars     high as the level of the mountain tops     a circuit ampler than the lake beneath     their own domainbut ever while intent     on tracing and retracing that large round     their jubilant activity evolves     hundreds of curves and circlets to and fro     upward and downward progress intricate     yet unperplexd as if one spirit swayed     their indefatigable flighttis done     ten times or more i fancied it had ceased     but lo the vanishd company again     ascendingthey approachi hear their wings     faint faint at first and then an eager sound     past in a momentand as faint again     they tempt the sun to sport amid their plumes     they tempt the water or the gleaming ice     to shew them a fair imagetis themselves     their own fair forms upon the glimmering plain     painted more soft and fair as they descend     almost to touchthen up again aloft     up with a sally and a flash of speed     as if they scornd both restingplace and rest  the islands dispersed among these lakes are neither so numerous nor so beautiful as might be expected from the account that has been given of the manner in which the level areas of the vales are so frequently diversified by rocks hills and hillocks scattered over them nor are they ornamented as are several of the lakes in scotland and ireland by the remains of castles or other places of defence nor with the still more interesting ruins of religious edifices every one must regret that scarcely a vestige is left of the oratory consecrated to the virgin which stood upon chapelholm in windermere and that the chauntry has disappeared where mass used to be sung upon st herberts island derwentwater the islands of the lastmentioned lake are neither fortunately placed nor of pleasing shape but if the wood upon them were managed with more taste they might become interesting features in the landscape there is a beautiful cluster on winandermere a pair pleasingly contrasted upon eydal nor must the solitary green island of grasmere be forgotten in the bosom of each of the lakes of ennerdale and devockwater is a single rock which owing to its neighbourhood to the sea is      the haunt of cormorants and seamews clang  a music well suited to the stern and wild character of the several scenes it may be worth while here to mention not as an object of beauty but of curiosity that there occasionally appears above the surface of derwentwater and always in the same place a considerable tract of spongy ground covered with aquatic plants which is called the floating but with more propriety might be named the buoyant island and on one of the pools near the lake of esthwaite may sometimes be seen a mossy islet with trees upon it shifting about before the wind a lusus naturae frequent on the great rivers of america and not unknown in other parts of the world          fas habeas invisere tiburis arva       albuneaeque lacum atque umbras terrasque natantes51   51 see that admirable idyllium the catillus and salia of landor  this part of the subject may be concluded with observingthat from the multitude of brooks and torrents that fall into these lakes and of internal springs by which they are fed and which circulate through them like veins they are truly living lakes vivi lacus and are thus discriminated from the stagnant and sullen pools frequent among mountains that have been formed by volcanoes and from the shallow meres found in flat and fenny countries the water is also of crystalline purity so that if it were not for the reflections of the incumbent mountains by which it is darkened a delusion might be felt by a person resting quietly in a boat on the bosom of winandermere or derwentwater similar to that which carver so beautifully describes when he was floating alone in the middle of lake erie or ontario and could almost have imagined that his boat was suspended in an element as pure as air or rather that the air and water were one  having spoken of lakes i must not omit to mention as a kindred feature of this country those bodies of still water called tarns in the economy of nature these are useful as auxiliars to lakes for if the whole quantity of water which falls upon the mountains in time of storm were poured down upon the plains without intervention in some quarters of such receptacles the habitable grounds would be much more subject than they are to inundation but as some of the collateral brooks spend their fury finding a free course toward and also down the channel of the main stream of the vale before those that have to pass through the higher tarns and lakes have filled their several basins a gradual distribution is effected and the waters thus reserved instead of uniting to spread ravage and deformity with those which meet with no such detention contribute to support for a length of time the vigour of many streams without a fresh fall of rain tarns are found in some of the vales and are numerous upon the mountains a tarn in a vale implies for the most part that the bed of the vale is not happily formed that the water of the brooks can neither wholly escape nor diffuse itself over a large area accordingly in such situations tarns are often surrounded by an unsightly tract of boggy ground but this is not always the case and in the cultivated parts of the country when the shores of the tarn are determined it differs only from the lake in being smaller and in belonging mostly to a smaller valley or circular recess of this class of miniature lakes loughrigg tarn near grasmere is the most beautiful example it has a margin of green firm meadows of rocks and rocky woods a few reeds here a little company of waterlilies there with beds of gravel or stone beyond a tiny stream issuing neither briskly nor sluggishly out of it but its feeding rills from the shortness of their course so small as to be scarcely visible five or six cottages are reflected in its peaceful bosom rocky and barren steeps rise up above the hanging enclosures and the solemn pikes of langdale overlook from a distance the low cultivated ridge of land that forms the northern boundary of this small quiet and fertile domain the mountain tarns can only be recommended to the notice of the inquisitive traveller who has time to spare they are difficult of access and naked yet some of them are in their permanent forms very grand and there are accidents of things which would make the meanest of them interesting at all events one of these pools is an acceptable sight to the mountain wanderer not merely as an incident that diversifies the prospect but as forming in his mind a centre or conspicuous point to which objects otherwise disconnected or insubordinated may be referred some few have a varied outline with bold heathclad promontories and as they mostly lie at the foot of a steep precipice the water where the sun is not shining upon it appears black and sullen and round the margin huge stones and masses of rock are scattered some defying conjecture as to the means by which they came thither and others obviously fallen from on highthe contribution of ages a not unpleasing sadness is induced by this perplexity and these images of decay while the prospect of a body of pure water unattended with groves and other cheerful rural images by which fresh water is usually accompanied and unable to give furtherance to the meagre vegetation around itexcites a sense of some repulsive power strongly put forth and thus deepens the melancholy natural to such scenes nor is the feeling of solitude often more forcibly or more solemnly impressed than by the side of one of these mountain pools though desolate and forbidding it seems a distinct place to repair to yet where the visitants must be rare and there can be no disturbance waterfowl flock hither and the lonely angler may here be seen but the imagination not content with this scanty allowance of society is tempted to attribute a voluntary power to every change which takes place in such a spot whether it be the breeze that wanders over the surface of the water or the splendid lights of evening resting upon it in the midst of awful precipices      there sometimes does a leaping fish     send through the tarn a lonely cheer     the crags repeat the ravens croak     in symphony austere     thither the rainbow comes the cloud     and mists that spread the flying shroud     and sunbeams and the sounding blast  it will be observed that this country is bounded on the south and east by the sea which combines beautifully from many elevated points with the inland scenery and from the bay of morecamb the sloping shores and background of distant mountains are seen composing pictures equally distinguished for amenity and grandeur but the aestuaries on this coast are in a great measure bare at low water52 and there is no instance of the sea running far up among the mountains and mingling with the lakes which are such in the strict and usual sense of the word being of fresh water nor have the streams from the shortness of their course time to acquire that body of water necessary to confer upon them much majesty in fact the most considerable while they continue in the mountain and lakecountry are rather large brooks than rivers the water is perfectly pellucid through which in many places are seen to a great depth their beds of rock or of blue gravel which give to the water itself an exquisitely cerulean colour this is particularly striking in the rivers derwent and duddon which may be compared such and so various are their beauties to any two rivers of equal length of course in any country the number of the torrents and smaller brooks is infinite with their waterfalls and waterbreaks and they need not here be described i will only observe that as many even of the smallest rills have either found or made for themselves recesses in the sides of the mountains or in the vales they have tempted the primitive inhabitants to settle near them for shelter and hence cottages so placed by seeming to withdraw from the eye are the more endeared to the feelings  52 in fact there is not an instance of a harbour on the cumberland side of the solway frith that is not dry at low water that of ravenglass at the mouth of the esk as a natural harbour is much the best the sea appears to have been retiring slowly for ages from this coast from whitehaven to st bees extends a tract of level ground about five miles in length which formerly must have been under salt water so as to have made an island of the high ground that stretches between it and the sea  the woods consist chiefly of oak ash and birch and here and there wychelm with underwood of hazel the white and black thorn and hollies in moist places alders and willows abound and yews among the rocks formerly the whole country must have been covered with wood to a great height up the mountains where native scotch firs53 must have grown in great profusion as they do in the northern part of scotland to this day but not one of these old inhabitants has existed perhaps for some hundreds of years the beautiful traces however of the universal sylvan54 appearance the country formerly had yet survive in the native coppicewoods that have been protected by inclosures and also in the foresttrees and hollies which though disappearing fast are yet scattered both over the inclosed and uninclosed parts of the mountains the same is expressed by the beauty and intricacy with which the fields and coppice woods are often intermingled the plough of the first settlers having followed naturally the veins of richer dryer or less stony soil and thus it has shaped out an intermixture of wood and lawn with a grace and wildness which it would have been impossible for the hand of studied art to produce other trees have been introduced within these last fifty years such as beeches larches limes c and plantations of firs seldom with advantage and often with great injury to the appearance of the country but the sycamore which i believe was brought into this island from germany not more than two hundred years ago has long been the favourite of the cottagers and with the fir has been chosen to screen their dwellings and is sometimes found in the fields whither the winds or the waters may have carried its seeds  53 this species of fir is in character much superior to the american which has usurped its place where the fir is planted for ornament let it be by all means of the aboriginal species which can only be procured from the scotch nurseries  54 a squirrel so i have heard the old people of wytheburn say might have gone from their chapel to keswick without alighting on the ground  the want most felt however is that of timber trees there are few magnificent ones to be found near any of the lakes and unless greater care be taken there will in a short time scarcely be left an ancient oak that would repay the cost of felling the neighbourhood of rydal notwithstanding the havoc which has been made is yet nobly distinguished in the woods of lowther also is found an almost matchless store of ancient trees and the majesty and wildness of the native forest  among the smaller vegetable ornaments must be reckoned the bilberry a ground plant never so beautiful as in early spring when it is seen under bare or budding trees that imperfectly intercept the tombstone covering the rocky knolls with a pure mantle of fresh verdure more lively than the herbage of the open fieldsthe broom that spreads luxuriantly along rough pastures and in the month of june interveins the steep copses with its golden blossomsand the juniper a rich evergreen that thrives in spite of cattle upon the uninclosed parts of the mountainsthe dutch myrtle diffuses fragrance in moist places and there is an endless variety of brilliant flowers in the fields and meadows which if the agriculture of the country were more carefully attended to would disappear nor can i omit again to notice the lichens and mosses their profusion beauty and variety exceed those of any other country i have seen  it may now be proper to say a few words respecting climate and skiey influences in which this region as far as the character of its landscapes is affected by them may upon the whole be considered fortunate the country is indeed subject to much bad weather and it has been ascertained that twice as much rain falls here as in many parts of the island but the number of black drizzling days that blot out the face of things is by no means proportionally great nor is a continuance of thick flagging damp air so common as in the west of england and ireland the rain here comes down heartily and is frequently succeeded by clear bright weather when every brook is vocal and every torrent sonorous brooks and torrents which are never muddy even in the heaviest floods except after a drought they happen to be defiled for a short time by waters that have swept along dusty roads or have broken out into ploughed fields days of unsettled weather with partial showers are very frequent but the showers darkening or brightning as they fly from hill to hill are not less grateful to the eye than finely interwoven passages of gay and sad music are touching to the ear vapours exhaling from the lakes and meadows after sunrise in a hot season or in moist weather brooding upon the heights or descending towards the valleys with inaudible motion give a visionary character to every thing around them and are in themselves so beautiful as to dispose us to enter into the feelings of those simple nations such as the laplanders of this day by whom they are taken for guardian deities of the mountains or to sympathise with others who have fancied these delicate apparitions to be the spirits of their departed ancestors akin to these are fleecy clouds resting upon the hilltops they are not easily managed in picture with their accompaniments of blue sky but how glorious are they in nature how pregnant with imagination for the poet and the height of the cumbrian mountains is sufficient to exhibit daily and hourly instances of those mysterious attachments such clouds cleaving to their stations or lifting up suddenly their glittering heads from behind rocky barriers or hurrying out of sight with speed of the sharpest sledgewill often tempt an inhabitant to congratulate himself on belonging to a country of mists and clouds and storms and make him think of the blank sky of egypt and of the cerulean vacancy of italy as an unanimated and even a sad spectacle the atmosphere however as in every country subject to much rain is frequently unfavourable to landscape especially when keen winds succeed the rain which are apt to produce coldness spottiness and an unmeaning or repulsive detail in the distancea sunless frost under a canopy of leaden and shapeless clouds is as far as it allows things to be seen equally disagreeable  it has been said that in human life there are moments worth ages in a more subdued tone of sympathy may we affirm that in the climate of england there are for the lover of nature days which are worth whole monthsi might sayeven years one of these favoured days sometimes occurs in springtime when that soft air is breathing over the blossoms and newborn verdure which inspired buchanan with his beautiful ode to the first of may the air which in the luxuriance of his fancy he likens to that of the golden ageto that which gives motion to the funereal cypresses on the banks of letheto the air which is to salute beatified spirits when expiatory fires shall have consumed the earth with all her habitations but it is in autumn that days of such affecting influence most frequently intervenethe atmosphere seems refined and the sky rendered more crystalline as the vivifying heat of the year abates the lights and shadows are more delicate the colouring is richer and more finely harmonised and in this season of stillness the ear being unoccupied or only gently excited the sense of vision becomes more susceptible of its appropriate enjoyments a resident in a country like this which we are treating of will agree with me that the presence of a lake is indispensable to exhibit in perfection the beauty of one of these days and he must have experienced while looking on the unruffled waters that the imagination by their aid is carried into recesses of feeling otherwise impenetrable the reason of this is that the heavens are not only brought down into the bosom of the earth but that the earth is mainly looked at and thought of through the medium of a purer element the happiest time is when the equinoxial gales are departed but their fury may probably be called to mind by the sight of a few shattered boughs whose leaves do not differ in colour from the faded foliage of the stately oaks from which these relics of the storm depend all else speaks of tranquillitynot a breath of air no restlessness of insects and not a moving object perceptibleexcept the clouds gliding in the depths of the lake or the traveller passing along an inverted image whose motion seems governed by the quiet of a time to which its archetype the living person is perhaps insensibleor it may happen that the figure of one of the larger birds a raven or a heron is crossing silently among the reflected clouds while the voice of the real bird from the element aloft gently awakens in the spectator the recollection of appetites and instincts pursuits and occupations that deform and agitate the worldyet have no power to prevent nature from putting on an aspect capable of satisfying the most intense cravings for the tranquil the lovely and the perfect to which man the noblest of her creatures is subject  thus far of climate as influencing the feelings through its effect on the objects of sense we may add that whatever has been said upon the advantages derived to these scenes from a changeable atmosphere would apply perhaps still more forcibly to their appearance under the varied solemnities of night milton it will be remembered has given a clouded moon to paradise itself in the nightseason also the narrowness of the vales and comparative smallness of the lakes are especially adapted to bring surrounding objects home to the eye and to the heart the stars taking their stations above the hilltops are contemplated from a spot like the abyssinian recess of rasselas with much more touching interest than they are likely to excite when looked at from an open country with ordinary undulations and it must be obvious that it is the bays only of large lakes that can present such contrasts of light and shadow as those of smaller dimensions display from every quarter a deep contracted valley with diffused waters such a valley and plains level and wide as those of chaldea are the two extremes in which the beauty of the heavens and their connexion with the earth are most sensibly felt nor do the advantages i have been speaking of imply here an exclusion of the aerial effects of distance these are insured by the height of the mountains and are found even in the narrowest vales where they lengthen in perspective or act if the expression may be used as telescopes for the open country  the subject would bear to be enlarged upon but i will conclude this section with a nightscene suggested by the vale of keswick the fragment is well known but it gratifies me to insert it as the writer was one of the first who led the way to a worthy admiration of this country      now sunk the sun now twilight sunk and night     rode in her zenith not a passing breeze     sighd to the grove which in the midnight air     stood motionless and in the peaceful floods     inverted hung for now the billows slept     along the shore nor heavd the deep but spread     a shining mirror to the moons pale orb     which dim and waning oer the shadowy cliffs     the solemn woods and spiry mountain tops     her glimmering faintness threw now every eye     oppressd with toil was drownd in deep repose     save that the unseen shepherd in his watch     proppd on his crook stood listening by the fold     and gazd the starry vault and pendant moon     nor voice nor sound broke on the deep serene     but the soft murmur of swiftgushing rills     forth issuing from the mountains distant steep     unheard till now and now scarce heard proclaimd     all things at rest and imagd the still voice     of quiet whispering in the ear of night55  55 dr brown the author of this fragment was from his infancy brought up in cumberland and should have remembered that the practice of folding sheep by night is unknown among these mountains and that the image of the shepherd upon the watch is out of its place and belongs only to countries with a warmer climate that are subject to ravages from beasts of prey it is pleasing to notice a dawn of imaginative feeling in these verses tickel a man of no common genius chose for the subject of a poem kensington gardens in preference to the banks of the derwent within a mile or two of which he was born but this was in the reign of queen anne or george the first progress must have been made in the interval though the traces of it except in the works of thomson and dyer are not very obvious                                          section second  aspect of the country as affected by its inhabitants  hitherto i have chiefly spoken of the features by which nature has discriminated this country from others i will now describe in general terms in what manner it is indebted to the hand of man what i have to notice on this subject will emanate most easily and perspicuously from a description of the ancient and present inhabitants their occupations their condition of life the distribution of landed property among them and the tenure by which it is holden  the reader will suffer me here to recall to his mind the shapes of the vallies and their position with respect to each other and the forms and substance of the intervening mountains he will people the vallies with lakes and rivers the coves and sides of the mountains with pools and torrents and will bound half of the circle which we have contemplated by the sands of the sea or by the sea itself he will conceive that from the point upon which he stood he looks down upon this scene before the country had been penetrated by any inhabitantsto vary his sensations and to break in upon their stillness he will form to himself an image of the tides visiting and revisiting the friths the main sea dashing against the bolder shore the rivers pursuing their course to be lost in the mighty mass of waters he may see or hear in fancy the winds sweeping over the lakes or piping with a loud voice among the mountain peaks and lastly may think of the primeval woods shedding and renewing their leaves with no human eye to notice or human heart to regret or welcome the change when the first settlers entered this region says an animated writer they found it overspread with wood forest trees the fir the oak the ash and the birch had skirted the fells tufted the hills and shaded the vallies through centuries of silent solitude the birds and beasts of prey reigned over the meeker species and the bellum inter omnia maintained the balance of nature in the empire of beasts  such was the state and appearance of this region when the aboriginal colonists of the celtic tribes were first driven or drawn towards it and became joint tenants with the wolf the boar the wild bull the red deer and the leigh a gigantic species of deer which has been long extinct while the inaccessible crags were occupied by the falcon the raven and the eagle the inner parts were too secluded and of too little value to participate much of the benefit of roman manners and though these conquerors encouraged the britons to the improvement of their lands in the plain country of furness and cumberland they seem to have had little connexion with the mountains except for military purposes or in subservience to the profit they drew from the mines  when the romans retired from great britain it is well known that these mountainfastnesses furnished a protection to some unsubdued britons long after the more accessible and more fertile districts had been seized by the saxon or danish invader a few though distinct traces of roman forts or camps as at ambleside and upon dunmallet and a few circles of rude stones attributed to the druids56 are the only vestiges that remain upon the surface of the country of these ancient occupants and as the saxons and danes who succeeded to the possession of the villages and hamlets which had been established by the britons seem at first to have confined themselves to the open countrywe may descend at once to times long posterior to the conquest by the normans when their feudal polity was regularly established we may easily conceive that these narrow dales and mountain sides choaked up as they must have been with wood lying out of the way of communication with other parts of the island and upon the edge of a hostile kingdom could have little attraction for the highborn and powerful especially as the more open parts of the country furnished positions for castles and houses of defence sufficient to repel any of those sudden attacks which in the then rude state of military knowledge could be made upon them accordingly the more retired regions and to such i am now confining myself must have been neglected or shunned even by the persons whose baronial or signioral rights extended over them and left doubtless partly as a place of refuge for outlaws and robbers and partly granted out for the more settled habitation of a few vassals following the employment of shepherds or woodlanders hence these lakes and inner vallies are unadorned by any remains of ancient grandeur castles or monastic edifices which are only found upon the skirts of the country as furness abbey calder abbey the priory of lannercost gleaston castlelong ago a residence of the flemingsand the numerous ancient castles of the cliffords the lucys and the dacres on the southern side of these mountains especially in that part known by the name of furness fells which is more remote from the borders the state of society would necessarily be more settled though it also was fashioned not a little by its neighbourhood to a hostile kingdom we will therefore give a sketch of the economy of the abbots in the distribution of lands among their tenants as similar plans were doubtless adopted by other lords and as the consequences have affected the face of the country materially to the present day being in fact one of the principal causes which give it such a striking superiority in beauty and interest over all other parts of the island  56 it is not improbable that these circles were once numerous and that many of them may yet endure in a perfect state under no very deep covering of soil a friend of the author while making a trench in a level piece of ground not far from the banks of the emont but in no connection with that river met with some stones which seemed to him formally arranged this excited his curiosity and proceeding he uncovered a perfect circle of stones from two to three or four feet high with a sanctum sanctorumthe whole a complete place of druidical worship of small dimensions having the same sort of relation to stonehenge long meg and her daughters near the river eden and karl lofts near shap if this last be not danish that a rural chapel bears to a stately church or to one of our noble cathedrals this interesting little monument having passed with the field in which it was found into other hands has been destroyed it is much to be regretted that the striking relic of antiquity at shap has been in a great measure destroyed also  the daughters of long meg are placed not in an oblong as the stones of shap but in a perfect circle eighty yards in diameter and seventytwo in number and from above three yards high to less than so many feet a little way out of the circle stands long meg herselfa single stone eighteen feet high  when the author first saw this monument he came upon it by surprize therefore might overrate its importance as an object but he must say that though it is not to be compared with stonehenge he has not seen any other remains of those dark ages which can pretend to rival it in singularity and dignity of appearance       a weight of awe not easy to be borne      fell suddenly upon my spirit cast      from the dread bosom of the unknown past      when first i saw that sisterhood forlorn      and her whose strength and stature seem to scorn      the power of yearspreeminent and placed      apart to overlook the circle vast      speak giantmother tell it to the morn      while she dispels the cumbrous shades of night      let the moon hear emerging from a cloud      when how and wherefore rose on british ground      that wondrous monument whose mystic round      forth shadows some have deemed to mortal sight      the inviolable god that tames the proud  when the abbots of furness says an author before cited enfranchised their villains and raised them to the dignity of customary tenants the lands which they had cultivated for their lord were divided into whole tenements each of which besides the customary annual rent was charged with the obligation of having in readiness a man completely armed for the kings service on the borders or elsewhere each of these whole tenements was again subdivided into four equal parts each villain had one and the party tenant contributed his share to the support of the man of arms and of other burdens these divisions were not properly distinguished the land remained mixed each tenant had a share through all the arable and meadowland and common of pasture over all the wastes these subtenements were judged sufficient for the support of so many families and no further division was permitted these divisions and subdivisions were convenient at the time for which they were calculated the land so parcelled out was of necessity more attended to and the industry greater when more persons were to be supported by the produce of it the frontier of the kingdom within which furness was considered was in a constant state of attack and defence more hands therefore were necessary to guard the coast to repel an invasion from scotland or make reprisals on the hostile neighbour the dividing the lands in such manner as has been shown increased the number of inhabitants and kept them at home till called for and the land being mixed and the several tenants united in equipping the plough the absence of the fourth man was no prejudice to the cultivation of his land which was committed to the care of three  while the villains of low furness were thus distributed over the land and employed in agriculture those of high furness were charged with the care of flocks and herds to protect them from the wolves which lurked in the thickets and in winter to browze them with the tender sprouts of hollies and ash this custom was not till lately discontinued in high furness and hollytrees were carefully preserved for that purpose when all other wood was cleared off large tracts of common being so covered with these trees as to have the appearance of a forest of hollies at the shepherds call the flocks surrounded the hollybush and received the croppings at his hand which they greedily nibbled up bleating for more the abbots of furness enfranchised these pastoral vassals and permitted them to enclose quillets to their houses for which they paid encroachment rentwests antiquities of furness  however desirable for the purposes of defence a numerous population might be it was not possible to make at once the same numerous allotments among the untilled vallies and upon the sides of the mountains as had been made in the cultivated plains the enfranchised shepherd or woodlander having chosen there his place of residence builds it of sods or of the mountainstone and with the permission of his lord encloses like robinson crusoe a small croft or two immediately at his door for such animals as he wishes to protect others are happy to imitate his example and avail themselves of the same privileges and thus a population mainly of danish or norse origin as the dialect indicates crept on towards the more secluded parts of the vallies chapels daughters of some distant mother church are first erected in the more open and fertile vales as those of bowness and grasmere offsets of kendal which again after a period as the settled population increases become motherchurches to smaller edifices planted at length in almost every dale throughout the country the inclosures formed by the tenantry are for a long time confined to the homesteads and the arable and meadow land of the vales is possessed in common field the several portions being marked out by stones bushes or trees which portions where the custom has survived to this day are called dales from the word deylen to distribute but while the valley was thus lying open enclosures seem to have taken place upon the sides of the mountains because the land there was not intermixed and was of little comparative value and therefore small opposition would be made to its being appropriated by those to whose habitations it was contiguous hence the singular appearance which the sides of many of these mountains exhibit intersected as they are almost to the summit with stone walls when first erected these stone fences must have little disfigured the face of the country as part of the lines would every where be hidden by the quantity of native wood then remaining and the lines would also be broken as they still are by the rocks which interrupt and vary their course in the meadows and in those parts of the lower grounds where the soil has not been sufficiently drained and could not afford a stable foundation there when the increasing value of land and the inconvenience suffered from intermixed plots of ground in common field had induced each inhabitant to enclose his own they were compelled to make the fences of alders willows and other trees these where the native wood had disappeared have frequently enriched the vallies with a sylvan appearance while the intricate intermixture of property has given to the fences a graceful irregularity which where large properties are prevalent and large capitals employed in agriculture is unknown this sylvan appearance is heightened by the number of ashtrees planted in rows along the quick fences and along the walls for the purpose of browzing the cattle at the approach of winter the branches are lopped off and strewn upon the pastures and when the cattle have stripped them of the leaves they are used for repairing the hedges or for fuel  we have thus seen a numerous body of dalesmen creeping into possession of their homesteads their little crofts their mountainenclosures and finally the whole vale is visibly divided except perhaps here and there some marshy ground which till fully drained would not repay the trouble of enclosing but these last partitions do not seem to have been general till long after the pacification of the borders by the union of the two crowns when the cause which had first determined the distribution of land into such small parcels had not only ceasedbut likewise a general improvement had taken place in the country with a correspondent rise in the value of its produce from the time of the union it is certain that this species of feudal population must rapidly have diminished that it was formerly much more numerous than it is at present is evident from the multitude of tenements i do not mean houses but small divisions of land which belonged formerly each to a several proprietor and for which separate fines are paid to the manorial lord at this day these are often in the proportion of four to one of the present occupants sir launcelot threlkeld who lived in the reign of henry vii was wont to say he had three noble houses one for pleasure crosby in westmoreland where he had a park full of deer one for profit and warmth wherein to reside in winter namely yanwith nigh penrith and the third threlkeld on the edge of the vale of keswick well stocked with tenants to go with him to the wars but as i have said from the union of the two crowns this numerous vassalage their services not being wanted would rapidly diminish various tenements would be united in one possessor and the aboriginal houses probably little better than hovels like the kraels of savages or the huts of the highlanders of scotland would fall into decay and the places of many be supplied by substantial and comfortable buildings a majority of which remain to this day scattered over the vallies and are often the only dwellings found in them  from the time of the erection of these houses till within the last sixty years the state of society though no doubt slowly and gradually improving underwent no material change corn was grown in these vales through which no carriageroad had yet been made sufficient upon each estate to furnish bread for each family and no more notwithstanding the union of several tenements the possessions of each inhabitant still being small in the same field was seen an intermixture of different crops and the plough was interrupted by little rocks mostly overgrown with wood or by spongy places which the tillers of the soil had neither leisure nor capital to convert into firm land the storms and moisture of the climate induced them to sprinkle their upland property with outhouses of native stone as places of shelter for their sheep where in tempestuous weather food was distributed to them every family spun from its own flock the wool with which it was clothed a weaver was here and there found among them and the rest of their wants was supplied by the produce of the yarn which they carded and spun in their own houses and carried to market either under their arms or more frequently on packhorses a small train taking their way weekly down the valley or over the mountains to the most commodious town they had as i have said their rural chapel and of course their minister in clothing or in manner of life in no respect differing from themselves except on the sabbathday this was the sole distinguished individual among them every thing else person and possession exhibited a perfect equality a community of shepherds and agriculturists proprietors for the most part of the lands which they occupied and cultivated  while the process above detailed was going on the native forest must have been every where receding but trees were planted for the sustenance of the flocks in wintersuch was then the rude state of agriculture and for the same cause it was necessary that care should be taken of some part of the growth of the native woods accordingly in queen elizabeths time this was so strongly felt that a petition was made to the crown praying that the blomaries in high furness might be abolished on account of the quantity of wood which was consumed in them for the use of the mines to the great detriment of the cattle but this same cause about a hundred years after produced effects directly contrary to those which had been deprecated the reestablishment at that period of furnaces upon a large scale made it the interest of the people to convert the steeper and more stony of the enclosures sprinkled over with remains of the native forest into close woods which when cattle and sheep were excluded rapidly sowed and thickened themselves the readers attention has been directed to the cause by which tufts of wood pasturage meadow and arable land with its various produce are intricately intermingled in the same field and he will now see in like manner how enclosures entirely of wood and those of cultivated ground are blended all over the country under a law of similar wildness  an historic detail has thus been given of the manner in which the hand of man has acted upon the surface of the inner regions of this mountainous country as incorporated with and subservient to the powers and processes of nature we will now take a view of the same agencyacting within narrower bounds for the production of the few works of art and accommodations of life which in so simple a state of society could be necessary these are merely habitations of man and coverts for beasts roads and bridges and places of worship  and to begin with the cottages they are scattered over the vallies and under the hill sides and on the rocks and even to this day in the more retired dales without any intrusion of more assuming buildings      clusterd like stars some few but single most     and lurking dimly in their shy retreats     or glancing on each other cheerful looks     like separated stars with clouds betweenms  the dwellinghouses and contiguous outhouses are in many instances of the colour of the native rock out of which they have been built but frequently the dwelling or firehouse as it is ordinarily called has been distinguished from the barn or byer by roughcast and white wash which as the inhabitants are not hasty in renewing it in a few years acquires by the influence of weather a tint at once sober and variegated as these houses have been from father to son inhabited by persons engaged in the same occupations yet necessarily with changes in their circumstances they have received without incongruity additions and accommodations adapted to the needs of each successive occupant who being for the most part proprietor was at liberty to follow his own fancy so that these humble dwellings remind the contemplative spectator of a production of nature and may using a strong expression rather be said to have grown than to have been erectedto have risen by an instinct of their own out of the native rockso little is there in them of formality such is their wildness and beauty among the numerous recesses and projections in the walls and in the different stages of their roofs are seen bold and harmonious effects of contrasted sunshine and shadow it is a favourable circumstance that the strong winds which sweep down the vallies induced the inhabitants at a time when the materials for building were easily procured to furnish many of these dwellings with substantial porches and such as have not this defence are seldom unprovided with a projection of two large slates over their thresholds nor will the singular beauty of the chimneys escape the eye of the attentive traveller sometimes a low chimney almost upon a level with the roof is overlaid with a slate supported upon four slender pillars to prevent the wind from driving the smoke down the chimney others are of a quadrangular shape rising one or two feet above the roof which low square is often surmounted by a tall cylinder giving to the cottage chimney the most beautiful shape in which it is ever seen nor will it be too fanciful or refined to remark that there is a pleasing harmony between a tall chimney of this circular form and the living column of smoke ascending from it through the still air these dwellings mostly built as has been said of rough unhewn stone are roofed with slates which were rudely taken from the quarry before the present art of splitting them was understood and are therefore rough and uneven in their surface so that both the coverings and sides of the houses have furnished places of rest for the seeds of lichens mosses ferns and flowers hence buildings which in their very form call to mind the processes of nature do thus clothed in part with a vegetable garb appear to be received into the bosom of the living principle of things as it acts and exists among the woods and fields and by their colour and their shape affectingly direct the thoughts to that tranquil course of nature and simplicity along which the humbleminded inhabitants have through so many generations been led add the little garden with its shed for beehives its small bed of potherbs and its borders and patches of flowers for sunday posies with sometimes a choice few too much prized to be plucked an orchard of proportioned size a cheesepress often supported by some tree near the door a cluster of embowering sycamores for summer shade with a tall fir through which the winds sing when other trees are leafless the little rill or household spout murmuring in all seasonscombine these incidents and images together and you have the representative idea of a mountaincottage in this country so beautifully formed in itself and so richly adorned by the hand of nature  till within the last sixty years there was no communication between any of these vales by carriageroads all bulky articles were transported on packhorses owing however to the population not being concentrated in villages but scattered the vallies themselves were intersected as now by innumerable lanes and pathways leading from house to house and from field to field these lanes where they are fenced by stone walls are mostly bordered with ashes hazels wild roses and beds of tall fern at their base while the walls themselves if old are overspread with mosses small ferns wild strawberries the geranium and lichens and if the wall happen to rest against a bank of earth it is sometimes almost wholly concealed by a rich facing of stonefern it is a great advantage to a traveller or resident that these numerous lanes and paths if he be a zealous admirer of nature will lead him on into all the recesses of the country so that the hidden treasures of its landscapes may by an everready guide be laid open to his eyes  likewise to the smallness of the several properties is owing the great number of bridges over the brooks and torrents and the daring and graceful neglect of danger or accommodation with which so many of them are constructed the rudeness of the forms of some and their endless variety but when i speak of this rudeness i must at the same time add that many of these structures are in themselves models of elegance as if they had been formed upon principles of the most thoughtful architecture it is to be regretted that these monuments of the skill of our ancestors and of that happy instinct by which consummate beauty was produced are disappearing fast but sufficient specimens remain57 to give a high gratification to the man of genuine taste  57 written some time ago the injury done since is more than could have been calculated upon  singula de nobis anni praedantur euntes this is in the course of things but why should the genius that directed the ancient architecture of these vales have deserted them for the bridges churches mansions cottages and their richly fringed and flatroofed outhouses venerable as the grange of some old abbey have been substituted structures in which baldness only seems to have been studied or plans of the most vulgar utility but some improvement may be looked for in future the gentry recently have copied the old models and successful instances might be pointed out if i could take the liberty  travellers who may not have been accustomed to pay attention to things so inobtrusive will excuse me if i point out the proportion between the span and elevation of the arch the lightness of the parapet and the graceful manner in which its curve follows faithfully that of the arch  upon this subject i have nothing further to notice except the places of worship which have mostly a little schoolhouse adjoining58 the architecture of these churches and chapels where they have not been recently rebuilt or modernised is of a style not less appropriate and admirable than that of the dwellinghouses and other structures how sacred the spirit by which our forefathers were directed the religio loci is no where violated by these unstinted yet unpretending works of human hands they exhibit generally a wellproportioned oblong with a suitable porch in some instances a steeple tower and in others nothing more than a small belfry in which one or two bells hang visibly but these objects though pleasing in their forms must necessarily more than others in rural scenery derive their interest from the sentiments of piety and reverence for the modest virtues and simple manners of humble life with which they may be contemplated a man must be very insensible who would not be touched with pleasure at the sight of the chapel of buttermere so strikingly expressing by its diminutive size how small must be the congregation there assembled as it were like one family and proclaiming at the same time to the passenger in connection with the surrounding mountains the depth of that seclusion in which the people live that has rendered necessary the building of a separate place of worship for so few a patriot calling to mind the images of the stately fabrics of canterbury york or westminster will find a heartfelt satisfaction in presence of this lowly pile as a monument of the wise institutions of our country and as evidence of the allpervading and paternal care of that venerable establishment of which it is perhaps the humblest daughter the edifice is scarcely larger than many of the single stones or fragments of rock which are scattered near it  58 in some places scholars were formerly taught in the church and at others the schoolhouse was a sort of antichapel to the place of worship being under the same roof an arrangement which was abandoned as irreverent it continues however to this day in borrowdale in the parish register of that chapelry is a notice that a youth who had quitted the valley and died in one of the towns on the coast of cumberland had requested that his body should be brought and interred at the foot of the pillar by which he had been accustomed to sit while a schoolboy one cannot but regret that parish registers so seldom contain any thing but bare names in a few of this country especially in that of loweswater i have found interesting notices of unusual natural occurrencescharacters of the deceased and particulars of their lives there is no good reason why such memorials should not be frequent these short and simple annals would in future ages become precious  we have thus far confined our observations on this division of the subject to that part of these dales which runs up far into the mountains  as we descend towards the open country we meet with halls and mansions many of which have been places of defence against the incursions of the scottish borderers and they not unfrequently retain their towers and battlements to these houses parks are sometimes attached and to their successive proprietors we chiefly owe whatever ornament is still left to the country of majestic timber through the open parts of the vales are scattered also houses of a middle rank between the pastoral cottage and the old hall residence of the knight or esquire such houses differ much from the rugged cottages before described and are generally graced with a little court or garden in front where may yet be seen specimens of those fantastic and quaint figures which our ancestors were fond of shaping out in yewtree holly or boxwood the passenger will sometimes smile at such elaborate display of petty art while the house does not deign to look upon the natural beauty or the sublimity which its situation almost unavoidably commands  thus has been given a faithful description the minuteness of which the reader will pardon of the face of this country as it was and had been through centuries till within the last sixty years towards the head of these dales was found a perfect republic of shepherds and agriculturists among whom the plough of each man was confined to the maintenance of his own family or to the occasional accommodation of his neighbour59  59 one of the most pleasing characteristics of manners in secluded and thinlypeopled districts is a sense of the degree in which human happiness and comfort are dependent on the contingency of neighbourhood this is implied by a rhyming adage common here friends are far when neighbours are nar near this mutual helpfulness is not confined to outofdoors work but is ready upon all occasions formerly if a person became sick especially the mistress of a family it was usual for those of the neighbours who were more particularly connected with the party by amicable offices to visit the house carrying a present this practice which is by no means obsolete is called owning the family and is regarded as a pledge of a disposition to be otherwise serviceable in a time of disability and distress  two or three cows furnished each family with milk and cheese the chapel was the only edifice that presided over these dwellings the supreme head of this pure commonwealth the members of which existed in the midst of a powerful empire like an ideal society or an organised community whose constitution had been imposed and regulated by the mountains which protected it neither highborn nobleman knight nor esquire was here but many of these humble sons of the hills had a consciousness that the land which they walked over and tilled had for more than five hundred years been possessed by men of their name and blood and venerable was the transition when a curious traveller descending from the heart of the mountains had come to some ancient manorial residence in the more open parts of the vales which through the rights attached to its proprietor connected the almost visionary mountain republic he had been contemplating with the substantial frame of society as existing in the laws and constitution of a mighty empire                                        section third  changes and bulks of taste for preventing their bad effects  such as hath been said was the appearance of things till within the last sixty years a practice denominated ornamental gardening was at that time becoming prevalent over england in union with an admiration of this art and in some instances in opposition to it had been generated a relish for select parts of natural scenery and travellers instead of confining their observations to towns manufactories or mines began a thing till then unheard of to wander over the island in search of sequestered spots distinguished as they might accidentally have learned for the sublimity or beauty of the forms of nature there to be seendr brown the celebrated author of the estimate of the manners and principles of the times published a letter to a friend in which the attractions of the vale of keswick were delineated with a powerful pencil and the feeling of a genuine enthusiast gray the poet followed he died soon after his forlorn and melancholy pilgrimage to the vale of keswick and the record left behind him of what he had seen and felt in this journey excited that pensive interest with which the human mind is ever disposed to listen to the farewell words of a man of genius the journal of gray feelingly showed how the gloom of ill health and low spirits had been irradiated by objects which the authors powers of mind enabled him to describe with distinctness and unaffected simplicity every reader of this journal must have been impressed with the words which conclude his notice of the vale of grasmerenot a single red tile no flaring gentlemans house or gardenwall breaks in upon the repose of this little unsuspected paradise but all is peace rusticity and happy poverty in its neatest and most becoming attire  what is here so justly said of grasmere applied almost equally to all its sister vales it was well for the undisturbed pleasure of the poet that he had no forebodings of the change which was soon to take place and it might have been hoped that these words indicating how much the charm of what was depended upon what was not would of themselves have preserved the ancient franchises of this and other kindred mountain retirements from trespass or shall i dare to say would have secured scenes so consecrated from profanation the lakes had now become celebrated visitors flocked hither from all parts of england the fancies of some were smitten so deeply that they became settlers and the islands of derwentwater and winandermere as they offered the strongest temptation were the first places seized upon and were instantly defaced by the intrusion  the venerable wood that had grown for centuries round the small house called st herberts hermitage had indeed some years before been felled by its native proprietor and the whole island planted anew with scotch firs left to spindle up by each others sidea melancholy phalanx defying the power of the winds and disregarding the regret of the spectator who might otherwise have cheated himself into a belief that some of the decayed remains of those oaks the place of which was in this manner usurped had been planted by the hermits own hand this sainted spot however suffered comparatively little injury at the bidding of an alien improver the hinds cottage upon vicars island in the same lake with its embowering sycamores and cattleshed disappeared from the corner where they stood and right in the middle and upon the precise point of the islands highest elevation rose a tall square habitation with four sides exposed like an astronomers observatory or a warrenhouse reared upon an eminence for the detection of depredators or like the temple of oeolus where all the winds pay him obeisance round this novel structure but at a respectful distance platoons of firs were stationed as if to protect their commander when weather and time should somewhat have shattered his strength within the narrow limits of this island were typified also the state and strength of a kingdom and its religion as it had been and wasfor neither was the druidical circle uncreated nor the church of the present establishment nor the stately pier emblem of commerce and navigation nor the fort to deal out thunder upon the approaching invader the taste of a succeeding proprietor rectified the mistakes as far as was practicable and has ridded the spot of its puerilities the church after having been docked of its steeple is applied both ostensibly and really to the purpose for which the body of the pile was actually erected namely a boathouse the fort is demolished and without indignation on the part of the spirits of the ancient druids who officiated at the circle upon the opposite hill the mimic arrangement of stones with its sanctum sanctorum has been swept away  the present instance has been singled out extravagant as it is because unquestionably this beautiful country has in numerous other places suffered from the same spirit though not clothed exactly in the same form nor active in an equal degree it will be sufficient here to utter a regret for the changes that have been made upon the principal island at winandermere and in its neighbourhood what could be more unfortunate than the taste that suggested the paring of the shores and surrounding with an embankment this spot of ground the natural shape of which was so beautiful an artificial appearance has thus been given to the whole while infinite varieties of minute beauty have been destroyed could not the margin of this noble island be given back to nature winds and waves work with a careless and graceful hand and should they in some places carry away a portion of the soil the trifling loss would be amply compensated by the additional spirit dignity and loveliness which these agents and the other powers of nature would soon communicate to what was left behind as to the larchplantations upon the main shorethey who remember the original appearance of the rocky steeps scattered over with native hollies and ashtrees will be prepared to agree with what i shall have to say hereafter upon plantations60 in general   60 these are disappearing fast under the management of the present proprietor and native wood is resuming its place  but in truth no one can now travel through the more frequented tracts without being offended at almost every turn by an introduction of discordant objects disturbing that peaceful harmony of form and colour which had been through a long lapse of ages most happily preserved  all gross transgressions of this kind originate doubtless in a feeling natural and honourable to the human mind viz the pleasure which it receives from distinct ideas and from the perception of order regularity and contrivance now unpractised minds receive these impressions only from objects that are divided from each other by strong lines of demarcation hence the delight with which such minds are smitten by formality and harsh contrast but i would beg of those who are eager to create the means of such gratification first carefully to study what already exists and they will find in a country so lavishly gifted by nature an abundant variety of forms marked out with a precision that will satisfy their desires moreover a new habit of pleasure will be formed opposite to this arising out of the perception of the fine gradations by which in nature one thing passes away into another and the boundaries that constitute individuality disappear in one instance only to be revived elsewhere under a more alluring form the bill of dunmallet at the foot of ulswater was once divided into different portions by avenues of firtrees with a green and almost perpendicular lane descending down the steep hill through each avenuecontrast this quaint appearance with the image of the same hill overgrown with selfplanted woodeach tree springing up in the situation best suited to its kind and with that shape which the situation constrained or suffered it to take what endless melting and playing into each other of forms and colours does the one offer to a mind at once attentive and active and how insipid and lifeless compared with it appear those parts of the former exhibition with which a child a peasant perhaps or a citizen unfamiliar with natural imagery would have been most delighted  the disfigurement which this country has undergone has not however proceeded wholly from the common feelings of human nature which have been referred to as the primary sources of bad taste in rural imagery another cause must be added that has chiefly shown itself in its effect upon buildings i mean a warping of the natural mind occasioned by a consciousness that this country being an object of general admiration every new house would be looked at and commented upon either for approbation or censure hence all the deformity and ungracefulness that ever pursue the steps of constraint or affectation persons who in leicestershire or northamptonshire would probably have built a modest dwelling like those of their sensible neighbours have been turned out of their course and acting a part no wonder if having had little experience they act it ill the craving for prospect also which is immoderate particularly in new settlers has rendered it impossible that buildings whatever might have been their architecture should in most instances be ornamental to the landscape rising as they do from the summits of naked hills in staring contrast to the snugness and privacy of the ancient houses  no man is to be condemned for a desire to decorate his residence and possessions feeling a disposition to applaud such an endeavour i would show how the end may be best attained the rule is simple with respect to groundswork where you can in the spirit of nature with an invisible hand of art planting and a removal of wood may thus and thus only be carried on with good effect and the like may be said of building if antiquity who may be styled the copartner and sister of nature be not denied the respect to which she is entitled i have already spoken of the beautiful forms of the ancient mansions of this country and of the happy manner in which they harmonise with the forms of nature why cannot such be taken as a model and modern internal convenience be confined within their external grace and dignity expense to be avoided or difficulties to be overcome may prevent a close adherence to this model still however it might be followed to a certain degree in the style of architecture and in the choice of situation if the thirst for prospect were mitigated by those considerations of comfort shelter and convenience which used to be chiefly sought after but should an aversion to old fashions unfortunately exist accompanied with a desire to transplant into the cold and stormy north the elegancies of a villa formed upon a model taken from countries with a milder climate i will adduce a passage from an english poet the divine spenser which will show in what manner such a plan may be realised without injury to the native beauty of these scenes      into that forest farre they thence him led     where was their dwelling in a pleasant glade     with mountains round about environed     and mighty woods which did the valley shade     and like a stately theatre it made     spreading itself into a spacious plaine     and in the midst a little river plaide     emongst the puny stones which seemd to plaine     with gentle murmure that his course they did restraine      beside the same a dainty place there lay     planted with mirtle trees and laurels green     in which the birds sang many a lovely lay     of gods high praise and of their sweet loves teene     as it an earthly paradise had beene     in whose enclosed shadow there was pight     a fair pavillion scarcely to be seen     the which was all within most richly dight     that greatest princes living it mote well delight  houses or mansions suited to a mountainous region should be not obvious not obtrusive but retired and the reasons for this rule though they have been little adverted to are evident mountainous countries more frequently and forcibly than others remind us of the power of the elements as manifested in winds snows and torrents and accordingly make the notion of exposure very unpleasing while shelter and comfort are in proportion necessary and acceptable farwinding vallies difficult of access and the feelings of simplicity habitually connected with mountain retirements prompt us to turn from ostentation as a thing there eminently unnatural and out of place a mansion amid such scenes can never have sufficient dignity or interest to become principal in the landscape and to render the mountains lakes or torrents by which it may be surrounded a subordinate part of the view it is i grant easy to conceive that an ancient castellated building hanging over a precipice or raised upon an island or the peninsula of a lake like that of kilchurn castle upon loch awe may not want whether deserted or inhabited sufficient majesty to preside for a moment in the spectators thoughts over the high mountains among which it is embosomed but its titles are from antiquitya power readily submitted to upon occasion as the vicegerent of nature it is respected as having owed its existence to the necessities of things as a monument of security in times of disturbance and danger long passed awayas a record of the pomp and violence of passion and a symbol of the wisdom of law it bears a countenance of authority which is not impaired by decay      child of loudthroated war the mountain stream     roars in thy hearing but thy hour of rest     is come and thou art silent in thy age  to such honours a modern edifice can lay no claim and the puny efforts of elegance appear contemptible when in such situations they are obtruded in rivalship with the sublimities of nature but towards the verge of a district like this of which we are treating where the mountains subside into hills of moderate elevation or in an undulating or flat country a gentlemans mansion may with propriety become a principal feature in the landscape and itself being a work of art works and traces of artificial ornament may without censure be extended around it as they will be referred to the common centre the house the right of which to impress within certain limits a character of obvious ornament will not be denied where no commanding forms of nature dispute it or set it aside now to a want of the perception of this difference and to the causes before assigned may chiefly be attributed the disfigurement which the country of the lakes has undergone from persons who may have built demolished and planted with full confidence that every change and addition was or would become an improvement  the principle that ought to determine the position apparent size and architecture of a house viz that it should be so constructed and if large so much of it hidden as to admit of its being gently incorporated into the scenery of natureshould also determine its colour sir joshua reynolds used to say if you would fix upon the best colour for your house turn up a stone or pluck up a handful of grass by the roots and see what is the colour of the soil where the house is to stand and let that be your choice of course this precept given in conversation could not have been meant to be taken literally for example in low furness where the soil from its strong impregnation with iron is universally of a deep red if this rule were strictly followed the house also must be of a glaring red in other places it must be of a sullen black which would only be adding annoyance to annoyance the rule however as a general guide is good and in agricultural districts where large tracts of soil are laid bare by the plough particularly if the face of the country being undulating they are held up to view this rule though not to be implicitly adhered to should never be lost sight ofthe colour of the house ought if possible to have a cast or shade of the colour of the soil the principle is that the house must harmonise with the surrounding landscape accordingly in mountainous countries with still more confidence may it be said look at the rocks and those parts of the mountains where the soil is visible and they will furnish a safe direction nevertheless it will often happen that the rocks may bear so large a proportion to the rest of the landscape and may be of such a tone of colour that the rule may not admit even here of being implicitly followed for instance the chief defect in the colouring of the country of the lakes which is most strongly felt in the summer season is an overprevalence of a bluish tint which the green of the herbage the fern and the woods does not sufficiently counteract if a house therefore should stand where this defect prevails i have no hesitation in saying that the colour of the neighbouring rocks would not be the best that could be chosen a tint ought to be introduced approaching nearer to those which in the technical language of painters are called warm this if happily selected would not disturb but would animate the landscape how often do we see this exemplified upon a small scale by the native cottages in cases where the glare of whitewash has been subdued by time and enriched by weatherstains no harshness is then seen but one of these cottages thus coloured will often form a central point to a landscape by which the whole shall be connected and an influence of pleasure diffused over all the objects that compose the picture but where the cold blue tint of the rocks is enriched by the iron tinge the colour cannot be too closely imitated and it will be produced of itself by the stones hewn from the adjoining quarry and by the mortar which may be tempered with the most gravelly part of the soil the pure blue gravel from the bed of the river is however more suitable to the masons purpose who will probably insist also that the house must be covered with roughcast otherwise it cannot be kept dry if this advice be taken the builder of taste will set about contriving such means as may enable him to come the nearest to the effect aimed at  the supposed necessity of roughcast to keep out rain in houses not built of hewn stone or brick has tended greatly to injure english landscape and the neighbourhood of these lakes especially by furnishing such apt occasion for whitening buildings that white should be a favourite colour for rural residences is natural for many reasons the mere aspect of cleanliness and neatness thus given not only to an individual house but where the practice is general to the whole face of the country produces moral associations so powerful that in many minds they take place of all others but what has already been said upon the subject of cottages must have convinced men of feeling and imagination that a human dwelling of the humblest class may be rendered more deeply interesting to the affections and far more pleasing to the eye by other influences than a sprightly tone of colour spread over its outside i do not however mean to deny that a small white building embowered in trees may in some situations be a delightful and animating objectin no way injurious to the landscape but this only where it sparkles from the midst of a thick shade and in rare and solitary instances especially if the country be itself rich and pleasing and abound with grand forms on the sides of bleak and desolate moors we are indeed thankful for the sight of white cottages and white houses plentifully scattered where without these perhaps every thing would be cheerless this is said however with hesitation and with a wilful sacrifice of some higher enjoyments but i have certainly seen such buildings glittering at sunrise and in wandering lights with no common pleasure the continental traveller also will remember that the convents hanging from the rocks of the rhine the rhone the danube or among the appenines or the mountains of spain are not looked at with less complacency when as is often the case they happen to be of a brilliant white but this is perhaps owing in no small degree to the contrast of that lively colour with the gloom of monastic life and to the general want of rural residences of smiling and attractive appearance in those countries  the objections to white as a colour in large spots or masses in landscape especially in a mountainous country are insurmountable in nature pure white is scarcely ever found but in small objects such as flowers or in those which are transitory as the clouds foam of rivers and snow mr gilpin who notices this has also recorded the just remark of mr locke of n that white destroys the gradations of distance and therefore an object of pure white can scarcely ever be managed with good effect in landscapepainting five or six white houses scattered over a valley by their obtrusiveness dot the surface and divide it into triangles or other mathematical figures haunting the eye and disturbing that repose which might otherwise be perfect i have seen a single white house materially impair the majesty of a mountain cutting away by a harsh separation the whole of its base below the point on which the house stood thus was the apparent size of the mountain reduced not by the interposition of another object in a manner to call forth the imagination which will give more than the eye loses but what had been abstracted in this case was left visible and the mountain appeared to take its beginning or to rise from the line of the house instead of its own natural base but if i may express my own individual feeling it is after sunset at the coming on of twilight that white objects are most to be complained of the solemnity and quietness of nature at that time are always marred and often destroyed by them when the ground is covered with snow they are of course inoffensive and in moonshine they are always pleasingit is a tone of light with which they accord and the dimness of the scene is enlivened by an object at once conspicuous and cheerful i will conclude this subject with noticing that the cold slaty colour which many persons who have heard the white condemned have adopted in its stead must be disapproved of for the reason already given the flaring yellow runs into the opposite extreme and is still more censurable upon the whole the safest colour for general use is something between a cream and a dustcolour commonly called stone colourthere are among the lakes examples of this that need not be pointed out61  61 a proper colouring of houses is now becoming general it is best that the colouring material should be mixed with the roughcast and not laid on as a wash afterwards  the principle taken as our guide viz that the house should be so formed and of such apparent size and colour as to admit of its being gently incorporated with the works of nature should also be applied to the management of the grounds and plantations and is here more urgently needed for it is from abuses in this department far more even than from the introduction of exotics in architecture if the phrase may be used that this country has suffered larch and fir plantations have been spread not merely with a view to profit but in many instances for the sake of ornament to those who plant for profit and are thrusting every other tree out of the way to make room for their favourite the larch i would utter first a regret that they should have selected these lovely vales for their vegetable manufactory when there is so much barren and irreclaimable land in the neighbouring moors and in other parts of the island which might have been had for this purpose at a far cheaper rate and i will also beg leave to represent to them that they ought not to be carried away by flattering promises from the speedy growth of this tree because in rich soils and sheltered situations the wood though it thrives fast is full of sap and of little value and is likewise very subject to ravage from the attacks of insects and from blight accordingly in scotland where planting is much better understood and carried on upon an incomparably larger scale than among us good soil and sheltered situations are appropriated to the oak the ash and other deciduous trees and the larch is now generally confined to barren and exposed ground there the plant which is a hardy one is of slower growth much less liable to injury and the timber is of better quality but the circumstances of many permit and their taste leads them to plant with little regard to profit and there are others less wealthy who have such a lively feeling of the native beauty of these scenes that they are laudably not unwilling to make some sacrifices to heighten it both these classes of persons i would entreat to inquire of themselves wherein that beauty which they admire consists they would then see that after the feeling has been gratified that prompts us to gather round our dwelling a few flowers and shrubs which from the circumstance of their not being native may by their very looks remind us that they owe their existence to our hands and their prosperity to our care they will see that after this natural desire has been provided for the course of all beyond has been predetermined by the spirit of the place before i proceed i will remind those who are not satisfied with the restraint thus laid upon them that they are liable to a charge of inconsistency when they are so eager to change the face of that country whose native attractions by the act of erecting their habitations in it they have so emphatically acknowledged and surely there is not a single spot that would not have if well managed sufficient dignity to support itself unaided by the productions of other climates or by elaborate decorations which might be becoming elsewhere  having adverted to the feelings that justify the introduction of a few exotic plants provided they be confined almost to the doors of the house we may add that a transition should be contrived without abruptness from these foreigners to the rest of the shrubs which ought to be of the kinds scattered by nature through the woodsholly broom wildrose elder dogberry white and black thorn ceither these only or such as are carefully selected in consequence of their being united in form and harmonising in colour with them especially with respect to colour when the tints are most diversified as in autumn and spring the various sorts of fruitandblossombearing trees usually found in orchards to which may be added those of the woodsnamely the wilding black cherry tree and wild clustercherry here called heckberrymay be happily admitted as an intermediate link between the shrubs and the forest trees which last ought almost entirely to be such as are natives of the country of the birch one of the most beautiful of the native trees it may be noticed that in dry and rocky situations it outstrips even the larch which many persons are tempted to plant merely on account of the speed of its growth the scotch fir is less attractive during its youth than any other plant but when full grown if it has had room to spread out its arms it becomes a noble tree and by those who are disinterested enough to plant for posterity it may be placed along with the sycamore near the house for from their massiveness both these trees unite well with buildings and in some situations with rocks also having in their forms and apparent substances the effect of something intermediate betwixt the immoveableness and solidity of stone and the spray and foliage of the lighter trees if these general rules be just what shall we say to whole acres of artificial shrubbery and exotic trees among rocks and dashing torrents with their own wild wood in sightwhere we have the whole contents of the nurserymans catalogue jumbled togethercolour at war with colour and form with formamong the most peaceful subjects of natures kingdom everywhere discord distraction and bewilderment but this deformity bad as it is is not so obtrusive as the small patches and large tracts of larchplantations that are overrunning the hill sides to justify our condemnation of these let us again recur to nature the process by which she forms woods and forests is as follows seeds are scattered indiscriminately by winds brought by waters and dropped by birds they perish or produce according as the soil and situation upon which they fall are suited to them and under the same dependence the seedling or the sucker if not cropped by animals which nature is often careful to prevent by fencing it about with brambles or other prickly shrubs thrives and the tree grows sometimes single taking its own shape without constraint but for the most part compelled to conform itself to some law imposed upon it by its neighbours from low and sheltered places vegetation travels upwards to the more exposed and the young plants are protected and to a certain degree fashioned by those that have preceded them the continuous mass of foliage which would be thus produced is broken by rocks or by glades or open places where the browzing of animals has prevented the growth of wood as vegetation ascends the winds begin also to bear their part in moulding the forms of the trees but thus mutually protected trees though not of the hardiest kind are enabled to climb high up the mountains gradually however by the quality of the ground and by increasing exposure a stop is put to their ascent the hardy trees only are left those also by little and little give wayand a wild and irregular boundary is established graceful in its outline and never contemplated without some feeling more or less distinct of the powers of nature by which it is imposed  contrast the liberty that encourages and the law that limits this joint work of nature and time with the disheartening necessities restrictions and disadvantages under which the artificial planter must proceed even he whom long observation and fine feeling have best qualified for his task in the first place his trees however well chosen and adapted to their several situations must generally start all at the same time and this necessity would of itself prevent that fine connection of parts that sympathy and organisation if i may so express myself which pervades the whole of a natural wood and appears to the eye in its single trees its masses of foliage and their various colours when they are held up to view on the side of a mountain or when spread over a valley they are looked down upon from an eminence it is therefore impossible under any circumstances for the artificial planter to rival the beauty of nature but a moments thought will show that if ten thousand of this spiky tree the larch are stuck in at once upon the side of a hill they can grow up into nothing but deformity that while they are suffered to stand we shall look in vain for any of those appearances which are the chief sources of beauty in a natural wood  it must be acknowledged that the larch till it has outgrown the size of a shrub shows when looked at singly some elegance in form and appearance especially in spring decorated as it then is by the pink tassels of its blossoms but as a tree it is less than any other pleasing its branches for boughs it has none have no variety in the youth of the tree and little dignity even when it attains its full growth leaves it cannot be said to have consequently neither affords shade nor shelter in spring the larch becomes green long before the native trees and its green is so peculiar and vivid that finding nothing to harmonise with it wherever it comes forth a disagreeable speck is produced in summer when all other trees are in their pride it is of a dingy lifeless hue in autumn of a spiritless unvaried yellow and in winter it is still more lamentably distinguished from every other deciduous tree of the forest for they seem only to sleep but the larch appears absolutely dead if an attempt be made to mingle thickets or a certain proportion of other foresttrees with the larch its horizontal branches intolerantly cut them down as with a scythe or force them to spindle up to keep pace with it the terminating spike renders it impossible that the several trees where planted in numbers should ever blend together so as to form a mass or masses of wood add thousands to tens of thousands and the appearance is still the samea collection of separate individual trees obstinately presenting themselves as such and which from whatever point they are looked at if but seen may be counted upon the fingers sunshine or shadow has little power to adorn the surface of such a wood and the trees not carrying up their heads the wind raises among them no majestic undulations it is indeed true that in countries where the larch is a native and where without interruption it may sweep from valley to valley and from hill to hill a sublime image may be produced by such a forest in the same manner as by one composed of any other single tree to the spreading of which no limits can be assigned for sublimity will never be wanting where the sense of innumerable multitude is lost in and alternates with that of intense unity and to the ready perception of this effect similarity and almost identity of individual form and monotony of colour contribute but this feeling is confined to the native immeasurable forest no artificial plantation can give it  the foregoing observations will i hope as nothing has been condemned or recommended without a substantial reason have some influence upon those who plant for ornament merely to such as plant for profit i have already spoken let me then entreat that the native deciduous trees may be left in complete possession of the lower ground and that plantations of larch if introduced at all may be confined to the highest and most barren tracts interposition of rocks would there break the dreary uniformity of which we have been complaining and the winds would take hold of the trees and imprint upon their shapes a wildness congenial to their situation  having determined what kinds of trees must be wholly rejected or at least very sparingly used by those who are unwilling to disfigure the country and having shown what kinds ought to be chosen i should have given if my limits had not already been overstepped a few practical rules for the manner in which trees ought to be disposed in planting but to this subject i should attach little importance if i could succeed in banishing such trees as introduce deformity and could prevail upon the proprietor to confine himself either to those found in the native woods or to such as accord with them this is indeed the main point for much as these scenes have been injured by what has been taken from thembuildings trees and woods either through negligence necessity avarice or capriceit is not the removals but the harsh additions that have been made which are the worst grievancea standing and unavoidable annoyance often have i felt this distinction with mingled satisfaction and regret for if no positive deformity or discordance be substituted or superinduced such is the benignity of nature that take away from her beauty after beauty and ornament after ornament her appearance cannot be marredthe scars if any be left will gradually disappear before a healing spirit and what remains will still be soothing and pleasing                many hearts deplored     the fate of those old trees and oft with pain     the traveller at this day will stop and gaze     on wrongs which nature scarcely seems to heed     for sheltered places bosoms nooks and bays     and the pure mountains and the gentle tweed     and the green silent pastures yet remain  there are few ancient woods left in this part of england upon which such indiscriminate ravage as is here deplored could now be committed but out of the numerous copses fine woods might in time be raised probably without sacrifice of profit by leaving at the periodical fellings a due proportion of the healthiest trees to grow up into timberthis plan has fortunately in many instances been adopted and they who have set the example are entitled to the thanks of all persons of taste as to the management of planting with reasonable attention to ornament let the images of nature be your guide and the whole secret lurks in a few words thickets or underwoodssingle treestrees clustered or in groupsgrovesunbroken woods but with varied masses of foliagegladesinvisible or winding boundariesin rocky districts a seemly proportion of rock left wholly bare and other parts half hiddendisagreeable objects concealed and formal lines brokentrees climbing up to the horizon and in some places ascending from its sharp edge in which they are rooted with the whole body of the tree appearing to stand in the clear skyin other parts woods surmounted by rocks utterly bare and naked which add to the sense of height as if vegetation could not thither be carried and impress a feeling of duration power of resistance and security from change  the author has been induced to speak thus at length by a wish to preserve the native beauty of this delightful district because still further changes in its appearance must inevitably follow from the change of inhabitants and owners which is rapidly taking placeabout the same time that strangers began to be attracted to the country and to feel a desire to settle in it the difficulty that would have stood in the way of their procuring situations was lessened by an unfortunate alteration in the circumstances of the native peasantry proceeding from a cause which then began to operate and is now felt in every house the family of each man whether estatesman or farmer formerly had a twofold support first the produce of his lands and flocks and secondly the profit drawn from the employment of the women and children as manufacturers spinning their own wool in their own houses work chiefly done in the winter season and carrying it to market for sale hence however numerous the children the income of the family kept pace with its increase but by the invention and universal application of machinery this second resource has been cut off the gains being so far reduced as not to be sought after but by a few aged persons disabled from other employment doubtless the invention of machinery has not been to these people a pure loss for the profits arising from homemanufactures operated as a strong temptation to choose that mode of labour in neglect of husbandry they also participate in the general benefit which the island has derived from the increased value of the produce of land brought about by the establishment of manufactories and in the consequent quickening of agricultural industry but this is far from making them amends and now that homemanufactures are nearly done away though the women and children might at many seasons of the year employ themselves with advantage in the fields beyond what they are accustomed to do yet still all possible exertion in this way cannot be rationally expected from persons whose agricultural knowledge is so confined and above all where there must necessarily be so small a capital the consequence then isthat proprietors and farmers being no longer able to maintain themselves upon small farms several are united in one and the buildings go to decay or are destroyed and that the lands of the estatesmen being mortgaged and the owners constrained to part with them they fall into the hands of wealthy purchasers who in like manner unite and consolidate and if they wish to become residents erect new mansions out of the ruins of the ancient cottages whose little enclosures with all the wild graces that grew out of them disappear the feudal tenure under which the estates are held has indeed done something towards checking this influx of new settlers but so strong is the inclination that these galling restraints are endured and it is probable that in a few years the country on the margin of the lakes will fall almost entirely into the possession of gentry either strangers or natives it is then much to be wished that a better taste should prevail among these new proprietors and as they cannot be expected to leave things to themselves that skill and knowledge should prevent unnecessary deviations from that path of simplicity and beauty along which without design and unconsciously their humble predecessors have moved in this wish the author will be joined by persons of pure taste throughout the whole island who by their visits often repeated to the lakes in the north of england testify that they deem the district a sort of national property in which every man has a right and interest who has an eye to perceive and a heart to enjoy     miscellaneous observations  mr west in his wellknown guide to the lakes recommends as the best season for visiting this country the interval from the beginning of june to the end of august and the two latter months being a time of vacation and leisure it is almost exclusively in these that strangers resort hither but that season is by no means the best the colouring of the mountains and woods unless where they are diversified by rocks is of too unvaried a green and as a large portion of the vallies is allotted to haygrass some want of variety is found there also the meadows however are sufficiently enlivened after haymaking begins which is much later than in the southern part of the island a stronger objection is rainy weather setting in sometimes at this period with a vigour and continuing with a perseverance that may remind the disappointed and dejected traveller of those deluges of rain which fall among the abyssinian mountains for the annual supply of the nile the months of september and october particularly october are generally attended with much finer weather and the scenery is then beyond comparison more diversified more splendid and beautiful but on the other hand short days prevent long excursions and sharp and chill gales are unfavourable to parties of pleasure out of doors nevertheless to the sincere admirer of nature who is in good health and spirits and at liberty to make a choice the six weeks following the 1st of september may be recommended in preference to july and august for there is no inconvenience arising from the season which to such a person would not be amply compensated by the autumnal appearance of any of the more retired vallies into which discordant plantations and unsuitable buildings have not yet found entrancein such spots at this season there is an admirable compass and proportion of natural harmony in colour through the whole scale of objects in the tender green of the aftergrass upon the meadows interspersed with islands of grey or mossy rock crowned by shrubs and trees in the irregular inclosures of standing corn or stubblefields in like manner broken in the mountainsides glowing with fern of divers colours in the calm blue lakes and riverpools and in the foliage of the trees through all the tints of autumnfrom the pale and brilliant yellow of the birch and ash to the deep greens of the unfaded oak and alder and of the ivy upon the rocks upon the trees and the cottages yet as most travellers are either stinted or stint themselves for time the space between the middle or last week in may and the middle or last week of june may be pointed out as affording the best combination of long days fine weather and variety of impressions few of the native trees are then in full leaf but for whatever maybe wanting in depth of shade more than an equivalent will be found in the diversity of foliage in the blossoms of the fruitandberrybearing trees which abound in the woods and in the golden flowers of the broom and other shrubs with which many of the copses are interveined in those woods also and on those mountainsides which have a northern aspect and in the deep dells many of the springflowers still linger while the open and sunny places are stocked with the flowers of the approaching summer and besides is not an exquisite pleasure still untasted by him who has not heard the choir of linnets and thrushes chaunting their lovesongs in the copses woods and hedgerows of a mountainous country safe from the birds of prey which build in the inaccessible crags and are at all hours seen or heard wheeling about in the air the number of these formidable creatures is probably the cause why in the narrow vallies there are no skylarks as the destroyer would be enabled to dart upon them from the near and surrounding crags before they could descend to their groundnests for protection it is not often that the nightingale resorts to these vales but almost all the other tribes of our english warblers are numerous and their notes when listened to by the side of broad still waters or when heard in unison with the murmuring of mountainbrooks have the compass of their power enlarged accordingly there is also an imaginative influence in the voice of the cuckoo when that voice has taken possession of a deep mountain valley very different from any thing which can be excited by the same sound in a flat country nor must a circumstance be omitted which here renders the close of spring especially interesting i mean the practice of bringing down the ewes from the mountains to yean in the vallies and enclosed grounds the herbage being thus cropped as it springs that first tender emerald green of the season which would otherwise have lasted little more than a fortnight is prolonged in the pastures and meadows for many weeks while they are farther enlivened by the multitude of lambs bleating and skipping about these sportive creatures as they gather strength are turned out upon the open mountains and with their slender limbs their snowwhite colour and their wild and light motions beautifully accord or contrast with the rocks and lawns upon which they must now begin to seek their food and last but not least at this time the traveller will be sure of room and comfortable accommodation even in the smaller inns i am aware that few of those who may be inclined to profit by this recommendation will be able to do so as the time and manner of an excursion of this kind are mostly regulated by circumstances which prevent an entire freedom of choice it will therefore be more pleasant to observe that though the months of july and august are liable to many objections yet it often happens that the weather at this time is not more wet and stormy than they who are really capable of enjoying the sublime forms of nature in their utmost sublimity would desire for no traveller provided he be in good health and with any command of time would have a just privilege to visit such scenes if he could grudge the price of a little confinement among them or interruption in his journey for the sight or sound of a storm coming on or clearing away insensible must he be who would not congratulate himself upon the bold bursts of sunshine the descending vapours wandering lights and shadows and the invigorated torrents and waterfalls with which broken weather in a mountainous region is accompanied at such a time there is no cause to complain either of the monotony of midsummer colouring or the glaring atmosphere of long cloudless and hot days  thus far concerning the respective advantages and disadvantages of the different seasons for visiting this country as to the order in which objects are best seena lake being composed of water flowing from higher grounds and expanding itself till its receptacle is filled to the brimit follows that it will appear to most advantage when approached from its outlet especially if the lake be in a mountainous country for by this way of approach the traveller faces the grander features of the scene and is gradually conducted into its most sublime recesses now every one knows that from amenity and beauty the transition to sublimity is easy and favourable but the reverse is not so for after the faculties have been elevated they are indisposed to humbler excitement62  62 the only instances to which the foregoing observations do not apply are derwentwater and loweswater derwent is distinguished from all the other lakes by being surrounded with sublimity the fantastic mountains of borrowdale to the south the solitary majesty of skiddaw to the north the bold steeps of wallowcrag and lodore to the east and to the west the clustering mountains of newlands loweswater is tame at the head but towards its outlet has a magnificent assemblage of mountains yet as far as respects the formation of such receptacles the general observation holds good neither derwent nor loweswater derive any supplies from the streams of those mountains that dignify the landscape towards the outlets  it is not likely that a mountain will be ascended without disappointment if a wide range of prospect be the object unless either the summit be reached before sunrise or the visitant remain there until the time of sunset and afterwards the precipitous sides of the mountain and the neighbouring summits may be seen with effect under any atmosphere which allows them to be seen at all but he is the most fortunate adventurer who chances to be involved in vapours which open and let in an extent of country partially or dispersing suddenly reveal the whole region from centre to circumference  a stranger to a mountainous country may not be aware that his walk in the early morning ought to be taken on the eastern side of the vale otherwise he will lose the morning light first touching the tops and thence creeping down the sides of the opposite hills as the sun ascends or he may go to some central eminence commanding both the shadows from the eastern and the lights upon the western mountains but if the horizon line in the east be low the western side may be taken for the sake of the reflections upon the water of light from the rising sun in the evening for like reasons the contrary course should be taken  after all it is upon the mind which a traveller brings along with him that his acquisitions whether of pleasure or profit must principally dependmay i be allowed a few words on this subject  nothing is more injurious to genuine feeling than the practice of hastily and ungraciously depreciating the face of one country by comparing it with that of another true it is qui bene distinguit bene docet yet fastidiousness is a wretched travelling companion and the best guide to which in matters of taste we can entrust ourselves is a disposition to be pleased for example if a traveller be among the alps let him surrender up his mind to the fury of the gigantic torrents and take delight in the contemplation of their almost irresistible violence without complaining of the monotony of their foaming course or being disgusted with the muddiness of the waterapparent even where it is violently agitated in cumberland and westmoreland let not the comparative weakness of the streams prevent him from sympathising with such impetuosity as they possess and making the most of the present objects let him as he justly may do observe with admiration the unrivalled brilliancy of the water and that variety of motion mood and character that arises out of the want of those resources by which the power of the streams in the alps is supportedagain with respect to the mountains though these are comparatively of diminutive size though there is little of perpetual snow and no voice of summeravalanches is heard among them and though traces left by the ravage of the elements are here comparatively rare and unimpressive yet out of this very deficiency proceeds a sense of stability and permanence that is to many minds more grateful      while the hoarse rushes to the sweeping breeze     sigh forth their ancient melodies  among the alps are few places that do not preclude this feeling of tranquil sublimity havoc and ruin and desolation and encroachment are everywhere more or less obtruded and it is difficult notwithstanding the naked loftiness of the pikes and the snowcapped summits of the mounts to escape from the depressing sensation that the whole are in a rapid process of dissolution and were it not that the destructive agency must abate as the heights diminish would in time to come be levelled with the plains nevertheless i would relish to the utmost the demonstrations of every species of power at work to effect such changes  from these general views let us descend a moment to detail a stranger to mountain imagery naturally on his first arrival looks out for sublimity in every object that admits of it and is almost always disappointed for this disappointment there exists i believe no general preventive nor is it desirable that there should but with regard to one class of objects there is a point in which injurious expectations may be easily corrected it is generally supposed that waterfalls are scarcely worth being looked at except after much rain and that the more swoln the stream the more fortunate the spectator but this however is true only of large cataracts with sublime accompaniments and not even of these without some drawbacks in other instances what becomes at such a time of that sense of refreshing coolness which can only be felt in dry and sunny weather when the rocks herbs and flowers glisten with moisture diffused by the breath of the precipitous water but considering these things as objects of sight only it may be observed that the principal charm of the smaller waterfalls or cascades consists in certain proportions of form and affinities of colour among the component parts of the scene and in the contrast maintained between the falling water and that which is apparently at rest or rather settling gradually into quiet in the pool below the beauty of such a scene where there is naturally so much agitation is also heightened in a peculiar manner by the glimmering and towards the verge of the pool by the steady reflection of the surrounding images now all those delicate distinctions are destroyed by heavy floods and the whole stream rushes along in foam and tumultuous confusion a happy proportion of component parts is indeed noticeable among the landscapes of the north of england and in this characteristic essential to a perfect picture they surpass the scenes of scotland and in a still greater degree those of switzerland  as a resident among the lakes i frequently hear the scenery of this country compared with that of the alps and therefore a few words shall be added to what has been incidentally said upon that subject  if we could recall to this region of lakes the native pineforests with which many hundred years ago a large portion of the heights was covered then during spring and autumn it might frequently with much propriety be compared to switzerlandthe elements of the landscape would be the sameone country representing the other in miniature towns villages churches rural seats bridges and roads green meadows and arable grounds with their various produce and deciduous woods of diversified foliage which occupy the vales and lower regions of the mountains would as in switzerland be divided by dark forests from ridges and roundtopped heights covered with snow and from pikes and sharp declivities imperfectly arrayed in the same glittering mantle and the resemblance would be still more perfect on those days when vapours resting upon and floating around the summits leave the elevation of the mountains less dependent upon the eye than on the imagination but the pineforests have wholly disappeared and only during late spring and early autumn is realised here that assemblage of the imagery of different seasons which is exhibited through the whole summer among the alpswinter in the distanceand warmth leafy woods verdure and fertility at hand and widely diffused  striking then from among the permanent materials of the landscape that stage of vegetation which is occupied by pineforests and above that the perennial snows we have mountains the highest of which little exceed 3000 feet while some of the alps do not fall short of 14000 or 15000 and 8000 or 10000 is not an uncommon elevation our tracts of wood and water are almost diminutive in comparison therefore as far as sublimity is dependent upon absolute bulk and height and atmospherical influences in connection with these it is obvious that there can be no rivalship but a short residence among the british mountains will furnish abundant proof that after a certain point of elevation viz that which allows of compact and fleecy clouds settling upon or sweeping over the summits the sense of sublimity depends more upon form and relation of objects to each other than upon their actual magnitude and that an elevation of 3000 feet is sufficient to call forth in a most impressive degree the creative and magnifying and softening powers of the atmosphere hence on the score even of sublimity the superiority of the alps is by no means so great as might hastily be inferredand as to the beauty of the lower regions of the swiss mountains it is noticeablethat as they are all regularly mown their surface has nothing of that mellow tone and variety of hues by which mountain turf that is never touched by the scythe is distinguished on the smooth and steep slopes of the swiss hills these plots of verdure do indeed agreeably unite their colour with that of the deciduous trees or make a lively contrast with the dark green pinegroves that define them and among which they run in endless variety of shapesbut this is most pleasing at first sight the permanent gratification of the eye requires finer gradations of tone and a more delicate blending of hues into each other besides it is only in spring and late autumn that cattle animate by their presence the swiss lawns and though the pastures of the higher regions where they feed during the summer are left in their natural state of flowery herbage those pastures are so remote that their texture and colour are of no consequence in the composition of any picture in which a lake of the vales is a feature yet in those lofty regions how vegetation is invigorated by the genial climate of that country among the luxuriant flowers there met with groves or forests if i may so call them of monkshood are frequently seen the plant of deep rich blue and as tall as in our gardens and this at an elevation where in cumberland icelandic moss would only be found or the stony summits be utterly bare  we have then for the colouring of switzerland principally a vivid green herbage black woods and dazzling snows presented in masses with a grandeur to which no one can be insensible but not often graduated by nature into soothing harmony and so ill suited to the pencil that though abundance of good subjects may be there found they are not such as can be deemed characteristic of the country nor is this unfitness confined to colour the forms of the mountains though many of them in some points of view the noblest that can be conceived are apt to run into spikes and needles and present a jagged outline which has a mean effect transferred to canvass this must have been felt by the ancient masters for if i am not mistaken they have not left a single landscape the materials of which are taken from the peculiar features of the alps yet titian passed his life almost in their neighbourhood the poussins and claude must have been well acquainted with their aspects and several admirable painters as tibaldi and luino were born among the italian alps a few experiments have lately been made by englishmen but they only prove that courage skill and judgment may surmount any obstacles and it may be safely affirmed that they who have done best in this bold adventure will be the least likely to repeat the attempt but though our scenes are better suited to painting than those of the alps i should be sorry to contemplate either country in reference to that art further than as its fitness or unfitness for the pencil renders it more or less pleasing to the eye of the spectator who has learned to observe and feel chiefly from nature herself  deeming the points in which alpine imagery is superior to british too obvious to be insisted upon i will observe that the deciduous woods though in many places unapproachable by the axe and triumphing in the pomp and prodigality of nature have in general63 neither the variety nor beauty which would exist in those of the mountains of britain if left to themselves magnificent walnuttrees grow upon the plains of switzerland and fine trees of that species are found scattered over the hillsides birches also grow here and there in luxuriant beauty but neither these nor oaks are ever a prevailing tree nor can even be said to be common and the oaks as far as i had an opportunity of observing are greatly inferior to those of britain among the interior vallies the proportion of beeches and pines is so great that other trees are scarcely noticeable and surely such woods are at all seasons much less agreeable than that rich and harmonious distribution of oak ash elm birch and alder that formerly clothed the sides of snowdon and helvellyn and of which no mean remains still survive at the head of ulswater on the italian side of the alps chesnut and walnuttrees grow at a considerable height on the mountains but even there the foliage is not equal in beauty to the natural product of this climate in fact the sunshine of the south of europe so envied when heard of at a distance is in many respects injurious to rural beauty particularly as it incites to the cultivation of spots of ground which in colder climates would be left in the hands of nature favouring at the same time the culture of plants that are more valuable on account of the fruit they produce to gratify the palate than for affording pleasure to the eye as materials of landscape take for instance the promontory of bellagio so fortunate in its command of the three branches of the lake of como yet the ridge of the promontory itself being for the most part covered with vines interspersed with olivetrees accords but ill with the vastness of the green unappropriated mountains and derogates not a little from the sublimity of those finely contrasted pictures to which it is a foreground the vine when cultivated upon a large scale notwithstanding all that may be said of it in poetry64 makes but a dull formal appearance in landscape and the olivetree though one is loth to say so is not more grateful to the eye than our common willow which it much resembles but the hoariness of hue common to both has in the aquatic plant an appropriate delicacy harmonising with the situation in which it most delights the same may no doubt be said of the olive among the dry rocks of attica but i am speaking of it as found in gardens and vineyards in the north of italy at bellagio what englishman can resist the temptation of substituting in his fancy for these formal treasures of cultivation the natural variety of one of our parksits pastured lawns coverts of hawthorn of wildrose and honeysuckle and the majesty of forest treessuch wild graces as the banks of derwentwater shewed in the time of the ratcliffes and growbarrow park lowther and rydal do at this day  63 the greatest variety of trees is found in the valais  as my object is to reconcile a briton to the scenery of his own country though not at the expense of truth i am not afraid of asserting that in many points of view our lakes also are much more interesting than those of the alps first as is implied above from being more happily proportioned to the other features of the landscape and next both as being infinitely more pellucid and less subject to agitation from the winds65  64 lucretius has charmingly described a scene of this kind       inque dies magis in montem succedere sylvas      cogebant infráquo locum coucedere cultis      prata lacus rivos segetes vinetaque laeta      collibus et campis ut haberent atque olearum      caerula distinguens inter plaga currere posset      per

remarkable that como as is probably the case with other italian lakes is more troubled by storms in summer than in winter hence the propriety of the following verses       lari margine ubique confragoso      nulli coelicolum negas sacellum      picto pariete saxeoque tecto      hinc miracula multa navitarum      audis nee placido refellis ore      sed nova usque pavas noto vel euro

is disturbed by a periodical wind blowing from the head in the morning and towards it in the afternoon the magnificent lake of the four cantons especially its noblest division called the lake of uri is not only much agitated by winds but in the night time is disturbed from the bottom as i was told and indeed as i witnessed without any apparent commotion in the air and when at rest the water is not pure to the eye but of a heavy green hueas is that of all the other lakes apparently according to the degree in which they are fed by melted snows if the lake of geneva furnish an exception this is probably owing to its vast extent which allows the water to deposit its impurities the water of the english lakes on the contrary being of a crystalline clearness the reflections of the surrounding hills are frequently so lively that it is scarcely possible to distinguish the point where the real object terminates and its unsubstantial duplicate begins the lower part of the lake of geneva from its narrowness must be much less subject to agitation than the higher divisions and as the water is clearer than that of the other swiss lakes it will frequently exhibit this appearance though it is scarcely possible in an equal degree during two comprehensive tours among the alps i did not observe except on one of the smaller lakes between lugano and ponte tresa a single instance of those beautiful repetitions of surrounding objects on the bosom of the water which are so frequently seen here not to speak of the fine dazzling trembling network breezy motions and streaks and circles of intermingled smooth and rippled water which make the surface of our lakes a field of endless variety but among the alps where every thing tends to the grand and the sublime in surfaces as well as in forms if the lakes do not court the placid reflections of land objects those of firstrate magnitude make compensation in some degree by exhibiting those everchanging fields of green blue and purple shadows or lights one scarcely knows which to name them that call to mind a seaprospect contemplated from a lofty cliff  the subject of torrents and waterfalls has already been touched upon but it may be added that in switzerland the perpetual accompaniment of snow upon the higher regions takes much from the effect of foaming white streams while from their frequency they obstruct each others influence upon the mind of the spectator and in all cases the effect of an individual cataract excepting the great fall of the rhine at schaffhausen is diminished by the general fury of the stream of which it is a part  recurring to the reflections from still water i will describe a singular phenomenon of this kind of which i was an eyewitness  walking by the side of ulswater upon a calm september morning i saw deep within the bosom of the lake a magnificent castle with towers and battlements nothing could be more distinct than the whole edifice after gazing with delight upon it for some time as upon a work of enchantment i could not but regret that my previous knowledge of the place enabled me to account for the appearance it was in fact the reflection of a pleasurehouse called lyulphs towerthe towers and battlements magnified and so much changed in shape as not to be immediately recognised in the meanwhile the pleasurehouse itself was altogether hidden from my view by a body of vapour stretching over it and along the hillside on which it stands but not so as to have intercepted its communication with the lake and hence this novel and most impressive object which if i had been a stranger to the spot would from its being inexplicable have long detained the mind in a state of pleasing astonishment  appearances of this kind acting upon the credulity of early ages may have given birth to and favoured the belief in stories of subaqueous palaces gardens and pleasuregroundsthe brilliant ornaments of romance  with this inverted scene i will couple a much more extraordinary phenomenon which will show how other elegant fancies may have had their origin less in invention than in the actual processes of nature  about eleven oclock on the forenoon of a winters day coming suddenly in company of a friend into view of the lake of grasmere we were alarmed by the sight of a newlycreated island the transitory thought of the moment was that it had been produced by an earthquake or some other convulsion of nature recovering from the alarm which was greater than the reader can possibly sympathise with but which was shared to its full extent by my companion we proceeded to examine the object before us the elevation of this new island exceeded considerably that of the old one its neighbour it was likewise larger in circumference comprehending a space of about five acres its surface rocky speckled with snow and sprinkled over with birchtrees it was divided towards the south from the other island by a narrow frith and in like manner from the northern shore of the lake on the east and west it was separated from the shore by a much larger space of smooth water  marvellous was the illusion comparing the new with the old island the surface of which is soft green and unvaried i do not scruple to say that as an object of sight it was much the more distinct how little faith we exclaimed is due to one sense unless its evidence be confirmed by some of its fellows what stranger could possibly be persuaded that this which we know to be an unsubstantial mockery is really so and that there exists only a single island on this beautiful lake at length the appearance underwent a gradual transmutation it lost its prominence and passed into a glimmering and dim inversion and then totally disappeared leaving behind it a clear open area of ice of the same dimensions we now perceived that this bed of ice which was thinly suffused with water had produced the illusion by reflecting and refracting as persons skilled in optics would no doubt easily explain a rocky and woody section of the opposite mountain named silverhow  having dwelt so much upon the beauty of pure and still water and pointed out the advantage which the lakes of the north of england have in this particular over those of the alps it would be injustice not to advert to the sublimity that must often be given to alpine scenes by the agitations to which those vast bodies of diffused water are there subject i have witnessed many tremendous thunderstorms among the alps and the most glorious effects of light and shadow but i never happened to be present when any lake was agitated by those hurricanes which i imagine must often torment them if the commotions be at all proportionable to the expanse and depth of the waters and the height of the surrounding mountains then if i may judge from what is frequently seen here the exhibition must be awful and astonishingon this day march 30 1822 the winds have been acting upon the small lake of rydal as if they had received command to carry its waters from their bed into the sky the white billows in different quarters disappeared under clouds or rather drifts of spray that were whirled along and up into the air by scouring winds charging each other in squadrons in every direction upon the lake the spray having been hurried aloft till it lost its consistency and whiteness was driven along the mountain tops like flying showers that vanish in the distance frequently an eddying wind scooped the waters out of the basin and forced them upwards in the very shape of an icelandic geyser or boiling fountain to the height of several hundred feet  this small mere of rydal from its position is subject in a peculiar degree to these commotions the present season however is unusually stormygreat numbers of fish two of them not less than 12 pounds weight were a few days ago cast on the shores of derwentwater by the force of the waves  lest in the foregoing comparative estimate i should be suspected of partiality to my native mountains i will support my general opinion by the authority of mr west whose guide to the lakes has been eminently serviceable to the tourist for nearly 50 years the author a roman catholic clergyman had passed much time abroad and was well acquainted with the scenery of the continent he thus expresses himself they who intend to make the continental tour should begin here as it will give in miniature an idea of what they are to meet with there in traversing the alps and appenines to which our northern mountains are not inferior in beauty of line or variety of summit number of lakes and transparency of water not in colouring of rock or softness of turf but in height and extent only the mountains here are all accessible to the summit and furnish prospects no less surprising and with more variety than the alps themselves the tops of the highest alps are inaccessible being covered with everlasting snow which commencing at regular heights above the cultivated tracts or wooded and verdant sides form indeed the highest contrast in nature for there may be seen all the variety of climate in one view to this however we oppose the sight of the ocean from the summits of all the higher mountains as it appears intersected with promontories decorated with islands and animated with navigationwests guide p5     excursions to the top of scawfell and on the banks of ulswater   it was my intention several years ago to describe a regular tour through this country taking the different scenes in the most favourable order but after some progress had been made in the work it was abandoned from a conviction that if well executed it would lessen the pleasure of the traveller by anticipation and if the contrary it would mislead him the reader may not however be displeased with the following extract from a letter to a friend giving an account of a visit to a summit of one of the highest of these mountains of which i am reminded by the observations of mr west and by reviewing what has been said of this district in comparison with the alps  having left rosthwaite in borrowdale on a bright morning in the first week of october we ascended from seathwaite to the top of the ridge called ashcourse and thence beheld three distinct viewson one side the continuous vale of borrowdale keswick and bassenthwaitewith skiddaw helvellyn saddleback and numerous other mountainsand in the distance the solway frith and the mountains of scotlandon the other side and below us the langdale pikestheir own vale below themwindermereand far beyond windermere ingleborough in yorkshire but how shall i speak of the deliciousness of the third prospect at this time that was most favoured by sunshine and shade the green vale of eskdeep and green with its glittering serpent stream lay below us and on we looked to the mountains near the seablack comb preeminentand still beyond to the sea itself in dazzling brightness turning round we saw the mountains of wastdale in tumult to our right great gavel the loftiest a distinct and huge form though the middle of the mountain was to our eyes as its base  we had attained the object of this journey but our ambition now mounted higher we saw the summit of scawfell apparently very near to us and we shaped our course towards it but discovering that it could not be reached without first making a considerable descent we resolved instead to aim at another point of the same mountain called the pikes which i have since found has been estimated as higher than the summit bearing the name of scawfell head where the stone man is built  the sun had never once been overshadowed by a cloud during the whole of our progress from the centre of borrowdale on the summit of the pike which we gained after much toil though without difficulty there was not a breath of air to stir even the papers containing our refreshment as they lay spread out upon a rock the stillness seemed to be not of this worldwe paused and kept silence to listen and no sound could be heard the scawfell cataracts were voiceless to us and there was not an insect to hum in the air the vales which we had seen from ashcourse lay yet in view and side by side with eskdale we now saw the sister vale of donnerdale terminated by the duddon sands but the majesty of the mountains below and close to us is not to be conceived we now beheld the whole mass of great gavel from its basethe den of wastdale at our feeta gulf immeasurable grasmire and the other mountains of crummockennerdale and its mountains and the sea beyond we sat down to our repast and gladly would we have tempered our beverage for there was no spring or well near us with such a supply of delicious water as we might have procured had we been on the rival summit of great gavel for on its highest point is a small triangular receptacle in the native rock which the shepherds say is never dry there we might have slaked our thirst plenteously with a pure and celestial liquid for the cup or basin it appears has no other feeder than the dews of heaven the showers the vapours the hoar frost and the spotless snow  while we were gazing around look i exclaimed at yon ship upon the glittering sea is it a ship replied our shepherdguide it can be nothing else interposed my companion i cannot be mistaken i am so accustomed to the appearance of ships at sea the guide dropped the argument but before a minute was gone he quietly said now look at your ship it is changed into a horse so indeed it wasa horse with a gallant neck and head we laughed heartily and i hope when again inclined to be positive i may remember the ship and the horse upon the glittering sea and the calm confidence yet submissiveness of our wise man of the mountains who certainly had more knowledge of clouds than we whatever might be our knowledge of ships  i know not how long we might have remained on the summit of the pike without a thought of moving had not our guide warned us that we must not linger for a storm was coming we looked in vain to espy the signs of it mountains vales and sea were touched with the clear light of the sun it is there said he pointing to the sea beyond whitehaven and there we perceived a light vapour unnoticeable but by a shepherd accustomed to watch all mountain bodings we gazed around again and yet again unwilling to lose the remembrance of what lay before us in that lofty solitude and then prepared to depart meanwhile the air changed to cold and we saw that tiny vapour swelled into mighty masses of cloud which came boiling over the mountains great gavel helvellyn and skiddaw were wrapped in storm yet langdale and the mountains in that quarter remained all bright in sunshine soon the storm reached us we sheltered under a crag and almost as rapidly as it had come it passed away and left us free to observe the struggles of gloom and sunshine in other quarters langdale now had its share and the pikes of langdale were decorated by two splendid rainbows skiddaw also had his own rainbows before we again reached ashcourse every cloud had vanished from every summit  i ought to have mentioned that round the top of scawfellpike not a blade of grass is to be seen cushions or tufts of moss parched and brown appear between the huge blocks and stones that lie in heaps on all sides to a great distance like skeletons or bones of the earth not needed at the creation and there left to be covered with neverdying lichens which the clouds and dews nourish and adorn with colours of vivid and exquisite beauty flowers the most brilliant feathers and even gems scarcely surpass in colouring some of those masses of stone which no human eye beholds except the shepherd or traveller be led thither by curiosity and how seldom must this happen for the other eminence is the one visited by the adventurous stranger and the shepherd has no inducement to ascend the pike in quest of his sheep no food being there to tempt them  we certainly were singularly favoured in the weather for when we were seated on the summit our conductor turning his eyes thoughtfully round said i do not know that in my whole life i was ever at any season of the year so high upon the mountains on so calm a day it was the 7th of october afterwards we had a spectacle of the grandeur of earth and heaven commingled yet without terror we knew that the storm would pass awayfor so our prophetic guide had assured us  before we reached seathwaite in borrowdale a few stars had appeared and we pursued our way down the vale to rosthwaite by moonlight  scawfell and helvellyn being the two mountains of this region which will best repay the fatigue of ascending them the following verses may be here introduced with propriety they are from the authors miscellaneous poems   to  on her first ascent to the summit of helvellyn      inmate of a mountain dwelling     thou hast clomb aloft and gazed     from the watchtowers of helvellyn     awed delighted and amazed

which few are likely to ascend i am induced to subjoin an account of a short excursion through more accessible parts of the country made at a time when it is seldom seen but by the inhabitants as the journal was written for one acquainted with the general features of the country only those effects and appearances are dwelt upon which are produced by the changeableness of the atmosphere or belong to the season when the excursion was made  ad 1805on the 7th of november on a damp and gloomy morning we left grasmere vale intending to pass a few days on the banks of ullswater a mild and dry autumn had been unusually favourable to the preservation and beauty of foliage and far advanced as the season was the trees on the larger island of rydalmere retained a splendour which did not need the heightening of sunshine we noticed as we passed that the line of the grey rocky shore of that island shaggy with variegated bushes and shrubs and spotted and striped with purplish brown heath indistinguishably blending with its image reflected in the still water produced a curious resemblance both in form and colour to a richlycoated caterpillar as it might appear through a magnifying glass of extraordinary power the mists gathered as we went along but when we reached the top of kirkstone we were glad we had not been discouraged by the apprehension of bad weather though not able to see a hundred yards before us we were more than contented at such a time and in such a place every scattered stone the size of ones head becomes a companion near the top of the pass is the remnant of an old wall which magnified though obscured by the vapour might have been taken for a fragment of some monument of ancient grandeuryet that same pile of stones we had never before even observed this situation it must be allowed is not favourable to gaiety but a pleasing hurry of spirits accompanies the surprise occasioned by objects transformed dilated or distorted as they are when seen through such a medium many of the fragments of rock on the top and slopes of kirkstone and of similar places are fantastic enough in themselves but the full effect of such impressions can only be had in a state of weather when they are not likely to be sought for it was not till we had descended considerably that the fields of hartshope were seen like a lake tinged by the reflection of sunny clouds i mistook them for brotherswater but soon after we saw that lake gleaming faintly with a steelly brightnessthen as we continued to descend appeared the brown oaks and the birches of lively yellowand the cottagesand the lowly hall of hartshope with its long roof and ancient chimneys during great part of our way to patterdale we had rain or rather drizzling vapour for there was never a drop upon our hair or clothes larger than the smallest pearls upon a ladys ring  the following morning incessant rain till 11 oclock when the sky began to clear and we walked along the eastern shore of ullswater towards the farm of blowick the wind blew strong and drove the clouds forward on the side of the mountain above our headstwo stormstiffened black yewtrees fixed our notice seen through or under the edge of the flying mistsfour or five goats were bounding among the rocksthe sheep moved about more quietly or cowered beneath their sheltering places this is the only part of the country where goats are now found66 but this morning before we had seen these i was reminded of that picturesque animal by two rams of mountain breed both with ammonian horns and with beards majestic as that which michael angelo has given to his statue of mosesbut to return when our path had brought us to that part of the naked common which overlooks the woods and bushbesprinkled fields of blowick the lake clouds and mists were all in motion to the sound of sweeping windsthe church and cottages of patterdale scarcely visible or seen only by fits between the shifting vapours to the northward the scene was less visionaryplace fell steady and boldthe whole lake driving onward like a great riverwaves dancing round the small islands the house at blowick was the boundary of our walk and we returned lamenting to see a decaying and uncomfortable dwelling in a place where sublimity and beauty seemed to contend with each other but these regrets were dispelled by a glance on the woods that clothe the opposite steeps of the lake how exquisite was the mixture of sober and splendid hues the general colouring of the trees was brownrather that of ripe hazel nuts but towards the water there were yet beds of green and in the highest parts of the wood was abundance of yellow foliage which gleaming through a vapoury lustre reminded us of masses of clouds as you see them gathered together in the west and touched with the golden light of the setting sun  66 ad 1835 these also have disappeared  after dinner we walked up the vale i had never had an idea of its extent and width in passing along the public road on the other side we followed the path that leads from house to house two or three times it took us through some of those copses or groves that cover the little hillocks in the middle of the vale making an intricate and pleasing intermixture of lawn and wood our fancies could not resist the temptation and we fixed upon a spot for a cottage which we began to build and finished as easily as castles are raised in the airvisited the same spot in the evening i shall say nothing of the moonlight aspect of the situation which had charmed us so much in the afternoon but i wish you had been with us when in returning to our friends house we espied his ladys large white dog lying in the moonshine upon the round knoll under the old yewtree in the garden a romantic imagethe dark tree and its dark shadowand the elegant creature as fair as a spirit the torrents murmured softly the mountains down which they were falling did not to my sight furnish a background for this ossianic picture but i had a consciousness of the depth of the seclusion and that mountains were embracing us on all sides i saw not but i felt that they were there  friday november 9thrain as yesterday till 10 oclock when we took a boat to row down the lake the day improvedclouds and sunny gleams on the mountains in the large bay under place fell three fishermen were dragging a netpicturesque group beneath the high and bare crags a raven was seen aloft not hovering like the kite for that is not the habit of the bird but passing on with a straightforward perseverance and timing the motion of its wings to its own croaking the waters were agitated and the iron tone of the ravens voice which strikes upon the ear at all times as the more dolorous from its regularity was in fine keeping with the wild scene before our eyes this carnivorous fowl is a great enemy to the lambs of these solitudes i recollect frequently seeing when a boy bunches of unfledged ravens suspended from the churchyard gates of h for which a reward of so much a head was given to the adventurous destroyerthe fishermen drew their net ashore and hundreds of fish were leaping in their prison they were all of the kind called skellies a sort of freshwater herring shoals of which may sometimes be seen dimpling or rippling the surface of the lake in calm weather this species is not found i believe in any other of these lakes nor as far as i know is the chevin that spiritless fish though i am loth to call it so for it was a prime favourite with isaac walton which must frequent ullswater as i have seen a large shoal passing into the lake from the river eamont here are no pike and the char are smaller than those of the other lakes and of inferior quality but the grey trout attains a very large size sometimes weighing above twenty pounds this lordly creature seems to know that retiredness is a piece of majesty for it is scarcely ever caught or even seen except when it quits the depths of the lake in the spawning season and runs up into the streams where it is too often destroyed in disregard of the law of the land and of nature  quitted the boat in the bay of sandwyke and pursued our way towards martindale along a pleasant pathat first through a coppice bordering the lake then through green fieldsand came to the village if village it may be called for the houses are few and separated from each other a sequestered spot shut out from the view of the lake crossed the onearched bridge below the chapel with its bare ring of mossy wall and single yewtree at the last house in the dale we were greeted by the master who was sitting at his door with a flock of sheep collected round him for the purpose of smearing them with tar according to the custom of the season for protection against the winters cold he invited us to enter and view a room built by mr hasell for the accommodation of his friends at the annual chase of red deer in his forests at the head of these dales the room is fitted up in the sportsmans style with a cupboard for bottles and glasses with strong chairs and a diningtable and ornamented with the horns of the stags caught at these hunts for a succession of yearsthe length of the last race each had run being recorded under his spreading antlers the good woman treated us with oaten cake new and crisp and after this welcome refreshment and rest we proceeded on our return to patterdale by a short cut over the mountains on leaving the fields of sandwyke while ascending by a gentle slope along the valley of martindale we had occasion to observe that in thinlypeopled glens of this character the general want of wood gives a peculiar interest to the scattered cottages embowered in sycamore towards its head this valley splits into two parts and in one of these that to the left there is no house nor any building to be seen but a cattleshed on the side of a hill which is sprinkled over with trees evidently the remains of an extensive forest near the entrance of the other division stands the house where we were entertained and beyond the enclosures of that farm there are no other a few old trees remain relics of the forest a little stream hastens though with serpentine windings through the uncultivated hollow where many cattle were pasturing the cattle of this country are generally white or lightcoloured but these were dark brown or black which heightened the resemblance this scene bears to many parts of the highlands of scotlandwhile we paused to rest upon the hillside though well contented with the quiet everyday soundsthe lowing of cattle bleating of sheep and the very gentle murmuring of the valley stream we could not but think what a grand effect the music of the buglehorn would have among these mountains it is still heard once every year at the chase i have spoken of a day of festivity for the inhabitants of this district except the poor deer the most ancient of them all our ascent even to the top was very easy when it was accomplished we had exceedingly fine views some of the lofty fells being resplendent with sunshine and others partly shrouded by clouds ullswater bordered by black steeps was of dazzling brightness the plain beyond penrith smooth and bright or rather gleamy as the sea or sea sands looked down into boardale which like stybarrow has been named from the wild swine that formerly abounded here but it has now no sylvan covert being smooth and bare a long narrow deep cradleshaped glen lying so sheltered that one would be pleased to see it planted by human hands there being a sufficiency of soil and the trees would be sheltered almost like shrubs in a greenhouseafter having walked some way along the top of the hill came in view of glenriddin and the mountains at the head of grisdalebefore we began to descend turned aside to a small ruin called at this day the chapel where it is said the inhabitants of martindale and patterdale were accustomed to assemble for worship there are now no traces from which you could infer for what use the building had been erected the loose stones and the few which yet continue piled up resemble those which lie elsewhere on the mountain but the shape of the building having been oblong its remains differ from those of a common sheepfold and it has stood east and west scarcely did the druids when they fled to these fastnesses perform their rites in any situation more exposed to disturbance from the elements one cannot pass by without being reminded that the rustic psalmody must have had the accompaniment of many a wildlywhistling blast and what dismal storms must have often drowned the voice of the preacher as we descend patterdale opens upon the eye in grand simplicity screened by mountains and proceeding from two heads deepdale and hartshope where lies the little lake of brotherswater named in old maps broaderwater and probably rightly so for bassenthwaitemere at this day is familiarly called broadwater but the change in the appellation of this small lake or pool if it be a corruption may have been assisted by some melancholy accident similar to what happened about twenty years ago when two brothers were drowned there having gone out to take their holiday pleasure upon the ice on a newyears day  a rough and precipitous peat track brought us down to our friends houseanother fine moonlight night but a thick fog rising from the neighbouring river enveloped the rocky and woodcrested knoll on which our fancy cottage had been erected and under the damp cast upon my feelings i consoled myself with moralising on the folly of hasty decisions in matters of importance and the necessity of having at least one years knowledge of a place before you realise airy suggestions in solid stone  saturday november 10that the breakfasttable tidings reached us of the death of lord nelson and of the victory at trafalgar sequestered as we were from the sympathy of a crowd we were shocked to hear that the bells had been ringing joyously at penrith to celebrate the triumph in the rebellion of the year 1745 people fled with their valuables from the open country to patterdale as a place of refuge secure from the incursions of strangers at that time news such as we had heard might have been long in penetrating so far into the recesses of the mountains but now as you know the approach is easy and the communication in summer time almost hourly nor is this strange for travellers after pleasure are become not less active and more numerous than those who formerly left their homes for purposes of gain the priest on the banks of the remotest stream of lapland will talk familiarly of buonapartes last conquests and discuss the progress of the french revolution having acquired much of his information from adventurers impelled by curiosity alone  the morning was clear and cheerful after a night of sharp frost at 10 oclock we took our way on foot towards pooley bridge on the same side of the lake we had coasted in a boat the day beforelooked backwards to the south from our favourite station above blowick the dazzling sunbeams striking upon the church and village while the earth was steaming with exhalations not traceable in other quarters rendered their forms even more indistinct than the partial and flitting veil of unillumined vapour had done two days before the grass on which we trod and the trees in every thicket were dripping with melted hoarfrost we observed the lemoncoloured leaves of the birches as the breeze turned them to the sun sparkle or rather flash like diamonds and the leafless purple twigs were tipped with globes of shining crystal  the day continued delightful and unclouded to the end i will not describe the country which we slowly travelled through nor relate our adventures and will only add that on the afternoon of the 13th we returned along the banks of ullswater by the usual road the lake lay in deep repose after the agitations of a wet and stormy morning the trees in gowbarrow park were in that state when what is gained by the disclosure of their bark and branches compensates almost for the loss of foliage exhibiting the variety which characterises the point of time between autumn and winter the hawthorns were leafless their round heads covered with rich scarlet berries and adorned with arches of green brambles and eglantines hung with glossy hips and the grey trunks of some of the ancient oaks which in the summer season might have been regarded only for their venerable majesty now attracted notice by a pretty embellishment of green mosses and fern intermixed with russet leaves retained by those slender outstarting twigs which the veteran tree would not have tolerated in his strength the smooth silver branches of the ashes were bare most of the alders as green as the devonshire cottagemyrtle that weathers the snows of christmaswill you accept it as some apology for my having dwelt so long on the woodland ornaments of these scenesthat artists speak of the trees on the banks of ullswater and especially along the bays of stybarrow crags as having a peculiar character of picturesque intricacy in their stems and branches which their rocky stations and the mountain winds have combined to give them  at the end of gowbarrow park a large herd of deer were either moving slowly or standing still among the fern i was sorry when a chancecompanion who had joined us by the way startled them with a whistle disturbing an image of grave simplicity and thoughtful enjoyment for i could have fancied that those natives of this wild and beautiful region were partaking with us a sensation of the solemnity of the closing day the sun had been set some time and we could perceive that the light was fading away from the coves of helvellyn but the lake under a luminous sky was more brilliant than before  after tea at patterdale set out againa fine evening the seven stars close to the mountaintop all the stars seemed brighter than usual the steeps were reflected in brotherswater and above the lake appeared like enormous black perpendicular walls the kirkstone torrents had been swoln by the rains and now filled the mountain pass with their roaring which added greatly to the solemnity of our walk behind us when we had climbed to a great height we saw one light very distinct in the vale like a large red stara solitary one in the gloomy region the cheerfulness of the scene was in the sky above us  reached home a little before midnight the following verses from the authors miscellaneous poems after what has just been

october 12th 1844  the degree and kind of attachment which many of the yeomanry feel to their small inheritances can scarcely be overrated near the house of one of them stands a magnificent tree which a neighbour of the owner advised him to fell for profits sake fell it exclaimed the yeoman i had rather fall on my knees and worship it it happens i believe that the intended railway would pass through this little property and i hope that an apology for the answer will not be thought necessary by one who enters into the strength of the feeling  ww  kendal and windermere railway                                       no i       to the editor of the morning post  sir  some little time ago you did me the favour of inserting a sonnet expressive of the regret and indignation which in common with others all over these islands i felt at the proposal of a railway to extend from kendal to low wood near the head of windermere the project was so offensive to a large majority of the proprietors through whose lands the line after it came in view of the lake was to pass that for this reason and the avowed one of the heavy expense without which the difficulties in the way could not be overcome it has been partially abandoned and the terminus is now announced to be at a spot within a mile of bowness but as no guarantee can be given that the project will not hereafter be revived and an attempt made to carry the line forward through the vales of ambleside and grasmere and as in one main particular the case remains essentially the same allow me to address you upon certain points which merit more consideration than the favourers of the scheme have yet given them the matter though seemingly local is really one in which all persons of taste must be interested and therefore i hope to be excused if i venture to treat it at some length  i shall barely touch upon the statistics of the question leaving these to the two adverse parties who will lay their several statements before the board of trade which may possibly be induced to refer the matter to the house of commons and contemplating that possibility i hope that the observations i have to make may not be altogether without influence upon the public and upon individuals whose duty it may be to decide in their place whether the proposed measure shall be referred to a committee of the house were the case before us an ordinary one i should reject such an attempt as presumptuous and futile but it is not only different from all others but in truth peculiar  in this district the manufactures are trifling mines it has none and its quarries are either wrought out or superseded the soil is light and the cultivateable parts of the country are very limited so that it has little to send out and little has it also to receive summer tourists and the very word precludes the notion of a railway it has in abundance but the inhabitants are so few and their intercourse with other places so infrequent that one daily coach which could not be kept going but through its connection with the postoffice suffices for threefourths of the year along the line of country as far as keswick the staple of the district is in fact its beauty and its character of seclusion and retirement and to these topics and to others connected with them my remarks shall be confined  the projectors have induced many to favour their schemes by declaring that one of their main objects is to place the beauties of the lake district within easier reach of those who cannot afford to pay for ordinary conveyances look at the facts railways are completed which joined with others in rapid progress will bring travellers who prefer approaching by ullswater to within four miles of that lake the lancaster and carlisle railway will approach the town of kendal about eight or nine miles from eminences that command the whole vale of windermere the lakes are therefore at present of very easy access for all persons but if they be not made still more so the poor it is said will be wronged before this be admitted let the question be fairly looked into and its different bearings examined no one can assert that if this intended mode of approach be not effected anything will be taken away that is actually possessed the wrong if any must lie in the unwarrantable obstruction of an attainable benefit first then let us consider the probable amount of that benefit  elaborate gardens with topiary works were in high request even among our remote ancestors but the relish for choice and picturesque natural scenery a poor and mean word which requires an apology but will be generally understood is quite of recent origin our earlier travellersray the naturalist one of the first men of his agebishop burnet and others who had crossed the alps or lived some time in switzerland are silent upon the sublimity and beauty of those regions and burnet even uses these words speaking of the grisonswhen they have made up estates elsewhere they are glad to leave italy and the best parts of germany and to come and live among those mountains of which the very sight is enough to fill a man with horror the accomplished evelyn giving an account of his journey from italy through the alps dilates upon the terrible the melancholy and the uncomfortable but till he comes to the fruitful country in the neighbourhood of geneva not a syllable of delight or praise in the sacra telluris theoria of the other burnet there is a passageomitted however in his own english translation of the workin which he gives utterance to his sensations when from a particular spot he beheld a tract of the alps rising before him on the one hand and on the other the mediterranean sea spread beneath him nothing can be worthier of the magnificent appearances he describes than his language in a noble strain also does the poet gray address in a latin ode the religio loci at the grande chartruise but before his time with the exception of the passage from thomas burnet just alluded to there is not i believe a single english traveller whose published writings would disprove the assertion that where precipitous rocks and mountains are mentioned at all they are spoken of as objects of dislike and fear and not of admiration even gray himself describing in his journal the steeps at the entrance of borrowdale expresses his terror in the language of dantelet us not speak of them but look and pass on in my youth i lived some time in the vale of keswick under the roof of a shrewd and sensible woman who more than once exclaimed in my hearing bless me folk are always talking about prospects when i was young there was never sic a thing neamed in fact our ancestors as every where appears in choosing the site of their houses looked only at shelter and convenience especially of water and often would place a barn or any other outhouse directly in front of their habitations however beautiful the landscape which their windows might otherwise have commanded the first house that was built in the lake district for the sake of the beauty of the country was the work of a mr english who had travelled in italy and chose for his site some eighty years ago the great island of windermere but it was sold before his building was finished and he showed how little he was capable of appreciating the character of the situation by setting up a length of high gardenwall as exclusive as it was ugly almost close to the house the nuisance was swept away when the late mr curwen became the owner of this favoured spot mr english was followed by mr pocklington a native of nottinghamshire who played strange pranks by his buildings and plantations upon vicars island in derwentwater which his admiration such as it was of the country and probably a wish to be a leader in a new fashion had tempted him to purchase but what has all this to do with the subjectwhy to show that a vivid perception of romantic scenery is neither inherent in mankind nor a necessary consequence of even a comprehensive education it is benignly ordained that green fields clear blue skies running streams of pure water rich groves and woods orchards and all the ordinary varieties of rural nature should find an easy way to the affections of all men and more or less so from early childhood till the senses are impaired by old age and the sources of mere earthly enjoyment have in a great measure failed but a taste beyond this however desirable it may be that every one should possess it is not to be implanted at once it must be gradually developed both in nations and individuals rocks and mountains torrents and widespread waters and all those features of nature which go to the composition of such scenes as this part of england is distinguished for cannot in their finer relations to the human mind be comprehended or even very imperfectly conceived without processes of culture or opportunities of observation in some degree habitual in the eye of thousands and tens of thousands a rich meadow with fat cattle grazing upon it or the sight of what they would call a heavy crop of corn is worth all that the alps and pyrenees in their utmost grandeur and beauty could show to them and notwithstanding the grateful influence as we have observed of ordinary nature and the productions of the fields it is noticeable what trifling conventional prepossessions will in common minds not only preclude pleasure from the sight of natural beauty but will even turn it into an object of disgust if i had to do with this garden said a respectable person one of my neighbours i would sweep away all the black and dirty stuff from that wall the wall was backed by a bank of earth and was exquisitely decorated with ivy flowers moss and ferns such as grow of themselves in like places but the mere notion of fitness associated with a trim gardenwall prevented in this instance all sense of the spontaneous bounty and delicate care of nature in the midst of a small pleasureground immediately below my house rises a detached rock equally remarkable for the beauty of its form the ancient oaks that grow out of it and the flowers and shrubs which adorn it what a nice place would this be said a manchester tradesman pointing to the rock if that ugly lump were but out of the way men as little advanced in the pleasure which such objects give to others are so far from being rare that they may be said fairly to represent a large majority of mankind this is a fact and none but the deceiver and the willingly deceived can be offended by its being stated but as a more susceptible taste is undoubtedly a great acquisition and has been spreading among us for some years the question is what means are most likely to be beneficial in extending its operation surely that good is not to be obtained by transferring at once uneducated persons in large bodies to particular spots where the combinations of natural objects are such as would afford the greatest pleasure to those who have been in the habit of observing and studying the peculiar character of such scenes and how they differ one from another instead of tempting artisans and labourers and the humbler classes of shopkeepers to ramble to a distance let us rather look with lively sympathy upon persons in that condition when upon a holiday or on the sunday after having attended divine worship they make little excursions with their wives and children among neighbouring fields whither the whole of each family might stroll or be conveyed at much less cost than would be required to take a single individual of the number to the shores of windermere by the cheapest conveyance it is in some such way as this only that persons who must labour daily with their hands for bread in large towns or are subject to confinement through the week can be trained to a profitable intercourse with nature where she is the most distinguished by the majesty and sublimity of her forms  for further illustration of the subject turn to what we know of a man of extraordinary genius who was bred to hard labour in agricultural employments burns the poet when he had become distinguished by the publication of a volume of verses and was enabled to travel by the profit his poems brought him he made a tour in the course of which as his companion dr adair tells us he visited scenes inferior to none in scotland in beauty sublimity and romantic interest and the doctor having noticed with other companions that he seemed little moved upon one occasion by the sight of such a scene saysi doubt if he had much taste for the picturesque the personal testimony however upon this point is conflicting but when dr currie refers to certain local poems as decisive proofs that burns fellowtraveller was mistaken the biographer is surely unfortunate how vague and tame are the poets expressions in those few local poems compared with his language when he is describing objects with which his position in life allowed him to be familiar it appears both from what his works contain and from what is not to be found in them that sensitive as they abundantly prove his mind to have been in its intercourse with common rural images and with the general powers of nature exhibited in storm and in stillness in light or darkness and in the various aspects of the seasons he was little affected by the sight of one spot in preference to another unless where it derived an interest from history tradition or local associations he lived many years in nithsdale where he was in daily sight of skiddaw yet he never crossed the solway for a better acquaintance with that mountain and i am persuaded that if he had been induced to ramble among our lakes by that time sufficiently celebrated he would have seldom been more excited than by some ordinary scottish stream or hill with a tradition attached to it or which had been the scene of a favourite ballad or love song if all this be truly said of such a man and the like cannot be denied of the eminent individuals before named who to great natural talents added the accomplishments of scholarship or science then what ground is there for maintaining that the poor are treated with disrespect or wrong done to them or any class of visitants if we be reluctant to introduce a railway into this country for the sake of lessening by eight or nine miles only the fatigue or expense of their journey to windermereand wherever any one among the labouring classes has made even an approach to the sensibility which drew a lamentation from burns when he had uprooted a daisy with his plough and caused him to turn the weederclips aside from the thistle and spare the symbol dear of his country then surely such a one could he afford by any means to travel as far as kendal would not grudge a two hours walk across the skirts of the beautiful country that he was desirous of visiting  the widespread waters of these regions are in their nature peaceful so are thesteep mountains and the rocky glens nor can they be profitably enjoyed but by a mind disposed to peace go to a pantomime a farce or a puppetshow if you want noisy pleasurethe crowd of spectators who partake your enjoyment will by their presence and acclamations enhance it but may those who have given proof that they prefer other gratifications continue to be safe from the molestation of cheap trains pouring out their hundreds at a time along the margin of windermere nor let any one be liable to the charge of being selfishly disregardful of the poor and their innocent and salutary enjoyments if he does not congratulate himself upon the especial benefit which would thus be conferred on such a concourse      o nature a thy shows an forms     to feeling pensive hearts hae charms  so exclaimed the ayrshire ploughman speaking of ordinary rural nature under the varying influences of the seasons and the sentiment has found an echo in the bosoms of thousands in as humble a condition as he himself was when he gave vent to it but then they were feeling pensive hearts men who would be among the first to lament the facility with which they had approached this region by a sacrifice of so much of its quiet and beauty as from the intrusion of a railway would be inseparable what can in truth be more absurd than that either rich or poor should be spared the trouble of travelling by the high roads over so short a space according to their respective means if the unavoidable consequence must be a great disturbance of the retirement and in many places a destruction of the beauty of the country which the parties are come in search of would not this be pretty much like the childs cutting up his drum to learn where the sound came from  having i trust given sufficient reason for the belief that the imperfectly educated classes are not likely to draw much good from rare visits to the lakes performed in this way and surely on their own account it is not desirable that the visits should be frequent let us glance at the mischief which such facilities would certainly produce the directors of railway companies are always ready to devise or encourage entertainments for tempting the humbler classes to leave their homes accordingly for the profit of the shareholders and that of the lower class of innkeepers we should have wrestling matches horse and boat races without number and pothouses and beershops would keep pace with these excitements and recreations most of which might too easily be had elsewhere the injury which would thus be done to morals both among this influx of strangers and the lower class of inhabitants is obvious and supposing such extraordinary temptations not to be held out there cannot be a doubt that the sabbath day in the towns of bowness and ambleside and other parts of the district would be subject to much additional desecration  whatever comes of the scheme which we have endeavoured to discountenance the charge against its opponents of being selfishly regardless of the poor ought to cease the cry has been raised and kept up by three classes of personsthey who wish to bring into discredit all such as stand in the way of their gains or gambling speculations they who are dazzled by the application of physical science to the useful arts and indiscriminately applaud what they call the spirit of the age as manifested in this way and lastly those persons who are ever ready to step forward in what appears to them to be the cause of the poor but not always with becoming attention to particulars i am well aware that upon the first class what has been said will be of no avail but upon the two latter some impression will i trust be made  to conclude the railway power we know well will not admit of being materially counteracted by sentiment and who would wish it where large towns are connected and the interests of trade and agriculture are substantially promoted by such mode of intercommunication but be it remembered that this case is as has been said before a peculiar one and that the staple of the country is its beauty and its character of retirement let then the beauty be undisfigured and the retirement unviolated unless there be reason for believing that rights and interests of a higher kind and more apparent than those which have been urged in behalf of the projected intrusion will compensate the sacrifice thanking you for the judicious observations that have appeared in your paper upon the subject of railways       i remain sir         your obliged             wm wordsworth  rydal mount dec 9 1844  noteto the instances named in this letter of the indifference even of men of genius to the sublime forms of nature in mountainous districts the author of the interesting essays in the morning post entitled table talk has justly added goldsmith and i give the passage in his own words  the simple and gentlehearted goldsmith who had an exquisite sense of rural beauty in the familiar forms of hill and dale and meadows with their hawthornscented hedges does not seem to have dreamt of any such thing as beauty in the swiss alps though he traversed them on foot and had therefore the best opportunities of observing them in his poem the traveller he describes the swiss as loving their mountain homes not by reason of the romantic beauty of the situation but in spite of the miserable character of the soil and the stormy horrors of their mountain steeps                        turn we to survey     where rougher climes a nobler race display     where the bleak swiss their stormy mansion tread     and force a churlish soil for scanty bread     no produce here the barren hills afford     but man and steel the soldier and his sword     no vernal blooms their torpid rocks array     but winter lingering chills the lap of may     no zephyr fondly sues the mountains breast     but meteors glare and stormy glooms invest     yet still even here content can spread a charm     redress the clime and all its rage disarm  in the same essay december 18th 1844 are many observations judiciously bearing upon the true character of this and similar projects   no ii  to the editor of the morning post  sir  as you obligingly found space in your journal for observations of mine upon the intended kendal and windermere railway i venture to send you some further remarks upon the same subject the scope of the main argument it will be recollected was to prove that the perception of what has acquired the name of picturesque and romantic scenery is so far from being intuitive that it can be produced only by a slow and gradual process of culture and to show as a consequence that the humbler ranks of society are not and cannot be in a state to gain material benefit from a more speedy access than they now have to this beautiful region some of our opponents dissent from this latter proposition though the most judicious of them readily admit the former but then overlooking not only positive assertions but reasons carefully given they say as you allow that a more comprehensive taste is desirable you ought to side with us and they illustrate their position by reference to the british museum and national picture gallery there they add thanks to the easy entrance now granted numbers are seen indicating by their dress and appearance their humble condition who when admitted for the first time stare vacantly around them so that one is inclined to ask what brought them hither but an impression is made something gained which may induce them to repeat the visit until light breaks in upon them and they take an intelligent interest in what they behold persons who talk thus forget that to produce such an improvement frequent access at small cost of time and labour is indispensable manchester lies perhaps within eight hours railway distance of london but surely no one would advise that manchester operatives should contract a habit of running to and fro between that town and london for the sake of forming an intimacy with the british museum and national gallery no no little would all but a very few gain from the opportunities which consistently with common sense could be afforded them for such expeditions nor would it fare better with them in respect of trips to the lake district an assertion the truth of which no one can doubt who has learned by experience how many men of the same or higher rank living from their birth in this very region are indifferent to those objects around them in which a cultivated taste takes so much pleasure i should not have detained the reader so long upon this point had i not heard glad tidings for the directors and traffickers in shares that among the affluent and benevolent manufacturers of yorkshire and lancashire are some who already entertain the thought of sending at their own expense large bodies of their workmen by railway to the banks of windermere surely those gentlemen will think a little more before they put such a scheme into practice the rich man cannot benefit the poor nor the superior the inferior by anything that degrades him packing off men after this fashion for holiday entertainment is in fact treating them like children they go at the will of their master and must return at the same or they will be dealt with as transgressors  a poor man speaking of his son whose time of service in the army was expired once said to me the reader will be startled at the expression and i indeed was greatly shocked by it i am glad he has done with that mean way of life but i soon gathered what was at the bottom of the feeling the father overlooked all the glory that attaches to the character of a british soldier in the consciousness that his sons will must have been in so great a degree subject to that of others the poor man felt where the true dignity of his species lay namely in a just proportion between actions governed by a mans own inclinations and those of other men but according to the fathers notion that proportion did not exist in the course of life from which his son had been released had the old man known from experience the degree of liberty allowed to the common soldier and the moral effect of the obedience required he would have thought differently and had he been capable of extending his views he would have felt how much of the best and noblest part of our civic spirit was owing to our military and naval institutions and that perhaps our very existence as a free people had by them been maintained this extreme instance has been adduced to show how deeply seated in the minds of englishmen is their sense of personal independence mastermanufacturers ought never to lose sight of this truth let them consent to a ten hours bill with little or if possible no diminution of wages and the necessaries of life being more easily procured the mind will develope itself accordingly and each individual would be more at liberty to make at his own cost excursions in any direction which might be most inviting to him there would then be no need for their masters sending them in droves scores of miles from their homes and families to the borders of windermere or anywhere else consider also the state of the lake district and look in the first place at the little town of bowness in the event of such railway inundations what would become of it in this not the retreat but the advance of the ten thousand leeds i am told has sent as many at once to scarborough we should have the whole of lancashire and no small part of yorkshire pouring in upon us to meet the men of durham and the borderers from cumberland and northumberland alas alas if the lakes are to pay this penalty for their own attractions      vane could tell what ills from beauty spring     and sedley cursed the form that pleased a king  the fear of adding to the length of my last long letter prevented me from entering into details upon private and personal feelings among the residents who have cause to lament the threatened intrusion these are not matters to be brought before a board of trade though i trust there will always be of that board members who know well that as we do not live by bread alone so neither do we live by political economy alone of the present board i would gladly believe there is not one who if his duty allowed it would not be influenced by considerations of what may be felt by a gallant officer now serving on the coast of south america when he shall learn that the nuisance though not intended actually to enter his property will send its omnibuses as fast as they can drive within a few yards of his modest abode which he built upon a small domain purchased at a price greatly enhanced by the privacy and beauty of the situation professor wilson him i take the liberty to name though a native of scotland and familiar with the grandeur of his own country could not resist the temptation of settling long ago among our mountains the place which his public duties have compelled him to quit as a residence and may compel him to part with is probably dearer to him than any spot upon earth the reader should be informed with what respect he has been treated engineer agents to his astonishment came and intruded with their measuring instruments upon his garden he saw them and who will not admire the patience that kept his hands from their shoulders i must stop  but with the fear before me of the line being carried at a day not distant through the whole breadth of the district i could dwell with much concern for other residents upon the condition which they would be in if that outrage should be committed nor ought it to be deemed impertinent were i to recommend this point to the especial regard of members of parliament who may have to decide upon the question the two houses of legislature have frequently shown themselves not unmindful of private feeling in these matters they have in some cases been induced to spare parks and pleasure grounds but along the great railway lines these are of rare occurrence they are but a part and a small part here it is far otherwise among the ancient inheritances of the yeomen surely worthy of high respect are interspersed through the entire district villas most of them with such small domains attached that the occupants would be hardly less annoyed by a railway passing through their neighbours ground than through their own and it would be unpardonable not to advert to the effect of this measure on the interests of the very poor in this locality with the town of bowness i have no minute acquaintance but of ambleside grasmere and the neighbourhood i can testify from long experience that they have been favoured by the residence of a gentry whose love of retirement has been a blessing to these vales for their families have ministered and still minister to the temporal and spiritual necessities of the poor and have personally superintended the education of the children in a degree which does those benefactors the highest honour and which is i trust gratefully acknowledged in the hearts of all whom they have relieved employed and taught many of those friends of our poor would quit this country if the apprehended change were realised and would be succeeded by strangers not linked to the neighbourhood but flitting to and fro between their fancy villas and the homes where their wealth was accumulated and accumulating by trade and manufactures it is obvious that persons so unsettled whatever might be their good wishes and readiness to part with money for charitable purposes would ill supply the loss of the inhabitants who had been driven away  it will be felt by those who think with me upon this occasion that i have been writing on behalf of a social condition which no one who is competent to judge of it will be willing to subvert and that i have been endeavouring to support moral sentiments and intellectual pleasures of a high order against an enmity which seems growing more and more formidable every day i mean utilitarianism serving as a mask for cupidity and gambling speculations my business with this evil lies in its reckless mode of action by railways now its favourite instruments upon good authority i have been told that there was lately an intention of driving one of these pests as they are likely too often to prove through a part of the magnificent ruins of furness abbeyan outrage which was prevented by some one pointing out how easily a deviation might be made and the hint produced its due effect upon the engineer  sacred as that relic of the devotion of our ancestors deserves to be kept there are temples of nature temples built by the almighty which have a still higher claim to be left unviolated almost every reach of the winding vales in this district might once have presented itself to a man of imagination and feeling under that aspect or as the vale of grasmere appeared to the poet gray more than seventy years ago no flaring gentlemanshouse says he nor gardenwalls break in upon the repose of this little unsuspected paradise but all is peace c c were the poet now living how would he have lamented the probable intrusion of a railway with its scarifications its intersections its noisy machinery its smoke and swarms of pleasurehunters most of them thinking that they do not fly fast enough through the country which they have come to see even a broad highway may in some places greatly impair the characteristic beauty of the country as will be readily acknowledged by those who remember what the lake of grasmere was before the new road that runs along its eastern margin had been constructed                      quanto praestantias esset     numen aquae viridi si margina clauderet undas     herba  as it once was and fringed with wood instead of the breastwork of bare wall that now confines it in the same manner has the beauty and still more the sublimity of many passes in the alps been injuriously affected will the reader excuse a quotation from a ms poem in which i attempted to describe the impression made upon my mind by the descent towards italy along the simplon before the new military road had taken the place of the old muleteer track with its primitive simplicities                              brook and road     were fellowtravellers in this gloomy pass     and with them did we journey several hours     at a slow step the immeasurable height     of woods decaying never to be decayed     the stationary blasts of waterfalls     and in the narrow rent at every turn     winds thwarting winds bewildered and forlorn     the torrents shooting from the clear blue sky     the rocks that muttered close upon our ears     black drizzling crags that spake by the wayside     as if a voice were in them the sick sight     and giddy prospect of the raving stream     the unfettered clouds and region of the heavens     tumult and peace the darkness and the light     were all like workings of one mind the features     of the same face blossoms upon one tree     characters of the great apocalypse     the types and symbols of eternity     of first and last and midst and without end                                                    1799  thirty years afterwards i crossed the alps by the same pass and what had become of the forms and powers to which i had been indebted for those emotions many of them remained of course undestroyed and indestructible but though the road and torrent continued to run parallel to each other their fellowship was put an end to the stream had dwindled into comparative insignificance so much had art interfered with and taken the lead of nature and although the utility of the new work as facilitating the intercourse of great nations was readily acquiesced in and the workmanship in some places could not but excite admiration it was impossible to suppress regret for what had vanished for ever the oratories heretofore not unfrequently met with on a road still somewhat perilous were gone the simple and rude bridges swept away and instead of travellers proceeding with leisure to observe and feel were pilgrims of fashion hurried along in their carriages not a few of them perhaps discussing the merits of the last new novel or poring over their guidebooks or fast asleep similar remarks might be applied to the mountainous country of wales but there too the plea of utility especially as expediting the communication between england and ireland more than justifies the labours of the engineer not so would it be with the lake district a railroad is already planned along the sea coast and another from lancaster to carlisle is in great forwardness an intermediate one is therefore to say the least of it superfluous once for all let me declare that it is not against railways but against the abuse of them that i am contending  how far i am from undervaluing the benefit to be expected from railways in their legitimate application will appear from the following lines published in 1837 and composed some years earlier  steamboats and railways      motions and means on sea on land at war     with old poetic feeling not for this     shall ye by poets even be judged amiss     nor shall your presence howsoeer it mar     the loveliness of nature prove a bar     to the minds gaining that prophetic sense     of future good that point of vision whence     may be discovered what in soul ye are     in spite of all that beauty must disown     in your harsh features nature doth embrace     her lawful offspring in mans art and time     pleased with your triumphs oer his brother space     accepts from your bold hand the proffered crown     of hope and welcomes you with cheer sublime  i have now done with the subject the time of life at which i have arrived may i trust if nothing else will guard me from the imputation of having written from any selfish interests or from fear of disturbance which a railway might cause to myself if gratitude for what repose and quiet in a district hitherto for the most part not disfigured but beautified by human hands have done for me through the course of a long life and hope that others might hereafter be benefited in the same manner and in the same country be selfishness then indeed but not otherwise i plead guilty to the charge nor have i opposed this undertaking on account of the inhabitants of the district merely but as hath been intimated for the sake of every one however humble his condition who coming hither shall bring with him an eye to perceive and a heart to feel and worthily enjoy and as for holiday pastimes if a scene is to be chosen suitable to them for persons thronging from a distance it may be found elsewhere at less cost of every kind but in fact we have too much hurrying about in these islands much for idle pleasure and more from over activity in the pursuit of wealth without regard to the good or happiness of others      proud were ye mountains when in times of old     your patriot sons to stem invasive war     intrenched your brows ye gloried in each scar     now for your shame a power the thirst of gold     that rules oer britain like a baneful star     wills that your peace your beauty shall be sold     and clear way made for her triumphal car     through the beloved retreats your arms enfold     heard ye that whistle as her longlinked train     swept onwards did the vision cross your view     yes ye were startledand in balance true     weighing the mischief with the promised

edinburgh to an academy at belfast later having entered holy orders he proceeded to india as a chaplain in the east india companys service he was stationed at bhooj in cutch near the mouth of the

1792 8vo wordsworth could not have failed to be interested in the descriptions of this overlooked book they are openeyed openeared and vivid i would refer especially to the letters on windermere pp 5860 and indeed all on the lakes space can only be found for a short quotation on ambleside letter xiii august 18 1791 we now leave low wood and along the verge of the lake have a pleasing couple of miles to ambleside this is a straggling little markettown made up of roughcast white houses but charmingly situated in the centre of three radiant vallies ie all issuing from the town as from a centre this shows the propriety of the roman station situated near the west end of this place called amboglana commanding one of the most difficult passes in england beautiful woods rise halfway up the sides of the mountains from ambleside and seem wishful to cover the naked asperities of the country but the iron works calling for them in the character of charcoal every fourteen or fifteen years exposes the nakedness of the country among these woods and mountains are many frightful precipices and roaring cascades in a still evening several are heard at once in various keys forming a kind of savage music one half a mile above the town in a wood seems upwards of a hundred feet fallabout as much water as is in the new river precipitates itself over a perpendicular rock into a natural bason where it seems to recover from its fall before it takes a second and a third tumble over huge stones that break it into a number of streams it suffers not this outrage quietly for it grumbles through hollow glens and stone cavities all the way till it meets the rothay when it quietly enters the lake pp 713 it is odd that a book so matterful and containing many descriptions equal to this of ambleside should be so absolutely gone out of sight it is a considerable volume and pp 1114 are devoted to the lake region walker in 1787 issued anonymously an hasty sketch of a tour through part of the

composed in anticipation of leaving school  dear native regions c 1786 hawkshead the beautiful image with which this poem concludes suggested itself to me while i was resting in a boat along with my companions under the shade of a magnificent row of sycamores which then extended their branches from the shore of the promontory upon which stands the ancient and at that time the more picturesque hall of coniston the seat of the le flemings from very early times the poem of which it was the conclusion was of many hundred lines and contained thoughts and images most of which have been dispersed through my other writings   4 of the poems in this class the evening walk and descriptive sketches were first published in 1793 they are reprinted with some alterations that were chiefly made very soon after their publication                                       this notice which was written some time ago scarcely applies to the poem descriptive sketches as it now stands the corrections though numerous are not however such as to prevent its retaining with propriety a place in the class of juvenile pieces   5 an evening walk addressed to a young lady iii  the young lady to whom this was addressed was my sister it was composed at school and during my first two college vacations there is not an image in it which i have not observed and now in my seventythird year i recollect the time and place where most of them were noticed i will confine myself to one instance      waving his hat the shepherd from the vale     directs his wandering dog the cliffs to scale     the dog bounds barking mid the glittering rocks     hunts where his master points the intercepted flocks  i was an eyewitness of this for the first time while crossing the pass of dunmail raise upon second thought i will mention another image      and fronting the bright west yon oak entwines     its darkening boughs and leaves in stronger lines  this is feebly and imperfectly exprest but i recollect distinctly the very spot where this first struck me it was on the way between hawkshead and ambleside and gave me extreme pleasure the moment was important in my poetical history for i date from it my consciousness of the infinite variety of natural appearances which had been unnoticed by the poets of any age or country so far as i was acquainted with them and i made a resolution to supply in some degree the deficiency i could not have been at that time above fourteen years of age the description of the swans that follows was taken from the daily opportunities i had of observing their habits not as confined to the gentlemans park but in a state of nature there were two pairs of them that divided the lake of esthwaite and its inandoutflowing streams between them never trespassing a single yard upon each others separate domain they were of the old magnificent species bearing in beauty and majesty about the same relation to the thames swan which that does to a goose it was from the remembrance of these noble creatures i took thirty years after the picture of the swan which i have discarded from the poem of dion while i was a schoolboy the late mr curwen introduced a little fleet of these birds but of the inferior species to the lake of windermere their principal home was about his own islands but they sailed about into remote parts of the lake and either from real or imagined injury done to the adjoining fields they were got rid of at the request of the farmers and proprietors but to the great regret of all who had become attached to them from noticing their beauty and quiet habits i will conclude my notice of this poem by observing that the plan of it has not been confined to a particular walk or an individual place a proof of which i was unconscious at the time of my unwillingness to submit the poetic spirit to the chains of fact and real circumstance the country is idealized rather than described in any one of its local aspects   footnotes   5a intake l 49

circumstance of our having been companions among the alps seemed to give this dedication a propriety sufficient to do away any scruples which your modesty might otherwise have suggested  in inscribing

but the seasunsets which give such splendour to the vale of clwyd snowdon the chair of idris the quiet village of bethgelert menai and her druids the alpine steeps of the conway and the still more interesting windings of the wizard stream of the dee remain yet untouched apprehensive that my pencil may never be exercised on these subjects i cannot let slip this opportunity of thus publicly

beginning in solemn shapes c was taken from that beautiful region of which the principal features are lungarn and sarnen nothing that i ever saw in nature left a more delightful impression on my mind than that which i have attempted alas how feebly to convey to others in these lines those two lakes have always interested me especially from bearing in their size and other features a resemblance to

and character are here given was a gentleman of the neighbourhood a man of talent and learning who had been educated at one of our universities and returned to pass his time in seclusion on his own

used i to be delighted with the view from it while a little boy that some years before the first pleasurehouse was built i led thither from hawkshead a youngster about my own age an irish boy who was a servant to an itinerant conjuror my motive was to witness the pleasure i expected the boy would receive from the prospect of the islands below and the intermingling water i was not disappointed and

advertisement prefixed to the first edition of this poem published in 1842  not less than onethird of the following poem though it has from time to time been altered in the expression was published so far back as the year 1798 under the title of the female vagrant the extract is of such length that an apology seems to be required for reprinting it here but it was necessary to restore it to its original position or the rest would have been unintelligible the whole was written before the close of the year 1794 and i will detail rather as a matter of literary biography than for any other reason the circumstances under which it was produced  during the latter part of the summer of 1793 having passed a month in the isle of wight in view of the fleet which was then preparing for sea off portsmouth at the commencement of the war i left the place with melancholy forebodings the american war was still fresh in memory the struggle which was beginning and which many thought would be brought to a speedy close by the irresistible arms of great britain being added to those of the allies i was assured in my own mind would be of long continuance and productive of distress and misery beyond all possible calculation this conviction was pressed upon me by having been a witness during a long residence in revolutionary france of the spirit which prevailed in that country after leaving the isle of wight i spent two days in wandering on foot over salisbury plain which though cultivation was then widely spread through parts of it had upon the whole a still more impressive appearance than it now retains  the monuments and traces of antiquity scattered in abundance over that region led me unavoidably to compare what we know or guess of those remote times with certain aspects of modern society and with calamities principally those consequent upon war to which more than other classes of men the poor are subject in those reflections joined with particular facts that had come to my knowledge the following stanzas originated  in conclusion to obviate some distraction in the minds of those who are well acquainted with salisbury plain it may be proper to say that of the features described as belonging to it one or two are taken from other desolate parts of england   20 the female vagrant  i find the date of this is placed in 1792 in contradiction by mistake to what i have asserted in guilt and sorrow the correct date is 17934 the chief incidents of it more particularly her description of her feelings on the atlantic are taken from life   21 guilt and sorrow or incidents upon salisbury plain viii  unwilling to be unnecessarily particular i have assigned this poem to the dates 1793 and 1794 but in fact much of the female vagrants story was composed at least two years before all that relates to her sufferings as a soldiers wife in america and her condition of mind during her voyage home were faithfully taken from the report made to me of her own case by a friend who had been subjected to the same trials and affected in the same way mr coleridge when i first became acquainted with him was so much impressed with this poem that it would have encouraged me to publish the whole as it then stood but the mariners fate appeared to me so tragical as to require a treatment more subdued and yet more strictly applicable in expression than i had at first given to it this fault was corrected nearly fifty years afterwards when i determined to publish the whole it may be worth while to remark that though the incidents of this attempt do only in a small degree produce each other and it deviates accordingly from the general rule by which narrative pieces ought to be governed it is not therefore wanting in continuous hold upon the mind or in unity which is effected by the identity of moral interest that places the two personages upon the same footing in the readers sympathies my ramble over many parts of salisbury plain put me as mentioned in the preface upon writing this poem and left upon my mind imaginative impressions the force of which i have felt to this day from that district i proceeded to bath bristol and so on to the banks of the wye when i took again to travelling on foot in remembrance of that part of my journey which was in 1793 i began the verses      five years have passed c   22 charles farish      and hovering round it often did a raven fly  from a short ms poem read to me when an undergraduate by my schoolfellow and friend charles farish long since deceased the verses were by a brother of his a man of promising genius who died young guilt and sorrow st ix l 9   23 the forsaken poems founded on the affections xii  this was an overflow from the affliction of margaret and excluded as superfluous there but preserved in the faint hope that it may turn to account by restoring a shy lover to some forsaken damsel my poetry having been complained of as deficient in interests of this sort a charge which the next piece beginning      lyre though such power do in thy magic live  will scarcely tend to obviate the natural imagery of these verses was supplied by frequent i might say intense observation of the rydal torrent what an animating contrast is the everchanging aspect of that and indeed of every one of our mountain brooks to the monotonous tone and unmitigated fury of such streams among the alps as are fed all the summer long by glaciers and melting snows a traveller observing the exquisite purity of the great rivers such as the rhone at geneva and the reuss at lucerne where they issue out of their respective lakes might fancy for a moment that some power in nature produced this beautiful change with a view to make amends for those alpine sullyings which the waters exhibit near their fountain heads but alas how soon does that purity depart before the influx of tributary waters that have flowed through cultivated plains and the crowded abodes of men   24 the borderers a tragedy  of this dramatic work i have little to say in addition to the short printed note which will be found attached to it it was composed at racedown in dorset during the latter part of the year 1795 and in the course of the following year had it been the work of a later period of life it would have been different in some respects from what it is now the plot would have been something more complex and a greater variety of characters introduced to relieve the mind from the pressure of incidents so mournful the manners also would have been more attended to my care was almost exclusively given to the passions and the characters and the position in which the persons in the drama stood relatively to each other that the reader for i never thought of the stage at the time it was written might be moved and to a degree instructed by lights penetrating somewhat into the depths of our nature in this endeavour i cannot think upon a very late review that i have failed as to the scene and period of action little more was required for my purpose than the absence of established law and government so that the agents might be at liberty to act on their own impulses nevertheless i do remember that having a wish to colour the manners in some degree from local history more than my knowledge enabled me to do i read redpaths history of the borders but found there nothing to my purpose i once made an observation to sir w scott in which he concurred that it was difficult to conceive how so dull a book could be written on such a subject much about the same time but a little after coleridge was employed in writing his tragedy of remorse and it happened soon after that through one of the mr pooles mr knight the actor heard that we had been engaged in writing plays and upon his suggestion mine was curtailed and i believe with coleridges was offered to mr harris manager of covent garden for myself i had no hope nor even a wish though a successful play would in the then state of my finances have been a most welcome piece of good fortune that he should accept my performance so that i incurred no disappointment when the piece was judiciously returned as not calculated for the stage in this judgment i entirely concurred and had it been otherwise it was so natural for me to shrink from public notice that any hope i might have had of success would not have reconciled me altogether to such an exhibition mr cs play was as is well known brought forward several years after through the kindness of mr sheridan in conclusion i may observe that while i was composing this play i wrote a short essay illustrative of that constitution and those tendencies of human nature which make the apparently motiveless actions of bad men intelligible to careful observers this was partly done with reference to the character of oswald and his persevering endeavour to lead the man he disliked into so heinous a crime but still more to preserve in my distinct remembrance what i had observed of transitions in character and the reflections i had been led to make during the time i was a witness of the changes through which the french revolution passed   25 the following is the short printed note mentioned in above  this dramatic piece as noticed in its titlepage was composed in 17956 it lay nearly from that time till within the last two or three months unregarded among my papers without being mentioned even to my most intimate friends having however impressions upon my mind which made me unwilling to destroy the ms i determined to undertake the responsibility of publishing it during my own life rather than impose upon my successors the task of deciding its fate accordingly it has been revised with some care but as it was at first written and is now published without any view to its exhibition upon the stage not the slightest alteration has been made in the conduct of the story or the composition of the characters above all in respect to the two leading persons of the drama i felt no inducement to make any change the study of human nature suggests this awful truth that as in the trial to which life subjects us sin and crime are apt to start from their very opposite qualities so are there no limits to the hardening of the heart and the perversion of the understanding to which they may carry their slaves during my long residence in france while the revolution was rapidly advancing to its extreme of wickedness i had frequent opportunities of being an eyewitness of this process and it was while that knowledge was fresh upon my memory that the tragedy of the borderers was composed   26 later this was prefixed readers already acquainted with my poems will recognise in the following composition some eight or ten lines which i have not scrupled to retain in the places where they originally stood it is proper however to add that they would not have been used elsewhere if i had foreseen the time when i might be induced to publish this tragedy february 28

ridicule by the small critics so that in policy i excluded it from many editions of my poems till it was restored at the request of some of my friends in particular my soninlaw edward quillinan   35 lucy gray or solitude ix  written at goslar in germany in 1799 it was founded on a circumstance told me by my sister of a little girl who not far from halifax in yorkshire was bewildered in a snowstorm her footsteps were tracked by her parents to the middle of the lock of a canal and no other vestige of her backward or forward could be traced the body however was found in the canal the way in which the incident was treated and the spiritualising of the character might furnish hints for contrasting the imaginative influences which i have endeavoured to throw over common life with crabbes matteroffact style of handling subjects of the same kind this is not spoken to his disparagement far from it but to direct the attention of thoughtful readers into whose hands these notes may fall to a comparison that may enlarge the circle of their sensibilities and tend to produce in them a catholic judgment  36 we are seven x the ancient mariner and coleridge c c cc  written at alfoxden in the spring of 1798 under circumstances somewhat remarkable the little girl who is the heroine i met within the area of goderich castle in the year 1793 having left the isle of wight and crost salisbury plain as mentioned in the preface to guilt and sorrow i proceeded by bristol up the wye and so on to n wales to the vale of clwydd where i spent my summer under the roof of the father of my friend robert jones  in reference to this poem i will here mention one of the most remarkable facts in my own poetic history and that of mr coleridge in the spring of the year 1798 he my sister and myself started from alfoxden pretty late in the afternoon with a view to visit linton and the valley of stones near to it and as our united funds were very small we agreed to defray the expense of the tour by writing a poem to be sent to the new monthly magazine set up by phillips the bookseller and edited by dr aikin accordingly we set off and proceeded along the quantock hills towards watchet and in the course of this walk was planned the poem of the ancient mariner founded on a dream as mr coleridge said of his friend mr cruikshank much the greatest part of the story was mr coleridges invention but certain parts i myself suggested for example some crime was to be committed which would bring upon the old navigator as coleridge afterwards delighted to call him the spectral persecution as a consequence of that crime and his own wanderings i had been reading in shelvockes voyages a day or two before that while doubling cape horn they frequently saw albatrosses in that latitude the largest sort of seafowl some extending their wings twelve or thirteen feet suppose said i you represent him as having killed one of these birds on entering the south sea and that the tutelary spirits of these regions take upon them to avenge the crime the incident was thought fit for the purpose and adopted accordingly i also suggested the navigation of the ship by the dead men but do not recollect that i had anything more to do with the scheme of the poem the gloss with which it was subsequently accompanied was not thought of by either of us at the time at least not a hint of it was given to me and i have no doubt it was a gratuitous afterthought we began the composition together on that to me memorable evening i furnished two or three lines at the beginning of the poem in particular      and listend like a three years child       the mariner had his will  these trifling contributions all but one which mr c has with unnecessary scrupulosity recorded slipt out of his mind as they well might as we endeavoured to proceed conjointly i speak of the same evening our respective manners proved so widely different that it would have been quite presumptuous in me to do anything but separate from an undertaking upon which i could only have been a clog we returned after a few days from a delightful tour of which i have many pleasant and some of them droll enough recollections we returned by dulverton to alfoxden the ancient mariner grew and grew till it became too important for our first object which was limited to our expectation of five pounds and we began to talk of a volume which was to consist as mr coleridge has told the world of poems chiefly on natural subjects taken from common life but looked at as much as might be through an imaginative medium accordingly i wrote the idiot boy her eyes are wild c and we are seven the thorn and some others to return to we are seven the piece that called forth this notei composed it while walking in the grove of alfoxden my friends will not deem it too trifling to relate that while walking to and fro i composed the last stanza first having begun with the last line when it was all but finished i came in and recited it to mr coleridge and my sister and said a prefatory stanza must be added and i should sit down to our little teameal with greater pleasure if my task was finished i mentioned in substance what i wished to be expressed and coleridge immediately threw off the stanza thus      a little child dear brother jem  i objected to the rhyme dear brother jem as being ludicrous but we all enjoyed the joke of hitching in our friend james tobins name who was familiarly called jem he was the brother of the dramatist and this reminds me of an anecdote which it may be worth while here to notice the said jem got a sight of the lyrical ballads as it was going through the press at bristol during which time i was residing in that city one evening he came to me with a grave face and said wordsworth i have seen the volume that coleridge and you are about to publish there is one poem in it which i earnestly entreat you will cancel for if published it will make you everlastingly ridiculous i answered that i felt much obliged by the interest he took in my good name as a writer and begged to know what was the unfortunate piece he alluded to he said it is called we are seven nay said i that shall take its chance however and he left me in despair i have only to add that in the spring of 1841 i visited goodrich castle not having seen that part of the wye since i met the little girl there in 1793 it would have given me greater pleasure to have found in the neighbouring hamlet traces of one who had interested me so much but that was impossible as unfortunately i did not even know her name the ruin from its position and features is a most impressive object i could not but deeply regret that its solemnity was impaired by a fantastic new castle set up on a projection of the same ridge as if to show how far modern art can go in surpassing all that could be done by antiquity and nature with their united graces remembrances and associations i could have almost wished for power so much the contrast vexed me to blow away sir  meyricks impertinent structure and all the possessions it contains   37 the idle shepherd boys or dungeonghyll force a pastoral xi  grasmere townend 1800 i will only add a little monitory anecdote concerning this subject when coleridge and southey were walking together upon the fells southey observed that if i wished to be considered a faithful painter of rural manners i ought not to have said that my shepherd boys trimmed their rustic hats as described in the poem just as the words had past his lips two boys appeared with the very plant entwined round their hats i have often wondered that southey who rambled so much about the mountains should have fallen into this mistake and i record it as a warning for others who with far less opportunity than my dear friend had

two or three years under our care the name of kilve is from a village in the bristol channel about a mile from alfoxden and the name of liswin farm was taken from a beautiful spot on the wye when mr coleridge my sister and i had been visiting the famous john thelwall who had taken refuge from politics after a trial for high treason with a view to bring up his family by the profits of agriculture which proved as unfortunate a speculation as that he had fled from coleridge and he had been public lecturers coleridge mingling with his politics theology from which the other abstained unless it were for the sake of a sneer this quondam community of public employment induced thelwall to visit coleridge at nether stowey where he fell in my way he really was a man of extraordinary talent an affectionate husband and a good father though brought up in the city on a tailors board he was truly sensible of the beauty of natural objects i remember once when coleridge he and i were seated together upon the turf on the brink of a stream in the most beautiful part of the most beautiful glen of alfoxden coleridge exclaimed this is a place to reconcile one to all the jarrings and conflicts of the wide world nay said thelwall to make one forget them altogether the visit of this man to coleridge was as i believe coleridge has related the occasion of a spy being sent by government to watch our proceedings which were i can say with truth such as the world at large would have thought ludicrously harmless   40 rural architecture xiii  these structures as every one knows are common among

though much changed as to beauty was one of two most lovely sisters almost the first words my poor brother john said when he visited us for the first time at grasmere were were those two angels that i have just seen and from his description i have no doubt they were those two sisters the mother died in childbed and one of our neighbours at grasmere told me that the loveliest sight she had ever seen was that mother as she lay in her coffin with her dead babe in her arm i mention this to notice what i cannot but think a salutary custom once universal in these vales every attendant on a funeral made it a duty to look at the corpse in the coffin before the lid was closed which was never done nor i believe is now till a minute or two before the corpse was removed barbara lewthwaite was not in fact the child whom i had seen and overheard as engaged in the poem i chose the name for reasons implied in the above and will here add a caution against the use of names of living persons within a few months after the publication of this poem i was much surprised and more hurt to find it in a childs schoolbook which having been compiled by lindley murray had come into use at grasmere school where barbara was a pupil and alas i had the mortification of hearing that she was very vain of being thus distinguished and in after life she used to say that she remembered the incident and what i

that i took the trouble for not improbably the fact is illustrative of the boys early piety and may concur with my other little pieces on children to produce profitable reflection among my youthful readers this is said however with an absolute conviction that children will derive most benefit from books which are not unworthy the perusal of persons of any age i protest with my whole heart against those productions so abundant in the present day in which the doings of children are dwelt upon as if they were incapable of being interested in anything else on this subject i have dwelt at

northeastern end of grasmere lake which grove was in a great measure destroyed by turning the highroad along the side of the water the few trees that are left were spared at my intercession the poem

 grasmere 1800 the effect of her laugh is an extravagance though the effect of the reverberation of voices in some parts of these mountains is very striking there is in the excursion an allusion to

cumberland and westmoreland are several inscriptions upon the native rock which from the wasting of time and the rudeness of the workmanship have been mistaken for runic they are without doubt roman

unpoetical nation in europe it is probably true for they have more temptation to become so than any other european people trade commerce and manufactures physical science and mechanic arts out of which so much wealth has arisen have made our countrymen infinitely less sensible to movements of imagination and fancy than were our forefathers in their simple state of society how touching and beautiful were in most instances the names they gave to our indigenous flowers or any other they were familiarly acquainted with every month for many years have we been importing plants and flowers from all quarters of the globe many of which are spread through our gardens and some perhaps likely to be met with on the few commons which we have left will their botanical names ever be displaced by plain english appellations which will bring them home to our hearts by connection with our joys and sorrows it can never be unless society treads back her steps towards those simplicities which have been banished by the undue influence of towns spreading and spreading in every direction so that city life with every generation takes more and more the lead of rural among the ancients villages were reckoned the seats of barbarism refinement for the most part false increases the desire to accumulate wealth and while theories of political economy are boastfully pleading for the practice inhumanity

without disadvantage in the year 1806 if i am not mistaken the waggoner was read to you in manuscript and as you have remembered it for so long a time i am the more encouraged to hope that since the localities on which the poem partly depends did not prevent its being interesting to you it may prove acceptable to others being therefore in some measure the cause of its present appearance you must

lorton is much diminished by mutilation i will here mention that a little way up the hill on the road leading from rossthwaite to stonethwaite lay the trunk of a yewtree which appeared as you approached so vast was its diameter like the entrance of a cave and not a small one calculating upon what i have observed of the slow growth of this tree in rocky situations and of its durability i have often thought that the one i am describing must have been as old as the christian era the tree lay in the line of a fence great masses of its ruins were strewn about and some had been rolled down the hillside and lay near the road at the bottom as you approached the tree you were struck with the number of shrubs and young plants ashes c which had found a bed upon the decayed trunk and grew to no inconsiderable height forming as it were a part of the hedgerow in no part of england or of europe have i ever seen a yewtree at all approaching this in magnitude as it must have stood by the bye

particularised that the volumes cannot but improve upon you i see that you have entered into the spirit of them you mention the daffodils you know butler montagus friend not tom butler but the conveyancer when i was in town in spring he happened to see the volumes lying on montagus mantlepiece and to glance his eye upon the very poem of the daffodils aye says he a fine morsel this for the reviewers when this was told me for i was not present i observed that there were two lines in that little poem which if thoroughly felt would annihilate ninetenths of the reviews of the kingdom as they would find no readers the lines i alluded to were these      they flash upon that inward eye     which is the bliss of solitude  these two lines were composed by mrs wordsworth memoirs i 1834

thorn which i had often past in calm and bright weather without noticing it i said to myself cannot i by some invention do as much to make this thorn permanently an impressive object as the storm has made it to my eyes at this moment i began the poem accordingly and composed it with great rapidity sir george beaumont painted a picture from it which wilkie thought his best he gave it to me though when he saw it several times at rydal mount afterwards he said i could make a better and would like to paint the same subject over again the sky in this picture is nobly done but it reminds one too much of wilson the only fault however of any consequence is the female figure which is too old and decrepit for one likely to frequent an eminence on such a call   147 hartleap well xxiv  hartleap well is a small spring of water about five miles from richmond in yorkshire and near the side of the road that leads from richmond to askrigg its name is derived from a remarkable chase the memory of which is preserved by the monuments spoken of in the second part of the following poem which monuments do now exist as i have there described them   148 ibid  townend 1800 the first eight stanzas were composed extempore one winter evening in the cottage when after having tired and disgusted myself with labouring at an awkward passage in the brothers i started with a sudden impulse to this to get rid of the other and finished it in a day or two my sister and i had past the place a few weeks before in our wild winter journey from sockburn on the banks of the tees to grasmere a peasant whom we met near the spot told us the story so far as concerned the name of the well and the hart and pointed out the stones both the stones and the well are objects that may easily be missed the tradition by

castle xxv  henry lord clifford c c who is the subject of this poem was the son of john lord clifford who was slain at towton field which john lord clifford as is known to the reader of english history was the person who after the battle of wakefield slew in the pursuit the young earl of rutland son of the duke of york who had fallen in the battle in part of revenge say the authors of the history of cumberland and westmoreland for the earls father had slain his a deed which worthily blemished the author saith speed but who as he adds dare promise anything temperate of himself in the heat of martial fury chiefly when it was resolved not to leave any branch of the york line standing for so one maketh this lord to speak this no doubt i would observe by the bye was an action sufficiently in the vindictive spirit of the times and yet not altogether so bad as represented for the earl was no child as some writers would have him but able to bear arms being sixteen or seventeen years of age as is evident from this say the memoirs of the countess of pembroke who was laudably anxious to wipe away as far as could be this stigma from the illustrious name to which she was born that he was the next child to king edward the fourth which his mother had by richard duke of york and that king was then eighteen years of age and for the small distance betwixt her children see austin vincent in his book of nobility p 622 where he writes of them all it may further he observed that lord clifford who was then himself only 25 years of age had been a leading man and commander two or three years together in the army of lancaster before this time and therefore would be less likely to think that the earl of rutland might be entitled to mercy from his youthbut independent of this act at best a cruel and savage one the family of clifford had done enough to draw upon them the vehement hatred of the house of york so that after the battle of towton there was no hope for them but in flight and concealment henry the subject of the poem was deprived of his estate and honours during the space of twentyfour years all which time he lived as a shepherd in yorkshire or in cumberland where the estate of his fatherinlaw sir lancelot threlkeld lay he was restored to his estate and honours in the first year of henry the seventh it is recorded that when called to parliament he behaved nobly and wisely but otherwise came seldom to london or the court and rather delighted to live in the country where he repaired several of his castles which had gone to decay during the late troubles thus far is chiefly collected from nicholson and burn and i can add from my own knowledge that there is a tradition current in the village of threlkeld and its neighbourhood his principal retreat that in the course of his shepherdlife he had acquired great astronomical knowledge i cannot conclude this note without adding a word upon the subject of those numerous and noble feudal edifices spoken of in the poem the ruins of some of which are at this day so great an ornament to that interesting country the cliffords had always been distinguished for an honourable pride in these castles and we have seen that after the wars of york and lancaster they were rebuilt in the civil wars of charles the first they were again laid waste and again restored almost to their former magnificence by the celebrated mary anne clifford countess of pembroke c c not more than twentyfive years after this was done when the estates of clifford had passed into the family of tufton three of these castles namely brough brougham and pendragon were demolished and the timber and other materials sold by thomas earl of thanet we will hope that when this order was issued the earl had not consulted the text of isaiah 58th chap 12th verse to which the inscription placed over the gate of pendragon castle by the countess of pembroke i believe his grandmother at the time she repaired that structure refers the readerand they that shall be of thee shall build the old waste places thou shalt raise up the foundations of many generations and thou shalt be called the repairer of the breach the restorer of paths to dwell in the earl of thanet the present possessor of the estates with a due respect for the memory of his ancestors and a proper sense of the value and beauty of these remains of antiquity has i am told given orders that they shall be preserved from all depredations   150 ibid  see the note attached this poem was composed at coleorton while i was walking to and fro along the path that led from sir george beaumonts farmhouse where we resided to the hall which was building at that time   151 sir john beaumont      earth helped him with the cry of blood l 27  this line

follows that besides several others who perished in the same manner the four immediate progenitors of the person in whose hearing this is supposed to be spoken all died on the field   154 tintern abbey xxvi  july 1798 no poem of mine was composed under circumstances more pleasant for me to remember than this i began it upon leaving tintern after crossing the wye and concluded it just as i was entering bristol in the evening after a ramble of four or five days with my sister not a line of it was altered and not any part of it written down till i reached bristol it was published almost immediately after in the little volume of which so much has been said in these notes the lyrical ballads as first published at bristol by cottle   155 it is no spirit c xxvii  1803 townend i remember the instant my sister sarah hutchinson called me to the window of our cottage saying look how beautiful is yon star it has the sky all to itself i composed the verses immediately   156 french

poems since   157 yes it was the mountain echo xxix  townend 1806 the echo came from nabscar when i was walking on the opposite side of rydal mere i will here mention for my dear sisters sake that while she was sitting alone one day high up on this part of loughrigg fell she was so affected by the voice of the cuckoo heard from the crags at some distance that she could not suppress a wish to have a stone inscribed with her name among the rocks from which the sound proceeded on my return from my walk i recited those verses to mary who was then confined with her son thomas who died in his seventh year as recorded on his headstone in grasmere churchyard   158 to a skylark xxx  rydal mount 1825 in pencilwhere there are no skylarks but the poet is everywhere   159 laodamia xxxi  rydal

expressed by some of my friends that the rejected stanza should be restored i hope they will be content if it be hereafter immediately attached to the poem instead of its being degraded to a place in the notes  the reasons supra are thus given this poem began with the following stanza which has been displaced on account of its detaining the reader too long from the subject and as rather precluding than preparing for the due effect of the allusion to the genius of plato   162 fair is the swan c xxxiii see supra 161   163 the pass of kirkstone  rydal mount 1817 thoughts and feelings of many walks

needed i should have been rather mortified if you had not liked the piece as i think it contains some of the happiest verses i ever wrote it had been promised several years to two of the party before a fancy fit for the performance struck me it was then thrown off rapidly and afterwards revised with care during the last week i wrote some stanzas on the power of sound which ought to find a place in my larger work if aught should ever come of that  in the book on the lakes which i have not at hand is a passage rather too vaguely expressed where i content myself with saying that after a certain

immediately   178 suggested by a picture of the bird of paradise xlix  this subject has been treated of before see a former note i will here only by way of comment direct attention to the fact that pictures of animals and other productions of nature as seen in conservatories menageries and museums c would do little for the national mind nay they would be rather injurious to it if the imagination were excluded by the presence of the object more or less out of the state of nature if it were not that we learn to talk and think of the lion and the eagle the palmtree and even the cedar from the impassioned introduction of them so frequently in holy scripture and by great poets and divines who write as poets the spiritual part of our nature and therefore the higher part of it would derive no benefit from such intercourse with such subjects   179 a jewish family l  coleridge and my daughter and i in 1828 passed a fortnight upon the banks of the rhine principally under the hospitable roof of mr aders at gotesburg but two days of the time were spent at st goa or in rambles among the neighbouring vallies it was at st goa that i saw the jewish family here described though exceedingly poor and in rags they were not less beautiful than i have endeavoured to make them appear we had taken a little dinner with us in a basket and invited them to partake of it which the mother refused to do both for herself and her children saying it was with them a fastday adding diffidently that whether such observances were right or wrong she felt it her duty to keep them strictly the jews who are numerous in this part of the rhine greatly surpass the german peasantry in the beauty of their features and in the intelligence of their countenances but the lower classes of the german peasantry have

dedication         whats in a name     brutus will start a spirit as soon as caesar            to robert southey esq pl etc etc my dear friend  the tale of peter bell which i now introduce to your notice and to that of the public has in its manuscript state nearly survived its minorityfor it first saw the light in the summer of 1798 during this long interval pains have been taken at different times to make the production less unworthy of a favourable reception or rather to fit it for filling permanently a station however humble in the literature of our country this has indeed been the aim of all my endeavours in poetry which you know have been sufficiently laborious to prove that i deem the art not lightly to be approached and that the attainment of excellence in it may laudably be made the principal object of intellectual pursuit by any man who with reasonable consideration of circumstances has faith in his own impulses  the poem of peter bell as the prologue will show was composed under a belief that the imagination not only does not require for its exercise the intervention of supernatural agency but that though such agency be excluded the faculty may be called forth as imperiously and for kindred results of pleasure by incidents within the compass of poetic probability in the humblest departments of daily life since that prologue was written you have exhibited most splendid effects of judicious daring in the opposite and usual course let this acknowledgment make my peace with the lovers of the supernatural and i am persuaded it will be admitted that to you as a master in that province of the art the following tale whether from contrast or congruity is not an inappropriate offering accept it then as a public testimony of affectionate admiration from one with whose name yours has been often coupled to use your own words for evil and for good and believe me to be with earnest wishes that life and health may be granted you to complete the many important works in which you are engaged and with high respect                   most faithfully yours                       william wordsworth rydal mount april 7 1819   182 peter bell the poem  alfoxden 1798 founded upon an anecdote which i read in a newspaper of an ass being found hanging his head over a canal in a wretched posture upon examination a dead body was found in the water and proved to be the body of its master the countenance gait and figure of peter were taken from a wild rover with whom i walked from builth on the river wye downwards nearly as far as the town of hay he told me strange stories it has always been a pleasure to me through life to catch at every opportunity that has occurred in my rambles of becoming acquainted with this class of people the number of peters wives was taken from the trespasses in this way of a lawless creature who lived in the county of durham and used to be attended by many women sometimes not less than half a dozen as disorderly as himself and a story went in the country that he had been heard to say while they were quarrelling why cant you be quiet theres none so many of you benoni or the child of sorrow i knew when i was a schoolboy his mother had been deserted by a gentleman in the neighbourhood she herself being a gentlewoman by birth the circumstances of her story were told me by my dear old dame ann tyson who was her confidante the lady died brokenhearted in the woods of alfoxden i used to take great delight in noticing the habits tricks and physiognomy of asses and i have no doubt that i was thus put upon writing the poem out of liking for the creature that is so often dreadfully abused the crescent moon which makes such a figure in the prologue assumed this character one evening while i was watching its beauty in front of alfoxden house i intended this poem for the volume before spoken of but it was not published for more than twenty years afterwards the worship of the methodists or ranters is often heard

been well acquainted with them but i was particularly struck on that occasion with the dignified simplicity and majestic harmony that runs through most of themin character so totally different from the italian and still more so from shakespeares fine sonnets i took fire if i may be allowed to say so and produced three sonnets the same afternoonthe first i ever wrote except an irregular one at school of these three the only one i distinctly remember is i grieved for buonaparte c one was never written down the third which was i believe preserved i cannot particularise   184 admonition

sonnet viii      the fairest brightest hues c  suggested at hackett which is the craggy ridge that rises between the two langdales and looks towards windermere the cottage of hackett was often visited by us and at the time when this sonnet was written and long after was occupied by the husband and wife described in the excursion where it is mentioned that she was in the habit of walking in the front of the dwelling with a light to guide her husband home at night the same cottage is alluded to in the epistle to sir g beaumont as that from which the female peasant hailed us on our morning

picture are bredon hill and cloud hill near coleorton i shall never forget the happy feeling with which my heart was filled when i was impelled to compose this sonnet we resided only two years in this house and during the last half of this time which was after this poem had been written we lost our two children thomas and catherine our sorrow upon these events often brought it to my mind and cast me upon the support to which the last line of it gives expression      the appropriate calm of blest eternity  it is scarcely necessary to add that we still possess the picture   190 sonnet xi  aerial

sonnet xix      grief thou hast lost c  i could write a treatise of lamentation upon the changes brought about among the cottages of westmoreland by the silence of the spinningwheel during long winters nights and wet days the wheel upon which wool was spun gave employment to a great part of a family the old man however infirm was able to card the wool as he sate in the corner by the fireside and often when a boy have i admired the cylinders of carded wool which were softly laid upon each other by his side two wheels were often at work on the same floor and others of the family chiefly the little children were occupied in teazing and clearing the wool to fit it for the hand of the carder so that all except the infants were contributing to mutual support such was the employment that prevailed in the pastoral vales where wool was not at hand in the small rural towns the wheel for spinning flax was almost in as constant use if knitting was not preferred which latter occupation had the advantage in some cases disadvantage that not being of necessity stationary it allowed of gossiping about from house to house which good housewives reckoned an idle thing   193 sonnet xxii  decay

pleasure with which the man worked at improvements of the ground round the house indeed he expressed them to me himself and the countenance and manner of his wife always denoted feelings of the same character i believe a similar disposition to contentment under change of fortune is common among the class to which these good people belong yet in proof that to part with their patrimony is most painful to them i may refer to those stanzas entitled repentance no inconsiderable part of which was taken verbatim from the language of the speaker himself in pencilherself mn   205 sonnet xi  dark and more dark c  october 3d or 4th 1802 composed after a journey over the hambleton hills on a day memorable to methe day of my marriage the horizon commanded by those hills is most magnificent  the next day while we were travelling in a postchaise up wensley dale we were stopt by one of the horses proving restiff and were obliged to wait two hours in a severe storm before the postboy could fetch from the inn another to supply its place the spot was in front of bolton hall where mary queen of scots was kept prisoner soon after her unfortunate landing at workington the place then belonged to the scroopes and memorials of her are yet preserved there to beguile the time i composed a sonnet the subject was our own confinement contrasted with hers but it was not thought worthy of being preserved   206 sonnet xiii  while not a leaf c  september 1815 for me who under kindlier laws c l 9 this conclusion has more than once to my great regret excited painfully sad feelings in the hearts of young persons fond of poetry and poetic composition by contrast of their feeble and declining health with that state of robust constitution which prompted me to rejoice in a season of frost and snow as more favourable to the muses than summer itself   207 sonnet xiv  how clear how keen c  november 1st suggested on the banks of the brathay by the sight of langdale pikes it is delightful to remember those moments of fardistant days which probably would have been forgotten if the impression had not been transferred to verse the same observation applies to the rest   208 sonnet xv  one who

individually and as a representative of past times his chief employment was keeping watch at night by pacing round the house at that time building to keep off depredators he has often told me gravely of having seen the seven whistlers and the hounds as here described among the groves of coleorton where i became familiar with the habits and notions of old mitchell there was also a labourer of whom i regret i had no personal knowledge for more than forty years after when he was become an old man i learnt that while i was composing verses which i usually did aloud he took much pleasure unknown to me in following my steps that he might catch the words i uttered and what is not a little remarkable several lines caught in this way kept their place in his memory my volumes have lately been given to him by my informant and surely he must have been gratified to meet in print his old acquaintance   212 sonnet xxx four fiery steeds c  suggested on the road between preston and lancaster where it

friend jones and is particularly described in another note   217 sonnet ix a stream to mingle c  in this vale of meditation glen mywr my friend jones resided having been allowed by his diocesan to fix himself there without resigning his living in oxfordshire he was with my wife and daughter and me when we visited these celebrated ladies who had retired as one may say into notice in this vale their cottage lay directly in the road between london and dublin and they were of course visited by their irish friends as well as innumerable strangers they took much delight in passing jokes on our friend joness plumpness ruddy cheeks and smiling countenance as little suited to a hermit living in the vale of meditation we all thought there was ample room for retort on his part so curious was the appearance of these ladies so elaborately sentimental about themselves and their caro albergo as they named it in an inscription on a tree that stood opposite the endearing epithet being preceded by the word ecco calling upon the saunterer to look about him so oddly was one of these ladies attired that we took her at a little distance for a roman catholic priest with a crucifix and relics hung at his neck they were without caps their hair bushy and white as snow which contributed to the mistake   218 sonnet xi in the woods of rydal  this sonnet as poetry explains itself yet the scene of the incident having been a wild wood it may be doubted as a point of natural history whether the bird was aware that his attentions were bestowed upon a human or even a living creature but a redbreast will perch upon the foot of a gardener at work and alight on the handle of the spade when his hand is half upon it this i have seen and under my own roof i have witnessed affecting instances of the creatures friendly visits to the chambers of sick persons as described in the verses to the redbreast no 83 one of these welcome intruders used frequently to roost upon a nail in the wall from which a picture had hung and was ready as morning came to pipe his song in the hearing of the invalid who had been long confined to her room these attachments to a particular person when marked and continued used to be reckoned ominous but the superstition is passing away   219 sonnet xiii while annas peers c  this is taken from the account given by miss jewsbury of the pleasure she derived when long confined to her bed by sickness from the inanimate object on which this sonnet turns  220 sonnet xv wait prithee wait c  the fate of this poor dove as described was told to me at brinsop court by the

under this stone nothing appears to be known for a certainty the rev mr morris a nonconformist a sufferer for conscience sake a worthy man who having been deprived of his benefice after the accession of william iii lived to an old age in extreme destitution on the alms of charitable jacobites   226 sonnet xx while poring c  my attention to these antiquities was directed by mr walker son to the itinerant eidouranian philosopher the beautiful pavement was discovered within a few yards of the front door of his parsonage and appeared from the site in full view of several hills upon which there had formerly been roman encampments as if it might have been the villa of the commander of the forces at least such was mrs ws conjecture  227 sonnet xxi      chatsworth thy stately mansion c  i have reason to remember the day that gave rise to this sonnet the 6th of november 1830 having undertakena great feat for meto ride my daughters pony from westmoreland to cambridge that she might have the use of it while on a visit to her uncle at trinity lodge on my way from bakewell to matlock i turned aside to chatsworth and had scarcely gratified my curiosity by the sight of that celebrated place before there came on a severe storm of wind and rain which continued till i reached derby both man and pony in a pitiable plight for myself i went to bed at noonday in the course of that journey i had to encounter a storm worse if possible in which the pony could or would only make his way slantwise i mention this merely to add that notwithstanding this battering i composed on ponyback the lines to the memory of sir george beaumont suggested during my recent visit to coleorton  228 sonnet xxii      tis said that to the brow c  this pleasing tradition was told me by the coachman at whose side i sate while he drove down the dale he pointing to the trees on the hill as he related the story  229 sonnet xxiii      untouched through all severity of cold  this was also communicated to me by a coachman in the same way in the course of my many coach rambles and journeys which during the daytime always and often in the night were taken on the outside of the coach i had good and frequent opportunities of learning the character of this class of men one remark i made that is worth recording that whenever i had occasion especially to notice their wellordered respectful and kind behaviour to women of whatever age i found them i may say almost always to be married men   230 sonnet xxiv  go faithful tishart c  the six last lines of this sonnet are not written for poetical effect but as a matter of fact which in more than one instance could not escape my notice in the servants of the house   231 sonnet xxv  why art thou silent  in the month of january blank when dora and i were walking from townend grasmere across the vale snow being on the ground she espied in the thick though leafless hedge a birdsnest half filled with snow out of this comfortless appearance arose this sonnet which was in fact written without the least reference to any individual object but merely to prove to myself that i could if i thought fit write in a strain that poets have been fond of on the 14th of february in the same year my daughter in a sportive mood sent it as a valentine under a fictitious name to her cousin c w   232 sonnet xxvi  haydon let worthier judges c  this sonnet though said to be written on seeing the portrait of napoleon was in fact composed some time after extempore in rydal mount in pencilbut it was said in prose in haydons studio for i was present relate the facts and why it was versified   233 sonnet xxvii  a poethe hath put c  i was impelled to write this sonnet by the disgusting frequency with which the word artistical imported with other impertinencies from the germans is employed by writers of the present day for artistical let them substitute artificial and the poetry written on this system both at home and abroad will be for the most part much better characterised   234 sonnet xxviii  the most alluring clouds c  hundreds of times have i seen hanging about and above the vale of rydal clouds that might have given birth to this sonnet which was thrown off on the impulse of the moment one evening when i was returning home from the favourite walk of ours along the rotha under loughrigg   235 sonnet xxix  by arts bold privilege c  this was composed while i was ascending helvelyn in company with my daughter and her husband she was on horseback and rode to the very top of the hill without once dismounting a feat which it was scarcely possible to perform except during a season of dry weather and a guide with whom we fell in on the mountain told us he believed it had never been accomplished before by any one   236 sonnet xxxii  all praise the likeness c  the picture which gave occasion to this and the following sonnet was from the pencil of miss m gillies who resided for several weeks under our roof at rydal mount   237 sonnet

sister and myself started together from townend to make a tour in scotland august 14th poor coleridge was at that time in bad spirits and somewhat too much in love with his own dejection and he departed from us as is recorded in my sisters journal soon after we left loch lomond the verses that stand foremost among these memorials were not actually written for the occasion but transplanted from my epistle to sir g beaumont   242 to the sons of burns after visiting the grave of their father iv  see in connection with these verses two other poems upon burns one composed actually at the time and the other though then felt not put into words till several years afterwards viz at the grave of burns 1803 seven years after his death ii and thoughts suggested the day following on the banks of nith near the poets residence iii another note in if mss is nearly the same as this viz to be printed among the poems relating to my first tour in scotland for illustrations see my sisters journal it may be proper to add that the second of these pieces though felt at the time was not composed till many years after   243 ellen irwin or the braes of kirtle v  it may be worth while to observe that as there are scotch poems on this subject in the simple ballad strain i thought it would be both presumptuous and superfluous to attempt treating it in the same way and accordingly i chose a construction of stanza quite new in our language in fact the same as that of bürghers leonora except that the first and third lines do not in my stanzas rhyme at the outset i threw out a classical image to prepare the reader for the style in which i meant to treat the story and so to preclude all comparison notethe kirtle is a river in the southern part of scotland on the banks of which the events here related took place   244 to a highland girl vi  this delightful creature and her demeanour are particularly described in my sisters journal the sort of prophecy with which the verses conclude has through gods goodness been realised and now approaching the close of my seventythird year i have a most vivid remembrance of her and the beautiful objects with which she was surrounded she is alluded to in the poem of the three cottage girls among my continental memorials in illustration of this class of poems i have scarcely anything to say beyond what is anticipated in my sisters faithful and admirable journal   245 stepping westward vii  while my fellowtraveller and i were walking by the side of loch ketterine katrine one fine evening after sunset in our road to a hut where in the course of our tour we had been hospitably entertained some weeks before we met in one of the loneliest parts of that solitary region two welldressed women one of whom said to us by way of greeting what you are stepping westward   246 address to kilchurn castle x  the first three lines were thrown off at the moment i first caught sight of the ruin from a small eminence by the wayside the rest was added many years after notethe tradition is that the castle was built by a lady during the absence of her lord in palestine   247 rob roys grave xi  i have since been told that i was misinformed as to the burialplace of bob roy if so i may plead in excuse that i wrote on apparently good authority namely that of a welleducated lady who lived at the head of the lake within a mile or less of the point indicated as containing the remains of one so famous in that neighbourhood note prefixedthe history of rob roy is sufficiently known his grave is near the head of loch ketterine in one of those small pinfoldlike burialgrounds of neglected and desolate appearance which the traveller meets with in the highlands of scotland   248 sonnet composed at  castle 1803 xii   the castle

george mackreth for many years parishclerk of grasmere he had been an eyewitness of the occurrence the vessel in reality was a washingtub which the little fellow had met with on the shore of the loch appended noteit is recorded in dampiers voyages that a boy son of the captain of a manofwar seated himself in a turtleshell and floated in it from the shore to his fathers ship which lay at anchor at the distance of half a mile in deference to the opinion of a friend i have substituted such a shell for the less elegant vessel in which my blind voyager did actually intrust himself to the dangerous current of loch leven as was related to me by an eyewitness     ix memorials of a second tour in scotland 1814   253 suggested by a beautiful ruin upon one of the islands of loch lomond a place chosen for the retreat of a solitary individual from whom this habitation acquired the name of the brownies celli  in this tour my wife and her sister sara were my companions the account of the brownies cell and the brownies was given me by a man we met with on the banks of loch lomond a little above tarbert and in front of a huge mass of rock by the side of which we were told preachings were often held in the open air the place is quite a solitude and the surrounding scenery very striking how much is it to be regretted that instead of writing such poems as the holy fair and others in which the religious observances of his country are treated with so much levity and too often with indecency burns had not employed his genius in describing religion under the serious and affecting aspects it must so frequently take   254 composed at corra linn in sight of wallace towerii  i had seen this celebrated waterfall twice before but the feelings to which it had given birth were not expressed till they recurred in presence of the object on this occasion   255 effusion in the pleasureground on the banks of the braw near dunkeldiii  i am not aware that this condemnatory effusion was ever seen by the owner of the place he might be disposed to pay little attention to it but were it to prove otherwise i should be glad for the whole exhibition is distressingly puerile   256 yarrow visitediv  as mentioned in my verses on the death of the ettrick shepherd my first visit to yarrow was in his company we had lodged the night before at traquhair where hogg had joined us and also dr anderson the editor of the british poets who was on a visit at the manse dr a walked with us till we came in view of the vale of yarrow and being advanced in life he then turned back the old man was passionately fond of poetry though with not much of a discriminating judgment as the volumes he edited sufficiently shew but i was much pleased to meet with him and to acknowledge my obligation to his collection which had been my brother johns companion in more than one voyage to india and which he gave me before his departure from grasmere never to return through these volumes i became first familiar with chaucer and so little money had i then to spare for books that in all probability but for this same work i should have known little of drayton daniel and other distinguished poets of the elizabethan age and their immediate successors till a much later period of my life i am glad to record this not for any importance of its own but as a tribute of gratitude to this simplehearted old man whom i never again had the pleasure of meeting i seldom read or think of this poem without regretting that my dear sister was not of the party as she would have had so much delight in recalling the time when travelling together in scotland we declined going in search of this celebrated stream not altogether i will frankly confess for the reasons assigned in the poem on the occasion

delightful ramble through his own romantic country of north wales much of the latter part of his life he passed in comparative solitude which i know was often cheered by remembrance of our youthful adventures and of the beautiful regions which at home and abroad we had visited together our long friendship was never subject to a moments interruptionand while revising these volumes for the last time i have been so often reminded of my loss with a not unpleasing sadness that i trust the reader will excuse this passing mention of a man who well deserves from me something more than so brief a

the purpose of embodying moral truths this remark might perhaps as well have been suppressed for to those who may be in sympathy with the course of these poems it will be superfluous and will i fear be thrown away upon that other class whose besotted admiration of the intoxicated despot hereafter placed in contrast with him is the most melancholy evidence of degradation in british feeling and

struck as here described with the vanity and parade of our own country especially in great towns and cities as contrasted with the quiet and i may say the desolation that the revolution had produced

subject here treated would that poet be before whose eyes the present distresses under which this kingdom labours could interpose a veil sufficiently thick to hide or even to obscure the splendour of this great moral triumph if i have given way to exultation unchecked by these distresses it might be sufficient to protect me from a charge of insensibility should i state my own belief that the sufferings will be transitory upon the wisdom of a very large majority of the british nation rested that generosity which poured out the treasures of this country for the deliverance of europe and in the same national wisdom presiding in time of peace over an energy not inferior to that which has been displayed in war they confide who encourage a firm hope that the cup of our wealth will be gradually replenished there will doubtless be no few ready to indulge in regrets and repinings and to feed a morbid satisfaction by aggravating these burthens in imagination in order that calamity so confidently prophesied as it has not taken the shape which their sagacity allotted to it may appear as grievous as possible under another but the body of the nation will not quarrel with the gain because it might have been purchased at a less price and acknowledging in these sufferings which they feel to have been in a great degree unavoidable a consecration of their noble efforts they will vigorously apply themselves to remedy the evil  nor is it at the expense of rational patriotism or in disregard of sound philosophy that i have given vent to feelings tending to encourage a martial spirit in the bosoms of my countrymen at a time when there is a general outcry against the prevalence of these dispositions the british army both by its skill and valour in the field and by the discipline which rendered it to the inhabitants of the several countries where its operations were carried on a protection from the violence of their own troops has performed services that will not allow the language of gratitude and admiration to be suppressed or restrained whatever be the temper of the public mind through a scrupulous dread lest the tribute due to the past should prove an injurious incentive for the future every man deserving the name of briton adds his voice to the chorus which extols the exploits of his countrymen with a consciousness at times overpowering the effort that they transcend all praisebut this particular sentiment thus irresistibly excited is not sufficient the nation would err grievously if she suffered the abuse which other states have made of military power to prevent her from perceiving that no people ever was or can be independent free or secure much less great in any sane application of the word without a cultivation of military virtues nor let it be overlooked that the benefits derivable from these sources are placed within the reach of great britain under conditions peculiarly favourable the same insular position which by rendering territorial incorporation impossible utterly precludes the desire of conquest under the most seductive shape it can assume enables her to rely for her defence against foreign foes chiefly upon a species of armed force from which her own liberties have nothing to fear such are the privileges of her situation and by permitting they invite her to give way to the courageous instincts of human nature and to strengthen and refine them by culture  but some have more than insinuated that a design exists to subvert the civil character of the english people by unconstitutional applications and unnecessary increase of military power the advisers and abettors of such a design were it possible that it should exist would be guilty of the most heinous crime which upon this planet can be committed trusting that this apprehension arises from the delusive influences of an honourable jealousy let me hope that the martial qualities which i venerate will be fostered by adhering to those good old usages which experience has sanctioned and by availing ourselves of new means of indisputable promise particularly by applying in its utmost possible extent that system of tuition whose masterspring is a habit of gradually enlightened subordinationby imparting knowledge civil moral and religious in such measure that the mind among all classes of the community may love admire and be prepared and accomplished to defend that country under whose protection its faculties have been unfolded and its riches acquiredby just dealing towards all orders of the state so that no members of it being trampled upon courage may everywhere continue to rest immoveably upon its ancient english foundation personal selfrespectby adequate rewards and permanent honours conferred upon the deservingby encouraging athletic exercises and manly sports among the peasantry of the countryand by especial care to provide and support institutions in which during a time of peace a reasonable proportion of the youth of the country may be instructed in military science  i have only to add that i should feel little satisfaction in giving to the world these limited attempts to celebrate the virtues of my country if i did not encourage a hope that a subject which it has fallen within my province to treat only in the mass will by other poets be illustrated in that detail which its importance calls for and which will allow opportunities to give the merited applause to persons as well as to things  the ode was published along with other pieces now interspersed through this volume   269 ibid  the first stanza of this ode was composed almost extempore in front of rydal mount before churchtime on such a morning and precisely with such objects before my eyes as are here described the view taken of napoleons character and proceedings is little in accordance with that taken by some historians and critical philosophers i am glad and proud of the difference and trust that this series of poems infinitely below the subject as they are will survive to counteract in unsophisticated minds the pernicious and degrading tendency of those views and doctrines that lead to the idolatry of power as power and in that false splendour to lose sight of its real nature and constitution as it often acts for the gratification of its possessor without reference to a beneficial endan infirmity that has

the continent 1820 i should seem to have borne a little hard upon the personal appearance of the worthy poissardes of calais let me take shelter under the authority of my lamented friend the late sir george beaumont he a most accurate observer used to say of them that their features and countenances seemed to have conformed to those of the creatures they dealt in at all events the resemblance was striking   273 incident at bruges iv  this occurred at bruges in the year 1828 mr coleridge my daughter and i made a tour together in flanders upon the rhine and returned by holland dora and i while

affected and dora moved as appears in the verses   274 between namur and liege vi  the scenery on the meuse pleases me more upon the whole than that of the rhine though the river itself is much inferior in grandeur the rocks both in form and colour especially between namur and liege surpass any upon the rhine though they are in several places disfigured by quarries whence stones were taken for the new fortifications this is much to be regretted for they are useless and the scars will remain perhaps for thousands of years a like injury to a still greater degree has been inflicted in my memory upon the beautiful rocks at clifton on the banks of the avon there is probably in existence a very long letter of mine to sir uvedale price in which was given a description of the landscapes on the meuse as compared with those on the rhine  details in the spirit of these sonnets are given both in marys journal and my sisters and the reperusal of them has strengthened a wish long entertained

the danube might have suggested some of those sublime images which armstrong has so finely described at present the contrast is most striking the spring appears in a capacious stone basin in front of a ducal palace with a pleasureground opposite then passing under the pavement takes the form of a little clear bright black vigorous rill barely wide enough to tempt the agility of a child five years old to leap over itand entering the garden it joins after a course of a few hundred yards a stream much more considerable than itself the copiousness of the spring at doneschingen must have procured for it the honour of being named the source of the danube   277 the staubbach xii  the staubbach is a narrow stream which after a long course on the heights comes to the sharp edge of a somewhat

cathedral xxvii      of figures human and divine  the statues ranged round the spire and along the roof of the cathedral of milan have been found fault with by persons whose exclusive taste is unfortunate for themselves it is true that the same expense and labour judiciously directed to purposes more strictly architectural might have much heightened the general effect of the building for seen from the ground the statues appear diminutive but the coupdoeil from the best point of view which is half way up the spire must strike an unprejudiced person with admiration and surely the selection and arrangement of the figures is exquisitely fitted to support the religion of the country in the imaginations and feelings of the spectator it was with great pleasure that i saw during the

education accompanied by a fellowpupil a native of scotland he had just set out on a swiss tour when it was his misfortune to fall in with a friend of mine who was hastening to join our party the travellers after spending a day together on the road from berne and at soleure took leave of each other at night the young men having intended to proceed directly to zurich but early in the morning my friend found his new acquaintances who were informed of the object of his journey and the friends he was in pursuit of equipped to accompany him we met at lucerne the succeeding evening and mr g and his fellowstudent became in consequence our travelling companions for a couple of days we ascended the righi together and after contemplating the sunrise from that noble mountain we separated at an hour and on a spot well suited to the parting of those who were to meet no more our party descended through the valley of our lady of the snow and our late companions to art we had hoped to meet in a few weeks at geneva but on the third succeeding day on the 21st of august mr goddard perished being overset in a boat while crossing the lake of zurich his companion saved himself by swimming and was hospitably received in the mansion of a swiss gentleman m keller situated on the eastern coast of the lake the corpse of poor goddard was cast ashore on the estate of the same gentleman who generously performed all the rites of hospitality which could be rendered to the dead as well as to the living he caused a handsome mural monument to be erected in the church of küsnacht which records the

                              xii memorials of a tour in italy 1837   295 introductory remarks  during my whole life i had felt a strong desire to visit rome and the other celebrated cities and regions of italy but did not think myself justified in incurring the necessary expense till i received from mr moxon the publisher of a large edition of my poems a sum sufficient to enable me to gratify my wish without encroaching upon what i considered due to my family my excellent friend hc robinson readily consented to accompany me and in march 1837 we set off from london to which we returned in augustearlier than my companion wished or i should myself have desired had i been like him a bachelor these memorials of that tour touch upon but a very few of the places and objects that interested me and in what they do advert to are for the most part much slighter than i could wish more particularly do i regret that there is no notice in them of the south of france nor of the roman antiquities abounding in that district especially of the pont de degard which together with its situation impressed me full as much as any remains of roman architecture to be found in italy then there was vaucluse with its fountain its petrarch its rocks queryroses of all seasons its small plots of lawn in their first vernal freshness and the blossoms of the peach and other trees embellishing the scene on every side the beauty of the stream also called forcibly for the expression of sympathy from one who from his childhood had studied the brooks and torrents of his native mountains between two and three hours did i run about climbing the steep and rugged craggs from whose base the water of vaucluse breaks forth has lauras lover often said i to myself ever sat down upon this stone or has his foot ever pressed that turf some especially of the female sex could have felt sure of it my answer was impute it to my years i fear not is it not in fact obvious that many of his loveverses must have flowed i do not say from a wish to display his own talent but from a habit of exercising his intellect in that way rather than from an impulse of his heart it is otherwise with his lyrical poems and particularly with the one upon the degradation of his country there he pours out his reproaches lamentations and aspirations like an ardent and sincere patriot but enough it is time to turn to my own effusions such as they are   296 ibid  the tour of which the following poems are very inadequate remembrances was shortened by report too well founded of the prevalence of cholera at naples to make some amends for what was reluctantly left unseen in the south of italy we visited the tuscan sanctuaries among the apennines and the principal italian lakes among the alps neither of those lakes nor of venice is there any notice in these poems chiefly because i have touched upon them elsewhere see in particular descriptive sketches memorials of a tour on the continent in 1820 and a sonnet upon the extinction of the venetian republic   297 musings at aquapendente april 1837 i  the following note refers to sir w scott      had his sunk eye kindled at those dear words     that spake of bards and minstrels ll 601  his sir w scotts eye did in fact kindle at them for the lines places forsaken now and the two that follow were adopted from a poem of mine which nearly forty years ago was in part read to him and he never forgot them            old helvellyns brow     where once together in his day of strength     we stood rejoicing ll 624  sir hy davy was with us at the time we had ascended from paterdale and i could not but admire the vigour with which scott scrambled along that horn of the mountain called striding edge our progress was necessarily slow and beguiled by scotts telling many stories and amusing anecdotes as was his custom sir h davy would have probably been better pleased if other topics had occasionally been interspersed and some discussion entered upon at all events he did not remain with us long at the top of the mountain but left us to find our way down its steep side together into the vale of grasmere where at my cottage mrs scott was to meet us at dinner he said      when i am there although tis fair     twill be another yarrow  see among these notes the one upon yarrow revisited in the printed notes there is the following farther reference to the touching quotation by scottthese words were quoted to me from yarrow unvisited by sir walter scott when i visited him at abbotsford a day or two before his departure for italy and the affecting condition in which he was when he looked upon rome from the janicular mount was reported to me by a lady who had the honour of conducting him thither   298     a few short steps painful they were apart from     tassos conventhaven and retired gravell 835  this though introduced here i did not know till it was told me at rome by miss mackenzie of seaforth a lady whose friendly attentions during my residence at rome i have gratefully acknowledged with expressions of sincere regret that she is no more miss m told me that she had accompanied sir walter to the janicular mount and after showing him the grave of tasso in the church upon the top and a mural monument there erected to his memory they left the church and stood together on the brow of the hill overlooking the city of rome his daughter anne was with them and she naturally desirous for the sake of miss mackenzie especially to have some expression of pleasure from her father half reproached him for showing nothing of that kind either by his looks or voice how can i replied he having only one leg to stand upon and that in extreme pain so that the prophecy was more than fulfilled   299 over waves rough and deep line 122  we took boat near the lighthouse at the point of the right horn of the bay which makes a sort of natural port for genoa but the wind was high and the waves long and rough so that i did not feel quite recompensed by the view of the city splendid as it was for the danger apparently incurred the boatman i had only one encouraged me saying we were quite safe but i was not a little glad when we gained the shore though shelley and byronone of them at least who seemed to have courted agitation from every quarterwould have probably rejoiced in such a situation more than once i believe were they both in extreme danger even on the lake of geneva every man however has his fears of some kind or other and no doubt they had theirs of all men whom i have ever known coleridge had the most of passive courage in bodily trial but no one was so easily cowed when moral firmness was required in miscellaneous conversation or in the daily intercourse of social life   300      how lovelydidst thou appear savona ll 20911  there is not a single bay along this beautiful coast that might not raise in a traveller a wish to take up his abode there each as it succeeds seems more inviting than the other but the desolated convent on the cliff in the bay of savona struck my fancy most and had i for the sake of my own health or of that of a dear friend or any other cause been desirous of a residence abroad i should have let my thoughts loose upon a scheme of turning some part of this building into a habitation provided as far as might be with english comforts there is close by it a row or avenue i forget which of tall cypresses i could not forbear saying to myself what a sweet family walk or one for lonely musings would be found under the shade but there probably the trees remain little noticed and seldom enjoyed   301 p this flowering brooms dear neighbourhood l 378 p  the broom is a great ornament through the months of march and april to the vales and hills of the apennines in the wild part of which it blows in the utmost profusion and of course successively at different elevations as the season advances it surpasses ours in beauty and fragrance but speaking from my own limited observation only i cannot affirm the same of several of their wild spring flowers the primroses in particular which i saw not unfrequently but thinly scattered and languishing as compared with ours   302 the religious movement in the english church  in the printed notes there is the following on aquapendente it would be ungenerous not to advert to the religious movement that since the composition of these verses in 1837 has made itself felt more or less strongly throughout the english church a movement that takes for its first principle a devout deference to the voice of christian antiquity it is not my office to pass judgment on questions of theological detail but my own repugnance to the spirit and system of romanism has been so repeatedly and i trust feelingly expressed that i shall not be suspected of a leaning that way if i do not join in the grave charges thrown out perhaps in the heat of controversy against the learned and pious men to whose labours i allude i speak apart from controversy but with a strong faith in the moral temper which would elevate the present by doing reverence to the past i would draw cheerful auguries for the english church from this movement as likely to restore among us a tone of piety more earnest and real than that produced by the mere formalities of the understanding refusing in a degree which i cannot but lament that its own temper and judgment shall be controlled by those of antiquity from the if mss we learn that the preceding note was written by the rev fw faber dd as thus the note at the close of the poem upon the oxford movement was intrusted to my friend mr frederick faber i told him what i wished to be said and begged that as he was intimately acquainted with several of the leaders of it he would express my thought in the way least likely to be taken amiss by them much of the work they are undertaking was grievously wanted and god grant their endeavours may continue to prosper as they have done   302a the pinetree of monte mario ii  rescued by sir g beaumont from destruction sir g beaumont told me that when he first visited italy pinetrees of this species abounded but that on his return thither which was more than thirty years after they had disappeared from many places where he had been accustomed to admire them and had become rare all over the country especially in and about rome several roman villas have within these few years passed into the hands of foreigners who i observed with pleasure have taken care to plant this tree which in course of years will become a great ornament to the city and to the general landscape  may i venture to add here that having ascended the monte mario i could not resist embracing the trunk of this interesting monument of my departed friends feelings for the beauties of nature and the power of that art which he loved so much and in the practice of which he was so distinguished  among the printed notes is the followingwithin a couple of hours of my arrival at rome i saw from monte pincio the pinetree as described in the sonnet and while expressing admiration at the beauty of its appearance i was told by an acquaintance of my fellowtraveller who happened to join us at the moment that a price had been paid for it by the late sir g beaumont upon condition that the proprietor should not act upon his known intention of cutting it down   303 is this ye gods iii l 1  sight is at first a sad enemy to imagination and to those pleasures belonging to old times with which some exertions of that power will always mingle nothing perhaps brings this truth home to the feelings more than the city of rome not so much in respect to the impression made at the moment when it is first seen and looked at as a whole for then the imagination may be invigorated and the minds eye quickened to perceive as much as that of the imagination but when particular spots or objects are sought out disappointment is i believe invariably felt ability to recover from this disappointment will exist in proportion to knowledge and the power of the mind to reconstruct out of fragments and parts and to make details in the present subservient to more adequate comprehension of the past   304 at rome      they who have seen the noble romans scorn vii l 1  i have a private interest in this sonnet for i doubt whether it would ever have been written but for the lively picture given me by anna ricketts of what they had witnessed of the indignation and sorrow expressed by some italian noblemen of their acquaintance upon the surrender which circumstances had obliged them to make of the best portion of their family mansions to strangers   305 at albano ix  this sonnet is founded on simple fact and was written to enlarge if possible the views of those who can see nothing but evil in the intercessions countenanced by the church of rome that they are in many respects lamentably pernicious must be acknowledged but on the other hand they who reflect while they see and observe cannot but be struck with instances which will prove that it is a great error to condemn in all cases such mediation as purely idolatrous this remark bears with especial force upon addresses to the virgin   306 cuckoo at laverna xiv  may 25th 1837 among a thousand delightful feelings connected in my mind with the voice of the cuckoo there is a personal one which is rather melancholy i was first convinced that age had rather dulled my hearing by not being able to catch the sound at the same distance as the younger companions of my walks and of this failure i had proof upon the occasion that suggested these verses i did not hear the sound till mr robinson had twice or thrice directed my attention to it   307 camaldoli xv  this famous sanctuary was the original establishment of saint romualdo or rumwald as our ancestors saxonised the name in the 11th century the ground campo being given by a count maldo the camaldolensi however have spread wide as a branch of benedictines and may therefore be classed among the gentlemen of the monastic orders the society comprehends two orders monks and hermits symbolised by their arms two doves drinking out of the same cup the monastery in which the monks here reside is beautifully situated but a large unattractive edifice not unlike a factory the hermitage is placed in a loftier and wilder region of the forest it comprehends between 20 and 30 distinct residences each including for its single hermit an inclosed piece of ground and three very small apartments there are days of indulgence when the hermit may quit his cell and when old age arrives he descends from the mountain and takes his abode among the monks  my companion had in the year 1831 fallen in with the monk the subject of these two sonnets who showed him his abode among the hermits it is from him that i received the following particulars he was then about 40 years of age but his appearance was that of an older man he had been a painter by profession but on taking orders changed his name from santi to raffaello perhaps with an unconscious reference as well to the great sanzio durbino as to the archangel he assured my friend that he had been 13 years in the hermitage and had never known melancholy or ennui in the little recess for study and prayer there was a small collection of books i read only said he books of asceticism and mystical theology on being asked the names of the most famous mystics he enumerated scaramelli san giovanni della croce st dionysius the areopayite supposing the work which bears his name to be really his and with peculiar emphasis ricardo di san vittori the works of saint theresa are also in high repute among ascetics these names may interest some of my readers  we heard that raffaello was then living in the convent my friend sought in vain to renew his acquaintance with him it was probably a day of seclusion the reader will perceive that these sonnets were supposed to be written when he was a young man   308 monkvisitors of camaldoli      what aim had they the pair of monks xvii l 1  in justice to the benedictines of camaldoli by whom strangers are so hospitably entertained i feel obliged to notice that i saw among them no other figures at all resembling in size and complexion the two monks described in this sonnet what was their office or the motive which brought them to this place of mortification which they could not have approached without being carried in this or some other way a feeling of delicacy prevented me from inquiring an account has before been given of the hermitage they were about to enter it was visited by us towards the end of the month of may yet snow was lying thick under the pinetrees within a few yards of the gate   309 at vallombrosa xviii  i must confess though of course i did not acknowledge it in the few lines i wrote in the strangers book kept at the convent that i was somewhat disappointed at vallombrosa i had expected as the name implies a deep and narrow valley overshadowed by enclosing hills but the spot where the convent stands is in fact not a valley at all but a cove or crescent open to an extensive prospect in the book before mentioned i read the notice in the english language that if any one would ascend the steep ground above the convent and wander over it he would be abundantly rewarded by magnificent views i had not time to act upon the recommendation and only went with my young guide to a point nearly on a level with the site of the convent that overlooks the vale of arno for some leagues  to praise great and good men has ever been deemed one of the worthiest employments of poetry but the objects of admiration vary so much with time and circumstances and the noblest of mankind have been found when intimately known to be of characters so imperfect that no eulogist can find a subject which he will venture upon with the animation necessary to create sympathy unless he confines himself to a particular act or he takes something of a onesided view of the person he is disposed to celebrate this is a melancholy truth and affords a strong reason for the poetic mind being chiefly exercised in works of fiction the poet can then follow wherever the spirit of admiration leads him unchecked by such suggestions as will be too apt to cross his way if all that he is prompted to utter is to be tested by fact something in this spirit i have written in the note attached to the sonnet on the king of sweden and many will think that in this poem and elsewhere i have spoken of the author of paradise lost in a strain of panegyric scarcely justifiable by the tenour of some of his opinions whether theological or political and by the temper he carried into public affairs in which unfortunately for his genius he was so much concerned  among the printed notes is thisthe name of milton is pleasingly connected with vallombrosa in many ways the pride with which the monk without any previous question from me pointed out his residence i shall not readily forget it may be proper here to defend the poet from a charge which has been brought against him in respect to the passage in paradise lost where this place is mentioned it is said that he has erred in speaking of the trees there being deciduous whereas they are in fact pines the faultfinders are themselves mistaken the natural woods of the region of vallombrosa are deciduous and spread to a great extent those near the convent are indeed mostly pines but they are avenues of trees planted within a few steps of each other and thus composing large tracts of wood plots of which are periodically cut down the appearance of those narrow avenues upon steep slopes open to the sky on account of the height which the trees attain by being forced to grow upwards is often very impressive my guide a boy of about fourteen years old pointed this out to me in several places   310 sonnet at florence xix      under the shadow of a stately pile  upon what evidence the belief rests that this stone was a favourite seat of dante i do not know but a man would little consult his own interest as a traveller if he should busy himself with doubts as to the fact the readiness with which traditions of this character are received and the fidelity with which they are preserved from generation to generation are an evidence of feelings honourable to our nature i remember now during one of my rambles in the course of a college vacation i was pleased at being shown at  a seat near a kind of rocky cell at the source of the river  on which it was said that congreve wrote his old bachelor one can scarcely hit on any performance less in harmony with the scene but it was a local tribute paid to intellect by those who had not troubled themselves to estimate the moral worth of that authors comedies and why should they he was a man distinguished in his day and the sequestered neighbourhood in which he often resided was perhaps as proud of him as florence of her dante it is the same feeling though proceeding from persons one cannot bring together in this way without offering some apology to the shade of the great visionary   311 the baptist xx  it was very hot weather during the week we stayed at florence and having never been there before i went through much hard service and am not therefore ashamed to confess i fell asleep before this picture and sitting with my back towards the venus de medicis buonaparte in answer to one who had spoken of his being in a sound sleep up to the moment when one of his great battles was to be fought as a proof of the calmness of his mind and command over anxious thoughts said frankly that he slept because from bodily exhaustion he could not help it in like manner it is noticed that criminals on the night previous to their execution seldom awake before they are called a proof that the body is the master of us far more than we need be willing to allow  should this note by any possible chance be seen by any of my countrymen who might have been in the gallery at the time and several persons were there and witnessed such an indecorum i hope he will give up the opinion which he might naturally have formed to my prejudice   312 florence      rapt above earth and the following one xxiii  however at first these two sonnets from m angelo may seem in their spirit somewhat inconsistent with each other i have not scrupled to place them side by side as characteristic of their great author and others with whom he lived i feel nevertheless a wish to know at what periods of his life they were respectively composed the latter as it expresses was written in his advanced years when it was natural that the platonism that pervades the one should give way to the christian feeling that inspired the other between both there is more than poetic affinity   312a among the ruins of a convent in the apennines xxiii  the political revolutions of our time have multiplied on the continent objects that unavoidably call forth reflections such as are expressed in these verses but the ruins in those countries are too recent to exhibit in anything like an equal degree the beauty with which time and nature have invested the remains of our convents and abbeys these verses it will be observed take up the beauty long before it is matured as one cannot but wish it may be among some of the desolations of italy france and germany   313 sonnets after leaving italy xxv  i had proof in several instances that the carbonari if i may still call them so and their favourers are opening their eyes to the necessity of patience and are intent upon spreading knowledge actively but quietly as they can may they have resolution to continue in this course for it is the only one by which they can truly benefit their country  we left italy by the way which is called the nuova strada dallemagna to the east of the high passes of the alps which take you at once from italy into switzerland the road leads across several smaller heights and winds down different vales in succession so that it was only by the accidental sound of a few german words i was aware we had quitted italy and hence the unwelcome shock alluded to in the two or three last lines of the sonnet with which this imperfect series concludes   314 composed at rydal on may morning 1838  this and the following sonnet now xxvi were composed on what we call the far terrace at rydal mount where i have murmured out many thousands of my verses   315 pillar of trajan xxviii  these verses had better perhaps be transferred to the class of italian poems i had observed in the newspaper that the pillar of trajan was given as a subject for a prize poem in english verse i had a wish perhaps that my son who was then an undergraduate at oxford should try his fortune and i told him so but he not having been accustomed to write verse wisely declined to enter on the task whereupon i showed him these lines as a proof of what might without difficulty be done on such a subject   316 the egyptian maid  in addition to the short notice prefixed to this poem it may be worth while here to say that it rose out of a few words casually used in conversation by my nephew henry hutchinson he was describing with great spirit the appearance and movement of a vessel which he seemed to admire more than any other he had ever seen and said her name was the water lily this plant has been my delight from my boyhood as i have seen it floating on the lake and that conversation put me upon constructing and composing the poem had i not heard those words it would never have been written the form of the stanza is new and is nothing but a repetition of the first five lines as they were thrown off and is perhaps not well suited to narrative and certainly would not have been trusted to had i thought at the beginning that the poem would have gone to such a length the short note referred to supra is as follows for the names and persons in the following poem see the history of the renowned prince arthur and his knights of the round table for the rest the author is answerable only it may be proper to add that the lotus with the bust of the goddess appearing to rise out of the fullblown flower was suggested by the beautiful work of ancient art once included among the townley marbles and now in the british museum     xiii the river duddon a series of sonnets   317 introduction  the river duddon rises upon wrynose fell on the confines of westmoreland cumberland and lancashire and having served as a boundary to the two last counties for the space of about twentyfive miles enters the irish sea between the isle of walney and the lordship of millum   318 the river duddon  a poet whose works are not yet known as they deserve to be thus enters upon his description of the ruins of rome                  the rising sun     flames on the ruins in the purer air     towering aloft  and ends thus                  the setting sun displays     his visible great round between yon towers     as through two shady cliffs  mr crowe in his excellent locodescriptive poem lewesdon hill is still more expeditious finishing the whole on a maymorning before breakfast      tomorrow for severer thought but now     to breakfast and keep festival today  no one believes or is desired to believe that those poems were actually composed within such limits of time nor was there any reason why a prose statement should acquaint the reader with the plain fact to the disturbance of poetic credibility but in the present case i am compelled to mention that the above series of sonnets was the growth of many yearsthe one which stands the 14th was the first produced and others were added upon occasional visits to the stream or as recollections of the scenes upon its banks awakened a wish to describe them in this manner i had proceeded insensibly without perceiving that i was trespassing upon ground preoccupied at least as far as intention went by mr coleridge who more than twenty years ago used to speak of writing a rural poem to be entitled the brook of which he has given a sketch in a recent publication but a particular subject cannot i think much interfere with a general one and i have been further kept from encroaching upon any right mr c may still wish to exercise by the restriction which the frame of the sonnet imposed upon me narrowing unavoidably the range of thought and precluding though not without its advantages many graces to which a freer movement of verse would naturally have led  may i not venture then to hope that instead of being a hindrance by anticipation of any part of the subject these sonnets may remind mr coleridge of his own more comprehensive design and induce him to fulfil itthere is a sympathy in streamsone calleth to another and i would gladly believe that the brook will ere long murmur in concert with the duddon but asking pardon for this fancy i need not scruple to say that those verses must indeed be illfated which can enter upon such pleasant walks of nature without receiving and giving inspiration the power of waters over the minds of poets has been acknowledged from the earliest agesthrough the flumina amem sylvasque inglorius of virgil down to the sublime apostrophe to the great rivers of the earth by armstrong and the simple ejaculation of burns chosen if i recollect right by mr coleridge as a motto for his embryo brook      the muse nae poet ever fand her     till by himsel he learned to wander     adown some trotting burns meander     and na think lang   319 the sonnets on the river duddon  it is with the little river duddon as it is with most other rivers ganges and nile not exceptedmany springs might claim the honour of being its head in my own fancy i have fixed its rise near the noted shire stones placed at the meeting point of the counties westmoreland cumberland and lancashire they stand by the wayside on the top of the wrynose pass and it used to be reckoned a proud thing to say that by touching them at the same time with feet and hands one had been in three counties at once at what point of its course the stream takes the name of duddon i do not know i first became acquainted with the duddon as i have good reason to remember in early boyhood upon the banks of the derwent i had learnt to be very fond of angling fish abound in that large rivernot so in the small streams in the neighbourhood of hawkshead and i fell into the common delusion that the farther from home the better sport would be had accordingly one day i attached myself to a person living in the neighbourhood of hawkshead who was going to try his fortune as an angler near the source of the duddon we fished a great part of the day with very sorry success the rain pouring torrents and long before we got home i was worn out with fatigue and if the good man had not carried me on his back i must have lain down under the best shelter i could find little did i think then it would have been my lot to celebrate in a strain of love and admiration the stream which for many years i never thought of without recollections of disappointment and distress  during my college vacation and two or three years afterwards before taking my bachelors degree i was several times resident in the house of a near relative who lived in the small town of broughton i passed many delightful hours upon the banks of this river which becomes an estuary about a mile from that place the remembrances of that period are the subject of the 21st sonnet the subject of the 27th sonnet is in fact taken from a tradition belonging to rydal hall which once stood as is believed upon a rocky and woody hill on the right hand as you go from rydal to ambleside and was deserted from the superstitious fear here described and the present site fortunately chosen instead the present hall was erected by sir michael le fleming and it may be hoped that at some future time there will be an edifice more worthy of so beautiful a position with regard to the 30th sonnet it is odd enough that this imagination was realised in the year 1840 when i made a tour through this district with my wife and daughter miss fenwick and her niece and mr and miss quillinan before our return from seathwaite chapel the party separated mrs wordsworth while most of us went further up the stream chose an opposite direction having told us that we would overtake her on our way to ulpha but she was tempted out of the main road to ascend a rocky eminence near it thinking it impossible we should pass without seeing her this however unfortunately happened and then ensued vexation and distress especially to me which i should be ashamed to have recorded for i lost my temper entirely neither i nor those who were with me saw her again till we reached the inn at broughton seven miles this may perhaps in some degree excuse my irritability on the occasion for i could not but think she had been much to blame it appeared however on explanation that she had remained on the rock calling out and waving her handkerchief as we were passing in order that we also might ascend and enjoy a prospect which had much charmed her but on we went her signals proving vain how then could she reach broughton before us when we found she had not gone on to ulpha kirk mr quillinan went back in one of the carriages in search of her he met her on the road took her up and by a shorter way conveyed her to broughton where we were all reunited and spent a happy evening  i have many affecting remembrances connected with this stream these i forbear to mention especially things that occurred on its banks during the latter part of that visit to the seaside of which the former part is detailed in my epistle to sir george beaumont  the following additional notices of his latter excursion to the banks of the duddon are from a letter to lady frederick bentinck  you will

abbey wastdale eskdale the vale of duddon broughton furness abbey peele castle ulverston c we had broken weather which kept us long upon the road but we had also very fine intervals and i often wished you had been present we had such glorious sights one in particular i never saw the like of about sunset we were directly opposite that large lofty precipice at wastwater which is called the screes the ridge of it is broken into sundry points and along them and partly along the side of the steep went driving a procession of yellow vapoury clouds from the seaquarter towards the mountain scawfell their colours i have called yellow but it was exquisitely varied and the shapes of the rocks on the summit of the ridge varied with the density or thinness of the vapours the effect was most enchanting for right above was steadfastly fixed a beautiful rainbow we were a party of seven mrs wordsworth my daughter and miss fenwick included and it would be difficult to say who was most delighted the abbey of furness as you well know is a noble ruin and most happily situated in a dell that entirely hides it from the surrounding country it is taken excellent care of and seems little

the foregoing sonnets which together may be considered as a poem will not be displeased to find in this place a prose account of the duddon extracted from greens comprehensive guide to the lakes lately published the road leading from coniston to broughton is over high ground and commands a view of the river duddon which at high water is a grand sight having the beautiful and fertile lands of

traveller would be most gratified who should approach this beautiful stream neither at its source as is done in the sonnets nor from its termination but from coniston over walna scar first descending into a little circular valley a collateral compartment of the long winding vale through which flows the duddon this recess towards the close of september when the aftergrass of the meadow is still of a fresh green with the leaves of many of the trees faded but perhaps none fallen is truly enchanting at a point elevated enough to show the various objects in the valley and not so high as to diminish their importance the stranger will instinctively halt on the foreground a little below the most favourable station a rude footbridge is thrown over the bed of the noisy brook foaming by the wayside russet and craggy hills of bold and varied outline surround the level valley which is besprinkled with grey rocks plumed with birch trees a few homesteads are interspersed in some places peeping out from among the rocks like hermitages whose site has been chosen for the benefit of sunshine as well as shelter in other instances the dwellinghouse barn and byre compose together a cruciform structure which with its embowering trees and the ivy clothing part of the walls and roof like a fleece call to mind the remains of an ancient abbey time in most cases and nature everywhere have given a sanctity to the humble works of man that are scattered over this peaceful retirement hence a harmony of tone and colour a consummation and perfection of beauty which would have been marred had aim or purpose interfered with the course of convenience utility or necessity this unvitiated region stands in no need of the veil of twilight to soften or disguise its features as it glistens in the morning sunshine it would fill the spectators heart with gladsomeness looking from our chosen station he would feel an impatience to rove among its pathways to be greeted by the milkmaid to wander from house to house exchanging goodmorrows as he passed the open doors but at evening when the sun is set and a pearly light gleams from the western quarter of the sky with an answering light from the smooth surface of the meadows when the trees are dusky but each kind still distinguishable when the cool air has condensed the blue smoke rising from the cottage chimneys when the dark mossy stones seem to sleep in the bed of the foaming brook then he would be unwilling to move forward not less from a reluctance to relinquish what he beholds than from an apprehension of disturbing by his approach the quietness beneath him issuing from the plain of this valley the brook descends in a rapid torrent passing by the churchyard of seathwaite the traveller is thus conducted at once into the midst of the wild and beautiful scenery which gave occasion to the sonnets from the 14th to the 20th inclusive from the point where the seathwaite brook joins the duddon is a view upwards into the pass through which the river makes its way into the plain of donnerdale the perpendicular rock on the right bears the ancient british name of the pen the one opposite is called wallabarrow crag a name that occurs in other places to designate rocks of the same character the chaotic aspect of the scene is well marked by the expression of a stranger who strolled out while dinner was preparing and at his return being asked by his host what way he had been wandering replied as far as it is finished  the bed of the duddon is here strewn with large fragments of rocks fallen from aloft which as mr green truly says are happily adapted to the manyshaped waterfalls or rather waterbreaks for none of them are high displayed in the short space of half a mile that there is some hazard in frequenting these desolate places i myself have had proof for one night an immense mass of rock fell upon the very spot where with a friend i had lingered the day before the concussion says mr green speaking of the event for he also in the practice of his art on that day sat exposed for a still longer time to the same peril was heard not without alarm by the neighbouring shepherds but to return to seathwaite

curate of      seathwaite sixtysix years he was a man singular for his      temperance industry and integrity  this individual is the pastor alluded to in the eighteenth sonnet as a worthy compeer of the country parson of chaucer c in the seventh book of the excursion an abstract of his character is given beginning      a priest abides before whose life such doubts     fall to the ground  and some account of his life for it is worthy of being recorded will not be out of place here   322 memoir of the rev robert walker  pastor in book vii of the excursion  in the year 1709 robert walker was born at undercrag in seathwaite he was the youngest of twelve children his eldest brother who inherited the small family estate died at undercrag aged ninetyfour being twentyfour years older than the subject of this memoir who was born of the same mother robert was a sickly infant and through his boyhood and youth continuing to be of delicate frame and tender health it was deemed best according to the country phrase to breed him a scholar for it was not likely that he would be able to earn a livelihood by bodily labour at that period few of these dales were furnished with schoolhouses the children being taught to read and write in the chapel and in the same consecrated building where he officiated for so many years both as preacher and schoolmaster he himself received the rudiments of his education in his youth he became schoolmaster at loweswater not being called upon probably in that situation to teach more than reading writing and arithmetic but by the assistance of a gentleman in the neighbourhood he acquired at leisure hours a knowledge of the classics and became qualified for taking holy orders upon his ordination he had the offer of two curacies the one torver in the vale of conistonthe other seathwaite in his native vale the value of each was the same viz five pounds per annum but the cure of seathwaite having a cottage attached to it as he wished to marry he chose it in preference the young person on whom his affections were fixed though in the condition of a domestic servant had given promise by her serious and modest deportment and by her virtuous dispositions that she was worthy to become the helpmate of a man entering upon a plan of life such as he had marked out for himself by her frugality she had stored up a small sum of money with which they began housekeeping in 1735 or 1736 he entered upon his curacy and nineteen years afterwards his situation is thus described in some letters to be found in the annual register for 1760 from which the following is extracted              to mr                                      coniston july 26 1754  siri was the other day upon a party of pleasure about five or six miles from this place where i met with a very striking object and of a nature not very common going into a clergymans house of whom i had frequently heard i found him sitting at the head of a long square table such as is commonly used in this country by the lower class of people dressed in a coarse blue frock trimmed with black horn buttons a checked shirt a leathern strap about his neck for a stock a coarse apron and a pair of great woodensoled shoes plated with iron to preserve them what we call clogs in these parts with a child upon his knee eating his breakfast his wife and the remainder of his children were some of them employed in waiting upon each other the rest in teasing and spinning wool at which trade he is a great proficient and moreover when it is made ready for sale will lay it by sixteen or thirtytwo pounds weight upon his back and on foot seven or eight miles will carry it to the market even in the depth of winter i was not much surprised at all this as you may possibly be having heard a great deal of it related before but i must confess myself astonished with the alacrity and the good humour that appeared both in the clergyman and his wife and more so at the sense and ingenuity of the clergyman himself  then follows a letter from another person dated 1755 from which an extract shall be given  by his frugality and good management he keeps the wolf from the door as we say and if he advances a little in the world it is owing more to his own care than to anything else he has to rely upon i dont find his inclination is running after further preferment he is settled among the people that are happy among themselves and lives in the greatest unanimity and friendship with them and i believe the minister and people are exceedingly satisfied with each other and indeed how should they be dissatisfied when they have a person of so much worth and probity for their pastor a man who for his candour and meekness his sober chaste and virtuous conversation his soundness in principle and practice is an ornament to his profession and an honour to the country he is in and bear with me if i say the plainness of his dress the sanctity of his manners the simplicity of his doctrine and the vehemence of his expression have a sort of resemblance to the pure practice of primitive christianity  we will now give his own account of himself to be found in the same place   from the rev robert walker  siryours of the 26th instant was communicated to me by mr c and i should have returned an immediate answer but the hand of providence then laying heavy upon an amiable pledge of conjugal endearment hath since taken from me a promising girl which the disconsolate mother too pensively laments the loss of though we have yet eight living all healthful hopeful children whose names and ages are as followszaccheus aged almost eighteen years elizabeth sixteen years and ten months mary fifteen moses thirteen years and three months sarah ten years and three months mabel eight years and three months william tyson three years and eight months and anne esther one year and three months besides anne who died two years and six months ago and was then aged between nine and ten and eleanor who died the 23d inst january aged six years and ten months zaccheus the eldest child is now learning the trade of tanner and has two years and a half of his apprenticeship to serve the annual income of my chapel at present as near as i can compute it may amount to about 17l of which is paid in cash viz 5l from the bounty of queen anne and 5l from wp esq of p out of the annual rents he being lord of the manor and 3l from the several inhabitants of l settled upon the tenements as a rentcharge the house and gardens i value at 4l yearly and not worth more and i believe the surplice fees and voluntary contributions one year with another may be worth 3l but as the inhabitants are few in number and the fees very low this lastmentioned sum consists merely in freewill offerings  i am situated greatly to my satisfaction with regard to the conduct and behaviour of my auditory who not only live in the happy ignorance of the follies and vices of the age but in mutual peace and goodwill with one another and are seemingly i hope really too sincere christians and sound members of the established church not one dissenter of any denomination being amongst them all i got to the value of 40l for my wifes fortune but had no real estate of my own being the youngest son of twelve children born of obscure parents and though my income has been but small and my family large yet by a providential blessing upon my own diligent endeavours the kindness of friends and a cheap country to live in we have always had the necessaries of life by what i have written which is a true and exact account to the best of my knowledge i hope you will not think your favour to me out of the late worthy dr stratfords effects quite misbestowed for which i must ever gratefully own myself  sir your much obliged and most obedient humble servant                        rw curate of s  to mr c of lancaster  about the time when this letter was written the bishop of chester recommended the scheme of joining the curacy of ulpha to the contiguous one of seathwaite and the nomination was offered to mr walker but an unexpected difficulty arising mr w in a letter to the bishop a copy of which in his own beautiful handwriting now lies before me thus expresses himself if he meaning the person in whom the difficulty originated had suggested any such objection before i should utterly have declined any attempt to the curacy of ulpha indeed i was always apprehensive it might be disagreeable to my auditory at seathwaite as they have been always accustomed to double duty and the inhabitants of ulpha despair of being able to support a schoolmaster who is not curate there also which suppressed all thoughts in me of serving them both and in a second letter to the bishop he writes  my lordi have the favour of yours of the 1st instant and am exceedingly obliged on account of the ulpha affair if that curacy should lapse into your lordships hands i would beg leave rather to decline than embrace it for the chapels of seathwaite and ulpha annexed together would be apt to cause a general discontent among the inhabitants of both places by either thinking themselves slighted being only served alternately or neglected in the duty or attributing it to covetousness in me all which occasions of murmuring i would willingly avoid and in concluding his former letter he expresses a similar sentiment upon the same occasion desiring if it be possible however as much as in me lieth to live peaceably with all men                                       the year following the curacy of seathwaite was again augmented and to effect this augmentation fifty pounds had been advanced by himself and in 1760 lands were purchased with eight hundred pounds scanty as was his income the frequent offer of much better benefices could not tempt mr w to quit a situation where he had been so long happy with a consciousness of being useful among his papers i find the following copy of a letter dated 1775 twenty years after his refusal of the curacy of ulpha which will show what exertions had been made for one of his sons   may it please your graceour remote situation here makes it difficult to get the necessary information for transacting business regularly such is the reason of my giving your grace the present trouble  the bearer my son is desirous of offering himself candidate for deacons orders at your graces ensuing ordination the first on the 25th instant so that his papers could not be transmitted in due time as he is now fully at age and i have afforded him education to the utmost of my ability it would give me great satisfaction if your grace would take him and find him qualified to have him ordained his constitution has been tender for some years he entered the college of dublin but his health would not permit him to continue there or i would have supported him much longer he has been with me at home above a year in which time he has gained great strength of body sufficient i hope to enable him for performing the function divine providence assisted by liberal benefactors has blest my endeavours from a small income to rear a numerous family and as my time of life renders me now unfit for much future expectancy from this world i should be glad to see my son settled in a promising way to acquire an honest livelihood for himself his behaviour so far in life has been irreproachable and i hope he will not degenerate in principles or practice from the precepts and pattern of an indulgent parent your graces favourable reception of this from a distant corner of the diocese and an obscure hand will excite filial gratitude and a due use shall be made of the obligation vouchsafed thereby to  your graces very dutiful and most obedient son and servant robert walker   the same man who was thus liberal in the education of his numerous family was even munificent in hospitality as a parish priest every sunday were served upon the long table at which he has been described sitting with a child upon his knee messes of broth for the refreshment of those of his congregation who came from a distance and usually took their seats as parts of his own household it seems scarcely possible that this custom could have commenced before the augmentation of his cure and what would to many have been a high price of selfdenial was paid by the pastor and his family for this gratification as the treat could only be provided by dressing at one time the whole perhaps of their weekly allowance of fresh animal food consequently for a succession of days the table was covered with cold victuals only his generosity in old age may be still further illustrated by a little circumstance relating to an orphan grandson then ten years of age which i find in a copy of a letter to one of his sons he requests that half a guinea may be left for little roberts pocketmoney who was then at school intrusting it to the care of a lady who as he says may sometimes frustrate his squandering it away foolishly and promising to send him an equal allowance annually for the same purpose the conclusion of the same letter is so characteristic that i cannot forbear to transcribe it we meaning his wife and himself are in our wonted state of health allowing for the hasty strides of old age knocking daily at our door and threateningly telling us we are not only mortal but must expect ere long to take our leave of our ancient cottage and lie down in our last dormitory pray pardon my neglect to answer yours let us hear sooner from you to augment the mirth of the christmas holidays wishing you all the pleasures of the approaching season i am dear son with lasting sincerity yours affectionately  robert walker   he loved old customs and old usages and in some instances stuck to them to his own loss for having had a sum of money lodged in the hands of a neighbouring tradesman when long course of time had raised the rate of interest and more was offered he refused to accept it an act not difficult to one who while he was drawing seventeen pounds a year from his curacy declined as we have seen to add the profits of another small benefice to his own lest he should be suspected of cupidityfrom this vice he was utterly free he made no charge for teaching school such as could afford to pay gave him what they pleased when very young having kept a diary of his expenses however trifling the large amount at the end of the year surprised him and from that time the rule of his life was to be economical not avaricious at his decease he left behind him no less a sum than 2000l and such a sense of his various excellencies was prevalent in the country that the epithet of wonderful is to this day attached to his name  there is in the above sketch something so extraordinary as to require further explanatory detailsand to begin with his industry eight hours in each day during five days in the week and half of saturday except when the labours of husbandry were urgent he was occupied in teaching his seat was within the rails of the altar the communion table was his desk and like shenstones schoolmistress the master employed himself at the spinningwheel while the children were repeating their lessons by his side every evening after school hours if not more profitably engaged he continued the same kind of labour exchanging for the benefit of exercise the small wheel at which he had sate for the large one on which wool is spun the spinner stepping to and fro thus was the wheel constantly in readiness to prevent the waste of a moments time nor was his industry with the pen when occasion called for it less eager intrusted with extensive management of public and private affairs he acted in his rustic neighbourhood as scrivener writing out petitions deeds of conveyance wills covenants c with pecuniary gain to himself and to the great benefit of his employers these labours at all times considerable at one period of the year viz between christmas and candlemas when money transactions are settled in this country were often so intense that he passed great part of the night and sometimes whole nights at his desk his garden also was tilled by his own hand he had a right of pasturage upon the mountains for a few sheep and a couple of cows which required his attendance with this pastoral occupation he joined the labours of husbandry upon a small scale renting two or three acres in addition to his own less than one acre of glebe and the humblest drudgery which the cultivation of these fields required was performed by himself  he also assisted his neighbours in haymaking and shearing their flocks and in the performance of this latter service he was eminently dexterous they in their turn complimented him with the present of a haycock or a fleece less as a recompence for this particular service than as a general acknowledgment the sabbath was in a strict sense kept holy the sunday evenings being devoted to reading the scripture and family prayer the principal festivals appointed by the church were also duly observed but through every other day in the week through every week in the year he was incessantly occupied in work of hand or mind not allowing a moment for recreation except upon a saturday afternoon when he indulged himself with a newspaper or sometimes with a magazine the frugality and temperance established in his house were as admirable as the industry nothing to which the name of luxury could be given was there known in the latter part of his life indeed when tea had been brought into almost general use it was provided for visitors and for such of his own family as returned occasionally to his roof and had been accustomed to this refreshment elsewhere but neither he nor his wife ever partook of it the raiment worn by his family was comely and decent but as simple as their diet the homespun materials were made up into apparel by their own hands at the time of the decease of this thrifty pair their cottage contained a large store of webs of woollen and linen cloth woven from thread of their own spinning and it is remarkable that the pew in the chapel in which the family used to sit remains neatly lined with woollen cloth spun by the pastors own hands it is the only pew in the chapel so distinguished and i know of no other instance of his conformity to the delicate accommodations of modern times the fuel of the house like that of their neighbours consisted of peat procured from the mosses by their own labour the lights by which in the winter evenings their work was performed were of their own manufacture such as still continue to be used in these cottages they are made of the pith of rushes dipped in any unctuous substance that the house affords white candles as tallow candles are here called were reserved to honour the christmas festivals and were perhaps produced upon no other occasions once a month during the proper season a sheep was drawn from their small mountain flock and killed for the use of the family and a cow towards the close of the year was salted and dried for winter provision the hide was tanned to furnish them with shoesby these various resources this venerable clergyman reared a numerous family not only preserving them as he affectingly says from wanting the necessaries of life but affording them an unstinted education and the means of raising themselves in society in this they were eminently assisted by the effects of their fathers example his precepts and injunctions he was aware that truthspeaking as a moral virtue is best secured by inculcating attention to accuracy of report even on trivial occasions and so rigid were the rules of honesty by which he endeavoured to bring up his family that if one of them had chanced to find in the lanes or fields anything of the least use or value without being able to ascertain to whom it belonged he always insisted upon the childs carrying it back to the place from which it had been brought  no one it might be thought could as has been described convert his body into a machine as it were of industry for the humblest uses and keep his thoughts so frequently bent upon secular concerns without grievous injury to the more precious parts of his nature how could the powers of intellect thrive or its graces be displayed in the midst of circumstances apparently so unfavourable and where to the direct cultivation of the mind so small a portion of time was allotted but in this extraordinary man things in their nature adverse were reconciled his conversation was remarkable not only for being chaste and pure but for the degree in which it was fervent and eloquent his written style was correct simple and animated nor did his affections suffer more than his intellect he was tenderly alive to all the duties of his pastoral office the poor and needy he never sent empty awaythe stranger was fed and refreshed in passing that unfrequented valethe sick were visited and the feelings of humanity found further exercise among the distresses and embarrassments in the worldly estate of his neighbours with which his talents for business made him acquainted and the disinterestedness impartiality and uprightness which he maintained in the management of all affairs confided to him were virtues seldom separated in his own conscience from religious obligation nor could such conduct fail to remind those who witnessed it of a spirit nobler than law or custom they felt convictions which but for such intercourse could not have been afforded that as in the practice of their pastor there was no guile so in his faith there was nothing hollow and we are warranted in believing that upon these occasions selfishness obstinacy and discord would often give way before the breathings of his goodwill and saintly integrity it may be presumed alsowhile his humble congregation were listening to the moral precepts which he delivered from the pulpit and to the christian exhortations that they should love their neighbours as themselves and do as they would be done untothat peculiar efficacy was given to the preachers labours by recollections in the minds of his congregation that they were called upon to do no more than his own actions were daily setting before their eyes  the afternoon service in the chapel was less numerously attended than that of the morning but by a more serious auditory the lesson from the new testament on those occasions was accompanied by burkitts commentaries these lessons he read with impassioned emphasis frequently drawing tears from his hearers and leaving a lasting impression upon their minds his devotional feelings and the powers of his own mind were further exercised along with those of his family in perusing the scriptures not only on the sunday evenings but on every other evening while the rest of the household were at work some one of the children and in her turn the servant for the sake of practice in reading or for instruction read the bible aloud and in this manner the whole was repeatedly gone through that no common importance was attached to the observance of religious ordinances by his family appears from the following memorandum by one of his descendants which i am tempted to insert at length as it is characteristic and somewhat curious there is a small chapel in the county palatine of lancaster where a certain clergyman has regularly officiated above sixty years and a few months ago administered the sacrament of the lords supper in the same to a decent number of devout communicants after the clergyman had received himself the first company out of the assembly who approached the altar and kneeled down to be partakers of the sacred elements consisted of the parsons wife to whom he had been married upwards of sixty years one son and his wife four daughters each with her husband whose ages all added together amount to above 714 years the several and respective distances from the place of each of their abodes to the chapel where they all communicated will measure more than 1000 english miles though the narration will appear surprising it is without doubt a fact that the same persons exactly four years before met at the same place and all joined in performance of the same venerable duty  he was indeed most zealously attached to the doctrine and frame of the established church we have seen him congratulating himself that he had no dissenters in his cure of any denomination some allowance must be made for the state of opinion when his first religious impressions were received before the reader will acquit him of bigotry when i mention that at the time of the augmentation of the cure he refused to invest part of the money in the purchase of an estate offered to him upon advantageous terms because the proprietor was a quakerwhether from scrupulous apprehension that a blessing would not attend a contract framed for the benefit of the church between persons not in religious sympathy with each other or as a seeker of peace he was afraid of the uncomplying disposition which at one time was too frequently conspicuous in that sect of this an instance had fallen under his own notice for while he taught school at loweswater certain persons of that denomination had refused to pay annual interest due under the title of churchstock2 a great hardship upon the incumbent for the curacy of loweswater was then scarcely less poor than that of seathwaite to what degree this prejudice of his was blameable need not be determinedcertain it is that he was not only desirous as he himself says to live in peace but in love with all men he was placable and charitable in his judgments and however correct in conduct and rigorous to himself he was ever ready to forgive the trespasses of others and to soften the censure that was cast upon their frailtiesit would be unpardonable to omit that in the maintenance of his virtues he received due support from the partner of his long life she was equally strict in attending to her share of their joint cares nor less diligent in her appropriate occupations a person who had been some time their servant in the latter part of their lives concluded the panegyric of her mistress by saying to me she was no less excellent than her husband she was good to the poor she was good to every thing he survived for a short time this virtuous companion when she died he ordered that her body should be borne to the grave by three of her daughters and one granddaughter and when the corpse was lifted from the threshold he insisted upon lending his aid and feeling about for he was then almost blind took hold of a napkin fixed to the coffin and as a bearer of the body entered the chapel a few steps from the lowly parsonage  2 mr walkers charity being of that kind which seeketh not her own he would rather forego his rights than distrain for dues which the parties liable refused as a point of conscience to pay  what a contrast does the life of this obscurelyseated and in point of worldly wealth poorlyrepaid churchman present to that of a cardinal wolsey      o tis a burthen cromwell tis a burthen     too heavy for a man who hopes for heaven  we have been dwelling upon images of peace in the moral world that have brought us again to the quiet enclosure of consecrated ground in which this venerable pair lie interred the sounding brook that rolls close by the churchyard without disturbing feeling or meditation is now unfortunately laid bare but not long ago it participated with the chapel the shade of some stately ashtrees which will not spring again while the spectator from this spot is looking round upon the girdle of stony mountains that encompasses the valemasses of rock out of which monuments for all men that ever existed might have been hewnit would surprise him to be told as with truth he might be that the plain blue slab dedicated to the memory of this aged pair is a production of a quarry in north wales it was sent as a mark of respect by one of their descendants from the vale of festiniog a region almost as beautiful as that in which it now lies  upon the seathwaite brook at a small distance from the parsonage has been erected a mill for spinning yarn it is a mean and disagreeable object though not unimportant to the spectator as calling to mind the momentous changes wrought by such inventions in the frame of societychanges which have proved especially unfavourable to these mountain solitudes so much had been effected by those new powers before the subject of the preceding biographical sketch closed his life that their operation could not escape his notice and doubtless excited touching reflections upon the comparatively insignificant results of his own manual industry but robert walker was not a man of times and circumstances had he lived at a later period the principle of duty would have produced application as unremitting the same energy of character would have been displayed though in many instances with widely different effects  with pleasure i annex as illustrative and confirmatory of the above account extracts from a paper in the christian remembrancer october 1819 it bears an assumed signature but is known to be the work of the rev bobert bamford vicar of bishopton in the county of durham a greatgrandson of mr walker whose worth it commemorates by a record not the less valuable for being written in very early youth  his house was a nursery of virtue all the inmates were industrious and cleanly and happy sobriety neatness quietness characterised the whole family no railings no idleness no indulgence of passion were permitted every child ever young had its appointed engagements every hand was busy knitting spinning reading writing mending clothes making shoes were by the different children constantly performing the father himself sitting amongst them and guiding their thoughts was engaged in the same occupations  he sate up late and rose early when the family were at rest he retired to a little room which he had built on the roof of his house he had slated it and fitted it up with shelves for his books his stock of cloth wearing apparel and his utensils there many a cold winters night without fire while the roof was glazed with ice did he remain reading or writing till the day dawned he taught the children in the chapel for there was no schoolhouse yet in that cold damp place he never had a fire he used to send the children in parties either to his own fire at home or make them run up the mountain side                                       it may be further mentioned that he was a passionate admirer of nature she was his mother and he was a dutiful child while engaged on the mountains it was his greatest pleasure to view the rising sun and in tranquil evenings as it slided behind the hills he blessed its departure he was skilled in fossils and plants a constant observer of the stars and winds the atmosphere was his delight he made many experiments on its nature and properties in summer he used to gather a multitude of flies and insects and by his entertaining description amuse and instruct his children they shared all his daily employments and derived many sentiments of love and benevolence from his observations on the works and productions of nature whether they were following him in the field or surrounding him in school he took every opportunity of storing their minds with useful informationnor was the circle of his influence confined to seathwaite many a distant mother has told her child of mr walker and begged him to be as good a man                                       once when i was very young i had the pleasure of seeing and hearing that venerable old man in his 90th year and even then the calmness the force the perspicuity of his sermon sanctified and adorned by the wisdom of grey hairs and the authority of virtue had such an effect upon my mind that i never see a hoaryheaded clergyman without thinking of mr walker he allowed no dissenter or methodist to interfere in the instruction of the souls committed to his cure and so successful were his exertions that he had not one dissenter of any denomination whatever in the whole parishthough he avoided all religious controversies yet when age had silvered his head and virtuous piety had secured to his appearance reverence and silent honour no one however determined in his hatred of apostolic descent could have listened to his discourse on ecclesiastical history and ancient times without thinking that one of the beloved apostles had returned to mortality and in that vale of peace had come to exemplify the beauty of holiness in the life and character of mr walker                                       until the sickness of his wife a few months previous to her death his health and spirits and faculties were unimpaired but this misfortune gave him such a shock that his constitution gradually decayed his senses except sight still preserved their powers he never preached with steadiness after his wifes death his voice faltered he always looked at the seat she had used he could not pass her tomb without tears he became when alone sad and melancholy though still among his friends kind and goodhumoured he went to bed about twelve oclock the night before his death as his custom was he went tottering and leaning upon his daughters arm to examine the heavens and meditate a few moments in the open air how clear the moon shines tonight he said these words sighed and laid down at six next morning he was found a corpse many a tear and many a heavy heart and many a grateful blessing followed him to the grave  having mentioned in this narrative the vale of loweswater as a place where mr walker taught school i will add a few memoranda from its parish register respecting a person apparently of desires as moderate with whom he must have been intimate during his residence there      let him that would ascend the tottering seat     of courtly grandeur and become as great     as are his mounting wishes but for me     let sweet repose and rest my portion be      henry forest curate      honour the idol which the most adore     receives no homage from my knee     content in privacy i value more     than all uneasy dignity       henry forest came to loweswater 1708 being 25 years of age       this curacy was twice augmented by queen annes bounty the first      payment with great difficulty was paid to mr john curwen of      london on the 9th of may 1724 deposited by me henry forest      curate of loweswater ye said 9th of may ye said mr curwen went      to the office and saw my name registered there c this by the      providence of god came by lot to this poor place       haec testor h forest  in another place he records that the sycamore trees were planted in the churchyard in 1710  he died in 1741 having been curate thirtyfour years it is not improbable that h forest was the gentleman who assisted robert walker in his classical studies at loweswater  to this parish register is prefixed a motto of which the following verses are a part      invigilate viri tacito nam tempora gressu     diffugiunt nulloque sono convertitur annus     utendum est aetate cito pede praeterit ajtas   323

the white doe of rylstone or the fate of the nortons  advertisement  during the summer of 1807 i visited for the first time the beautiful country that surrounds bolton priory in yorkshire and the poem of the white doe founded upon a tradition connected with that place was composed at the close of the same year  the white doe of rylstone  the poem of the white doe of rylstone is founded on a local tradition and on the ballad in percys collection entitled the rising of the north the tradition is as follows about this time not long after the dissolution a white doe say the aged people of the neighbourhood long continued to make a weekly pilgrimage from rylstone over the falls of bolton and was constantly found in the abbey churchyard during divine service after the close of which she returned home as regularly as the rest of the congregationdr whitakers history of the deanery of cravenrylstone was the property and residence of the nortons distinguished in that illadvised and unfortunate insurrection which led me to connect with this tradition the principal circumstances of their fate as recorded in the ballad  bolton priory says dr whitaker in his excellent book the history and antiquities of the deanery of craven stands upon a beautiful curvature of the wharf on a level sufficiently elevated to protect it from inundations and low enough for every purpose of picturesque effect  opposite to the east window of the priory church the river washes the foot of a rock nearly perpendicular and of the richest purple where several of the mineral beds which break out instead of maintaining their usual inclination to the horizon are twisted by some inconceivable process into undulating and spiral lines to the south all is soft and delicious the eye reposes upon a few rich pastures a moderate reach of the river sufficiently tranquil to form a mirror to the sun and the bounding hills beyond neither too near nor too lofty to exclude even in winter any portion of his rays  but after all the glories of bolton are on the north whatever the most fastidious taste could require to constitute a perfect landscape is not only found here but in its proper place in front and immediately under the eye is a smooth expanse of parklike enclosure spotted with native elm ash c of the finest growth on the right a skirting oak wood with jutting points of grey rock on the left a rising copse still forward are seen the aged groves of bolton park the growth of centuries and farther yet the barren and rocky distances of simonseat and barden fell contrasted with the warmth fertility and luxuriant foliage of the valley below  about half a mile above bolton the valley closes and either side of the wharf is overhung by solemn woods from which huge perpendicular masses of grey rock jut out at intervals  this sequestered scene was almost inaccessible till of late that ridings have been cut on both sides of the river and the most interesting points laid open by judicious thinnings in the woods here a tributary stream rushes from a waterfall and bursts through a woody glen to mingle its waters with the wharf there the wharf itself is nearly lost in a deep cleft in the rock and next becomes a horned flood enclosing a woody islandsometimes it reposes for a moment and then resumes its native character lively irregular and impetuous  the cleft mentioned above is the tremendous strid this chasm being incapable of receiving the winter floods has formed on either side a broad strand of naked gritstone full of rockbasins or pots of the linn which bear witness to the restless impetuosity of so many northern torrents but if here wharf is lost to the eye it amply repays another sense by its deep and solemn roar like the voice of the angry spirit of the waters heard far above and beneath amidst the silence of the surrounding woods  the terminating object of the landscape is the remains of barden tower interesting from their form and situation and still more so from the recollections which they excite   325 the white doe of rylstone  the earlier half of this poem was composed at stocktonupontees when mary and i were on a visit to her eldest brother mr hutchinson at the close of the year 1807 the country is flat and the weather was rough i was accustomed every day to walk to and fro under the shelter of a row of stacks in a field at a small distance from the town and there poured forth my verses aloud as freely as they would come mary reminds me that her brother stood upon the punctilio of not sitting down to dinner till i joined the party and it frequently happened that i did not make my appearance till too late so that she was made uncomfortable i here beg her pardon for this and similar transgressions during the whole course of our wedded life to my beloved sister the same apology is due  when from the visit just mentioned we returned to townend grasmere i proceeded with the poem it may be worth while to note as a caution to others who may cast their eyes on these memoranda that the skin having been rubbed off my heel by my wearing too tight a shoe though i desisted from walking i found that the irritation of the wounded part was kept up by the act of composition to a degree that made it necessary to give my constitution a holiday a rapid cure was the consequence  poetic excitement when accompanied by protracted labour in composition has throughout my life brought on more or less bodily derangement nevertheless i am at the close of my seventythird year in what may be called excellent health so that intellectual labour is not necessarily unfavourable to longevity but perhaps i ought here to add that mine has been generally carried on out of doors  let me here say a few words of this poem by way of criticism the subject being taken from feudal times has led to its being compared to some of walter scotts poems that belong to the same age and state of society the comparison is inconsiderate sir walter pursued the customary and very natural course of conducting an action presenting various turns of fortune to some outstanding point on which the mind might rest as a termination or catastrophe the course i attempted to pursue is entirely different everything that is attempted by the principal personages in the white doe fails so far as its object is external and substantial so far as it is moral and spiritual it succeeds the heroine of the poem knows that her duty is not to interfere with the current of events either to forward or delay them but            to abide     the shock and finally secure     oer pain and grief a triumph pure  this she does in obedience to her brothers injunction as most suitable to a mind and character that under previous trials had been proved to accord with his she achieves this not without aid from the communication with the inferior creature which often leads her thoughts to revolve upon the past with a tender and humanising influence that exalts rather than depresses her the anticipated beatification if i may so say of her mind and the apotheosis of the companion of her solitude are the points at which the poem aims and constitute its legitimate catastrophe far too spiritual a one for instant or widelyspread sympathy but not therefore the less fitted to make a deep and permanent impression upon that class of minds who think and feel more independently than the many do of the surfaces of things and interests transitory because belonging more to the outward and social forms of life than to its internal spirit  how insignificant a thing for example does personal prowess appear compared with the fortitude of patience and heroic martyrdom in other words with struggles for the sake of principle in preference to victory gloried in for its own sake  to these remarks may be added the following in a letter from the writer to his friend archdeacon wrangham                       thanksgiving day jan 1816                                      rydal mount  my dear wrangham  you have given me an additional mark of that friendly disposition and those affectionate feelings which i have long known you to possess by writing to me after my long and unjustifiable silence                                       of the white doe i have little to say but that i hope it will be acceptable to the intelligent for whom alone it is written it starts from a high point of imagination and comes round through various wanderings of that faculty to a still highernothing less than the apotheosis of the animal who gives the first of the two titles to the poem and as the poem thus begins and ends with pure and lofty imagination every motive and impetus that actuates the persons introduced is from the same source a kindred spirit pervades and is intended to harmonise the whole throughout objects the banner for instance derive their influence not from properties inherent in them not from what they are actually in themselves but from such as are bestowed upon them by the minds of those who are conversant with or affected by those objects thus the poetry if there be any in the work proceeds as it ought to do from the soul of man communicating its creative energies to the images of the external world but too much of this                             most faithfully yours                                w

tower c i l 1  it is to be regretted that at the present day bolton abbey wants this ornament but the poem according to the imagination of the poet is composed in queen elizabeths time formerly says

   xiv ecclesiastical sonnets   332 ecclesiastical sonnets in series  advertisement  during the month of december 1820 i accompanied a muchbeloved and honoured friend in a walk through different parts of his estate with a view to fix upon the site of a new church which he intended to erect it was one of the most beautiful mornings of a mild seasonour feelings were in harmony with the cherishing influences of the scene and such being our purpose we were naturally led to look back upon past events with wonder and gratitude and on the future with hope not long afterwards some of the sonnets which will be found towards the close of this series were produced as a private memorial of that mornings occupation  the catholic question which was agitated in parliament about that time kept my thoughts in the same course and it struck me that certain points in the ecclesiastical history of our country might advantageously be presented to view in verse accordingly i took up the subject and what i now offer to the reader was the result  when this work was far advanced i was agreeably surprised to find that my friend mr southey had been engaged with similar views in writing a concise history of the church in england if our productions thus unintentionally coinciding shall be found to illustrate each other it will prove a high gratification to me which i am sure my friend will participate                               w wordsworth rydal mount january 24 1822  for the convenience of passing from one point of the subject to another without shocks of abruptness this work has taken the shape of a series of sonnets but the reader it is to be hoped will find that the pictures are often so closely connected as to have jointly the effect of passages of a poem in a form of stanza to which there is no objection but one that bears upon the poet onlyits difficulty   333 introductory remarks  my purpose in writing this series was as much as possible to confine my view to the introduction progress and operation of the church in england both previous and subsequent to the reformation the sonnets were written long before ecclesiastical history and points of doctrine had excited the interest with which they have been recently enquired into and discussed the former particular is mentioned as an excuse for my having fallen into error in respect to an incident which had been selected as setting forth the height to which the power of the popedom over temporal sovereignty had attained and the arrogance with which it was displayed i allude to the last sonnet but one in the first series where pope alexander the third at venice is described as setting his foot on the neck of the emperor barbarossa though this is related as a fact in history i am told it is a mere legend of no authority substitute for it an undeniable truth not less fitted for my purpose namely the penance inflicted by gregory the seventh upon the emperor henry the fourth at canosa4  4 according to baronius the humiliation of the emperor was a voluntary act of prostration on his part ann eccl ad ann 1177 memoirs ii 111  before i conclude my notice of these sonnets let me observe that the opinion i pronounced in favour of laud long before the oxford tract movement and which had brought censure upon me from several quarters is not in the least changed omitting here to examine into his conduct in respect to the persecuting spirit with which he has been charged i am persuaded that most of his aims to restore ritual practices which had been abandoned were good and wise whatever errors he might commit in the manner he sometimes attempted to enforce them i further believe that had not he and others who shared his opinions and felt as he did stood up in opposition to the reformers of that period it is questionable whether the church would ever have recovered its lost ground and become the blessing it now is and will i trust become in a still greater degree both to those of its communion and those who unfortunately are separated from it       1 saw the figure of a lovely maid sonnet i part iii  when i came to this part of the series i had the dream described in this sonnet the figure was that of my daughter and the whole past exactly as here represented the sonnet was composed on the middle road leading from grasmere to ambleside it was begun as i left the last house in the vale and finished word for word as it now stands before i came in view of rydal i wish i could say the same of the five or six hundred i have written most of them were frequently retouched in the course of composition and not a few laboriously  i have only further to observe that the intended church which prompted these sonnets was erected on coleorton moor towards the centre of a very populous parish between three and four miles from ashbydelazouch on the road to loughborough and has proved i believe a great benefit to the neighbourhood  postscript  as an addition to these general remarks on the ecclesiastical sonnets it seems only right to give here from the memoirs vol ii p 113 the following on sonnet xl pt ii      with what entire affection did they prize     their newborn church  the invidious inferences that would be drawn from this epithet by the enemies of the english church and reformation are too obvious to be dilated on the author was aware of this and in reply to a friend who called his attention to the misconstruction and perversion to which the passage was liable he replied as follows                              nov 12 1846 my dear c  the passage which you have been so kind as to comment upon in one of the ecclesiastical sonnets was altered several years ago by my pen in a copy of my poems which i possess but the correction was not printed till a place was given it in the last edition printed last year in one volume it there stands       their church reformed  though for my own part as i mentioned some time since in a letter i had occasion to write to the bishop of  i do not like the term reformed if taken in its literal sense as a transformation it is very objectionable                              yours affectionately

after a very long interval i returned to poetical composition and my first employment was to write a couple of sonnets upon subjects recommended by you to take place in the ecclesiastical series they are upon the marriage ceremony and the funeral service i have also at the same time added two others one upon visiting the sick and the other upon the thanksgiving of women after childbirth both subjects taken from the services of our liturgy to the second part of the same series i have also added two in order to do more justice to the papal church for the services which she did actually render to christianity and humanity in the middle ages by the by the sonnet beginning men of the western world c was slightly altered after i sent it to you not in the hope of substituting a better verse but merely to avoid the repetition of the same word book which occurs as a rhyme in the pilgrim fathers these three sonnets i learn from several quarters have been well received by those of your

be reckoned as eminently important the examples of civility and refinement which the clergy stationed at intervals afford to the whole people the established clergy in many parts of england have long been as they continue to be the principal bulwark against barbarism and the link which unites the sequestered peasantry with the intellectual advancement of the age nor is it below the dignity of the

border in the autumn of 1831   362 dedication  to samuel rogers esq       as a testimony of friendship and acknowledgment of intellectual      obligations these memorials are affectionately inscribed  rydal mount dec 11 1834  the following stanzas yarrow revisited are a memorial of a day passed with sir walter scott and other friends visiting the banks of the yarrow under his guidance immediately before his departure from abbotsford for naples  the title yarrow revisited will stand in no need of explanation for readers acquainted with the authors previous poems suggested by that celebrated stream   363 yarrow revisited  i first became acquainted with this great and amiable man sir walter scott in the year 1803 when my sister and i making a tour in scotland were hospitably received by him in lasswade upon the banks of the esk where he was then living we saw a good deal of him in the course of the following week the particulars are given in my sisters journal of that tour   2 ibid  in the autumn of 1831 my daughter and i set off from rydal to visit sir walter scott before his departure for italy this journey had been delayed by an inflammation in my eyes till we found that the time appointed for his leaving home would be too near for him to receive us without considerable inconvenience nevertheless we proceeded and reached abbotsford on monday i was then scarcely able to lift up my eyes to the light how sadly changed did i find him from the man i had seen so healthy gay and hopeful a few years before when he said at the inn at paterdale in my presence his daughter anne also being there with mr lockhart my own wife and daughter and mr quillinan i mean to live till i am eighty and shall write as long as i live though we had none of us the least thought of the cloud of misfortune which was then going to break upon his head i was startled and almost shocked at that bold saying which could scarcely be uttered by such a man sanguine as he was without a momentary forgetfulness of the instability of human life but to return to abbotsford the inmates and guests we found there were sir walter major scott anne scott and mr and mrs lockhart mr liddell his lady and brother and mr allan the painter and mr laidlaw a very old friend of sir walters one of burnss sons an officer in the indian service had left the house a day or two before and had kindly expressed his regret that he could not wait my arrival a regret that i may truly say was mutual in the evening mr and mrs liddell sang and mrs lockhart chaunted old ballads to her harp and mr allan hanging over the back of a chair told and acted odd stories in a humorous way with this exhibition and his daughters singing sir walter was much amused and indeed were we all as far as circumstances would allow but what is most worthy of mention is the admirable demeanour of major scott during that evening6 he had much to suffer from the sight of his fathers infirmities and from the great change that was about to take place at the residence he had built and where he had long lived in so much prosperity and happiness but what struck me most was the patient kindness with which he supported himself under the many fretful expressions that his sister anne addressed to him or uttered in his hearing and she poor thing as mistress of that house had been subject after her mothers death to a heavier load of care and responsibility and greater sacrifices of time than one of such a constitution of body and mind was able to bear of this dora and i were made so sensible that as soon as we had crossed the tweed on our departure we gave vent at the same moment to our apprehensions that her brain would fail and she would go out of her mind or that she would sink under the trials she had passed and those which awaited her  6 in pencilthis is a mistake dear father it was the following evening when the liddells were gone and only ourselves and mr allan present  on tuesday morning sir walter scott accompanied us and most of the party to newark castle on the yarrow when we alighted from the carriages he walked pretty stoutly and had great pleasure in revisiting these his favourite haunts of that excursion the verses yarrow revisited are a memorial notwithstanding the romance that pervades sir walters works and attaches to many of his habits there is too much pressure of fact for these verses to harmonise as much as i could wish with the two preceding poems on our return in the afternoon we had to cross the tweed directly opposite abbotsford the wheels of our carriage grated upon the pebbles in the bed of the stream that there flows somewhat rapidly a rich but sad light of rather a purple than a golden hue was spread over the eildon hills at that moment and thinking it probable that it might be the last time sir walter would cross the stream i was not a little moved and expressed some of my feelings in the sonnet beginning      a trouble not of clouds c  at noon on thursday we left abbotsford and on the morning of that day sir walter and i had a serious conversation têteàtête when he spoke with gratitude of the happy life which upon the whole he had led he had written in my daughters album before he came into the breakfastroom that morning a few stanzas addressed to her and while putting the book into her hand in his own study standing by his desk he said to her in my presence i should not have done any thing of this kind but for your fathers sake they are probably the last verses i shall ever write they show how much his mind was impaired not by the strain of thought but by the execution some of the lines being imperfect and one stanza wanting corresponding rhymes one letter the initial s had been omitted in the spelling of his own name in this interview also it was that upon my expressing a hope of his health being benefited by the climate of the country to which he was going and by the interest he would take in the classic remembrances of italy he made use of the quotation from yarrow revisited as recorded by me in the musings at aquapendente six years afterwards  mr lockhart has mentioned in his life of him what i heard from several quarters while abroad both at rome and elsewhere that little seemed to interest him but what he could collect or heard of the fugitive stuarts and their adherents who had followed them into exile both the yarrow revisited and the sonnet were sent him before his departure from england some further particulars of the conversations which occurred during this visit i should have set down had they not been already accurately recorded by mr lockhart   364 a place of burial in the south of scotland iii  similar places for burial are not unfrequent in scotland the one that suggested this sonnet lies on the banks of a small stream called the wauchope that flows into the esk near langholme mickle who as it appears from his poem on sir martin was not without genuine poetic feelings was born and passed his boyhood in this neighbourhood under his father who was a minister of the scotch kirk the esk both above and below langholme flows through a beautiful country and the two streams of the wauchope and the ewes which join it near that place are such as a pastoral poet would delight in   365 on the sight of a manse in the south of scotland iv  the manses in scotland and the gardens and grounds about them have seldom that attractive appearance which is common about our english parsonages even when the clergymans income falls below the average of the scotch ministers this is not merely owing to the one country being poor in comparison with the other but arises rather out of the equality of their benefices so that no one has enough to spare for decorations that might serve as an example for others whereas with us the taste of the richer incumbent extends its influence more or less to the poorest  after all in these observations the surface only of the matter is touched i once heard a conversation in which the roman catholic religion was decried on account of its abuses you cannot deny however said a lady of the party repeating an expression used by charles ii that it is the religion of a gentleman it may be left to the scotch themselves to determine how far this observation applies to the religion of their kirk while it cannot be denied that if it is wanting in that characteristic quality the aspect of common life so far as concerns its beauty must suffer sincere christian piety may be thought not to stand in need of refinement or studied ornament but assuredly it is ever ready to adopt them when they fall within its notice as means allow and this observation applies not only to manners but to everything that a christian truly so in spirit cultivates and gathers round him however humble his social condition   366 composed in roslin chapel during a storm v  we were detained by incessant rain and storm at the small inn near roslin chapel and i passed a great part of the day pacing to and fro in this beautiful structure which though not used for public service is not allowed to go to ruin here this sonnet was composed and i shall be fully satisfied if it has at all done justice to the feeling which the place and the storm raging without inspired i was as a prisoner a painter delineating the interior of the chapel and its minute features under such circumstances would have no doubt found his time agreeably shortened but the movements of the mind must be more free while dealing with words than with lines and colours such at least was then and has been on many other occasions my belief and as it is allotted to few to follow both arts with success i am grateful to my own calling for this and a thousand other recommendations which are denied to that of the painter   367 the trosachs vi  as recorded in my sisters journal i had first seen the trosachs in her and coleridges company the sentiment that runs through this sonnet was natural to the season in which i again saw this beautiful spot but this and some other sonnets that follow were coloured by the remembrance of my recent visit to sir walter scott and the melancholy errand on which he was going   368 composed in the glen of lock etive viii      that make the patriot spirit  it was mortifying to have frequent occasions to observe the bitter hatred of the lower orders of the highlanders to their superiors love of country seemed to have passed into its opposite emigration was the only relief looked to with hope   369 eagles composed at dunollie castle in the bay of oban ix  the last i saw was on the wing off the promontory of fairhead county of antrim i mention this because though my tour in ireland with mr marshall and his son was made many years ago this allusion to the eagle is the only image supplied by it to the poetry i have since written we travelled through the country in october and to the shortness of the days and the speed with which we travelled in a carriageandfour may be ascribed this want of notices in my verse of a country so interesting the deficiency i am somewhat ashamed of and it is the more remarkable as contrasted with my scotch and continental tours of which are to be found in these volumes so many memorials   370 in the sound of mull x  touring late in the season in scotland is an uncertain speculation we were detained a week by rain at bunaw on loch etive in a vain hope that the weather would clear up and allow me to show my daughter the beauties of glencoe two days we were at the isle of mull on a visit to major campbell but it rained incessantly and we were obliged to give up our intention of going to staffa the rain pursued us to tyndrum where the next sonnet was composed in a storm   371 shepherds of etive glen x  in gaelicbuachaill eite   372 highland broach xv  on ascending a hill that leads from loch awe towards inverary i fell into conversation with a woman of the humbler class who wore one of these highland broaches i talked with her about it and upon parting with her when i said with a kindness i truly felt may the broach continue in your family for many generations to come as you have already possessed it she thanked me most becomingly and seemed not a little moved the exact resemblance which the old broach still in use though rarely met with among the highlanders bears to the roman fibula must strike every one and concurs with the plaid and kilt to recall to mind the communication which the ancient romans had with this remote country  notehow much the broach is sometimes prized by persons in humble stations may be gathered from an occurrence mentioned to me by a female friend she had an opportunity of benefiting a poor old woman in her own hut who wishing to make a return said to her daughter in erse in a tone of plaintive earnestness i would give anything i have but i hope she does not wish for my broach and uttering these words she put her hand upon the broach which fastened her kerchief and which she imagined had attracted the eye of her benefactress   373 the brownie xvi  upon a small island not far from the

enclosed within my memory i was well acquainted with it in its ancient state the hartshorn tree mentioned in the next sonnet was one of its remarkable objects as well as another tree that grew upon an eminence not far from penrith it was single and conspicuous and being of a round shape though it was universally known to be a sycamore it was always called the round thorn so difficult is it to chain fancy down to fact   377 hartshorn tree near penrith xxii  after a quotation from nicholson and burnss history of westmoreland and cumberland the tree has now disappeared but i well remember its imposing appearance as it stood in a decayed state by the side of the high road leading from penrith to appleby the whole neighbourhood abounds in interesting traditions and vestiges of antiquity viz

380 lines composed on a high part of the coast of cumberland easter sunday april 7th the authors sixtythird birthday ii  the lines were composed on the road between moresby and whitehaven while i was on a visit to my son then rector of moresby this succession of voluntaries with the exception of the 8th and 9th originated in the concluding lines of the last paragraph of this poem with this coast i have been familiar from my earliest childhood and remember being struck for the first time by the town and port of whitehaven and the white waves breaking against its quays and piers as the whole came into view from the top of the high ground down which the roadwhich has since been alteredthen descended abruptly my sister when she first heard the voice of the sea from this point and beheld the scene spread before her burst into tears our family then lived at cockermouth and this fact was often mentioned among us as indicating the sensibility for which she was so remarkable   381 by the seaside iii  these lines were suggested during my residence under my sons roof at moresby on the coast near whitehaven at the time when i was composing those verses among the evening voluntaries that have reference to the sea in some future edition i purpose to place it among that class of poems it was in that neighbourhood i first became acquainted with the ocean and its appearances and movements my infancy and early childhood were passed at cockermouth about eight miles from the coast and i well remember that mysterious awe with which i used to listen to anything said about storms and shipwrecks seashells of many descriptions were common in the town and i was not a little surprised when i heard mr landor had denounced me as a plagiarist from himself for having described a boy applying a seashell to his ear and listening to it for intimation of what was going on in its native element this i had done myself scores of times and it was a belief among us that we could know from the sound whether the tide was ebbing or flowing   382 not in the lucid intervals of life iv  the lines following nor do words c were written with lord byrons character as a poet before me and that of others among his contemporaries who wrote under like influences   383 the leaves that rustled on this oakcrowned hill vii  composed by the side of grasmere lake the mountains that enclose the vale

in subsequent editions it was excluded it is reprinted at the request of the friend in whose presence the lines were thrown off   384a ibid  reprinted at the request of my sister in whose presence the lines were thrown off   385 composed upon an evening of extraordinary splendour and beauty ix  felt and in a great measure composed upon the little mount in front of our abode at rydal in concluding my notices of this class of poems it may be as well to observe that among the miscellaneous sonnets are a few alluding to morning impressions which might be read with mutual benefit in connection with these evening voluntaries see for example that one on westminster bridge that on may 2d on the song of the thrush and the one beginning while beams of orient light   386 alston american painter

season in 1831 from visiting staffa and iona the author made these the principal objects of a short tour in the summer of 1833 of which the following series of poems is a memorial the course pursued was down the cumberland river derwent and to whitehaven thence by the isle of man where a few days were passed up the frith of clyde to greenock then to oban staffa iona and back towards england by

weeping a conjecture rendered more probable from the stony and rocky channel of both the cumberland and yorkshire rivers the cumberland greta though it does not among the country people take up that name till within three miles of its disappearance in the river derwent may be considered as having its source in the mountain cove of wythburn and flowing through thirlmere the beautiful features of which lake are known only to those who travelling between grasmere and keswick have quitted the main road in the vale of wythburn and crossing over to the opposite side of the lake have proceeded with it on the right hand  the channel of the greta immediately above keswick has for the purposes of building been in a great measure cleared of the immense stones which by their concussion in high floods

six benedictine monks to the abbey of st mary at york  several traditions of miracles connected with the foundation of the first of these religious houses survive among the people of the neighbourhood one of which is alluded to in these stanzas and another of a somewhat bolder and more peculiar character has furnished the subject of a spirited poem by the rev r parkinson ma late divinity lecturer of st bees college and now fellow of the collegiate church of manchester  after the dissolution of the monasteries archbishop grindal founded a free school at st bees from which the counties of cumberland and westmoreland have derived great benefit and recently under the patronage of the earl of lonsdale a college has been established there for the education of ministers for the english

barriers between the two worlds dissolving before the power of love and faith the ministers of religion from their habitual attendance upon sickbeds would be daily witnesses of these benign results and hence would be strongly tempted to aim at giving to them permanence by embodying them in rites and ceremonies recurring at stated periods all this as it was in course of nature so was it blameless and even praiseworthy since some of its effects in that rude state of society could not but be salutary no reflecting person however can view without sorrow the abuses which rose out of thus formalising sublime instincts and disinterested movements of passion and perverting them into means of gratifying the ambition and rapacity of the priesthood but while we deplore and are indignant at these abuses it would be a great mistake if we imputed the origin of the offices to prospective selfishness on the part of the monks and clergy they were at first sincere in their sympathy and in their degree dupes rather of their own creed than artful and designing men charity is upon the whole the safest guide that we can take in judging our fellowmen whether of past ages or of the present

little children one of whom upon my request recited the lords prayer to me and i helped her to a clearer understanding of it as well as i could but i was not at all satisfied with my own part hers was

9  the summit of this mountain is well chosen by cowley as the scene of the vision in which the spectral angel discourses with him concerning the government of oliver cromwell i found myself says he on the top of that famous hill in the island mona which has the prospect of three great and not long since most happy kingdoms as soon as ever i looked upon them they called forth the sad representation of all the sins and all the miseries that had overwhelmed them these twenty years it is not to be denied that the changes now in progress and the passions and the way in which they work strikingly resemble those which led to the disasters the philosophic writer so feelingly bewails god grant that the resemblance may not become still more striking as months and years advance   404 eagle in mosaic sonnet xxv      on revisiting dunolly castle  this ingenious piece of workmanship as i afterwards learned had been executed for their own amusement by some labourers employed about the place   405 in the frith of clydeailsa crag during an eclipse of the sun july 17 1833 xxiii  the morning of the eclipse was exquisitely beautiful while we passed the crag as described in the sonnet on the deck of the steamboat were several persons of the poor and labouring class and i could not but be struck with their cheerful talk with each other while not one of them seemed to notice the magnificent objects with which we were surrounded and even the phenomenon of the eclipse attracted but little of their attention was it right not to regret this they appeared to me however so much alive in their own minds to their own concerns that i could not but look upon it as a misfortune that they had little perception for such pleasures as cannot be cultivated without ease and leisure yet if one surveys life in all its duties and relations such ease and leisure will not be found so enviable a privilege as it may at first appear natural philosophy painting and poetry and refined taste are no doubt great acquisitions to society but among those who dedicate themselves to such pursuits it is to be feared that few are as happy and as consistent in the management of their lives as the class of persons who at that time led me into this course of reflection i do not mean by this to be understood to derogate from intellectual pursuits for that would be monstrous i say it in deep gratitude for this compensation to those whose cares are limited to the necessities of daily life among them selftormentors so numerous in the higher classes of society are rare   406 on the frith of

stripling xxxvii  mosgiel was thus pointed out to me by a young man on the top of the coach on my way from glasgow to kilmarnock it is remarkable that though burns lived some time here and during much the most productive period of his poetical life he nowhere adverts to the splendid prospects stretching towards the sea and bounded by the peaks of arran on one part which in clear weather he must have had daily before his eyes yet this is easily explained in one of his poetical effusions he speaks of describing fair natures face as a privilege on which he sets a high value nevertheless natural appearances rarely take a lead in his poetry it is as a human being eminently sensitive and intelligent and not as a poet clad in his priestly robes and carrying the ensigns of sacerdotal office that he interests and affects us  whether he speaks of rivers hills and woods it is not so much on account of the properties with which they are absolutely endowed as relatively to local patriotic remembrances and associations or as they are ministerial to personal feelings especially those of love whether happy or otherwise yet it is not always so soon after we had passed mosgiel farm we crossed the ayr murmuring and winding through a narrow woody hollow his line      auld hermit ayr staw thro his woods stole  came at once to my mind with irwin lugar ayr and doon ayrshire streams over which he breathes a sigh as being unnamed in song and surely his own attempts to make them known were as successful as his heart could desire   408 written on a blank leaf of macphersons ossian xxvii  this poem should for varietys sake take its place among the itinerary sonnets on one of the scotch tours   409 cave of staffa xxix  the reader may be tempted to exclaim how came this and the two following sonnets to be written after the dissatisfaction expressed in the preceding one in fact at the risk of incurring the reasonable displeasure of the master of the steamboat i returned to the cave and explored it under circumstances more favourable to those imaginative impressions which it is so wonderfully fitted to make upon the mind   410 oxeyed daisy      hope smiled when your nativity

flower the oxeyed daisy i had noticed the same flower growing with profusion among the bold rocks on the western coast of the isle of man making a brilliant contrast with their black and gloomy surfaces   411 iona xxxiii  the four last lines of this sonnet are adapted from a wellknown sonnet of russel as conveying my feeling better than any words of my own could do   412 river eden xxxviii      yet fetched from paradise  it is to be feared that there is more of the poet than the sound etymologist in this derivation of the name eden on the western coast of cumberland is a rivulet which enters the sea at moresby known also in the neighbourhood by the name of eden may not the latter syllable come from the word dean a valley langdale near ambleside is by the inhabitants called langden the former syllable occurs in the name emont a principal feeder of the eden and the stream which flows when the tide is out over cartmel sands is called the eaeau frenchaqua latin   413 ibid      nature gives thee flowers that have no rival amidst british bowers  this can scarcely be true to the letter but without stretching the point at all i can say that the soil and air appear more congenial with many upon the bank of this river than i have observed in any other parts of great britain   414 monument of mrs howard xxxix  before this monument was put up in the chapel at wetheral i saw it in the sculptors studio nollekens who by the bye was a strange and grotesque figure that interfered much with ones admiration of his works showed me at the same time the various models in clay which he had made one after another of the mother and her infant the improvement on each was surprising and how so much grace beauty and tenderness had come out of such a head i was sadly puzzled to conceive upon a windowseat in his parlour lay two casts of faces one of the duchess of devonshire so noted in her day and the other of mr pitt taken after his deatha ghastly resemblance as these things always are even when taken from the living subject and more ghastly in this instance of mr pitt from the peculiarity of the features the heedless and apparently neglectful manner in which the faces of these two persons were leftthe one so distinguished in london society and the other upon whose counsels and public conduct during a most momentous period depended the fate of this great empire and perhaps of all europeafforded a lesson to which the dullest of casual visitors could scarcely be insensible it touched me the more because i had so often seen mr pitt upon his own ground at cambridge and upon the floor of the house of commons   415 nunnery xli  i became acquainted with the walks of nunnery when a boy they are within easy reach of a days pleasant excursion from the town of penrith where i used to pass my summer holidays under the roof of my maternal grandfather the place is well worth visiting tho within these few years its privacy and therefore the pleasure which the scene is so well fitted to give has been injuriously affected by walks cut in the rocks on that side the stream which had been left in its natural state   416 scene at corby xlii      canal and viaduct and railway tell  at corby a few miles below nunnery the eden is crossed by a magnificent viaduct and another of these works is thrown over a deep glen or ravine at a very short distance from

ground a little way out of the circle stands long meg herself a single stone eighteen feet high when i first saw this monument as i came upon it by surprise i might overrate its importance as an object but though it will not bear a comparison with stonehenge i must say i have not seen any other relique of those dark ages which can pretend to rival it in singularity and dignity of appearance   418 lowther xliv      cathedral pomp  it may be questioned whether this union was in the contemplation of the artist when he planned the edifice however this might be a poet may be excused for taking the view of the subject presented in this sonnet   419 to the earl of lonsdale xlv  this sonnet was written immediately after certain trials which took place at the cumberland assizes when the earl of lonsdale in consequence of repeated and longcontinued attacks upon his character through the local press had thought it right to prosecute the conductors and proprietors of three several journals a verdict of libel was given in one case and in the others the prosecutions were withdrawn upon the individuals retracting and disavowing the charges expressing regret that they had been made and promising to abstain from the like in future   420 the somnambulist xlvi  this poem might be dedicated to my friend sir g beaumont and mr rogers jointly while we were making an excursion together in this part of the lake district we heard that mr glover the artist while lodging at lyulphs tower had been disturbed by a loud shriek and upon rising he learnt that it had come from a young woman in the house who was in the habit of walking in her sleep in that state she had gone down stairs and while attempting to open the outer door either from some difficulty or the effect of the cold stone upon her feet had uttered the cry which alarmed him it seemed to us all that this might serve as a hint for a poem and the story here told was constructed and soon after put into verse by me as it now stands  notelyulphs towera pleasurehouse built by the late duke of norfolk upon the banks of ullswater force is the word used in the lake district for waterfall     xviii poems of sentiment and reflection   421 expostulation and reply i  this poem is a favourite among the quakers as i have learnt on many occasions it was composed in front of the house at alfoxden in the spring of 1798   422 the tables turned ii  composed at the same time as expostulation and reply   423 lines written in early spring iii  1798 actually composed while i was sitting by the side of the brook that runs down from the comb in which stands the village of alford through the grounds of alfoxden it was a chosen resort of mine the brook fell down a sloping rock so as to make a waterfall considerable for that country and across the pool below had fallen a tree an ash if i rightly remember from which rose perpendicularly boughs in search of the light intercepted by the deep shade above the boughs bore leaves of green that for want of sunshine had faded into almost lilywhite and from the underside of this natural sylvan bridge depended long and beautiful tresses of ivy which waved gently in the breeze that might poetically speaking be called the breath of the waterfall this motion varied of course in proportion to the power of water in the brook when with dear friends i revisited this spot after an interval of more than forty years this interesting feature of the scene was gone to the owner of the place i could not but regret that the beauty of this retired part of the grounds had not tempted him to make it more accessible by a path not broad or obtrusive but sufficient for persons who love such scenes to creep along without difficulty   424 a character  the principal features are taken from that of my friend robert jones   425 to my sister v  composed in front of alfoxden house  my little boymessenger on this occasion was the son of basil montagu the larch mentioned in the first stanza was standing when i revisited the place in may 1841 more than forty years after i was disappointed that it had not improved in appearance as to size nor had it acquired anything of the majesty of age which even though less perhaps than any other tree the larch sometimes does a few score yards from this tree grew when we inhabited alfoxden one of the most remarkable beechtrees ever seen the ground sloped both towards and from it it was of immense size and threw out arms that struck into the soil like those of the banyantree and rose again from it two of the branches thus inserted themselves twice which gave to each the appearance of a serpent moving along by gathering itself up in folds one of the large boughs of this tree had been torn off by the wind before we left alfoxden but five remained in 1841 we could barely find the spot where the tree had stood so remarkable a production of nature could not have been wilfully destroyed   426 simon lee the old huntsman vi  this old man had been huntsman to the squires of alfoxden which at the time we occupied it belonged to a minor the old mans cottage stood upon the common a little way from the entrance to alfoxden park but in 1841 it had disappeared many other changes had taken place in the adjoining village which i could not but notice with a regret more natural than wellconsidered improvements but rarely appear such to those who after long intervals of time revisit places they have had much pleasure in it is unnecessary to add the fact was as mentioned in the poem and i have after an interval of fortyfive years the image of the old man as fresh before my eyes as if i had seen him yesterday the expression when the hounds were out i dearly love their voice was word for word from his own lips   427 lines written in germany 17989 vii      a plague c  a bitter winter it was when these verses were composed by the side of my sister in our lodgings at a drapers house in the romantic imperial town of goslar on the edge of the hartz forest in this town the german emperors of the franconian line were accustomed to keep their court and it retains vestiges of ancient splendour so severe was the cold of this winter that when we passed out of the parlour warmed by the stove our cheeks were struck by the air as by cold iron i slept in a room over a passage that was not ceiled the people of the house used to say rather unfeelingly that they expected i should be frozen to death some night but with the protection of a pelisse lined with fur and a dogsskin bonnet such as was worn by the peasants i walked daily on the ramparts or on a sort of public ground or garden in which was a pond here i had no companion but a kingfisher a beautiful creature that used to glance by me i consequently became much attached to it during these walks i composed the poem that follows the poets epitaph  footnotethe reader must be apprised that the stoves in north germany generally have the impression of a gallopping horse upon them this being part of the brunswick arms   428 to the daisy ix  this and the other poems addressed to the same flower were composed at townend grasmere during the earlier part of our residence there i have been censured for the last line but one thy function apostolical as being little less than profane how could it be thought so the word is adopted with reference to its derivation implying something sent on a mission and assuredly this little flower especially when the subject of verse may be regarded in its humble degree as administering both to moral and to spiritual purposes   429 matthew x  in the school of hawkshead is a tablet on which are inscribed in gilt letters the names of the several persons who have been schoolmasters there since the foundation of the school with the time at which they entered upon and quitted their office opposite to one of those names the author wrote the following lines if nature c   430 matthew x  such a tablet as is here spoken of continued to be preserved in hawkshead school though the inscriptions were not brought down to our time this and other poems connected with matthew would not gain by a literal detail of facts like the wanderer in the excursion this schoolmaster was made up of several both of his class and men of other occupations i do not ask pardon for what there is of untruth in such verses considered strictly as matters of fact it is enough if being true and consistent in spirit they move and teach in a manner not unworthy of a poets calling   431 personal talk xiii  written at townend the last line but two stood at first better and more characteristically thus      by my halfkitchen and halfparlour fire  my sister and i were in the habit of having the teakettle in our little sittingroom and we toasted the bread ourselves which reminds me of a little circumstance not unworthy of being set down among these minutiae happening both of us to be engaged a few minutes one morning when we had a young prig of a scotch lawyer to breakfast with us my dear sister with her usual simplicity put the toastingfork with a slice of bread into the hands of this edinburgh genius our little bookcase stood on one side of the fire to prevent loss of time he took down a book and fell to reading to the neglect of the toast which was burnt to a cinder many a time have we laughed at this circumstance and other cottage simplicities of that day by the bye i have a spite at one of this series of sonnets i will leave the reader to discover which as having been the means of nearly putting off for ever our acquaintance with dear miss fenwick who has always stigmatised one line of it as vulgar and worthy only of having been composed by a country squire   432 to the spade of a friend 1804 xiv  this person was thomas wilkinson a quaker by religious profession by natural constitution of mindor shall i venture to say by gods grace he was something better he had inherited a small estate and built a house upon it near yanwath upon the banks of the emont i have heard him say that his heart used to beat in his boyhood when he heard the sound of a drum and fife nevertheless the spirit of enterprise in him confined itself in tilling his ground and conquering such obstacles as stood in the way of its fertility persons of his religious persuasion do now in a far greater degree than formerly attach themselves to trade and commerce he kept the old track as represented in this poem he employed his leisure hours in shaping pleasant walks by the side of his beloved river where he also built something between a hermitage and a summerhouse attaching to it inscriptions after the manner of shenstone at his leasowes he used to travel from time to time partly from love of nature and partly with religious friends in the service of humanity his admiration of genius in every department did him much honour through his connection with the family in which edmund burke was educated he became acquainted with that great man who used to receive him with great kindness and condescension and many times have i heard wilkinson speak of those interesting interviews he was honoured also by the friendship of elizabeth smith and of thomas clarkson and his excellent wife and was much esteemed by lord and lady lonsdale and every member of that family among his verses he wrote many are some worthy of preservation one little poem in particular upon disturbing by prying curiosity a bird while hatching her young in his garden the latter part of this innocent and good mans life was melancholy he became blind and also poor by becoming surety for some of his relations he was a bachelor he bore as i have often witnessed his calamities with unfailing resignation i will only add that while working in one of his fields he unearthed a stone of considerable size then another and then two more and observing that they had been placed in order as if forming the segment of a circle he proceeded carefully to uncover the soil and brought into view a beautiful druids temple of perfect though small dimensions in order to make his farm more compact he exchanged this field for another and i am sorry to add the new proprietor destroyed this interesting relic of remote ages for some vulgar purpose the fact so far as concerns thomas wilkinson is mentioned in the note on a sonnet on long meg and her daughters   433 a night thought xv  these verses were thrown off extempore upon leaving mr luffs house at fox ghyll one evening the good woman is not disposed to look at the bright side of things and there happened to be present certain ladies who had reached the point of life where youth is ended and who seemed to contend with each other in expressing their dislike of the country and the climate one of them had been heard to say she could not endure a country where there was neither sunshine nor cavaliers in pencil on opposite pagegossip   434 an incident characteristic of a favourite dog xvi  this dog i knew well it belonged to mrs wordsworths brother mr thomas hutchinson who then lived at sockburnonthetees a beautiful retired situation where i used to visit him and his sisters before my marriage my sister and i spent many months there after my return from germany in 1799   435 tribute to the memory of the same dog xvii  was written at the same time 1805 the dog music died aged and blind by falling into a drawwell at gallow hill to the great grief of the family of the hutchinsons who as has been before mentioned had removed to that place from sockburn   436 fidelity xviii  the young man whose death gave occasion to this poem was named charles gough and had come early in the spring to patterdale for the sake of angling while attempting to cross over helvellyn to grasmere he slipped from a steep part of the rock where the ice was not thawed and perished his body was discovered as described in this poem walter scott heard of the accident and both he and i without either of us knowing that the other had taken up the subject each wrote a poem in admiration of the dogs fidelity his contains a most beautiful stanza      how long didst thou think that his silence was slumber     when the wind waved his garment how oft didst thou start  i will add that the sentiment in the last four lines of the last stanza of my verses was uttered by a shepherd with such exactness that a traveller who afterwards reported his account in print was induced to question the man whether he had read them which he had not   437 ode to duty xix  this ode written in 1805 is on the model of grays ode to adversity which is copied from horaces ode to fortune  many and many a time have i been twitted by my wife and sister for having forgotten this dedication of myself to the stern lawgiver transgressor indeed i have been from hour to hour from day to day i would fain hope however not more flagrantly or in a worse way than most of my tuneful brethren but these last words are in a wrong strain we should be rigorous to ourselves and forbearing if not indulgent to others and if we make comparisons at all it ought to be with those who have morally excelled us in pencilbut is not the first stanza of grays from a chorus of aeschylus and is not horaces ode also modelled on the greek   438 character of the happy warrior xx  the course of the great war with the french naturally fixed ones attention upon the military character and to the honour of our country there are many illustrious instances of the qualities that constitute its highest excellence lord nelson carried most of the virtues that the trials he was exposed to in his department of the service necessarily call forth and sustain if they do not produce the contrary vices but his public life was stained with one great crime so that though many passages of these lines were suggested by what was generally known as excellent in his conduct i have not been able to connect his name with the poem as i could wish or even to think of him with satisfaction in reference to the idea of what a warrior ought to be for the sake of such of my friends as may happen to read this note i will add that many elements of the character here portrayed were found in my brother john who perished by shipwreck as mentioned elsewhere his messmates used to call him the philosopher from which it must be inferred that the qualities and dispositions i allude to had not escaped their notice he often expressed his regret after the war had continued some time that he had not chosen the naval instead of the east india companys service to which his family connection had led him he greatly valued moral and religious instruction for youth as tending to make good sailors the best he used to say came from scotland the next to them from the north of england especially from westmoreland and cumberland where thanks to the piety and local attachments of our ancestors endowed or as they are called freeschools abound   439 the force of prayer xxi  an appendage to the white doe my friend mr rogers has also written on the subject the story is preserved in dr whitakers history of craven a topographical writer of firstrate merit in all that concerns the past but such was his aversion from the modern spirit as shown in the spread of manufactories in those districts of which he treated that his readers are left entirely ignorant both of the progress of these arts and their real bearing upon the comfort virtues and happiness of the inhabitants  while wandering on foot through the fertile valleys and over the moorlands of the apennine that divides yorkshire from lancashire i used to be delighted with observing the number of substantial cottages that had sprung up on every side each having its little plot of fertile ground won from the surrounding waste a bright and warm fire if needed was always to be found in these dwellings the father was at his loom the children looked healthy and happy is it not to be feared that the increase of mechanic power has done away with many of these blessings and substituted many evils alas if these evils grow how are they to be checked and where is the remedy to be found political economy will not supply it that is certain we must look to something deeper purer and higher   440 a fact and an imagination xxii  the first and last four lines of this poem each make a sonnet and were composed as such but i thought that by intermediate lines they might be connected so as to make a whole one or two expressions are taken from miltons history of england   441 a little onward xxiii  the complaint in my eyes which gave occasion to this address to my daughter first showed itself as a consequence of inflammation caught at the top of kirkstone when i was overheated by having carried up the ascent my eldest son a lusty infant frequently has the disease recurred since leaving the eyes in a state which has often prevented my reading for months and makes me at this day incapable of bearing without injury any strong light by day or night my acquaintance with books has therefore been far short of my wishes and on this account to acknowledge the services daily and hourly done me by my family and friends this note is written   442 ode to lycoris xxiv  this as well as the preceding and the two that follow were composed in front of rydal mount and during my walks in the neighbourhood ninetenths of my verses have been murmured out in the open air and here let me repeat what i believe has already appeared in print one day a stranger having walked round the garden and grounds of rydal mount asked of one of the female servants who happened to be at the door permission to see her masters study this said she leading him forward is my masters library where he keeps his books but his study is out of doors after a long absence from home it has more than once happened that some one of my cottage neighbours not of the doublecoachhouse cottages has said well there he is we are glad to hear him booing about again once more in excuse for so much egotism let me say these notes are written for my familiar friends and at their earnest request another time a gentleman whom james had conducted through the grounds asked him what kind of plants throve best there after a little consideration he answered laurels that is said the stranger as it should be dont you know that the laurel is the emblem of poetry and that poets used on public occasions to be crowned with it james stared when the question was first put but was doubtless much pleased with the information   443 ibid  the discerning reader who is aware that in the poem of ellen irwin i was desirous of throwing the reader at once out of the old ballad so as if possible to preclude a comparison between that mode of dealing with the subject and the mode i meant to adopt may here perhaps perceive that this poem originated in the four last lines of the first stanza these specks of snow reflected in the lake and so transferred as it were to the subaqueous sky reminded me of the swans which the fancy of the ancient classic poets yoked to the car of venus hence the tenor of the whole first stanza and the name of lycoris which with some readers who think mythology and classical allusion too farfetched and therefore more or less unnatural or affected will tend to unrealise the sentiment that pervades these verses but surely one who has written so much in verse as i have done may be allowed to retrace his steps into the regions of fancy which delighted him in his boyhood when he first became acquainted with the greek and roman poets before i read virgil i was so strongly attached to ovid whose metamorphoses i read at school that i was quite in a passion whenever i found him in books of criticism placed below virgil as to homer i was never weary of travelling over the scenes through which he led me classical literature affected me by its own beauty but the truths of scripture having been entrusted to the dead languages and these fountains having been recently laid open at the reformation an importance and a sanctity were at that period attached to classical literature that extended as is obvious in miltons lycidas for example both to its spirit and form in a degree that can never be revived no doubt the hackneyed and lifeless use into which mythology fell towards the close of the 17th century and which continued through the 18th disgusted the general reader with all allusion to it in modern verse and though in deference to this disgust and also in a measure participating in it i abstained in my earlier writings from all introduction of pagan fablesurely even in its humble form it may ally itself with real sentimentas i can truly affirm it did in the present case   444 memory xxviii  the verses or strayed from hope and promise selfbetrayed were i am sorry to say suggested from apprehensions of the fate of my friend hc the subject of the verses addressed to hc when six years old the piece which follows to memory arose out of similar feelings   445 this lawn xxix  this lawn is the sloping one approaching the kitchengarden and was made out of it hundreds of times have i here watched the dancing of shadows amid a press of sunshine and other beautiful appearances of light and shade flowers and shrubs what a contrast between this and the cabbages and onions and carrots that used to grow there on a piece of uglyshaped unsightly ground no reflection however either upon cabbages or onions the latter we know were worshipped by the egyptians and he must have a poor eye for beauty who has not observed how much of it there is in the form and colour which cabbages and plants of this genus exhibit through the various stages of their growth and decay a richer display of colour in vegetable nature can scarcely be conceived than coleridge my sister and i saw in a bed of potatoe plants in blossom near a hut upon the moor between inversneyd and loch katrine these blossoms were of such extraordinary beauty and richness that no one could have passed them without notice but the sense must be cultivated through the mind before we can perceive those inexhaustible treasures of naturefor such they truly arewithout the least necessary reference to the utility of her productions or even to the laws whereupon as we learn by research they are dependent some are of opinion that the habit of analysing decomposing and anatomising is inevitably unfavourable to the perception of beauty people are led into this mistake by overlooking the fact that such processes being to a certain extent within the reach of a limited intellect we are apt to ascribe to them that insensibility of which they are in truth the effect and not the cause admiration and love to which all knowledge truly vital must tend are felt by men of real genius in proportion as their discoveries in natural philosophy are enlarged and the beauty in form of a plant or an animal is not made less but more apparent as a whole by a more accurate insight into its constituent properties and powers a savant who is not also a poet in soul and a religionist in heart is a feeble and unhappy creature   446 humanity xxx  these verses and the preceding ones entitled liberty were composed as one piece which mrs w complained of as unwieldy and illproportioned and accordingly it was divided into two on her judicious recommendation  printed notes the rockingstones alluded to in the beginning of the

motives which led to this measure and the good or evil which has attended or has risen from it will be duly appreciated by future historians there is no call for dwelling on the subject in this place i will content myself with saying that the then condition of the peoples mind is not in these verses exaggerated   450 the labourers noonday hymn xxxv  bishop kens morning and evening hymns are as they deserve to be familiarly known many other hymns have also been written on the same subjects but not being aware of any being designed for noonday i was induced to compose these verses often we had occasion to observe cottage children carrying in their baskets dinner to their fathers engaged with their daily labours in the fields and woods how gratifying would it be to me could i be assured that any portion of these stanzas had been sung by such a domestic concert under such circumstances a friend of mine has told me that she introduced this hymn into a villageschool which she superintended and the stanzas in succession furnished her with texts to comment upon in a way which without difficulty was made intelligible to the children and in which they obviously took delight and they were taught to sing it to the tune of the old 100th psalm   451 ode composed on may morning xxxvi  to may xxxvii  these two poems originated in these lines how delicate c my daughter and i left rydal mount upon a tour through our mountains with mr and mrs carr in the month of may 1826 and as we were going up the vale of newlands i was struck with the appearance of the little chapel gleaming through the veil of halfopened leaves and the feeling which was then conveyed to my mind was expressed in the stanza that follows as in the case of liberty and humanity mentioned before my first intention was to write only one poem but subsequently i broke it into two making additions to each part so as to produce a consistent and appropriate whole   452 lines suggested by a portrait from the pencil of f stone xxxviii  the foregoing subject resumed xxxix  this portrait has hung for many years in our principal sittingroom and represents jq as she was when a girl the picture though it is somewhat thinly painted has much merit in tone and general effect it is chiefly valuable however from the sentiment that pervades it the anecdote of the saying of the monk in sight of titians picture was told in this house by mr wilkie and was i believe first communicated to the public in this poem the former portion of which i was composing at the time southey heard the story from miss hutchinson and transferred it to the doctor but it is not easy to explain how my friend mr rogers in a note subsequently added to his italy was led to speak of the same remarkable words having many years before been spoken in his hearing by a monk or priest in front of a picture of the last supper placed over a refectorytable in a convent at padua printed note on xxxviii last line the escurial

the class entitled musings in mr southeys minor poems is one upon his own miniature picture taken in childhood and another upon a landscape painted by gaspar poussin it is possible that every word of the above verses though similar in subject might have been written had the author been unacquainted with those beautiful effusions of poetic sentiment but for his own satisfaction he must be allowed thus publicly to acknowledge the pleasure those two poems of his friend have given him and the grateful influence they have upon his mind as often as he reads them or thinks of them   453 upon seeing a coloured drawing of the bird of paradise in an album xli  i cannot forbear to record that the last seven lines of this poem were composed in bed during the night of the day on which my sister sh died about six pm and it was the thought of her innocent and beautiful life that through faith prompted the words      on wings that fear no glance of gods pure sight     no tempest from his breath  the reader will find two poems on pictures of this bird among my poems i will here observe that in a far greater number of instances than have been mentioned in these notes one poem has as in this case grown out of another either because i felt the subject had been inadequately treated or that the thoughts and images suggested in course of composition have been such as i found interfered with

that a good deal is said on the pennsylvania loans a subject in which as you are aware he was interested for his friends rather than for himself last december when i learned that a new edition of his poems was in press i wrote to him it was my last letter to say frankly that his sonnet to pennsylvanians was no longer just and to desire him not to let it stand so for after time it was very gratifying to me on receiving a copy of the new edition which was not till after his death to find the additional note at the end of the fifth volume showing by its being printed on the unusual place of a flyleaf that he had been anxious to attend to such a request it was characteristic of that righteousness which distinguished him as an author and it has this interest as i conjecture that it was

truly pleased with the receipt of the letter which you were put upon writing by the perusal of my penal sonnets in the quarterly review being much engaged at present i might have deferred making my acknowledgments for this and other favours particularly your descant if i had not had a special occasion for addressing you at this moment a bristol lady has kindly undertaken to be the bearer of the walkingstick which i spoke to you of some time since it was cut from a hollytree planted in our garden by my own hand                                       your descant amused me but i must protest against your system which would discard punctuation to the extent you propose it would i think destroy the harmony of blank verse when skilfully written what would become of the pauses at the third syllable followed by an and or any such word without the rest which a comma when consistent with the sense calls upon the reader to make and which being made he starts with the weak syllable that follows as from the beginning of a verse i am sure milton would have supported me in this opinion thomson wrote his blank verse before his ear was formed as it was when he wrote the castle of indolence and some of his short rhyme poems it was therefore rather hard in you to select him as an instance of punctuation abused i am glad that you concur in my view on the punishment of death an outcry as i expected has been raised against me by weakminded humanitarians what do you think of one person having opened a battery of nineteen fourteenpounders upon me ie nineteen sonnets in which he

when first written with a paragraph that has been transferred as an introduction to the first series of my scotch memorials the journey of which the first part is here described was from grasmere to bootle on the southwest coast of cumberland the whole along mountainroads through a beautiful country and we had fine weather the verses end with our breakfast at the head of yewdale in a yeomans house which like all the other property in that sequestered vale has passed or is passing into the hands of mr james marshall of monk coniston in mr knotts the late owners time called waterhead our hostess married a mr oldfield a lieutenant in the navy they lived together for some time at hackett where she still resides as his widow it was in front of that house on the mountainside near which stood the peasant who while we were passing at a distance saluted us waving a kerchief in his hand as described in the poem the dog which we met soon after our starting had belonged to mr rowlandson who for forty years was curate at grasmere in place of the rector who lived to extreme old age in a state of insanity of this mr r much might be said both with reference to his character and the way in which he was regarded by his parishioners he was a man of a robust frame had a firm voice and authoritative manner of strong natural talents of which he was himself conscious for he has been heard to say it grieves me to add with an oath if i had been brought up at college by  i should have been a bishop two vices used to struggle in him for mastery avarice and the love of strong drink but avarice as is common in like cases always got the better of its opponent for though he was often intoxicated it was never i believe at his own expense as has been said of one in a more exalted station he could take any given quantity i have heard a story of him which is worth the telling one summers morning our grasmere curate after a nights carouse in the vale of langdale on his return home having reached a point near which the whole vale of grasmere might be seen with the lake immediately below him he stept aside and sat down upon the turf after looking for some time at the landscape then in the perfection of its morning beauty he exclaimed good god that i should have led so long such a life in such a place this no doubt was deeply felt by him at the time but i am not authorised to say that any noticeable amendment followed penuriousness strengthened upon him as his body grew feebler with age he had purchased property and kept some land in his own hands but he could not find in his heart to lay out the necessary hire for labourers at the proper season and consequently he has often been seen in half dotage working his hay in the month of november by moonlighta melancholy sight which i myself have witnessed notwithstanding all that has been said this man on account of his talents and superior education was looked up to by his parishioners who without a single exception lived at that time and most of them upon their own small inheritances in a state of republican equality a condition favourable to the growth of kindly feelings among them and in a striking degree exclusive to temptations to gross vice and scandalous behaviour as a pastor their curate did little or nothing for them but what could more strikingly set forth the efficacy of the church of england through its ordinances and liturgy than that in spite of the unworthiness of the minister his church was regularly attended and though there was not much appearance in his flock of what might be called animated piety intoxication was rare and dissolute morals unknown with the bible they were for the most part well acquainted and as was strikingly shown when they were under affliction must have been supported and comforted by habitual belief in those truths which it is the aim of the church to inculcate notes sled l110a local word for sledge bield l 175a word common in the country signifying shelter as in scotland   460 upon perusing the foregoing epistle thirty years after its composition  loughrigg tarn  this beautiful pool and the surrounding scene are minutely described in my little book on the lakes  sir ghb in the earlier part of his life was induced by his love of nature and the art of painting to take up his abode at old brathay about three miles from this spot so that he must have seen it the tarn under many aspects and he was so much pleased with it that he purchased the tarn with a view to build such a residence as is alluded to in this epistle baronets and knights were not so common in that day as now and sir m le fleming not liking to have a rival in this kind of distinction so near him claimed a sort of lordship over the territory and showed dispositions little in unison with those of sir g beaumont who was eminently a lover of peace the project of building was given up sir gb retaining possession of the tarn many years afterwards a kendal tradesman born upon its banks applied to me for the purchase of it and accordingly it was sold for the sum that had been given for it and the money was laid out under my direction upon a substantial oak fence for a certain number of yewtrees to be planted in grasmere churchyard two were planted in each enclosure with a view to remove after a certain time the one which throve the least after several years the stouter plant being left the others were taken up and placed in other parts of the same churchyard and were adequately fenced at the expense and under the care of the late mr barber mr greenwood and myself the whole eight are now thriving and are an ornament to a place which during late years has lost much of its rustic simplicity by the introduction of iron palisades to fence off family buryinggrounds and by numerous monuments some of them in very bad taste from which this place of burial was in my memory quite free see the lines in the sixth book of the excursion beginning      green is the churchyard  the epistle to which these notes refer though written so far back as 1811 was carefully revised so late as 1842 previous to its publication i am loath to add that it was never seen by the person to whom it is addressed so sensible am i of the deficiencies in all that i write and so far does every thing that i attempt fall short of what i wish it to be that even private publication if such a term may be allowed requires more resolution than i can command i have written to give vent to my own mind and not without hope that some time or other kindred minds might benefit by my labours but i am inclined to believe i should never have ventured to send forth any verses of mine to the world if it had not been done on the pressure of personal occasions had i been a rich man my productions like this epistle the tragedy of the borderers c would most likely have been confined to ms   461 ibid  loughrigg tarn alluded to in the foregoing epistle resembles though much smaller in compass the lake nemi or speculum dianae as it is often called not only in its clear waters and circular form and the beauty immediately surrounding it but also as being overlooked by the eminence of langdale pikes as lake nemi is by that of monte calvo since this epistle was written loughrigg tarn has lost much of its beauty by the felling of many natural clumps of wood relics of the old forest particularly upon the farm called the oaks from the abundance of that tree which grew there  it is to be regretted upon public grounds that sir george beaumont did not carry into effect his intention of constructing here a summer retreat in the style i have described as his taste would have set an example how buildings with all the accommodations modern society requires might be introduced even into the most secluded parts of this country without injuring their native character the design was not abandoned from failure of inclination on his part but in consequence of local untowardness which need not be particularised   462 gold and silver fishes in a vaseii  they were a present from miss jewsbury of whom mention is made in the note at the end of the next poem the fish were healthy to all appearance in their confinement for a long time but at last for some cause we could not make out languished and one of them being all but dead they were taken to the pool under the old pollard oak the apparently dying one lay on its side unable to move i used to watch it and about the tenth day it began to right itself and in a few days more was able to swim about with its companions for many months they continued to prosper in their new place of abode but one night by an unusually great flood they were swept out of the pool and perished to our great regret   463 liberty sequel to the

wild geranium known by that name   466 ibid  i often ask myself what will become of rydal mount after our day will the old walls and steps remain in front of the house and about the grounds or will they be swept away with all the beautiful mosses and ferns and wild geraniums and other flowers which their rude construction suffered and encouraged to grow among them this little wild flower poor

to the lady le fleming ix  after thanking in prose lady fleming for the service she had done to her neighbourhood by erecting this chapel i have nothing to say beyond the expression of regret that the architect did not furnish an elevation better suited to the site in a narrow mountain pass and what is of more consequence better constructed in the interior for the purposes of worship it has no

               xxii selections from chaucer modernised  487 of the volume in which the selections appeared  of these selections the author wrote as follows to professor reed of philadelphia  there has recently been published in london a volume of some of chaucers tales and poems modernised this little specimen originated in what i attempted with the prioresss tale and if the book should find its way to america you will see in it two further specimens from myself i had no further connection with the publication than by making a present of these to one of the contributors let me however recommend to your notice the prologue and the franklins tale they are both by mr horne a gentleman unknown to me but are the latter in particular very well done mr leigh hunt has not failed in the manciples tale which i myself modernised many years ago but though i much admire the genius of chaucer as displayed in this performance i could not place my version at the disposal of the editor as i deemed the subject somewhat too indelicate for pure taste to be offered to the world at this time of day mr horne has much hurt this publication by not abstaining from the reves tale this after making all allowance for the rude manners of chaucers age is intolerable and by indispensably softening down the incidents he has killed the spirit of that humour gross and farcical that pervades the original when the work was first mentioned to me i protested as strongly as possible against admitting any coarseness or indelicacy so that my conscience is clear of countenancing aught of that kind so great is my admiration of chaucers genius and so profound my reverence for him as an instrument in the hands of providence for spreading the light of literature through his native land that notwithstanding the defects and faults in this publication i am glad of it as a mean for making many acquainted with the original who would otherwise be ignorant of everything about him but his name9

has been made than was necessary for the fluent reading and instant understanding of the author so much however is the language altered since chaucers time especially in pronunciation that much was to be removed and its place supplied with as little incongruity as possible the ancient accent has been retained in a few conjunctions as alsò and alwày from a conviction that such sprinklings of antiquity would be admitted by persons of taste to have a graceful accordance with the subject the fierce bigotry of the prioress forms a fine background for her tenderhearted sympathies with the mother and child and the mode in which the story is told amply atones for the extravagance of the miracle     xxiii poems referring to the period of old age  489 the old cumberland beggar i  the class of beggars to which the old man here described belongs will probably soon be extinct it consisted of poor and mostly old and infirm persons who confined themselves to a stated round in their neighbourhood and had certain fixed days on which at different houses they regularly received alms sometimes in money but mostly in provisions  490 ibid  observed and with great benefit to my own heart when i was a child written at racedown and alfoxden in my 23d year the political economists were about that time beginning their war upon mendicity in all its forms and by implication if not directly on almsgiving also this heartless process has been carried as far as it can go by the amended poor law bill tho the inhumanity that prevails in this measure is somewhat disguised by the profession that one of its objects is to throw the poor upon the voluntary donations of their neighbours that is if rightly interpreted to force them into a condition between relief in the union poor house and alms robbed of their christian grace and spirit as being forced rather from the avaricious and selfish and all in fact but the humane and charitable are at liberty to keep all they possess from their distressed brethren  491 the farmer of tilsbury vale  with this picture which was taken from real life compare the imaginative one of the reverie of poor susan and see to make up the deficiencies of the class the excursion passim  492 ibid  the character of this man was described to me and the incident upon which the verses turn was told me by mr pool of nether stowey with whom i

conduct to his labourers and poor neighbours their virtues he carefully encouraged and weighed their faults in the scales of charity if i seem in these verses to have treated the weaknesses of the farmer and his transgression too tenderly it may in part be ascribed to my having received the story from one so averse to all harsh judgment after his death was found in his escritoir a lock of gray hair carefully preserved with a notice that it had been cut from the head of his faithful shepherd who had served him for a length of years i need scarcely add that he felt for all men as brothers he

inmate with her at coleorton hall as were also mary and my sister the truth in the sketch of her character here given was acknowledged with gratitude by her nearest relatives she was eloquent in conversation energetic upon public matters open in respect to these but slow to communicate her personal feelings upon these she never touched in her intercourse with me so that i could not regard myself as her confidential friend and was accordingly surprised when i learnt she had left me a legacy of 100l as a token of her esteem see in further illustration the second stanza inscribed upon her

cambridge the storm of wind and rain on this day was so violent that the coach in which my mother and i travelled the same coach was all but blown over and had the coachman drawn up as he attempted to

fields  this way of indicating the name of my lamented friend has been found fault with perhaps rightly so but i may say in justification of the double sense of the word that similar allusions are not uncommon in epitaphs one of the best in our language in verse i ever read was upon a person who bore the name of palmer and the course of the thought throughout turned upon the life of the departed considered as a pilgrimage nor can i think that the objection in the present case will have much force with any one who remembers charles lambs beautiful sonnet addressed to his own name and ending      no deed of mine shall shame thee gentle name   509 ibid  light will be thrown upon the tragic circumstance alluded to in this poem when after the death of charles lambs sister his biographer mr serjeant talfourd shall be at liberty to relate particulars which could not at the time when his memoir was written be given to the public mary lamb was ten years older than her brother and has survived him as long a time were i to give way to my own feelings i should dwell not only on her genius and intellectual powers but upon the delicacy and refinement of manner which she maintained inviolable under most trying circumstances she was loved and honoured by all her brothers friends and others some of them strange characters whom his philanthropic peculiarities induced him to countenance the death of c lamb himself was doubtless hastened by his sorrow for that of coleridge to whom he had been attached from the time of their being schoolfellows at christs hospital lamb was a good latin scholar and probably would have gone to college upon one of the school foundations but for the impediment in his speech had such been his lot he would have probably been preserved from the indulgences of social humours and fancies which were often injurious to himself and causes of severe regret to his friends without really benefiting the object of his misapplied kindness   510 extempore effusion upon the death of james hogg xv  these verses were written extempore immediately after reading a notice of the ettrick shepherds death in the newcastle paper to the editor of which i sent a copy for publication the persons lamented in these verses were all either of my friends or acquaintance in lockharts life of sir walter scott an account is given of my first meeting with him in 1803 how the ettrick shepherd and i became known to each other has already been mentioned in these notes he was undoubtedly a man of original genius but of coarse manners and low and offensive opinions of coleridge and lamb i need not speak here crabbe i have met in london at mr rogers but more frequently and favourably at mr hoares upon hampstead heath every spring he used to pay that family a visit of some length and was upon terms of intimate friendship with mrs hoare and still more with her daughterinlaw who has a large collection of his letters addressed to herself after the poets decease application was made to her to give up these letters to his biographer that they or at least a part of them might be given to the public she hesitated to comply and asked my opinion on the subject by no means was my answer grounded not upon any objection there might be to publishing a selection from those letters but from an aversion i have always felt to meet idle curiosity by calling back the recently departed to become the object of trivial and familiar gossip crabbe obviously for the most part preferred the company of women to that of men for this among other reasons that he did not like to be put upon the stretch in general conversation accordingly in miscellaneous society his talk was so much below what might have been expected from a man so deservedly celebrated that to me it seemed trifling it must upon other occasions have been of a different character as i found in our rambles together on hampstead heath and not so much so from a readiness to communicate his knowledge of life and manners as of natural history in all its branches his mind was inquisitive and he seems to have taken refuge from a remembrance of the distresses he had gone through in these studies and the employments to which they led moreover such contemplations might tend profitably to counterbalance the painful truths which he had collected from his intercourse with mankind had i been more intimate with him i should have ventured to touch upon his office as a minister of the gospel and how far his heart and soul were in it so as to make him a zealous and diligent labourer in poetry tho he wrote much as we all know he assuredly was not so i happened once to speak of pains as necessary to produce merit of a certain kind which i highly valued his observation was it is not worth while you are right thought i if the labour encroaches upon the time due to teach truth as a steward of the mysteries of god but if poetry is to be produced at all make what you do produce as good as you can mr rogers once told me that he expressed his regret to crabbe that he wrote in his late works so much less correctly than in his earlier yes replied he but then i had a reputation to make now i can afford to relax whether it was from a modest estimate of his own qualifications or from causes less creditable his motives for writing verse and his hopes and aims were not so high as is to be desired after being silent for more than twenty years he again applied himself to poetry upon the spur of applause he received from the periodical publications of the day as he himself tells us in one of his prefaces is it not to be lamented that a man who was so conversant with permanent truth and whose writings are so valuable an acquisition to our countrys literature should have required an impulse from such a quarter10  10 in pencil on opposite page by mrs quillinandaddy dear i dont like this think how many reasons there were to depress his museto say nothing of his duties as a priest and probably he found poetry interfere with them he did not require such praise to make him write but it just put it into his heart to try again and gave him the courage to do so see notes and illustrations at close g  mrs hemans was unfortunate as a poetess in being obliged by circumstances to write for money and that so frequently and so much that she was compelled to look out for subjects wherever she could find them and to write as expeditiously as possible as a woman she was to a considerable degree a spoilt child of the world she had been early in life distinguished for talents and poems of hers were published whilst she was a girl she had also been handsome in her youth but her education had been most unfortunate she was totally ignorant of housewifery and could as easily have managed the spear of minerva as her needle it was from observing these deficiencies that one day while she was under my roof i purposely directed her attention to household economy and told her i had purchased scales which i intended to present to a young lady as a wedding present pointed out their utility for her especial benefit and said that no menage ought to be without them mrs hemans not in the least suspecting my drift reported this saying in a letter to a friend at the time as a proof of my simplicity being disposed to make large allowances for the faults of her education and the circumstances in which she was placed i felt most kindly disposed towards her and took her part upon all occasions and i was not a little affected by learning that after she withdrew to ireland a long and severe illness raised her spirit as it depressed her body this i heard from her most intimate friends and there is striking evidence of it in a poem entitled blank and in pencil on opposite pagedo you mean a sonnet entitled sabbath sonnet composed by mrs hemans april 26th 1835 a few days before her death how many blessed groups this hour are wending these notices of mrs hemans would be very unsatisfactory to her intimate friends as indeed they are to myself not so much for what is said but what for brevitys sake is left unsaid let it suffice to add there was much sympathy between us and if opportunity had been allowed me to see more of her i should have loved and valued her accordingly as it is i remember her with true affection for her amiable qualities and above all for her delicate and irreproachable conduct during her long separation from an unfeeling husband whom she had been led to marry from the romantic notions of inexperienced youth upon this husband i never heard her cast the least reproach nor did i ever hear her even name him though she did not forbear wholly to touch upon her domestic position but never so as that any fault could be found with her manner of adverting to it   511 dead friends immortals xv  walter scott      died 21st sept 1832 st coleridge        25th july  1834 charles lamb          27th dec  1834 geo

residence at townend grasmere two years at least passed between the writing of the four first stanzas and the remaining part to the attentive and competent reader the whole sufficiently explains itself but there may be no harm in adverting here to particular feelings or experiences of my own mind on which the structure of the poem partly rests nothing was more difficult for me in childhood than to admit the notion of death as a state applicable to my own being i have said elsewhere                    a simple child       that lightly draws its breath     and feels its life in every limb       what should it know of death11  11 in pencil on opposite pagebut this first stanza of we are seven is coleridges jem and all mr quillinan  but it was not so much from the source of animal vivacity that my difficulty came as from a sense of the indomitableness of the spirit within me i used to brood over the stories of enoch and elijah and almost to persuade myself that whatever might become of others i should be translated in something of the same way to heaven with a feeling congenial to this i was often unable to think of external things as having external existence and i communed with all that i saw as something not apart from but inherent in my own immaterial nature many times while going to school have i grasped at a wall or tree to recall myself from this abyss of idealism to the reality at that time i was afraid of such processes in later periods of life i have deplored as we have all reason to do a subjugation of an opposite character and have rejoiced over the remembrances as is expressed in the lines obstinate questionings c to that dreamlike vividness and splendour which invest objects of sight in childhood every one i believe if he would look back could bear testimony and i need not dwell upon it here but having in the poem regarded it as presumptive evidence of a prior state of existence i think it right to protest against a conclusion which has given pain to some good and pious persons that i meant to inculcate such a belief it is far too shadowy a notion to be recommended to faith as more than an element in our instincts of immortality but let us bear in mind that though the idea is not advanced in revelation there is nothing there to contradict it and the fall of man presents an analogy in its favour accordingly a preexistent state has entered into the popular creeds of many nations and among all persons acquainted with classic literature is known as an ingredient in platonic philosophy archimedes said that he could move the world if he had a point whereon to rest his machine who has not felt the same aspirations as regards the world of his own mind having to wield some of its elements when i was impelled to write this poem on the immortality of the soul i took hold of the notion of preexistence as having sufficient foundation in humanity for authorising me to make for my purpose the best use of it i could as a poet                                          xxv the excursion   513 on the leading characters and scenes of the poem  something must now be said of this poem but chiefly as has been done through the whole of these notes with reference to my personal friends and especially to her miss fenwick who has perseveringly taken them down from my dictation towards the close of the 1st book stand the lines that were first written beginning nine tedious years and ending last human tenant of these ruined walls these were composed in 1795 at racedown and for several passages describing the employment and demeanour of margaret during her affliction i was indebted to observations made in dorsetshire and afterwards at alfoxden in somersetshire where i resided in 1797 and 1798 the lines towards the conclusion of the 4th book despondency corrected beginning for the man who in this spirit to the words intellectual soul were in order of time composed the next either at racedown or alfoxden i do not remember which the rest of the poem was written in the vale of grasmere chiefly during our residence at allan bank the long poem on my own education was together with many minor poems composed while we lived at the cottage at townend perhaps my purpose of giving an additional interest to these my poems in the eyes of my nearest and dearest friends may he promoted by saying a few words upon the character of the wanderer the solitary and the pastor and some other of the persons introduced and first of the principal one the wanderer  my lamented friend southey for this is written a month after his decease12 used to say that had he been a papist the course of life which would in all probability have been his was the one for which he was most fitted and most to his mind that of a benedictine monk in a convent furnished as many once were and some still are with an inexhaustible library books as appears from many passages in his writings and was evident to those who had opportunities of observing his daily life were in fact his passion and wandering i can with truth affirm was mine but this propensity in me was happily counteracted by inability from want of fortune to fulfil my wishes  12 which took place in march 1843  but had i been born in a class which would have deprived me of what is called a liberal education it is not unlikely that being strong in body i should have taken to a way of life such as that in which my pedlar passed the greater part of his days at all events i am here called upon freely to acknowledge that the character i have represented in his person is chiefly an idea of what i fancied my own character might have become in his circumstances  nevertheless much of what he says and does had an external existence that fell under my own youthful and subsequent observation  an individual named patrick by birth and education a scotchman followed this humble occupation for many years and afterwards settled in the town of kendal he married a kinswoman of my wifes and her sister sarah was brought up from early childhood under this good mans eye13 my own imaginations i was happy to find clothed in reality and fresh ones suggested by what she reported of this mans tenderness of heart his strong and pure imagination and his solid attainments in literature chiefly religious whether in prose or verse at hawkshead also while i was a schoolboy there occasionally resided a packman the name then generally given to this calling with whom i had frequent conversations upon what had befallen him and what he had observed during his wandering life and as was natural we took much to each other and upon the subject of pedlarism in general as then followed and its favourableness to an intimate knowledge of human concerns not merely among the humbler classes of society i need say nothing here in addition to what is to be found in the excursion and a note attached to it  13 in pencil on opposite pagesarah went to kendal on our mothers death but mr p died in the course of a year or two mw  now for the solitary of him i have much less to say not long after we took up our abode at grasmere came to reside there from what motive i either never knew or have forgotten a scotchman a little past the middle of life who had for many years been chaplain to a highland regiment he was in no respect as far as i know an interesting character though in his appearance there was a good deal that attracted attention as if he had been shattered in for bane and not happy in mind of his quondam position i availed myself to connect with the wanderer also a scotchman a character suitable to my purpose the elements of which i drew from several persons with whom i had been connected and who fell under my observation during frequent residences in london at the beginning of the french revolution the chief of these was one may now say a mr fawcett a preacher at a dissenting meetinghouse at the old jewry it happened to me several times to be one of his congregation through my connection with mr nicholson of cateaton street strand who at a time when i had not many acquaintances in london used often to invite me to dine with him on sundays and i took that opportunity mr n being a dissenter of going to hear fawcett who was an able and eloquent man he published a poem on war which had a good deal of merit and made me think more about him than i should otherwise have done but his christianity was probably never very deeply rooted and like many others in those times of like shewy talents he had not strength of character to withstand the effects of the french revolution and of the wild and lax opinions which had done so much towards producing it and far more in carrying it forward in its extremes poor fawcett i have been told became pretty much such a person as i have described and early disappeared from the stage having fallen into habits of intemperance which i have heard though i will not answer for the fact hastened his death of him i need say no more there were many like him at that time which the world will never be without but which were more numerous then for reasons too obvious to be dwelt upon  the pastorto what is said of the pastor in the poem i have little to add but what may be deemed superfluous it has ever appeared to me highly favourable to the beneficial influence of the church of england upon all gradations and classes of society that the patronage of its benefices is in numerous instances attached to the estates of noble families of ancient gentry and accordingly i am gratified by the opportunity afforded me in the excursion to pourtray the character of a country clergyman of more than ordinary talents born and bred in the upper ranks of society so as to partake of their refinements and at the same time brought by his pastoral office and his love of rural life into intimate connection with the peasantry of his native district  to illustrate the relation which in my mind this pastor bore to the wanderer and the resemblances between them or rather the points of community in their nature i likened one to an oak and the other to a sycamore and having here referred to this comparison i need only add i had no one individual in my mind wishing rather to embody this idea than to break in upon the simplicity of it by traits of individual character or of any peculiarity of opinion  and now for a few words upon the scene where these interviews and conversations are supposed to occur  the scene of the first book of the poem is i must own laid in a tract of country not sufficiently near to that which soon comes into view in the second book to agree with the fact all that relates to margaret and the ruined cottage c was taken from observations made in the southwest of england and certainly it would require more than sevenleagued boots to stretch in one morning from a common in somersetshire or dorsetshire to the heights of furness fells and the deep valleys they embosom for this dealing with space i need make i trust no apology but my friends may be amused by the truth  in the poem i suppose that the pedlar and i ascended from a plain country up the vale of langdale and struck off a good way above the chapel to the western side of the vale we ascended the hill and thence looked down upon the circular recess in which lies blea tarn chosen by the solitary for his retreat after we quit his cottage passing over a low ridge we descend into another vale that of little langdale towards the head of which stands embowered or partly shaded by yews and other trees something between a cottage and a mansion or gentlemans house such as they once were in this country this i convert into the parsonage and at the same time and as by the waving of a magic wand i turn the comparatively confined vale of langdale its tarn and the rude chapel which once adorned the valley into the stately and comparatively spacious vale of grasmere and its ancient parish church and upon the side of loughrigg fell at the foot of the lake and looking down upon it and the whole vale and its accompanying mountains the pastor is supposed by me to stand when at sunset he addresses his companions in words which i hope my readers may remember14 or i should not have taken the trouble of giving so much in detail the materials on which my mind actually worked  14 excursion book the last near the conclusion  now for a few particulars of fact respecting the persons whose stories are told or characters described by the different speakers to margaret i have already alluded i will add here that the lines beginning      she was a woman of a steady mind  and      live on earth a life of happiness  faithfully delineate as far as they go the character possessed in common by many women whom it has been my happiness to know in humble life and that several of the most touching things which she is represented as saying and doing are taken from actual observation of the distresses and trials under which different persons were suffering some of them strangers to me and others daily under my notice  i was born too late to have a distinct remembrance of the origin of the american war but the state in which i represent roberts mind to be i had frequent opportunities of observing at the commencement of our rupture with france in 1793 opportunities of which i availed myself in the story of the female vagrant as told in the poem on guilt and sorrow the account given by the solitary towards the close of the second book in all that belongs to the character of the old man was taken from a grasmere pauper who was boarded in the last house quitting the vale on the road to ambleside the character of his hostess and all that befell the poor man upon the mountain belongs to paterdale the woman i knew well her name was ruth jackson and she was exactly such a person as i describe the ruins of the old chapel among which the old man was found lying may yet be traced and stood upon the ridge that divides paterdale from boardale and martindale having been placed there for the convenience of both districts the glorious appearance disclosed above and among the mountains was described partly from what my friend mr luff who then lived in paterdale witnessed upon this melancholy occasion and partly from what mrs wordsworth and i had seen in company with sir g and lady beaumont above hartshope hall in our way from paterdale to ambleside  and now for a few words upon the church its monuments and of the deceased who are spoken of as lying in the surrounding churchyard but first for the one picture given by the wanderer of the living in this nothing is introduced but what was taken from nature and real life the cottage was called hackett and stands as described on the southern extremity of the ridge which separates the two langdales the pair who inhabited it were called jonathan and betty yewdale once when our children were ill of whoopingcough i think we took them for change of air to this cottage and were in the habit of going there to drink tea upon fine summer afternoons so that we became intimately acquainted with the characters habits and lives of these good and let me say in the main wise people the matron had in her early youth been a servant in a house at hawkshead where several boys boarded while i was a schoolboy there i did not remember her as having served in that capacity but we had many little anecdotes to tell to each other of remarkable boys incidents and adventures which had made a noise in their day in that small town these two persons were induced afterwards to settle at rydal where they both died  church and churchyardthe church as already noticed is that of grasmere the interior of it has been improved lately and made warmer by underdrawing the roof and raising the floor but the rude and antique majesty of its former appearance has been impaired by painting the rafters and the oak benches with a simple rail at the back dividing them from each other have given way to seats that have more the appearance of pews it is remarkable that excepting only the pew belonging to rydal hall that to rydal mount the one to the parsonage and i believe another the men and women still continue as used to be the custom in wales to sit separate from each other is this practice as old as the reformation and when and how did it originate in the jewish synagogues and in lady huntingdons chapels the sexes are divided in the same way in the adjoining churchyard greater changes have taken place it is now not a little crowded with tombstones and near the schoolhouse which stands in the churchyard is an ugly structure built to receive the hearse which is recently come into use it would not be worth while to allude to this building or the hearsevehicle it contains but that the latter has been the means of introducing a change much to be lamented in the mode of conducting funerals among the mountains now the coffin is lodged in the hearse at the door of the house of the deceased and the corpse is so conveyed to the churchyard gate all the solemnity which formerly attended its progress as described in this poem is put an end to so much do i regret this that i beg to be excused for giving utterance here to a wish that should it befall me to die at rydal mount my own body may be carried to grasmere church after the manner in which till lately that of every one was borne to the place of sepulchre here namely on the shoulders of neighbours no house being passed without some words of a funeral psalm being sung at the time by the attendants bearing it when i put into the mouth of the wanderer many precious rites and customs of our rural ancestry are gone or stealing from us this i hope will last for ever and what follows little did i foresee that the observance and mode of proceeding which had often affected me so much would so soon be superseded  having said much of the injury done to this churchyard let me add that one is at liberty to look forward to a time when by the growth of the yewtrees thriving there a solemnity will be spread over the place that will in some degree make amends for the old simple character which has already been so much encroached upon and will be still more every year i will here set down by way of memorial that my friend sir g beaumont having long ago purchased the beautiful piece of water called loughrigg tarn on the banks of which he intended to build i told him that a person in kendal who was attached to the place wished to purchase it sir george finding the possession of no use to him consented to part with it and placed the purchasemoney 20l at my disposal for any local use which i thought proper accordingly i resolved to plant yewtrees in the churchyard and had four pretty strong large oak enclosures made in each of which was planted under my own eye and principally if not entirely by my own hand two young trees with the intention of leaving the one that throve best to stand many years after mr barber who will long be remembered in grasmere mr greenwood the chief landed proprietor and myself had four other enclosures made in the churchyard at our own expense in each of which was planted a tree taken from its neighbour and they all stand thriving admirably the fences having been removed as no longer necessary may the trees be taken care of hereafter when we are all gone and some of them will perhaps at some fardistant time rival the majesty of the yew of lorton and those which i have described as growing at borrowdale where they are still to be seen in grand assemblage  and now for the persons that are selected as lying in the churchyard but first for the individual whose grave is prepared to receive him  his story is here truly related he was a schoolfellow of mine for some years he came to us when he was at least seventeen years of age very tall robust and full grown this prevented him from falling into the amusements and games of the school consequently he gave more time to books he was not remarkably bright or quick but by industry he made a progress more than respectable his parents not being wealthy enough to send him to college when he left hawkshead he became a schoolmaster with a view to preparing himself for holy orders about this time he fell in love as related in the poem and every thing followed as there described except that i do not know exactly when and where he died the number of youths that came to hawkshead school from the families of the humble yeomanry to be educated to a certain degree of scholarship as a preparation for the church was considerable and the fortunes of those persons in after life various of course and some not a little remarkable i have now one of this class in my eye who became an usher in a preparatory school and ended in making a large fortune his manners when he came to hawkshead were as uncouth as well could be but he had good abilities with skill to turn them to account and when the master of the school to which he was usher died he stept into his place and became proprietor of the establishment he continued to manage it with such address and so much to the taste of what is called high society and the fashionable world that no school of the kind even till he retired was in such high request ministers of state the wealthiest gentry and nobility of the first rank vied with each other in bespeaking a place for their sons in the seminary of this fortunate teacher in pencil on opposite pagemr pearson in the solitude of grasmere while living as a married man in a cottage of 8l per annum rent i often used to smile at the tales which reached me of the brilliant career of this quondam clownfor such in reality he was in manners and appearance before he was polished a little by attrition with gentlemens sons trained at hawkshead rough and rude as many of our families were not 200 yards from the cottage in grasmere just mentioned to which i retired this gentleman who many years afterwards purchased a small estate in the neighbourhood is now erecting a boathouse with an upper story to be resorted to as an entertaining room when he and his associates may feel inclined to take their pastime on the lake every passenger will be disgusted with the sight of this edifice not merely as a tasteless thing in itself but as utterly out of place and peculiarly fitted as far as it is observed and it obtrudes itself on notice at every point of view to mar the beauty and destroy the pastoral simplicity of the vale for my own part and that of my household it is our utter detestation standing by a shore to which before the high road was made to pass that way we used daily and hourly to repair for seclusion and for the shelter of a grove under which i composed many of my poemsthe brothers especially and for this reason we gave the grove that name that which each man loved and prized in his peculiar nook of earth dies with him or is changed so much for my old schoolfellow and his exploits i will only add that as the foundation has twice failed from the lake no doubt being intolerant of the intrusion there is some ground for hoping that the impertinent structure will not stand it has been rebuilt in somewhat better taste and much as one wishes it away it is not now so very unsightly the structure is an emblem of the man perseverance has conquered difficulties and given something of form and polish to rudeness in pencil on opposite pagethis boathouse badly built gave way and was rebuilt it again tumbled and was a third time reconstructed but in a better fashion than before it is not now per se an ugly building however obtrusive it may be  the miner next described as having found his treasure after twice ten years of labour lived in paterdale and the story is true to the letter it seems to me however rather remarkable that the strength of mind which had supported him through his long unrewarded labour did not enable him to bear its successful issue several times in the course of my life i have heard of sudden influxes of great wealth being followed by derangement and in one instance the shock of good fortune was so great as to produce absolute idiotcy but these all happened where there had been little or no previous effort to acquire the riches and therefore such a consequence might the more naturally be expected than in the case of the solitary miner in reviewing his story one cannot but regret that such perseverance was not sustained by a worthier object archimedes leaped out of his bath and ran about the streets proclaiming his discovery in a transport of joy but we are not told that he lost either his life or his senses in consequence  the next character to whom the priest is led by contrast with the resoluteness displayed by the foregoing is taken from a person born and bred in grasmere by name dawson and whose talents dispositions and way of life were such as are here delineated i did not know him but all was fresh in memory when we settled at grasmere in the beginning of the century from this point the conversation leads to the mention of two individuals who by their several fortunes were at different times driven to take refuge at the small and obscure town of hawkshead on the skirt of these mountains their stories i had from the dear old dame with whom as a schoolboy and afterwards i lodged for the space of nearly ten years the elder the jacobite was named drummond and was of a high family in scotland the hanoverian whig bore the name of vandeput15 and might perhaps be a descendant of some dutchman who had come over in the train of king william at all events his zeal was such that he ruined himself by a contest for the representation of london or westminster undertaken to support his party and retired to this corner of the world selected as it had been by drummond for that obscurity which since visiting the lakes became fashionable it has no longer retained so much was this region considered out of the way till a late period that persons who had fled from justice used often to resort hither for concealment and some were so bold as to not unfrequently make excursions from the place of their retreat for the purpose of committing fresh offences such was particularly the case with two brothers of the name of weston who took up their abode at old brathay i think about seventy years ago they were highwaymen and lived there some time without being discovered though it was known that they often disappeared in a way and upon errands which could not be accounted for their horses were noticed as being of a choice breed and i have heard from the relph family one of whom was a saddler in the town of kendal that they were curious in their saddles and housings and accoutrements of their horses they as i have heard and as was universally believed were in the end both taken and hanged  15 sir george vandeput  tall was her stature her complexion dark and saturninethis person lived at townend and was almost our next neighbour i have little to notice concerning her beyond what is said in the poem she was a most striking instance how far a woman may surpass in talent in knowledge and culture of mind those with and among whom she lives and yet fall below them in christian virtues of the heart and spirit it seemed almost and i say it with grief that in proportion as she excelled in the one she failed in the other how frequently has one to observe in both sexes the same thing and how mortifying is the reflection  as on a sunny bank the tender lambthe story that follows was told to mrs wordsworth and my sister by the sister of this unhappy young woman every particular was exactly as i have related the party was not known to me though she lived at hawkshead but it was after i left school the clergyman who administered comfort to her in her distress i knew well her sister who told the story was the wife of a leading yeoman in the vale of grasmere and they were an affectionate pair and greatly respected by every one who knew them neither lived to be old and their estate which was perhaps the most considerable then in the vale and was endeared to them by many remembrances of a salutary character not easily understood or sympathised with by those who are born to great affluence past to their eldest son according to the practice of these vales who died soon after he came into possession he was an amiable and promising youth but was succeeded by an only brother a goodnatured man who fell into habits of drinking by which he gradually reduced his property and the other day the last acre of it was sold and his wife and children and he himself still surviving have very little left to live upon which it would not perhaps have been worth while to record here but that through all trials this woman has proved a model of patience meekness affectionate forbearance and forgiveness their eldest son who through the vices of his father has thus been robbed of an ancient family inheritance was never heard to murmur or complain against the cause of their distress and is now deservedly the chief prop of his mothers hopes  book viithe clergyman and his family described at the beginning of this book were during many years our principal associates in the vale of grasmere unless i were to except our very nearest neighbours i have entered so particularly into the main points of their history that i will barely testify in prose that with the single exception of the particulars of their journey to grasmere which however was exactly copied from real life in another instance the whole that i have said of them is as faithful to the truth as words can make it there was much talent in the family and the eldest son was distinguished for poetical talent of which a specimen is given in my notes to the sonnets on the duddon once when in our cottage at townend i was talking with him about poetry in the course of our conversation i presumed to find fault with the versification of pope of whom he was an enthusiastic admirer he defended him with a warmth that indicated much irritation nevertheless i would not abandon my point and said in compass and variety of sound your own versification surpasses his never shall i forget the change in his countenance and tone of voice the storm was laid in a moment he no longer disputed my judgment and i passed immediately in his mind no doubt for as great a critic as ever lived i ought to add he was a clergyman and a welleducated man and his verbal memory was the most remarkable of any individual i have known except a mr archer an irishman who lived several years in this neighbourhood and who in this faculty was a prodigy he afterwards became deranged and i fear continues so if alive  then follows the character of robert walker for which see nates to the duddon  next that of the deaf man whose epitaph may be seen in the churchyard at the head of haweswater and whose qualities of mind and heart and their benign influence in conjunction with his privation i had from his relatives on the spot  the blind man next commemorated was john gough of kendal a man known far beyond his neighbourhood for his talents and attainments in natural history and science  of the infants grave next noticed i will only say it is an exact picture of what fell under my own observation and all persons who are intimately acquainted with cottage life must often have observed like instances of the working of the domestic affections  a volley thrice repeatedthis young volunteer bore the name of dawson and was younger brother if i am not mistaken to the prodigal of whose character and fortunes an account is given towards the beginning of the preceding book the father of the family i knew well he was a man of literary education and considerable experience in society much beyond what was common among the inhabitants of the vale he had lived a good while in the highlands of scotland as a manager of ironworks at bunaw and had acted as clerk to one of my predecessors in the office of distributor of stamps when he used to travel round the country collecting and bringing home the money due to government in gold which it may be worth while to mention for the sake of my friends was deposited in the cell or iron closet under the west window which still exists with the iron doors that guarded the property this of course was before the time of bills and notes the two sons of this person had no doubt been led by the knowledge of their father to take more delight in scholarship and had been accustomed in their own minds to take a wider view of social interests than was usual among their associates the premature death of this gallant young man was much lamented and as an attendant upon the funeral i myself witnessed the ceremony and the effect of it as described in the poems tradition tells that in elizas golden days a knight came on a warhorse the house is gone the pillars of the gateway in front of the mansion remained when we first took up our abode at grasmere two or three cottages still remain which are called nott houses from the name of the gentleman i have called him a knight concerning whom these traditions survive he was the ancestor of the knott family formerly considerable proprietors in the district what follows in the discourse of the wanderer upon the changes he had witnessed in rural life by the introduction of machinery is truly described from what i myself saw during my boyhood and early youth and from what was often told me by persons of this humble calling happily most happily for these mountains the mischief was diverted from the banks of their beautiful streams and transferred to open and flat counties abounding in coal where the agency of steam was found much more effectual for carrying on those demoralising works had it not been for this invention long before the present time every torrent and river in this district would have had its factory large and populous in proportion to the power of the water that could there be commanded parliament has interfered to prevent the nightwork which was carried on in these mills as actively as during the daytime and by necessity still more perniciously a sad disgrace to the proprietors and to the nation which could so long tolerate such unnatural proceedings  reviewing at this late period 1843 what i put into the mouths of my interlocutors a few years after the commencement of the century i grieve that so little progress has been made in diminishing the evils deplored or promoting the benefits of education which the wanderer anticipates the results of lord ashleys labours to defer the time when children might legally be allowed to work in factories and his endeavours to still further limit the hours of permitted labour have fallen far short of his own humane wishes and of those of every benevolent and rightminded man who has carefully attended to this subject and in the present session of parliament 1843 sir james grahams attempt to establish a course of religious education among the children employed in factories has been abandoned in consequence of what might easily have been foreseen the vehement and turbulent opposition of the dissenters so that for many years to come it may be thought expedient to leave the religious instruction of children entirely in the hands of the several denominations of christians in the island each body to work according to its own means and in its own way such is my own confidence a confidence i share with many others of my most valued friends in the superior advantages both religious and social which attend a course of instruction presided over and guided by the clergy of the church of england that i have no doubt that if but once its members lay and clerical were duly sensible of those benefits their church would daily gain ground and rapidly upon every shape and fashion of dissent and in that case a great majority in parliament being sensible of these benefits the ministers of the country might be emboldened were it necessary to apply funds of the state to the support of education on church principles before i conclude i cannot forbear noticing the strenuous efforts made at this time in parliament by so many persons to extend manufacturing and commercial industry at the expense of agricultural though we have recently had abundant proofs that the apprehensions expressed by the wanderer were not groundless      i spake of mischief by the wise diffused     with gladness thinking that the more it spreads     the healthier the securer we become     delusion which a moment may destroy  the chartists are well aware of this possibility and cling to it with all ardour and perseverance which nothing but wiser and more brotherly dealing towards the many on the part of the wealthy few can moderate or remove  book ix towards conclusion      while from the grassy mountains open side     we gazed  the point here fixed upon in my imagination is halfway up the northern side of loughrigg fell from which the pastor and his companions are supposed to look upwards to the sky and mountaintops and round the vale with the lake lying immediately beneath them      but turned not without welcome promise given     that he would share the pleasures and pursuits     of yet another summers day consumed     in wandering with us  when i reported this promise of the solitary and long after it was my wish and i might say intention that we should resume our wanderings and pass the borders into his native country where as i hoped he might witness in the society of the wanderer some religious ceremonya sacrament say in the open fields or a preaching among the mountains which by recalling to his mind the days of his early childhood when he had been present on such occasions in company with his parents and nearest kindred might have dissolved his heart into tenderness and so done more towards restoring the christian faith in which he had been educated and with that contentedness and even cheerfulness of mind than all that the wanderer and pastor by their several effusions and addresses had been enabled to effect an issue like this was in my intentions

artificial society i have ever been ready to pay homage to the aristocracy of nature under a conviction that vigorous humanheartedness is the constituent principle of true taste it may still however be satisfactory to have prose testimony how far a character employed for purposes of imagination is founded upon general fact i therefore subjoin an extract from an author who had opportunities of being well acquainted with a class of men from whom my own personal knowledge emboldened me to draw this portrait  we learn from caesar and other roman writers that the travelling merchants who frequented gaul and other barbarous countries either newly conquered by the roman arms or bordering on the roman conquests were ever the first to make the inhabitants of those countries familiarly acquainted with the roman modes of life and to inspire them with an inclination to follow the roman fashions and to enjoy roman conveniences in north america travelling merchants from the settlements have done and continue to do much more towards civilising the indian natives than all the missionaries papist or protestant who have ever been sent among them  it is farther to be observed for the credit of this most useful class of men that they commonly contribute by their personal manners no less than by the sale of their wares to the refinement of the people among whom they travel their dealings form them to great quickness of wit and acuteness of judgment having constant occasion to recommend themselves and their goods they acquire habits of the most obliging attention and the most insinuating address as in their peregrinations they have opportunity of contemplating the manners of various men and various cities they become eminently skilled in the knowledge of the world as they wander each alone through thinlyinhabited districts they form habits of reflection and of sublime contemplation with all these qualifications no wonder that they should often be in remote parts of the country the best mirrors of fashion and censors of manners and should contribute much to polish the roughness and soften the rusticity of our peasantry it is not more than twenty or thirty years since a young man going from any part of scotland to england of purpose to carry the pack was considered as going to lead the life and acquire the fortune of a gentleman when after twenty years absence in

wordsworth pl at rydal mount november 1847  i was born at cockermouth in cumberland on april 7th 1770 the second son of john wordsworth attorneyatlaw as lawyers of this class were then called and lawagent to sir james lowther afterwards earl of lonsdale my mother was anne only daughter of william cookson mercer of penrith and of dorothy born crackanthorp of the ancient family of that name who from the times of edward the third had lived in newbiggen hall westmoreland my grandfather was the first of the name of wordsworth who came into westmoreland where he purchased the small estate of sockbridge he was descended from a family who had been settled at peniston in yorkshire near the sources of the don probably before the norman conquest their names appear on different occasions in all the transactions personal and public connected with that parish and i possess through the kindness of col beaumont an almery made in 1325 at the expense of a william wordsworth as is expressed in a latin inscription16 carved upon it which carries the pedigree of the family back four generations from himself   16 the original is as follows some of the abbreviations being expanded hoc opus fiebat

letters ihs and m also the emblem of the holy trinity  for further information concerning this oak press see mr hunters paper in gentlemans magazine for july 1850 p 43  the time of my infancy and early boyhood was passed partly at cockermouth and partly with my mothers parents at penrith where my mother in the year 1778 died of a decline brought on by a cold the consequence of being put at a friends house in london in what used to be called a best bedroom my father never recovered his usual cheerfulness of mind after this loss and died when i was in my fourteenth year a schoolboy just returned from hawkshead whither i had been sent with my elder brother richard in my ninth year  i remember my mother only in some few situations one of which was her pinning a nosegay to my breast when i was going to say the catechism in the church as was customary before easter17 i remember also telling her on one week day that i had been at church for our school stood in the churchyard and we had frequent opportunities of seeing what was going on there the occasion was a woman doing penance in the church in a white sheet my mother commended my having been present expressing a hope that i should remember the circumstance for the rest of my life but said i mama they did not give me a penny as i had been told they would oh said she recanting her praises if that was your motive you were very properly disappointed  my last impression was having a glimpse of her on passing the door of her bedroom during her last illness when she was reclining in her easy chair an intimate friend of hers miss hamilton by name who was used to visit her at cockermouth told me that she once said to her that the only one of her five children about whose future life she was anxious was william and he she said would be remarkable either for good or for evil the cause of this was that i was of a stiff moody and violent temper so much so that i remember going once into the attics of my grandfathers house at penrith upon some indignity having been put upon me with an intention of destroying myself with one of the foils which i knew was kept there i took the foil in hand but my heart failed upon another occasion while i was at my grandfathers house at penrith along with my eldest brother richard we were whipping tops together in the large drawingroom on which the carpet was only laid down upon particular occasions the walls were hung round with family pictures and i said to my brother dare you strike your whip through that old ladys petticoat he replied no i wont then said i here goes and i struck my lash through her hooped petticoat for which no doubt though i have forgotten it i was properly punished but possibly from some want of judgment in punishments inflicted i had become perverse and obstinate in defying chastisement and rather proud of it than otherwise  17 see ecclesiastical sonnets part iii sonnet xxii on catechising  of my earliest days at school i have little to say but that they were very happy ones chiefly because i was left at liberty then and in the vacations to read whatever books i liked for example i read all fieldings works don quixote gil blas and any part of swift that i liked gullivers travels and the tale of the tub being both much to my taste i was very much indebted to one of the ushers of hawkshead school by name shaw who taught me more of latin in a fortnight than i had learnt during two preceding years at the school of cockermouth unfortunately for me this excellent master left our school and went to stafford where he taught for many years it may be perhaps as well to mention that the first verses which i wrote were a task imposed by my master the subject the summer vacation and of my own accord i added others upon return to school there was nothing remarkable in either poem but i was called upon among other scholars to write verses upon the completion of the second centenary from the foundation of the school in 1585 by archbishop sandys these verses were much admired far more than they deserved for they were but a tame imitation of popes versification and a little in his style this exercise however put it into my head to compose verses from the impulse of my own mind and i wrote while yet a schoolboy a long poem running upon my own adventures and the scenery of the country in which i was brought up the only part of that poem which has been preserved is the conclusion of it which stands at the beginning of my collected poems dear native regions c  in the month of october 1787 i was sent to st johns college cambridge of which my uncle dr cookson had been a fellow the master dr chevallier died very soon after18 and according to the custom of that time his body after being placed in the coffin was removed to the hall of the college and the pall spread over the coffin was stuck over by copies of verses english or latin the composition of the students of st johns my uncle seemed mortified when upon inquiry he learnt that none of these verses were from my pen because said he it would have been a fair opportunity for distinguishing yourself i did not however regret that i had been silent on this occasion as i felt no interest in the deceased person with whom i had had no intercourse and whom i had never seen but during his walks in the college grounds  18 he was succeeded by dr craven in 1789  when at school i with the other boys of the same standing was put upon reading the first six books of euclid with the exception of the fifth and also in algebra i learnt simple and quadratic equations and this was for me unlucky because i had a full twelvemonths start of the freshmen of my year and accordingly got into rather an idle way reading nothing but classic authors according to my fancy and italian poetry my italian master was named isola and had been well acquainted with gray the poet as i took to these studies with much interest he was proud of the progress i made under his correction i translated the vision of mirza and two or three other papers of the spectator into italian in the month of august 1790 i set off for the continent in companionship with robert jones a welshman a fellowcollegian we went staff in hand without knapsacks and carrying each his needments tied up in a pocket handkerchief with about twenty pounds apiece in our pockets we crossed from dover and landed at calais on the eve of the day when the king was to swear fidelity to the new constitution an event which was solemnised with due pomp at calais on the afternoon of that day we started and slept at ardres for what seemed best to me worth recording in this tour see the poem of my own life19  after taking my degree in january 1791 i went to london stayed there some time and then visited my friend jones who resided in the yale of clwydd north wales along with him i made a pedestrian tour through north wales for which also see the poem20  in the autumn of 1791 i went to paris where i stayed some little time and then went to orleans with a view of being out of the way of my own countrymen that i might learn to speak the language fluently at orleans and blois and paris on my return i passed fifteen or sixteen months21 it was a stirring time the king was dethroned when i was at blois and the massacres of september took place when i was at orleans but for these matters see also the poem i came home before the execution of the king and passed the subsequent time among my friends in london and elsewhere till i settled with my only sister at piacedown in dorsetshire in the year 1796  19 prelude book vi  20 ibid book xiv  21 this is not quite correct the time of his absence did not exceed thirteen months  here we were visited by mr coleridge then residing at bristol and for the sake of being near him when he had removed to netherstowey in somersetshire we removed to alfoxden three miles from that place this was a very pleasant and productive time of my life coleridge my sister and i set off on a tour to linton and other places in devonshire and in order to defray his part of the expense coleridge on the same afternoon commenced his poem of the ancient mariner in which i was to have borne my part and a few verses were written by me and some assistance given in planning the poem but our styles agreed so little that i withdrew from the concern and he finished it himself  in the course of that spring i composed many poems most of which were printed at bristol in one volume by my friend joseph cottle along with coleridges ancient mariner and two or three other of his pieces  in the autumn of 1798 mr coleridge a friend of his mr chester my sister and i crossed from yarmouth to hamburgh where we remained a few days and saw several times klopstock the poet mr coleridge and his friend went to ratzburg in the north of germany and my sister and i preferred going southward and for the sake of cheapness and the neighbourhood of the hartz mountains we spent the winter at the old imperial city of goslar the winter was perishingly coldthe coldest of this century and the good people with whom we lodged told me one morning that they expected to find me frozen to death my little sleeping room being immediately over an archway however neither my sister nor i took any harm  we returned to england in the following spring and went to visit our friends the hutchinsons at sockburnontees in the county of durham with whom we remained till the 19th of december we then came on st thomass day the 21st to a small cottage at townend grasmere which in the course of a tour some months previously with mr coleridge i had been pleased with and had hired this we furnished for about a hundred pounds which sum had come to my sister by a legacy from her uncle crackanthorp  i fell to composition immediately and published in 1800 the second volume of the lyrical ballads  in the year 1802 i married mary hutchinson at brompton near scarborough to which part of the country the family had removed from sockburn we had known each other from childhood and had practised reading and spelling under the same old dame at penrith a remarkable personage who had taught three generations of the upper classes principally of the town of penrith and its neighbourhood  after our marriage we dwelt together with our sister at townend where three of our children were born in the spring of 1808 the increase of our family caused us to remove to a larger house then just built allan bank in the same vale where our two younger children were born and who died at the rectory the house we afterwards occupied for two years they died in 1812 and in 1813 we came to rydal mount where we have since lived with no further sorrow till 1836 when my sister became a confirmed invalid and our sister sarah hutchinson died she lived alternately with her brother and with us22   2 his schoolmistress mrs anne birkett penrith  the old dame did not affect to make theologians or logicians but she taught to read and she practised the memory often no doubt by rote but still the faculty was improved something perhaps she explained and left the rest to parents to masters and to the pastor of the parish23   3 books and reading  do not trouble yourself with reading modern authors at present confine your attention to ancient classical writers make yourself master of them and when you have done that you will come down to us and then you will be able to judge us according to our deserts24  22 memoirs i pp 717  23 letter to rev hj rose 1828 memoirs i 33  24 letter to a nephew memoirs i

last letter was addressed to you from st valier and the grande chartreuse i have since that period gone over a very considerable tract of country and i will give you a sketch of my route as far as relates to mentioning places where i have been after i have assured you that i am in excellent health and spirits and have had no reason to complain of the contrary during our whole tour my spirits have been kept in a perpetual hurry of delight by the almost uninterrupted succession of sublime and beautiful objects which have passed before my eyes during the course of the last mouth i will endeavour to give you some idea of our route it will be utterly impossible for me to dwell upon particular scenes as my paper would be exhausted before i had done with the journey of two or three days on quitting the grande chartreuse where we remained two days contemplating with increased pleasure its wonderful scenery we passed through savoy to geneva thence along the pays do vaud side of the lake to villeneuve a small town seated at its head the lower part of the lake did not afford us a pleasure equal to what might have been expected from its celebrity this owing partly to its width and partly to the weather which was one of those hot gleamy days in which all distant objects are veiled in a species of bright obscurity but the higher part of the lake made us ample amends tis true we had some disagreeable weather but the banks of the water are infinitely more picturesque and as it is much narrower the landscape suffered proportionally less from that pale steam which before almost entirely hid the opposite shore from villeneuve we proceeded up the rhone to martigny where we left our bundles and struck over the mountains to chamouny and visited the glaciers of savoy you have undoubtedly heard of these celebrated scenes but if you have not read about them any description which i have room to give you must be altogether inadequate after passing two days in the environs of chamouny we returned to martigny and pursued our mount up the valais along the rhine to brig at brig we quitted the valais and passed the alps at the simplon in order to visit part of italy the impressions of three hours of our walk among these alps will never be effaced from duomo dossola a town of italy which lay in our route we proceeded to the lake of locarno to visit the boromean islands and thence to como a more charming path was scarcely ever travelled over the banks of many of the italian and swiss lakes are so steep and rocky as not to admit of roads that of como is partly of this character a small footpath is all the communication by land between one village and another on the side along which we passed for upwards of thirty miles we entered upon this path about noon and owing to the steepness of the banks were soon unmolested by the sun which illuminated the woods rocks and villages of the opposite shore the lake is narrow and the shadows of the mountains were early thrown across it it was beautiful to watch them travelling up the side of the hillsfor several hours to remark one half of a village covered with shade and the other bright with the strongest sunshine it was with regret that we passed every turn of this charming path where every new picture was purchased by the loss of another which we should never have been tired of gazing upon the shores of the lake consist of steeps covered with large sweeping woods of chestnut spotted with villages some clinging from the summits of the advancing rocks and others hiding themselves within their recesses nor was the surface of the lake less interesting than its shores half of it glowing with the richest green and gold the reflection of the illuminated wood and path shaded with a soft blue tint the picture was still further diversified by the number of sails which stole lazily by us as we paused in the wood above them after all this we had the moon it was impossible not to contrast that repose that complacency of spirit produced by these lovely scenes with the sensations i had experienced two or three days before in passing the alps at the lake of como my mind ran through a thousand dreams of happiness which might be enjoyed upon its banks if heightened by conversation and the exercise of the social affections among the more awful scenes of the alps i had not a thought of man or a single created being my whole soul was turned to him who produced the terrible majesty before me but i am too particular for the limits of my paper  we followed the lake of como to its head and thence proceeded to chiavenna where we began to pass a range of the alps which brought us into the country of the grisons at sovozza from sovozza we pursued the valley of myssen in which it is situated to its head passed mount adula to hinter rhine a small village near one of the sources of the rhine we pursued this branch of the rhine downward through the grisons to michenem where we turned up the other branch of the same river and following it to chiamut a small village near its source here we quitted the grisons and entered switzerland at the valley of urseren and pursued the course of the reuss down to altorf thence we proceeded partly upon the lake and partly behind the mountains on its banks to lucerne and thence to zurich from zurich along the banks of the lake we continued our route to richtenschwyl here we left the lake to visit the famous church and convent of einsiedeln and thence to glaris but this catalogue must be shockingly tedious suffice it to say that after passing a day in visiting the romantic valley of glaris we proceeded by the lake of wallenstadt and the canton of appenzell to the lake of constance where this letter was begun nine days ago from constance we proceeded along the banks of the rhine to schaffhausen to view the falls of the rhine there magnificent as this fall certainly is i must confess i was disappointed in it i had raised my ideas too high  we followed the rhine downward about eight leagues from schaffhausen where we crossed it and proceeded by baden to lucerne i am at this present moment 14th september writing at a small village on the road from grindelwald to lauterbrunnen by consulting your maps you will find these villages in the southeast part of the canton of berne not far from the lakes of thun and brientz after viewing the valley of lauterbrunnen we shall have concluded our tour of the more alpine part of switzerland we proceed thence to berne and intend after making two or three small excursions about the lake of neufchatel to go to basle a town in switzerland upon the rhine whence we shall if we find we can afford it take advantage of the river down to cologne and so cross to ostend where we shall take the packet to margate today is the 14th of september and i hope we shall be in england by the 10th of october i have had during the course of this delightful tour a great deal of uneasiness from an apprehension of your anxiety on my account i have thought of you perpetually and never have my eyes burst upon a scene of particular loveliness but i have almost instantly wished that you could for a moment be transported to the place where i stood to enjoy it i have been more particularly induced to form those wishes because the scenes of switzerland have no resemblance to any i have found in england consequently it may probably never be in your power to form an idea of them we are now as i observed above upon the point of quitting these most sublime and beautiful parts and you cannot imagine the melancholy regret which i feel at the idea i am a perfect enthusiast in my admiration of nature in all her various forms and i have looked upon and as it were conversed with the objects which this country has presented to my view so long and with such increasing pleasure that the idea of parting from them oppresses me with a sadness similar to what i have always felt in quitting a beloved friend  there is no reason to be surprised at the strong attachment which the swiss have always shown to their native country much of it must undoubtedly have been owing to those charms which have already produced so powerful an effect upon me and to which the rudest minds cannot possibly be indifferent ten thousand times in the course of this tour have i regretted the inability of my memory to retain a more strong impression of the beautiful forms before me and again and again in quitting a fortunate station have i returned to it with the most eager avidity in the hope of bearing away a more lively picture at this moment when many of these landscapes are floating before my mind i feel a high enjoyment in reflecting that perhaps scarcely a day of my life will pass in which i shall not derive some happiness from these images  with regard to the manners of the inhabitants of this singular country the impressions which we have had often occasion to receive have been unfavourable but it must be remembered that we have had little to do but with innkeepers and those corrupted by perpetual intercourse with strangers had we been able to speak the language which is german and had we time to insinuate ourselves into their cottages we should probably have had as much occasion to admire the simplicity of their lives as the beauties of their country my partiality to switzerland excited by its natural charms induces me to hope that the manners of the inhabitants are amiable but at the same time i cannot help frequently comparing them with those of the french and as far as i have had opportunity to observe they lose very much by the comparison we not only found the french a much less imposing people but that politeness diffused through the lowest ranks had an air so engaging that you could scarce attribute it to any other cause than real benevolence during the time which was near a month that we were in france we had not once to complain of the smallest deficiency in courtesy in any person much less of any positive rudeness we had also perpetual occasion to observe that cheerfulness and sprightliness for which the french have always been remarkable but i must remind you that we crossed at the time when the whole nation was mad with joy in consequence of the revolution it was a most interesting period to be in france and we had many delightful scenes where the interest of the picture was owing solely to this cause i was also much pleased with what i saw of the italians during the short time we were among them we had several times occasion to observe a softness and elegance which contrasted strongly with the severe austereness of their neighbours on the other side of the alps it was with pleasure i observed at a small inn on the lake of como the master of it playing upon his harpsichord with a large collection of italian music about him the outside of the instrument was such that it would not much have graced an english drawingroom but the tones that he drew from it were by no means contemptible  but it is time to talk about england when you write to my brothers i must beg of you to give my love and tell them i am sorry it has not been in my power to write to them kit will be surprised he has not heard from me as we were almost upon terms of regular correspondence i had not heard from richard for some time before i set out i did not call upon him when i was in london not so much because we were determined to hurry through london but because he as many of our friends at cambridge did would look upon our scheme as mad and impracticable i expect great pleasure on my return to cambridge in exulting over those of my friends who threatened us with such an accumulation of difficulties as must undoubtedly render it impossible for us to perform the tour every thing however has succeeded with us far beyond my most sanguine expectations we have it is true met with little disasters occasionally but far from distressing and they rather gave us additional resolution and spirits we have both enjoyed most excellent health and we have been so inured to walking that we are become almost insensible to fatigue we have several times performed a journey of thirteen leagues over the most mountainous parts of switzerland without any more weariness than if we had been walking an hour in the groves of cambridge our appearance is singular and we have often observed that in passing through a village we have excited a general smile our coats which we had made light on purpose for the journey are of the same piece and our manner of carrying our bundles which is upon our heads with each an oak stick in our hands contributes not a little to that general curiosity which we seem to excite but i find i have again relapsed into egotism and must here entreat you not only to pardon this fault but also to make allowance for the illegible hand and desultory style of this letter it has been written as you will see by its different shades at many sittings and is in fact the produce of most of the leisure which i have had since it was begun and is now finally drawing to a conclusion it being on the 16th of september i flatter myself still with the hope of seeing you for a fortnight or three weeks if it be agreeable to my uncle as there will be no necessity for me to be in cambridge before the 10th of november i shall be better able to judge whether i am likely to enjoy this pleasure in about three weeks i shall probably write to you again before i quit france if not most certainly immediately on my landing in england you will remember me affectionately to my uncle and aunt as he was acquainted with my giving up all thoughts of a fellowship he may perhaps not be so much displeased at this journey i should be sorry if i have offended him by it i hope my little cousin is well i must now bid you adieu with assuring you that you are perpetually in my thoughts and that i remain  most affectionately yours  w wordsworth  on looking over this letter i am afraid you will not be able to read half of it i must again beg you to excuse me  miss wordsworth rev wm cooksons long stretton norfolk langleterre25  25 memoirs pp 5766   5 in wales  you will see by the date of this letter that i am in wales and whether you remember the place of joness residence or no you will immediately conclude that i am with him i quitted london about three weeks ago where my time passed in a strange manner sometimes whirled about by the vortex of its strenua inertia and sometimes thrown by the eddy into a corner of the stream think not however that i had not many pleasant hours my time has been spent since i reached wales in a very agreeable manner and jones and i intend to make a tour through its northern countieson foot as you will easily suppose26   6 melancholy of a friend  i regret much not to have been made acquainted with your wish to have employed your vacation in a pedestrian tour both on your account as it would have contributed greatly to exhilarate your spirits and on mine as we should have gained much from the addition of your society such an excursion would have served like an aurora borealis to gild your long lapland night of melancholy27  7 holy orders  about this time wordsworth was urged by some of his relatives to take holy orders writing from cambridge september 23rd to mathews he says i quitted wales on a summons from mr robinson a gentleman you most likely have heard me speak of respecting my going into orders and taking a curacy at harwich which curacy he considered as introductory to the living i thought it was best to pay my respects to him in person to inform him that i am not of age for ordination28  26 letter to william mathews memoirs i 70  27 ibid memoirs i 71  28 memoirs i 71   8 the french revolution 1792  the horrors excited by the relation of the events consequent upon the commencement of hostilities is general not but that there are some men who felt a gloomy satisfaction from a measure which seemed to put the patriot army out of a possibility of success an ignominious flight the massacre of their general a dance performed with savage joy round his burning body the murder of six prisoners are events which would have arrested the attention of the reader of the annals of morocco  he then expresses his fear that the patriot army would be routed by the invaders but suppose he adds that the german army is at the gates of paris what will be the consequence it will be impossible for it to make any material alterations in the constitution impossible to reinstate the clergy in its ancient guilty splendour impossible to restore an existence to the noblesse similar to that it before enjoyed impossible to add much to the authority of the king yet there are in france some millionsi speak without exaggerationwho expect that this will take place29   9 failure of louvets denunciation of robespierre  at paris his feelings were still more disturbed by the abortive issue of louvets denunciation of robespierre he began to forebode the commencement of the reign of terror he was paralysed with sorrow and dismay and stung with disappointment that no paramount spirit had emerged to abash the impious crests of the leaders of the atheist crew and to quell outrage and bloody power and to clear a passage for just government and leave a solid birthright to the state30  29 extract of letter to mathews may 17 1792 memoirs i 75  30 memoirs i 76   10 of inflammatory political opinions  i disapprove of monarchical and aristocratical governments however modified hereditary distinctions and privileged orders of every species i think must necessarily counteract the progress of human improvement hence it follows that i am not among the admirers of the british constitution i conceive that a more excellent system of civil policy might be established among us yet in my ardour to attain the goal i do not forget the nature of the ground where the race is to be run the destruction of those institutions which i condemn appears to me to be hastening on too rapidly i recoil from the very idea of a revolution i am a determined enemy to every species of violence i see no connection but what the obstinacy of pride and ignorance renders necessary between justice and the sword between reason and bonds i deplore the miserable condition of the french and think that we can only be guarded from the same scourge by the undaunted efforts of good men i severely condemn all inflammatory addresses to the passions of men i know that the multitude walk in darkness i would put into each mans hands a lantern to guide him and not have him to set out upon his journey depending for illumination on abortive flashes of lightning or the coruscations of transitory meteors31   11 at milkhouse halifax not to take orders  my sister he says in a letter to mathews february 17th 1794 is under the same roof with me indeed it was to see her that i came into this country i have been doing nothing and still continue to do nothing what is to become of me i know not he announces his resolve not to take orders and as for the law i have neither strength of mind purse or constitution to engage in that pursuit32   12 literary work evening walk and descriptive sketches 1794  in may 1794 william wordsworth was at whitehaven at his uncles mr richard wordsworths and he then proposes to his friend mathews who was resident in london that they should set on foot a monthly political and literary miscellany to which he says he would communicate critical remarks on poetry the arts of painting gardening c besides essays on morals and politics i am at present he adds nearly at leisurei say nearly for i am not quite so as i am correcting and considerably adding to those poems which i published in your absence the evening walk and descriptive sketches it was with great reluctance that i sent those two little works into the world in so imperfect a state but as i had done nothing by which to distinguish myself at the university i thought these little things might show that i could do something they have been treated with unmerited contempt by some of the periodicals and others have spoken in higher terms of them than they deserve33  31 extract of letter to mathews memoirs i 7980  32 memoirs i 82  33 ibid i 823   13 employment on a london newspaper  writing from keswick on november 7th 1794 he announces to his friend mathews who was employed on the newspapers his desire and intention of coming to london for the same purpose and requests him to procure for him a similar engagement you say a newspaper would be glad of me do you think you could ensure me employment in that way on terms similar to your own i mean also in an opposition paper for i cannot abet in the smallest degree the measures pursued by the present ministry they are already so deeply advanced in iniquity that like macbeth they cannot retreat when i express myself in this manner i am far from reprobating those whose sentiments differ from my own i know that many good men are persuaded of the expediency of the present war he then turns to domestic matters you would probably see that my brother afterwards the master of trinity has been honoured with two college declamation prizes this goes towards a fellowship which i hope he will obtain and am sure he will merit he is a lad of talents and industrious withal this same industry is a good old roman quality and nothing is to be done without it34   14 raisley culverts last illness  my friend calvert has every symptom of a confirmed consumption and i cannot think of quitting him in his present debilitated state35 again i have been here mr somerbys at the sign of the robin hood penrith for some time i am still much engaged with my sick friend and sorry am i to add that he worsens daily  he is barely alive36  34 memoirs i 85  35

considerable eminence died intestate when we were children and the chief part of his personal property after his decease was expended in an unsuccessful attempt to compel the late lord lonsdale to pay a debt of about 5000l to my fathers estate enough however was scraped together to educate us all in different ways i the second son was sent to college with a view to the profession of the church or law into one of which i should have been forced by necessity had not a friend left me 900l this bequest was from a young man with whom though i call him friend i had had but little connection and the act was done entirely from a confidence on his part that i had powers and attainments which might be of use to mankind this i have mentioned because it was his due and i thought the fact would give you pleasure upon the interest of the 900l 400l being laid out in annuity with 200l deducted from the principal and 100l a legacy to my sister and a 100l more which the lyrical ballads have brought me my sister and i contrived to live seven years nearly eight lord lonsdale then died and the present lord lowther paid to my fathers estate 8500l of this sum i believe 1800l apiece will come to my sister and myself at least would have come but 3000l was lent out to our poor brother37 i mean taken from the whole sum which was about 1200l more than his share which 1200l belonged to my sister and me this 1200l we freely lent him whether it was insured or no i do not know but i dare say it will prove to be the case we did not however stipulate for its being insured but you shall faithfully know all particulars as soon as i have learned them38   16 reading 1795  here racedown lodge near crewkerne dorsetshire he and his sister employed themselves industriously in readingif reading can ever deserve the name of industry says wordsworth in a letter to his friend mathews of march 21 179639  37 captain john wordsworth who perished by shipwreck a short time before the date of this letter  38

personal satire in fact i never will have anything to do with it as far as concerns the private vices of individuals on any account with respect to public delinquents or offenders i will not say the same though i should be slow to meddle even with these this is a rule which i have laid down for myself and shall rigidly adhere to though i do not in all cases blame those who think and act differently  it will therefore follow that i cannot lend any assistance to your proposed publication the verses which you have of mine i should wish to be destroyed i have no copy of them myself at least none that i can find i would most willingly give them up to you fame profit and everything if i thought either true fame or profit could arise out of them40   18 visit to thelwall  mr coleridge my sister and i had been visiting the famous john thelwall who had taken refuge from politics after a trial for high treason with a view to bring up his family by the profits of agriculture which proved as unfortunate a speculation as that he had fled from coleridge and he had been public lecturers coleridge mingling with his politics theology from which the other elocutionist abstained unless it were for the sake of a sneer this quondam community of public employment induced thelwall to visit coleridge at netherstowey where he fell in my way he really was a man of extraordinary talent an affectionate husband and a good father though brought up in the city on a tailors board he was truly sensible of the beauty of natural objects i remember once when coleridge he and i were seated upon the turf on the brink of the stream in the most beautiful part of the most beautiful glen of alfoxden coleridge exclaimed this is a place to reconcile one to all the jarrings and conflicts of the wide world nay said thelwall to make one forget them altogether the visit of this man to coleridge was as i believe coleridge has related the occasion of a spy being sent by government to watch our proceedings which were i can say with truth such as the world at large would have thought ludicrously harmless41  40 memoirs i 956  41 ibid i 1045   19 poetry added to april 12th 1798  you will be

week and thence we went towards the banks of the wye we crossed the severn ferry and walked ten miles further to tintern abbey a very beautiful ruin on the wye the next morning we walked along the river through monmouth to goderich castle there slept and returned the next day to tintern thence to chepstow and from chepstow back again in a boat to tintern where we slept and thence back in a small vessel to bristol  the wye is a stately and majestic river from its width and depth but never slow and sluggish you can always hear its murmur it travels through a woody country now varied with cottages and green meadows and now with huge and fantastic rocks43   21 at home again  we are now he says in a letter to cottle in the county of durham just upon the borders of yorkshire we left coleridge well at gottingen a month ago we have spent our time pleasantly enough in germany but we are right glad to find ourselves in englandfor we have learnt to know its value44   22 early visit to

have had a moments leisure my dear friend we talk of you perpetually and for me i see you every where but let me be a little more methodical we left sockburn last tuesday morning we crossed the tees by moonlight in the sockburn fields and after ten good miles riding came in sight of the swale it is there a beautiful river with its green bank and flat holms scattered over with trees four miles further brought us to richmond with its huge ivied castle its friarage steeple its castle tower resembling a huge steeple and two other steeple towers for such they appeared to us the situation of this place resembles that of barnard castle but i should suppose is somewhat inferior to it george accompanied us eight miles further and there we parted with sorrowful hearts we were now in wensley dale and dorothy and i set off side by side to foot it as far as kendal i will not clog my letter with a description of this celebrated dale but i must not neglect to mention that a little before sunset we reached one of the waterfalls of which i read you a short description in mr taylors tour it is a singular scene i meant to have given you some account of it but i feel myself too lazy to execute the task tis such a performance as you might have expected from some giant gardener employed by one of queen elizabeths courtiers if this same giant gardener had consulted with spenser and they two had finished the work together by this you will understand that it is at once formal and wild we reached askrigg twelve miles before six in the evening having been obliged to walk the last two miles over hard frozen roads to the great annoyance of our ankles and feet next morning the earth was thinly covered with snow enough to make the road soft and prevent its being slippery on leaving askrigg we turned aside to see another waterfall it was a beautiful morning with driving snow showers which disappeared by fits and unveiled the east which was all one delicious pale orange colour after walking through two small fields we came to a mill which we passed and in a moment a sweet little valley opened before us with an area of grassy ground and a stream dashing over various laminae of black rocks close under a bank covered with firs the bank and stream on our left another woody bank on our right and the flat meadow in front from which as at buttermere the stream had retired as it were to hide itself under the shade as we walked up this delightful valley we were tempted to look back perpetually on the stream which reflected the orange lights of the morning among the gloomy rocks with a brightness varying with the agitation of the current the steeple of askrigg was between us and the east at the bottom of the valley it was not a quarter of a mile distant but oh how far we were from it the two banks seemed to join before us with a facing of rock common to them both when we reached this bottom the valley opened out again two rocky banks on each side which hung with ivy and moss and fringed luxuriantly with brushwood ran directly parallel to each other and then approaching with a gentle curve at their point of union presented a lofty waterfall the termination of the valley it was a keen frosty morning showers of snow threatening us but the sun bright and active we had a task of twentyone miles to perform in a short winters day all this put our minds into such a state of excitation that we were no unworthy spectators of this delightful scene on a nearer approach the waters seemed to fall down a tall arch or niche that had shaped itself by insensible moulderings in the wall of an old castle we left this spot with reluctance but highly exhilarated when we had walked about a mile and a half we overtook two men with a string of ponies and some empty carts i recommended to dorothy to avail herself of this opportunity of husbanding her strength we rode with them more than two miles twas bitter cold the wind driving the snow behind us in the best style of a mountain storm we soon reached an inn at a place called hardrane and descending from our vehicles after warming ourselves by the cottage fire we walked up the brookside to take a view of a third waterfall we had not walked above a few hundred yards between two winding rocky banks before we came full upon the waterfall which seemed to throw itself in a narrow line from a lofty wall of rock the water which shot manifestly to some distance from the rock seeming to be dispersed into a thin shower scarcely visible before it reached the bason we were disappointed in the cascade itself though the introductory and accompanying banks were an exquisite mixture of grandeur and beauty we walked up to the fall and what would i not give if i could convey to you the feelings and images which were then communicated to me after cautiously sounding our way over stones of all colours and sizes encased in the clearest water formed by the spray of the fall we found the rock which before had appeared like a wall extending itself over our heads like the ceiling of a huge cave from the summit of which the waters shot directly over our heads into a bason and among fragments wrinkled over with masses of ice as white as snow or rather as dorothy says like congealed froth the water fell at least ten yards from us and we stood directly behind it the excavation not so deep in the rock as to impress any feeling of darkness but lofty and magnificent but in connection with the adjoining banks excluding as much of the sky as could well be spared from a scene so exquisitely beautiful the spot where we stood was as dry as the chamber in which i am now sitting and the incumbent rock of which the groundwork was limestone veined and dappled with colours which melted into each other with every possible variety of colour on the summit of the cave were three festoons or rather wrinkles in the rock run up parallel like the folds of a curtain when it is drawn up each of these was hung with icicles of various length and nearly in the middle of the festoon in the deepest valley of the waves that ran parallel to each other the stream shot from the rows of icicles in irregular fits of strength and with a body of water that varied every moment sometimes the stream shot into the bason in one continued current sometimes it was interrupted almost in the midst of its fall and was blown towards part of the waterfall at no great distance from our feet like the heaviest thundershower in such a situation you have at every moment a feeling of the presence of the sky large fleecy clouds drove over our heads above the rush of the water and the sky appeared of a blue more than usually brilliant the rocks on each side which joining with the side of this cave formed the vista of the brook were chequered with three diminutive waterfalls or rather courses of water each of these was a miniature of all that summer and winter can produce of delicate beauty the rock in the centre of the falls where the water was most abundant a deep black the adjoining parts yellow white purple and dovecolour covered with waterplants of the most vivid green and hung with streaming icicles that in some places seem to conceal the verdure of the plants and the violet and yellow variegation of the rocks and in some places render the colours more brilliant i cannot express to you the enchanting effect produced by this arabian scene of colour as the wind blew aside the great waterfall behind which we stood and alternately hid and revealed each of these fairy cataracts in irregular succession or displayed them with various gradations of distinctness as the intervening spray was thickened or dispersed what a scene too in summer in the luxury of our imagination we could not help feeding upon the pleasure which this cave in the heat of a july noon would spread through a frame exquisitely sensible that huge rock on the right the bank winding round on the left with all its living foliage and the breeze stealing up the valley and bedewing the cavern with the freshest imaginable spray and then the murmur of the water the quiet the seclusion and a long summer day47

reached our little cottage in high spirits and thankful to god for all his bounties my wife and child were both well and as i need not say we had all of us a happy meeting we passed branxholme your branxholme we supposed about four miles on this side of hawick it looks better in your poem than in its present realities the situation however is delightful and makes amends for an ordinary mansion the whole of the teviot and the pastoral steeps about mosspaul pleased us exceedingly the esk below langholm is a delicious river and we saw it to great advantage we did not omit noticing johnnie armstrongs keep but his hangingplace to our great regret we missed we were indeed most truly sorry that we could not have you along with us into westmoreland the country was in its full glory the verdure of the valleys in which we are so much superior to you in scotland but little tarnished by the weather and the trees putting on their most beautiful looks my sister was quite enchanted and we often said to each other what a pity mr scott is not with us i had the pleasure of seeing coleridge and southey at keswick last sunday southey whom i never saw much of before i liked much he is very pleasant in his manner and a man of great reading in old books poetry chronicles memoirs c particularly spanish and portuguese my sister and i often talk of the happy days that we spent in your company such things do not occur often in life if we live we shall meet again that is my consolation when i think of these things scotland and england sound like division do what we can but we really are but neighbours and if you were no further off and in yorkshire we should think so farewell god prosper you and all that belongs to you your sincere friend for such i will call myself though slow to use a word of such solemn meaning to any one  w wordsworth49  49 life of scott by lockhart vol ii 1657 1856 the following from the same source earlier may fitly find a place here it was in the september of this year 1803 that scott first saw wordsworth their common acquaintance stoddart had so often talked of them to each other that they met as if they had not been strangers and they parted friends mr and miss wordsworth had just completed that tour in the highlands of which so many incidents have since been immortalised both in the poets sense and in the hardly less poetical prose of his sisters diary on the morning of the 17th of september having left their carriage at rosslyn they walked down the valley to lasswade and arrived there before mr and mrs scott had risen we were received mr wordsworth has told me with that frank cordiality which under whatever circumstances i afterwards met him always marked his manners and indeed i found him then in every respectexcept perhaps that his animal spirits were somewhat higherprecisely the same man that you knew him in later life the same lively entertaining conversation full of anecdote and averse from disquisition the same unaffected modesty about himself the same cheerful and benevolent and hopeful views of man and the world he partly read and partly recited sometimes in an enthusiastic style of chant the first four cantos of the lay of the last minstrel and the novelty of the manners the clear picturesque descriptions and the easy glowing energy of much of the verse greatly delighted me pp 1601   27 the grove captain john wordsworth  john wordsworth left grasmere on michaelmasday 1800 walking over by grisedale tarn to paterdale whence he would proceed to penrith he took leave of his brother william near the tarn where ullswater first comes in view and he went to sea again in the abergavenny eastindiaman in the spring of 1801  after his departure from grasmere the poet discovered a track which had been worn by his brothers steps pacing there unwearied and alone during the winter weather in a sheltering firgrove above the cottage and henceforth that firgrove was known to the poets household by the name of johns grove or brothers grove of this wordsworth writes  when to the attractions of the busy world 1805the grove still exists but the plantation has been walled in and is not so accessible as when my brother john wore the path in the manner described the grove was a favourite haunt with us all while we lived at townend50   28 spenser and milton  captain wordsworth returned from the voyage on which he sailed in 1801 and in november 1802 he writes for directions what books to buy to carry with him on a voyage of sixteen months    50 memoirs i 282  tell john says wordsworth when he buys spenser to purchase an edition which has his state of ireland in it this is in prose this edition may be scarce but one surely can be found  miltons sonnets transcribe all this for john as said by me to him i think manly and dignified compositions distinguished by simplicity and unity of object and aim and undisfigured by false or vicious ornaments they are in several places incorrect and sometimes uncouth in language and perhaps in some inharmonious yet upon the whole i think the music exceedingly well suited to its end that is it has an energetic and varied flow of sound crowding into narrow room more of the combined effect of rhyme and blank verse than can be done by any other kind of verse i know the sonnets of milton which i like best are that to cyriack skinner on his blindness captain or colonel massacre of piedmont cromwell except two last lines fairfax c51  51 memoirs i 287   29 death of captain john wordsworth  letter to sir george h beaumont bart                            grasmere feb 11 1805  my dear friend  the public papers will already have broken the shock which the sight of this letter will give you you will have learned by them the loss of the earl of abergavenny eastindiaman and along with her of a great proportion of the crewthat of her captain our brother and a most beloved brother he was this calamitous news we received at 2 oclock today and i write to you from a house of mourning my poor sister and my wife who loved him almost as we did for he was one of the most amiable of men are in miserable affliction which i do all in my power to alleviate but heaven knows i want consolation myself i can say nothing higher of my everdear brother than that he was worthy of his sister who is now weeping beside me and of the friendship of coleridge meek affectionate silently enthusiastic loving all quiet things and a poet in every thing but words  alas what is human life this present moment i thought this morning would have been devoted to the pleasing employment of writing a letter to amuse you in your confinement i had singled out several little fragments descriptions merely which i purposed to have transcribed from my poems thinking that the perusal of them might give you a few minutes gratification and now i am called to this melancholy office  i shall never forget your goodness in writing so long and interesting a letter to me under such circumstances this letter also arrived by the same post which brought the unhappy tidings of my brothers death so that they were both put into my hands at the same moment                           your affectionate friend                                       w wordsworth  i shall do all in my power to sustain my sister under her sorrow which is and long will be bitter and poignant we did not love him as a brother merely but as a man of original mind and an honour to all about him oh dear friend forgive me for talking thus we have had no tidings of coleridge i tremble for the moment when he is to hear of my brothers death it will distress him to the heartand his poor body cannot bear sorrow he loved my brother and he knows how we at grasmere loved him   nine days afterwards wordsworth resumed the subject as follows                         grasmere feb 20 1805  having spoken of worldly affairs let me again mention my beloved brother it is now just five years since after a separation of fourteen years i may call it a separation for we only saw him four or five times and by glimpses he came to visit his sister and me in this cottage and passed eight blessed months with us he was then waiting for the command of the ship to which he was appointed when he quitted us as you will have seen we had little to live upon and he as little lord lonsdale being then alive but he encouraged me to persist and to keep my eye steady on its object he would work for me that was his language for me and his sister and i was to endeavour to do something for the world he went to sea as commander with this hope his voyage was very unsuccessful he having lost by it considerably when he came home we chanced to be in london and saw him oh said he i have thought of you and nothing but you if ever of myself and my bad success it was only on your account he went again to sea a second time and also was unsuccessful still with the same hopes on our account though then not so necessary lord lowther having paid the money52 lastly came the lamentable voyage which he entered upon full of expectation and love to his sister and myself and my wife whom indeed he loved with all a brothers tenderness this is the end of his part of the agreementof his efforts for my welfare god grant me life and strength to fulfil mine i shall never forget himnever lose sight of him there is a bond between us yet the same as if he were living nay far more sacred calling upon me to do my utmost as he to the last did his utmost to live in honour and worthiness some of the newspapers carelessly asserted that he did not wish to survive his ship this is false he was heard by one of the surviving officers giving orders with all possible calmness a very little before the ship went down and when he could remain at his post no longer then and not till then he attempted to save himself i knew this would be so but it was satisfactory for me to have it confirmed by external evidence do not think our grief unreasonable of all human beings whom i ever knew he was the man of the most rational desires the most sedate habits and the most perfect selfcommand he was modest and gentle and shy even to disease but this was wearing off in every thing his judgments were sound and original his taste in all the arts music and poetry in particular for these he of course had had the best opportunities of being familiar with was exquisite and his eye for the beauties of nature was as fine and delicate as ever poet or painter was gifted with in some discriminations owing to his education and way of life far superior to any persons i ever knew but alas what avails it it was the will of god that he should be taken away                                       i trust in god that i shall not want fortitude but my loss is great and irreparable  52 due to wordsworths father from james earl of lonsdale at whose death in 1802 it was paid by his lordships successor and divided among the five children                                       many thanks for the offer of your house but i am not likely to be called to town lady beaumont gives us hope we may see you next summer this would indeed be great joy to us all my sister thanks lady b for her affectionate remembrance of her and her letter and will write as soon as ever she feels herself able her health as was to be expected has suffered much                    your most affectionate friend                                  w wordsworth  again                        grasmere march 12 1805  as i have said your last letter affected me much a thousand times have i asked myself as your tender sympathy led me to do why was he taken away and i have answered the question as you have done in fact there is no other answer which can satisfy and lay the mind at rest why have we a choice and a will and a notion of justice and injustice enabling us to be moral agents why have we sympathies that make the best of us so afraid of inflicting pain and sorrow which yet we see dealt about so lavishly by the supreme governor why should our notions of right towards each other and to all sentient beings within our influence differ so widely from what appears to be his notion and rule if every thing were to end here would it not be blasphemy to say that upon the supposition of the thinking principle being destroyed by death however inferior we may be to the great cause and ruler of things we have more of love in our nature than he has the thought is monstrous and yet how to get rid of it except upon the supposition of another and a better world i do not see as to my departed brother who leads our minds at present to these reflections he walked all his life pure among many impure except a little hastiness of temper when any thing was done in a clumsy or bungling manner or when improperly contradicted upon occasions of not much importance he had not one vice of his profession i never heard an oath or even an indelicate expression or allusion from him in my life his modesty was equal to that of the purest woman in prudence in meekness in selfdenial in fortitude in just desires and elegant and refined enjoyments with an entire simplicity of manners life and habit he was all that could be wished for in man strong in health and of a noble person with every hope about him that could render life dear thinking of and living only for othersand we see what has been his end so good must be better so high must be destined to be higher                                       i will take this opportunity of saying that the newspaper accounts of the loss of the ship are throughout grossly inaccurate the chief facts i will state in a few words from the deposition at the india house of one of the surviving officers she struck at 5 pm guns were fired immediately and were continued to be fired she was gotten off the rock at halfpast seven but had taken in so much water in spite of constant pumping as to be waterlogged they had however hope that she might still be run upon weymouth sands and with this view continued pumping and baling till eleven when she went down the longboat could not be hoisted out as had that been done there would have been no possibility of the ship being run aground i have mentioned these things because the newspaper accounts were such as tended to throw discredit on my brothers conduct and personal firmness stating that the ship had struck an hour and a half before guns were fired and that in the agony of the moment the boats had been forgotten to be hoisted out we knew well this could not be but for the sake of the relatives of the persons lost it distressed us much that it should have been said a few minutes before the ship went down my brother was seen talking with the first mate with apparent cheerfulness and he was standing on the hencoop which is the point from which he could overlook the whole ship the moment she went down dying as he had lived in the very place and point where his duty stationed him i must beg your pardon for detaining you so long on this melancholy subject and yet it is not altogether melancholy for what nobler spectacle can be contemplated than that of a virtuous man with a serene countenance in such an overwhelming situation i will here transcribe a passage which i met with the other day in a review it is from aristotles synopsis of the virtues and vices53 it is says he the property of fortitude not to be easily terrified by the dread of things pertaining to death to possess good confidence in things terrible and presence of mind in dangers rather to prefer to be put to death worthily than to be preserved basely and to be the cause of victory moreover it is the property of fortitude to labour and endure and to make valorous exertion an object of choice further presence of mind a welldisposed soul confidence and boldness are the attendants on fortitude and besides these industry and patience except in the circumstance of making valorous exertion an object of choice if the philosopher alludes to general habits of character my brother might have sat for this picture but he was of a meek and retired nature loving all quiet things  53 vol ix p 395 ed bekker oxon 1837                       i remain dear sir george                           your most affectionate friend                                         w wordsworth  the following to his friend southey was written the morrow after the arrival of the sad tidings                           tuesday evening grasmere 1805  we see nothing here that does not remind us of our dear brother there is nothing about us save the children whom he had not seen that he has not known and loved  if you could bear to come to this house of mourning tomorrow i should be for ever thankful we weep much today and that relieves us as to fortitude i hope i shall show that and that all of us will show it in a proper time in keeping down many a silent pang hereafter but grief will as you say and must have its course there is no wisdom in attempting to check it under the circumstances which we are all of us in here  i condole with you from my soul on the melancholy account of your own brothers situation god grant you may not hear such tidings oh it makes the heart groan that with such a beautiful world as this to live in and such a soul as that of mans is by nature and gift of god that we should go about on such errands as we do destroying and laying waste and ninetynine of us in a hundred never easy in any road that travels towards peace and quietness and yet what virtue and what goodness what heroism and courage what triumphs of disinterested love everywhere and human life after all what is it surely this is not to be for ever even on this perishable planet come to us tomorrow if you can your conversation i know will do me good                                       all send best remembrances to you all                             your affectionate friend                                      w wordsworth  the following to another friend completes the sad tale                             grasmere march 16 1805  he wrote to us from portsmouth about twelve days before this disaster full of hopes saying that he was to sail tomorrow of course at the time when we heard this deplorable news we imagined that he was as far on his voyage as madeira it was indeed a thunderstroke to us the language which he held was always so encouraging saying that ships were in nine instances out of ten lost by mismanagement he had indeed a great fear of pilots and i have often heard him say that no situation could be imagined more distressing than that of being at the mercy of these men oh said he it is a joyful hour for us when we get rid of them his fears alas were too well founded his own ship was lost while under the management of the pilot whether mismanaged by him or not i do not know but know for certain which is indeed our great consolation that our dear brother did all that man could do even to the sacrifice of his own life the newspaper accounts were grossly inaccurate indeed that must have been obvious to any person who could bear to think upon the subject for they were absolutely unintelligible there are two pamphlets upon the subject one a mere transcript from the papers the other may be considered as to all important particulars as of authority it is by a person high in the india house and contains the deposition of the surviving officers concerning the loss of the ship the pamphlet i am told is most unfeelingly written i have only seen an extract from it containing gilpins deposition the fourth mate from this it appears that every thing was done that could be done under the circumstances for the safety of the lives and the ship my poor brother was standing on the hencoop which is placed upon the poop and is the most commanding situation in the vessel when she went down and he was thence washed overboard by a large sea which sank the ship he was seen struggling with the waves some time afterwards having laid hold it is said of a rope he was an excellent swimmer but what could it avail in such a sea encumbered with his clothes and exhausted in body as he must have been  for myself i feel that there is something cut out of my life which cannot be restored i never thought of him but with hope and delight we looked forward to the time not distant as we thought when he would settle near us when the task of his life would be over and he would have nothing to do but reap his reward by that time i hoped also that the chief part of my labours would be executed and that i should be able to show him that he had not placed a false confidence in me i never wrote a line without a thought of its giving him pleasure my writings printed and manuscript were his delight and one of the chief solaces of his long voyages but let me stop i will not be cast down were it only for his sake i will not be dejected i have much yet to do and pray god to give me strength and power his part of the agreement between us is brought to an end mine continues and i hope when i shall be able to think of him with a calmer mind that the remembrance of him dead will even animate me more than the joy which i had in him living i wish you would procure the pamphlet i have mentioned you may know the right one by its having a motto from shakspeare from clarences dream i wish you to see it that you may read gs statement and be enabled if the affair should ever be mentioned in your hearing to correct the errors which they must have fallen into who have taken their ideas from the newspaper accounts i have dwelt long too long i fear upon this subject but i could not write to you upon any thing else till i had unburthened my heart we have great consolations from the sources you allude to but alas we have much yet to endure time only can give us regular tranquillity we neither murmur nor repine but sorrow we must we should be senseless else54  54 memoirs i 28898   30 of dryden  letter to sir walter scott55  55 from lockharts life of scott vol ii pp 2879 edit 1856                             paterdale nov 7 1803  my dear scott  i was much pleased to hear of your engagement with dryden not that he is as a poet any great favourite of mine i admire his talents and genius highly but his is not a poetical genius the only qualities i can find in dryden that are essentially poetical are a certain ardour and impetuosity of mind with an excellent ear it may seem strange that i do not add to this great command of language that he certainly has and of such language too as it is most desirable that a poet should possess or rather that he should not be without but it is not language that is in the highest sense of the word poetical being neither of the imagination nor of the passions i mean the amiable the ennobling or the intense passions i do not mean to say that there is nothing of this in dryden but as little i think as is possible considering how much he has written you will easily understand my meaning when i refer to his versification of palamon and arcite as contrasted with the language of chaucer dryden had neither a tender heart nor a lofty sense of moral dignity whenever his language is poetically impassioned it is mostly upon unpleasing subjects such as the follies vices and crimes of classes of men or of individuals that his cannot be the language of imagination must have necessarily followed from thisthat there is not a single image from nature in the whole body of his works and in his translation from virgil whenever virgil can be fairly said to have his eye upon his object dryden always spoils the passage  but too much of this i am glad that you are to be his editor his political and satirical pieces may be greatly benefited by illustration and even absolutely require it a correct text is the first object of an editor then such notes as explain difficult or obscure passages and lastly which is much less important notes pointing out authors to whom the poet has been indebted not in the fiddling way of phrase here and phrase there which is detestable as a general practice but where he has had essential obligations either as to matter or manner  if i can be of any use to you do not fail to apply to me one thing i may take the liberty to suggest which is when you come to the fables might it not be advisable to print the whole of the tales of boccace in a smaller type in the original language if this should look too much like swelling a book i should certainly make such extracts as would show where dryden has most strikingly improved upon or fallen below his original i think his translations from boccace are the best at least the most poetical of his poems it is many years since i saw boccace but i remember that sigismunda is not married by him to guiscard the names are different in boccace in both tales i believe certainly in theodore c i think dryden has much injured the story by the marriage and degraded sigismundas character by it he has also to the best of my remembrance degraded her still more by making her love absolute sensuality and appetite dryden had no other notion of the passion with all these defects and they are very gross ones it is a noble poem guiscards answer when first reproached by tancred is noble in boccace nothing but this amor puà molto più che ne roi ne io possiamo this dryden has spoiled he says first very well the faults of love by love are justified and then come four lines of miserable rant quite à la maximin farewell and believe me ever                             your affectionate friend                            william wordsworth   31 of marmion  extract of letter to sir walter scott 1808  thank you for marmion i think your end has been attained that it is not the end which i should wish you to propose to yourself you will be well aware from what you know of my notions of composition both as to matter and manner in the circle of my acquaintance it seems as well liked as the lay though i have heard that in the world it is not so had the poem been much better than the lay it could scarcely have satisfied the public which has too much of the monster the moral monster in its composition the spring has burst out upon us all at once and the vale is now in exquisite beauty a gentle shower has fallen this morning and i hear the thrush who has built in my orchard singing amain how happy we should be to see you here again ever

grasmere oct 2 1808  my dear wrangham  in what are you employedi mean by way of amusement and relaxation from your professional duties is there any topographical history of your neighbourhood i remember reading whites natural history and antiquities of selbourne with great pleasure when a boy at school and i have lately read dr whitakers history of craven and whalley both with profit and pleasure would it not be worth your while to give some of your leisure hours to a work of this kind making those works partly your model and adding thereto from the originality of your own mind  with your activity you might produce something of this kind of general interest taking for your limit any division in your neighbourhood natural ecclesiastical or civil suppose for example the coast from the borders of cleveland or from scarborough to spurnhead and inward into the country to any boundary that you might approve of pray think of this i am induced to mention it from belief that you are admirably qualified for such a work that it would pleasantly employ your leisure hours and from a regret in seeing works of this kind which might be made so very interesting utterly marred by falling into the hands of wretched bunglers eg the history of cleveland which i have just read by a clergyman of  the most heavy performance i ever encountered and what an interesting district pray let me hear from you soon                             affectionately and sincerely yours                                          w wordsworth57  56 lockharts life iii 456  57 memoirs i 3856   33 the war in spain benefactors of mankind c  to the same                             grasmere dec 3 1808  my dear wrangham  on the other side you have the prospectus of a weekly essay intended to be published by your friend coleridge                                       your sermon did not reach me till the night before last we have all read it and are much pleased with it upon the whole i like it better than the last it must have been heard with great interest i differ however from you in a few particulars 1st the spaniards devoting themselves for an imprisoned bourbon or the crumbling relics of the inquisition this is very fair for pointing a sentence but it is not the truth they have told us over and over again that they are fighting against a foreign tyrant who has dealt with them most perfidiously and inhumanly who must hate them for their worth and on account of the injuries they have received from him and whom they must hate accordingly against a ruler over whom they could have no control and for one whom they have told us they will establish as a sovereign of a free people and therefore must he himself be a limited monarch you will permit me to make to you this representation for its truths sake and because it gives me an opportunity of letting out a secret viz that i myself am very deep in this subject and about to publish upon it first i believe in a newspaper for the sake of immediate and wide circulation and next the same matter in a separate pamphlet under the title of the convention of cintra brought to the test of principles and the people of great britain vindicated from the charge of having prejudged it you will wonder to hear me talk of principles when i have told you that i also do not go along with you in your sentiments respecting the roman catholic question i confess i am not prepared to see the roman catholic religion as the established church of ireland and how that can be consistently refused to them if other things are granted on the plea of their being the majority i do not see certainly this demand will follow and how would it be answered  there is yet another circumstance in which i differ from you if dr bells plan of education be of that importance which it appears to be of it cannot be a matter of indifference whether he or lancaster have a rightful claim to the invention for heavens sake let all benefactors of their species have the honour due to them virgil gives a high place in elysium to the improvers of life and it is neither the least philosophical or least poetical passage of the aeneid58 these points of difference being stated i may say that in other things i greatly approve both of the matter and manner of your sermon  do not fail to return my best thanks to the lady to whom i am obliged for the elegant and accurate drawing of broughton church i should have written to thank her and you for it immediately but i foresaw that i should have occasion to write to you on this or other business  all here desire their best remembrances and believe me in great haste for i have several other letters to write on the same subject affectionately yours  w wordsworth59  58 quique sui memores alios fecere merendo aen vi 664  59 memoirs i 3868  34 the convention of cintra the roman catholics  to the same                             workington april 8 1809  my dear wrangham  you will think i am afraid that i have used you ill in not replying sooner to your last letter particularly as you were desirous to be informed in what newspaper my pamphlet was printing i should not have failed to give you immediately any information upon this subject which could be of use but in fact though i began to publish in a newspaper viz the courier an accidental loss of two or three sheets of the manuscript prevented me from going on in that mode of publication after two sections had appeared the pamphlet will be out in less than a fortnight entitled at full length concerning the relations of great britain spain and portugal to each other and to the common enemy at this crisis and specifically as affected by the convention of cintra the whole brought to the test of those principles by which alone the independence and freedom of nations can be preserved or recovered this is less a title than a table of contents i give it you at full length in order that you may set your fancy at work if you have no better employment for it upon what the pamphlet may contain i sent off the last sheets only a day or two since else i should have written to you sooner it having been my intention to pay my debt to you the moment i had discharged this debt to my country what i have written has been done according to the best light of my conscience it is indeed very imperfect and will i fear be little read but if it is read cannot i hope fail of doing some good though i am aware it will create me a world of enemies and call forth the old yell of jacobinism i have not sent it to any personal friends as such therefore i have made no exception in your case i have ordered it to be sent to two the spanish and portuguese ambassadors and three or four other public men and members of parliament but to nobody of my friends and relations it is printed with my name and i believe will be published by longman i am very happy that you have not been inattentive to my suggestion on the subject of topography when i ventured to recommend the pursuit to you i did not for a moment suppose that it was to interfere with your appropriate duties as a parish priest far otherwise but i know you are of an active mind and i am sure that a portion of your time might be thus employed without any deduction from that which was due to your professional engagements it would be a recreation to you and also it does appear to me that records of this kind ought to be executed by somebody or other both for the instruction of those now living and for the sake of posterity and if so the duty devolves more naturally upon clergymen than upon other persons as their opportunities and qualifications are both likely to be better than those of other men if you have not seen whites and whitakers books do procure a sight of them  i was aware that you would think me fair game upon the roman catholic question but really i should be greatly obliged to any man who would help me over the difficulty i stated if the roman catholics upon the plea of their being the majority merely which implies an admission on our part that their profession of faith is in itself as good as ours as consistent with civil liberty if they are to have their requests accorded how can they be refused consistently the further prayer of being constituted upon the same plea the established church i confess i am not prepared for this with the methodists on one side and the catholics on the other what is to become of the poor church and the people of england to both of which i am most tenderly attached and to the former not the less so on account of the pretty little spire of broughton parish church under which you and i were made happy men by the gift from providence of two excellent wives to mrs wrangham present my cordial regards and believe me dear wrangham your very                             sincere and affectionate friend                                        w wordsworth60   35 the tractate on the

same time i wished to present to you a tract which i have lately written and which i hope you have now received it was finished and ought to have appeared two months ago but has been delayed by circumstances connected with my distance from the press over which i had no control if this tract should so far interest your lordship as to induce you to peruse it i do not doubt that it will be thoughtfully and candidly judged by you in which case i fear no censure but that which every man is liable to who with good intentions may have occasionally fallen into error while at the same time i have an entire confidence that the principles which i have endeavoured to uphold must have the sanction of a mind distinguished like that of your lordship for regard to morality and religion and the true dignity and honour of your country                                       may i beg of your lordship to present my respectful compliments to lady lonsdale                             i have the

of the way of all literary communication so i can report nothing i have read the whole with great pleasure the work will do you everlasting honour i have said the whole forgetting in that contemplation my feelings upon one part where you have tickled with a feather when you should have branded with a redhot iron you will guess i mean the convention of cintra my detestation i may say abhorrence of that event is not at all diminished by your account of it buonaparte had committed a capital blunder in supposing that when he had intimidated the sovereigns of europe he had conquered the several nations yet it was natural for a wiser than he was to have fallen into this mistake for the old despotisms had deprived the body of the people of all practical knowledge in the management and of necessity of all interest in the course of affairs the french themselves were astonished at the apathy and ignorance of the people whom they had supposed they had utterly subdued when they had taken their fortresses scattered their armies entered their capital cities and struck their cabinets with dismay there was no hope for the deliverance of europe till the nations had suffered enough to be driven to a passionate recollection of all that was honourable in their past history and to make appeal to the principles of universal and everlasting justice these sentiments the authors of that convention most unfeelingly violated and as to the principles they seemed to be as little aware even of the existence of such powers for powers emphatically may they be called as the tyrant himself as far therefore as these men could they put an extinguisher upon the star which was then rising it is in vain to say that after the first burst of indignation was over the portuguese themselves were reconciled to the event and rejoiced in their deliverance we may infer from that the horror which they must have felt in the presence of their oppressors and we may see in it to what a state of helplessness their bad government had reduced them our duty was to have treated them with respect as the representatives of suffering humanity beyond what they were likely to look for themselves and as deserving greatly in common with their spanish brethren for having been the first to rise against the tremendous oppression and to show how and how only it could be put an end to  wm wordsworth63

testifying thereby the interest you take in us and our neighbourhood most probably some of them are answered in my daughters letter to miss eh i will however myself reply to one or two at the risk of repeating what she may have said 1st mrs hemans has not sent us any tidings of her movements and intentions since she left us so i am unable to tell you whether she mean to settle in edinburgh or london  63 memoirs i 3918  64 letter to lord lonsdale jan 8 1813 memoirs ii 2  she said she would write as soon as she could procure a frank that accommodation is i suppose more rare in scotland than at this season in our neighbourhood i assure you the weather has been so unfavourable to outdoor amusements since you left us not but that we have had a sprinkling of fine and bright days that little or no progress has been made in the game of the graces and i fear that amusement must be deferred till next summer if we or anybody else are to see another mr barber has dined with us once and my sister and mrs marshall of halsteads have seen his palace and grounds but i cannot report upon the general state of his temper i believe he continues to be enchanted as far as decayed health will allow with a mr cooper a clergyman who has just come to the living of hawkshend about five miles from ambleside did i tell you that professor wilson with his two sons and daughter have been and probably still are at elleray he heads the gaieties of the neighbourhood and has presided as steward at two regattas do these employments come under your notions of action opposed to contemplation why should they not whatever the high moralists may say the political economists will i conclude approve them as setting capital afloat and giving an impulse to manufacture and handicrafts but i speak of the improvement which may come thence to navigation and nautical science i have dined twice along with my brother who left us some time ago in the professors companyat mrs watsons widow of the bp at calgarth and at mr boltons poor mr b he must have been greatly shocked at the fatal accident that put an end to his friend huskissons earthly career there is another acquaintance of mine also recently gonea person for whom i never had any love but with whom i had for a short time a good deal of intimacy i mean hazlitt whose death you may have seen announced in the papers he was a man of extraordinary acuteness but perverse as lord byron himself whose life by galt i have been skimming since i came here galt affects to be very profound though he is in fact a very shallow fellowand perhaps the most illogical writer that these illogical days have produced his buts and his therefores are singularly misapplied singularly even for this unthinking age he accuses mr southey of pursuing lord b with rancour i should like a reference to what mr s has written of lord b to ascertain whether this charge be well founded i trust it is not both from what i know of my friend and for the aversion which mr g has expressed towards the lakers whom in the plenitude of his ignorance he is pleased to speak of as a class or school of poets  now for a word on the serious part of your letter your views of action and contemplation are i think just if you can lay your hands upon mr coleridges friend you will find some remarks of mine upon a letter signed if i recollect right mathetes which was written by professor wilson in which if i am not mistaken sentiments like yours are expressed at all events i am sure that i have long retained those opinions and have frequently expressed them either by letter or otherwise one thing however is not to be forgotten concerning active lifethat a personal independence must be provided for and in some cases more is requiredability to assist

left so long unanswered found me in a distressed state of mind with one of my children lying nearly as i thought at the point of death this put me off answering your letter  you return to the r catholic question i am decidedly of opinion that no further concessions should be made the r catholic emancipation is a mere pretext of ambitious and discontented men are you prepared for the next stepa r catholic established church i confess i dread the thought  as to the bible society my view of the subject is as follows1st distributing bibles is a good thing 2ndly more bibles will be distributed in consequence of the existence of the bible society therefore so far as that goes the existence of the bible society is good but 3rdly as to the indirect benefits expected from it as producing a golden age of unanimity among christians all that i think fume and emptiness nay far worse so deeply am i persuaded that discord and artifice and pride and ambition would be fostered by such an approximation and unnatural alliance of sects that i am inclined to think the evil thus produced would more than outweigh the good done by dispersing the bibles i think the last fifty or sixty pages of my brothers pamphlet66 merit the serious consideration of all persons of the established church who have connected themselves with the sectaries for this purpose  entreating your pardon for my long delay in answering your letter let me conclude with assuring you that i remain with great truth your affectionate friend  w wordsworth67  66 reasons for declining to become a subscriber to the

me intending to answer it upon the road but i had not courage to undertake the office on account of the inquiries it contains concerning my family i will be brief on this melancholy subject in the course of the last year i have lost two sweet children a girl and a boy at the ages of four and six and a half these innocents were the delight of our hearts and beloved by everybody that knew them they were cut off in a few hoursone by the measles and the other by convulsions dying one half a year after the other i quit this sorrowful subject secure of your sympathy as a father and as my friend                                       my employment i find salutary to me and of consequence in a pecuniary point of view as my literary employments bring me no remuneration nor promise any as to what you say about the ministry i very much prefer the course of their policy to that of the opposition especially on two points most near my heart resistance of buonaparte by force of arms and their adherence to the principles of the british constitution in withholding political power from the roman catholics my most determined hostility shall always be directed against those statesmen who like whitbread grenville and others would crouch to a sanguinary tyrant and i cannot act with those who see no danger to the constitution in introducing papists into parliament there are other points of policy in which i deem the opposition grievously mistaken and therefore i am at present and long have been by principle a supporter of ministers as far as my little influence extends with affectionate wishes for your welfare and that of your family and with best regards to mrs wrangham i am my dear friend                      faithfully yours                           w wordsworth68  68 memoirs ii

exertions and it is his wish to take pupils in order to increase his income which as he is a curate you know cannot but be small he is an excellent young man a good scholar and likely to become much better for he is extremely industrious among his talents i must mention that for drawing in which he is a proficient now my wish is that if it fall in your way you would vouchsafe him your patronage  of course you cannot speak for him directly till you have seen him but might he be permitted to refer to you you could have no objection to say that you were as yet ignorant of his merits as to your own knowledge but that your esteemed friend mr wordsworth that popular poet stampcollector for westmoreland c had recommended him strenuously to you as in all things deserving  a portion of a long

written and a most interesting story i did not notice a single sentiment or opinion that i could have wished away but onewhere you support the notion that if the duke of wellington had not lived and commanded buonaparte must have continued the master of europe i do not object to this from any dislike i have to the duke but from a convictioni trust a philosophic onethat providence would not allow the upsetting of so diabolical a system as buonapartes to depend upon the existence of any individual justly was it observed by lord wellesley that buonaparte was of an order of minds that created for themselves great reverses he might have gone further and said that it is of the nature of tyranny to work to its own destruction71   69 the excursion published 1814  70 memoirs ii 1011  71 as has been

not a page of them that he did not read me in ms and several of the dialogues are upon subjects which we have often discussed i am greatly interested with much of the book but upon its effect as a whole i can yet form no opinion as it was read to me as it happened to be written i need scarcely say that mr southey ranks very highly in my opinion as a prose writer his style is eminently clear lively and unencumbered and his information unbounded and there is a moral ardour about his compositions which nobly distinguishes them from the trading and factious authorship of the present day he may not improbably be our companion in wales next year at the end of this month he goes with his family to the isle of man for seaair and said if i would accompany him and put off the welsh tour for another year he would join our party notwithstanding the inducement i could not bring myself to consent but as things now are i shall remind him of the hope he held out                      believe me very faithfully yours                                 wm wordsworth  there is no probability of my being in town this season i have a horror of smoking and nothing but a necessity for healths sake could reconcile me to it in william74  74 memoirs ii 22   44 of alleged changes in political opinions  letter to a friend 1821  in the year 1821 october 7 an old friend of wordsworth thus writes to him they tell me you have changed your opinions upon many subjects respecting which we used to think alike but i am persuaded we shall neither of us change those great principles which ought to guide us in our conduct and lead us to do all the good we can to others and i am much mistaken if we should not find many things to talk about without disturbing ourselves with political or party disputes  to this wordsworth answered as follows                      rydal mount dec 4 1821  my dear l  your letter ought to have been much earlier acknowledged and would have been so had i not been sure you would ascribe my silence to its true cause viz procrastination and not to indifference to your kind attention there was another feeling which both urged and indisposed me to write to youi mean the allusion which in so friendly a manner you make to a supposed change in my political opinions to the scribblers in pamphlets and periodical publications who have heaped so much obloquy upon myself and my friends coleridge and southey i have not condescended to reply nor ever shall but to you my candid and enlightened friend i will say a few words on this subject which if we have the good fortune to meet again as i hope we may will probably be further dwelt upon  i should think that i had lived to little purpose if my notions on the subject of government had undergone no modification my youth must in that case have been without enthusiasm and my manhood endued with small capability of profiting by reflection if i were addressing those who have dealt so liberally with the words renegade apostate c i should retort the charge upon them and say you have been deluded by places and persons while i have stuck to principles i abandoned france and her rulers when they abandoned the struggle for liberty gave themselves up to tyranny and endeavoured to enslave the world i disapproved of the war against france at its commencement thinking which was perhaps an error that it might have been avoided but after buonaparte had violated the independence of switzerland my heart turned against him and against the nation that could submit to be the instrument of such an outrage here it was that i parted in feeling from the whigs and to a certain degree united with their adversaries who were free from the delusion such i must ever regard it of mr fox and his party that a safe and honourable peace was practicable with the french nation and that an ambitious conqueror like buonaparte could be softened down into a commercial rival  in a determination therefore to aim at the overthrow of that inordinate ambition by war i sided with the ministry not from general approbation of their conduct but as men who thought right on this essential point how deeply this question interested me will be plain to any one who will take the trouble of reading my political sonnets and the tract occasioned by the convention of cintra in which are sufficient evidences of my dissatisfaction with the mode of conducting the war and a prophetic display of the course which it would take if carried on upon the principles of justice and with due respect for the feelings of the oppressed nations  this is enough for foreign politics as influencing my attachments  there are three great domestic questions viz the liberty of the press parliamentary reform and roman catholic concession which if i briefly advert to no more need be said at present  a free discussion of public measures through the press i deem the only safeguard of liberty without it i have neither confidence in kings parliaments judges or divines they have all in their turn betrayed their country but the press so potent for good is scarcely less so for evil and unfortunately they who are misled and abused by its means are the persons whom it can least benefit it is the fatal characteristic of their disease to reject all remedies coming from the quarter that has caused or aggravated the malady i am therefore for vigorous restrictions but there is scarcely any abuse that i would not endure rather than sacrifice or even endanger this freedom  when i was young giving myself credit for qualities which i did not possess and measuring mankind by that standard i thought it derogatory to human nature to set up property in preference to person as a title for legislative power that notion has vanished i now perceive many advantages in our present complex system of representation which formerly eluded my observation this has tempered my ardour for reform but if any plan could be contrived for throwing the representation fairly into the hands of the property of the country and not leaving it so much in the hands of the large proprietors as it now is it should have my best support though even in that event there would be a sacrifice of personal rights independent of property that are now frequently exercised for the benefit of the community  be not startled when i say that i am averse to further concessions to the roman catholics my reasons are that such concessions will not produce harmony among the roman catholics themselves that they among them who are most clamorous for the measure care little about it but as a step first to the overthrow of the protestant establishment in ireland as introductory to a separation of the two countriestheir ultimate aim that i cannot consent to take the character of a religion from the declaration of powerful professors of it disclaiming doctrines imputed to that religion that taking its character from what it actually teaches to the great mass i believe the roman catholic religion to be unchanged in its doctrines and unsoftened in its spirithow can it be otherwise unless the doctrine of infallibility be given up that such concessions would set all other dissenters in motionan issue which has never fairly been met by the friends to concession and deeming the church establishment not only a fundamental part of our constitution but one of the greatest upholders and propagators of civilization in our own country and lastly the most effectual and main support of religious toleration i cannot but look with jealousy upon measures which must reduce her relative influence unless they be accompanied with arrangements more adequate than any yet adopted for the preservation and increase of that influence to keep pace with the other powers in the community  i do not apologise for this long letter the substance of which you may report to any one worthy of a reply who in your hearing may animadvert upon my political conduct i ought to have added perhaps a word on local politics but i have not space but what i should have said may in a great measure be deduced from the above                      i am my dear l

sister during my absence has returned thanks in my name for the verses which you have done me the honour of addressing to me and for the obliging letter which accompanies them i feel it incumbent on me on my return home to write a few words to the same purpose with my own hand  it is always a satisfaction to me to learn that i have given pleasure upon rational grounds and i have nothing to object to your poetical panegyric but the occasion which called it forth an admirer of my works zealous as you have declared yourself to be condescends too much when he gives way to an impulse proceeding from the  or indeed from any other review the writers in these publications while they prosecute their inglorious employment cannot be supposed to be in a state of mind very favourable for being affected by the finer influences of a thing so pure as genuine poetry and as to the instance which has incited you to offer me this tribute of your gratitude though i have not seen it i doubt not but that it is a splenetic effusion of the conductor of that review who has taken a perpetual retainer from his own incapacity to plead against my claims to public approbation  i differ from you in thinking that the only poetical lines in your address are stolen from myself the best verse perhaps is the following      awfully mighty in his impotence  which by way of repayment i may he tempted to steal from you on some future occasion  it pleases though it does not surprise me to learn that having been affected early in life by my verses you have returned again to your old loves after some little infidelities which you were shamed into by commerce with the scribbling and chattering part of the world i have heard of many who upon their first acquaintance with my poetry have had much to get over before they could thoroughly relish it but never of one who having once learned to enjoy it had ceased to value it or survived his admiration this is as good an external assurance as i can desire that my inspiration is from a pure source and that my principles of composition are trustworthy  with many thanks for your good wishes and begging leave to offer mine in return                      i remain                      dear sir                      respectfully yours                         wm wordsworth76  76 memoirs ii 524  bernard barton esq woodbridge suffolk   46 of the thanksgiving ode and white doe of rylston  letter to robert southey                      1816 my dear southey  i am much of your mind in respect to my ode had it been a hymn uttering the sentiments of a multitude a stanza would have been indispensable but though i have called it a thanksgiving ode strictly speaking it is not so but a poem composed or supposed to be composed on the morning of the thanksgiving uttering the sentiments of an individual upon that occasion it is a dramatised ejaculation and this if any thing can must excuse the irregular frame of the metre in respect to a stanza for a grand subject designed to be treated comprehensively there are great objections if the stanza be short it will scarcely allow of fervour and impetuosity unless so short as that the sense is run perpetually from one stanza to another as in horaces alcaics and if it be long it will be as apt to generate diffuseness as to check it of this we have innumerable instances in spenser and the italian poets the sense required cannot he included in one given stanza so that another whole stanza is added not unfrequently for the sake of matter which would naturally include itself in a very few lines  if grays plan be adopted there is not time to become acquainted with the arrangement and to recognise with pleasure the recurrence of the movement  be so good as to let me know where you found most difficulty in following me the passage which i most suspect of being misunderstood is      and thus is missed the sole true glory  and the passage where i doubt most about the reasonableness of expecting that the reader should follow me in the luxuriance of the imagery and the language is the one that describes under so many metaphors the spreading of the news of the waterloo victory over the globe tell me if this displeased you  do you know who reviewed the white doe in the quarterly after having asserted that mr w uses his words without any regard to their sense the writer says that on no other principle can he explain that emily is always called the consecrated emily now the name emily occurs just fifteen times in the poem and out of these fifteen the epithet is attached to it once and that for the express purpose of recalling the scene in which she had been consecrated by her brothers solemn adjuration that she would fulfil her destiny and become a soul      by force of sorrows high     uplifted to the purest sky     of undisturbed mortality  the point upon which the whole moral interest of the piece hinges when that speech is closed occurs in this line      he kissed the consecrated maid  and to bring back this to the reader i repeated the epithet  the service i have lately rendered to burns genius77 will one day be performed to mine the quotations also are printed with the most culpable neglect of correctness there are lines turned into nonsense too much of this farewell                     believe me affectionately yours                           w

epic poetry is much the same as the critic whom lucien buonaparte has quoted in his preface epic poetry of the highest class requires in the first place an action eminently influential an action with a grand or sublime train of consequences it next requires the intervention and guidance of beings superior to man what the critics i believe call machinery and lastly i think with dennis that no subject but a religious one can answer the demand of the soul in the highest class of this species of poetry now tassos is a religious subject and in my opinion a most happy one but i am confidently of opinion that the movement of tassos poem rarely corresponds with the essential character of the subject nor do i think it possible that written in stanzas it should the celestial movement cannot i think be kept up if the sense is to be broken in that despotic manner at the close of every eight lines spensers stanza is infinitely finer than the ottaca rhima but even spensers will not allow the epic movement as exhibited by homer virgil and milton how noble is the first paragraph of the aeneid in point of sound compared with the first stanza of the jerusalem delivered the one winds with the majesty of the conscript fathers entering the senate house in solemn procession and the other has the pace of a set of recruits shuffling on the drillground and receiving from the adjutant or drillserjeant the commands to halt at every ten or twenty steps farewell                     affectionately yours                        w wordsworth79  79 memoirs ii 623   48 the classics translation of aeneid c  laodamia dion c these poems were written in 181416 about this time wordsworths attention was given to the education of his eldest son this occupation appears to have been the occasion of their composition in preparing his son for his university career he reperused the principal latin poets and doubtless the careful study of their works was not without a beneficial influence on his own it imparted variety and richness to his conceptions and shed new graces on his style and rescued his poems from the charge of mannerism  among the fruits of this course of reading was a translation of some of the earlier books of virgils aeneid three books were finished this version was not executed in blank verse but in rhyme not however in the style of pope but with greater freedom and vigour a specimen of this translation was contributed by wordsworth to the philological museum printed at cambridge in 183280 it was accompanied with the following letter from the author   translation of part of the first book of the aeneid81  to the editor off the philological museum  your letter reminding me of an expectation i some time since held out to you of allowing some specimens of my translation from the aeneid to be printed in the philological museum was not very acceptable for i had abandoned the thought of ever sending into the world any part of that experimentfor it was nothing morean experiment begun for amusement and i now think a less fortunate one than when i first named it to you having been displeased in modern translations with the additions of incongruous matter i began to translate with a resolve to keep clear of that fault by adding nothing but i became convinced that a spirited translation can scarcely be accomplished in the english language without admitting a principle of compensation on this point however i do not wish to insist and merely send the following passage taken at random from a wish to comply with your request

gratified if you happen to like my translation and thankful for any remarks with which you may honour me i have made so much progress with the second book that i defer sending the former till that is finished it takes in many places a high tone of passion which i would gladly succeed in rendering when i read virgil in the original i am moved but not so much so by the translation and i cannot but think this owing to a defect in the diction which i have endeavoured to supply with what success you will easily be enabled to judge                     ever my lord                     most faithfully your obliged friend and servant                                       wm wordsworth83                     feb 5 1829  my lord  i am truly obliged by your friendly and frank communication may i beg that you would add to the favour by marking with a pencil some of the passages that are faulty in your view of the case we seem pretty much of opinion upon the subject of rhyme pentameters where the sense has a close of some sort at every two lines may be rendered in regularly closed couplets but hexameters especially the virgilian that run the lines into each other for a great length cannot i have long been persuaded that milton formed his blank verse upon the model of the georgics and the aeneid and i am so much struck with this resemblance that i should have attempted virgil in blank verse had i not been persuaded that no ancient author can be with advantage so rendered their religion their warfare their course of action and feeling are too remote from modern interest to allow it we require every possible help and attraction of sound in our language to smooth the way for the admission of things so remote from our present concerns my own notion of translation is that it cannot be too literal provided three faults be avoided baldness in which i include all that takes from dignity and strangeness or uncouthness including harshness and lastly attempts to convey meanings which as they cannot be given but by languid circumlocutions cannot in fact be said to be given at all i will trouble you with an instance in which i fear this fault exists virgil describing aeneass voyage third book verse 551 says      hinc sinus herculei si vera est fama tarenti     cernitur  83 memoirs ii 69  i render it thus      hence we behold the bay that bears the name     of proud tarentum proud to share the fame     of hercules though by a dubious claim  i was unable to get the meaning with tolerable harmony into fewer words which are more than to a modern reader perhaps it is worth  i feel much at a loss without the assistance of the marks which i have requested to take an exact measure of your lordships feelings with regard to the diction to save you the trouble of reference i will transcribe two passages from dryden first the celebrated appearance of hectors ghost to aeneas aeneas thus addresses him      o light of trojans and support of troy     thy fathers champion and thy country s joy     o long expected by thy friends from whence     art thou returned so late for our defence     do we behold thee wearied as we are     with length of labours and with toils of war     after so many funerals of thy own     art thou restored to thy declining town  this i think not an unfavourable specimen of drydens way of treating the solemnly pathetic passages yet surely here is nothing of the cadence of the original and little of its spirit the second verse is not in the original and ought not to have been in dryden for it anticipates the beautiful hemistich      sat patriae priamoque datum  by the by there is the same sort of anticipation in a spirited and harmonious couplet preceding      such as he was when by pelides slain     thessalian coursers dragged him oer the plain  this introduction of pelides here is not in virgil because it would have prevented the effect of      redit exuvias indutus achillei  there is a striking solemnity in the answer of pantheus to aeneas      venit summa dies et ineluctabile tempus     dardaniae fuimus troës fuit ilium et ingens     gloria teucrorum c  dryden thus gives it            then pantheus with a groan     troy is no more and ilium was a town     the fatal day the appointed hour is come     when wrathful joves irrevocable doom     transfers the trojan state to grecian hands     the fire consumes the town the foe commands  my own translation runs thus and i quote it because it occurred to my mind immediately on reading your lordships observations            tis come the final hour     th inevitable close of dardan power     hath come we have been trojans ilium was     and the great name of troy now all things pass     to argos so wills angry jupiter     amid a burning town the grecians domineer  i cannot say that we have been and ilium was are as sonorous sounds as fuimus and fuit but these latter must have been as familiar to the romans as the former to ourselves i should much like to know if your lordship disapproves of my translation here i have one word to say upon ornament it was my wish and labour that my translation should have far more of the genuine ornaments of virgil than my predecessors dryden has been very careless of these and profuse of his own which seem to me very rarely to harmonise with those of virgil as for example describing hectors appearance in the passage above alluded to      a bloody shroud he seemed and bathd in tears     i wept to see the visionary man  again      and all the wounds he for his country bore     now streamed afresh and with new purple ran  i feel it however to be too probable that my translation is deficient in ornament because i must unavoidably have lost many of virgils and have never without reluctance attempted a compensation of my own had i taken the liberties of my predecessors dryden especially i could have translated nine books with the labour that three have cost me the third book being of a humbler character than either of the former i have treated with rather less scrupulous apprehension and have interwoven a little of my own and with permission i will send it ere long for the benefit of your lordships observations which really will be of great service to me if i proceed had i begun the work fifteen years ago i should have finished it with pleasure at present i fear it will take more time than i either can or ought to spare i do not think of going beyond the fourth book  as to the ms be so kind as to forward it at your leisure to me at sir george beaumonts coleorton hall near ashby

hear from me during my continental tour accordingly i have great pleasure in writing from this place where we arrived three days ago our route has lain through brussels namur along the banks of the meuse to liege thence to aixlachapelle cologne and along the rhine to mayence to frankfort heidelberg a noble situation at the point where the neckar issues from steep lofty hills into the plain of the rhine carlsruhe and through the black forest to schaffhausen thence to zurich berne thun interlachen here our alpine tour might be said to commence which has produced much pleasure thus far and nothing that deserves the name of difficulty even for the ladies from the valley of lauterbrunnen we crossed the wengern alp to grindelwald and then over the grand sheideck to meyringen this journey led us over high ground and for fifteen leagues along the base of the loftiest alps which reared their bare or snowclad ridges and pikes in a clear atmosphere with fleecy clouds now and then settling upon and gathering round them we heard and saw several avalanches they are announced by a sound like thunder but more metallic and musical this warning naturally makes one look about and we had the gratification of seeing one falling in the shape and appearance of a torrent or cascade of foaming water down the deepworn crevices of the steep or perpendicular granite mountains nothing can be more awful than the sound of these cataracts of ice and snow thus descending unless it be the silence which succeeds the elevations from which we beheld these operations of nature and saw such an immense range of primitive mountains stretching to the east and west were covered with rich pasturage and beautiful flowers among which was abundance of the monkshood a flower which i had never seen but in the trim borders of our gardens and which here grew not so much in patches as in little woods or forests towering above the other plants at this season the herdsmen are with their cattle in still higher regions than those which we have trod the herbage where we travelled being reserved till they descend in the autumn we have visited the abbey of engelberg not many leagues from the borders of the lake of lucerne the tradition is that the site of the abbey was appointed by angels singing from a lofty mountain that rises from the plain of the valley and which from having been thus honoured is called engelberg or the hill of the angels it is a glorious position for such beings and i should have thought myself repaid for the trouble of so long a journey by the impression made upon my mind when i first came in view of the vale in which the convent is placed and of the mountains that enclose it the light of the sun had left the valley and the deep shadows spread over it heightened the splendour of the evening light and spread upon the surrounding mountains some of which had their summits covered with pure snow others were half hidden by vapours rolling round them and the rock of engelberg could not have been seen under more fortunate circumstances for masses of cloud glowing with the reflection of the rays of the setting sun were hovering round it like choirs of spirits preparing to settle upon its venerable head  today we quit this place to ascend the mountain righi we shall be detained in this neighbourhood till our passports are returned from berne signed by the austrian minister which we find absolutely necessary to enable us to proceed into the milanese at the end of five weeks at the latest we hope to reach geneva returning by the simplon pass there i might have the pleasure of hearing from your lordship and may i beg that you would not omit to mention our westmoreland politics the diet of switzerland is now sitting in this place yesterday i had a long conversation with the bavarian envoy whose views of the state of europe appear to me very just this letter must unavoidably prove dull to your lordship but when i have the pleasure of seeing you i hope to make some little amends though i feel this is a very superficial way of viewing a country even with reference merely to the beauties of nature we have not met with many english there is scarcely a third part as many in the country as there was last year a brother of lord grey is in the house where we now are and lord ashburton left yesterday i must conclude abruptly with kindest

of switzerland usually deemed most worthy of notice and the italian lakes having stopped four days at milan and as many at geneva with the exception of a couple of days on the lake of geneva the weather has been most favourable though frequently during the last fortnight extremely cold we have had no detention from illness nor any bad accident for which we feel more grateful on account of some of our fellow travellers who accidentally joined us for a few days of these one an american gentleman was drowned in the lake of zurich by the upsetting of a boat in a storm two or three days after he parted with us and two others near the summit of mount jura and in the middle of a tempestuous night were precipitated they scarcely knew how far along with one of those frightful and ponderous vehicles a continental diligence we have been in paris since sunday last and think of staying about a fortnight longer as scarcely less will suffice for even a hasty view of the town and neighbourhood we took fontainebleau in our way and intend giving a day to versailles the day we entered paris we passed a welldrest young man and woman dragging a harrow through a field like cattle nevertheless working in the fields on the sabbath day does not appear to be general in france on the same day a wretchedlooking person begged of us as the carriage was climbing a hill nothing could exceed his transport in receiving a pair of old pantaloons which were handed out of the carriage this poor mendicant the postilion told us was an ancien curé the churches seem generally falling into decay in the country we passed one which had been recently repaired i have noticed however several young persons men as well as women earnestly employed in their devotions in different churches both in paris and elsewhere nothing which i have seen in this city has interested me at all like the jardin des plantes with the living animals and the museum of natural history which it includes scarcely could i refrain from tears of admiration at the sight of this apparently boundless exhibition of the wonders of the creation the statues and pictures of the louvre affect me feebly in comparison the exterior of paris is much changed since i last visited it in 1792 i miss many ancient buildings particularly the temple where the poor king and his family were so long confined that memorable spot where the jacobin club was held has also disappeared nor are the additional buildings always improvements the pont des arts in particular injures the view from the pont neuf greatly but in these things public convenience is the main point  i say nothing of public affairs for i have little opportunity of knowing anything about them in respect to the business of our queen we deem ourselves truly fortunate in having been out of the country at a time when an inquiry at which all europe seems scandalised was going on  i have purposely deferred congratulating your lordship on the marriage of lady mary with lord frederick bentinck which i hear has been celebrated my wishes for her happiness are most earnest  with respectful compliments and congratulations to lady lonsdale in which mrs

1828  letter to a nephew                     rydal mount nov 27 1828  my dear c  it gives me much pleasure to learn that your residence in france has answered so well as i had recommended the step i felt more especially anxious to be informed of the result i have only to regret that you did not tell me whether the interests of a foreign country and a brilliant metropolis had encroached more upon the time due to academical studies than was proper  as to the revolution which mr d calculates upon i agree with him that a great change must take place but not altogether or even mainly from the causes which he looks to if i be right in conjecturing that he expects that the religionists who have at present such influence over the kings mind will be predominant the extremes to which they wish to carry things are not sufficiently in the spirit of the age to suit their purpose the french monarchy must undergo a great change or it will fall altogether a constitution of government so disproportioned cannot endure a monarchy without a powerful aristocracy or nobility graduating into a gentry and so downwards cannot long subsist this is wanting in france and must continue to be wanting till the restrictions imposed on the disposal of property by will through the code napoleon are done away with and it may be observed by the by that there is a bareness some would call it a simplicity in that code which unfits it for a complex state of society like that of france so that evasions and stretchings of its provisions are already found necessary to a degree which will ere long convince the french people of the necessity of disencumbering themselves of it but to return my apprehension is that for the cause assigned the french monarchy may fall before an aristocracy can be raised to give it necessary support the great monarchies of russia prussia and austria having not yet been subject to popular revolutions are still able to maintain themselves through the old

classes how much they have to lose for circumstances often make men wiser or at least more discreet when their individual levity or presumption would dispose them to be much otherwise to what extent that constitution of character which is produced by property makes up for the decay of chivalrous loyalty and strengthens governments may be seen by comparing the officers of the english army with those of prussia c how far superior are ours as gentlemen so much so that british officers can scarcely associate with those of the continent not from pride but instinctive aversion to their low

fragment criticisms i should say to your young friend style is in poetry of incalculable importance he seems however aware of it for his diction is obviously studied now the great difficulty is to determine what constitutes a good style in estimating this we are all subject to delusion not improbably i am so when it appears to me that the metaphor in the first speech of his dramatic scene is too much drawn out it does not pass off as rapidly as metaphors ought to do i think in dramatic writing i am well aware that our early dramatists abound with these continuities of imagery but to me they appear laboured and unnatural at least unsuited to that species of composition of which action and motion are the essentials while with the ashes of a light that was and the two following lines are in the best style of dramatic writing to every opinion thus given always add i pray you in my judgment though i may not to save trouble or to avoid a charge of false modesty express it this

thought the answer90 appeared to you triumphant for it had struck me as in the main point knowledge of the subject and spirit in the writing and accuracy in the logic as one of the best controversial tracts i ever had  i am glad you have been so busy i wish i could say so much of myself i have written this last month however about 600 verses with tolerable success  many thanks for the review your article is excellent i only wish that you had said more of the deserts of government in respect to ireland since i do sincerely believe that no government in europe has shown better dispositions to its subjects than the english have done to the irish and that no country has improved so much during the same period you have adverted to this part of the subject but not spoken so forcibly as i could have wished there is another point might be insisted upon more expressly than you have donethe danger not to say the absurdity of roman catholic legislation for the property of a protestant church so inadequately represented in parliament as ours is the convocation is gone clergymen are excluded from the house of commons and the bishops are at the beck of ministers i boldly ask what real property of the country is so inadequately represented it is a mere mockery                     most affectionately yours                       ww91  90 this alludes to dr wordsworths second publication

night feb 26 1829  you ask for my opinion on the roman catholic question  i dare scarcely trust my pen to the notice of the question which the duke of wellington tells us is about to be settled one thing no rational person will deny that the experiment is hazardous equally obvious is it that the timidity supineness and other unworthy qualities of the government for many years past have produced the danger the extent of which they now affirm imposes a necessity of granting all that the romanists demand now it is rather too much that the country should be called upon to take the measure of this danger from the very men who may almost be said to have created it danger is a relative thing and the first requisite for judging of what we have to dread from the physical force of the roman catholics is to be in sympathy with the protestants had our ministers been so could they have suffered themselves to be bearded by the catholic association for so many years  c if i may take leave to say it loses sight of things in names when he says that they should not be admitted as roman catholics but simply as british subjects the question before us is can protestantism and popery be coordinate powers in the constitution of a free country and at the same time christian belief be in that country a vital principle of action  i fear not heaven grant i may be deceived  ww92  92

also delicate to touch upon and hazardous to deal with but of prime importance in this crisis the question as under the conduct of the present ministers is closely connecting itself with religion now after all if we are to be preserved from utter confusion it is religion and morals and conscience which must do the work the religious part of the community especially those attached to the church of england must and do feel that neither the church as an establishment nor its points of faith as a church nor christianity itself as governed by scripture ought to be left long if it can be prevented in the hands which manage our affairs  but i am running into unpardonable length i took up the pen principally to express a hope that your lordship may have continued to see the question in the light which affords the only chance of preserving the nation from several generations perhaps of confusion and crime and wretchedness                     excuse the liberty i have taken

laws c  letter to g huntly gordon esq                     rydal mount dec 1 1829  my dear sir  you must not go to ireland without applying to me as the guidebooks for the most part are sorry things and mislead by their exaggerations if i were a younger man and could prevail upon an able artist to accompany me there are few things i should like better than giving a month or six weeks to explore the county of kerry only a judicious topographical work on that district would be really useful both for the lovers of nature and the observers of manners as to the giants causeway and the coast of antrim you cannot go wrong there the interests obtrude themselves on every ones notice  the subject of the poor laws was never out of my sight whilst i was in ireland it seems to me next to impossible to introduce a general system of such laws principally for two reasons the vast numbers that would have equal claims for relief and the nonexistence of a class capable of looking with effect to their administration much is done at present in many places derry for example by voluntary contributions but the narrowminded escape from the burthen which falls unreasonably upon the charitable so that assessments in the bestdisposed places are to be wished for could they be effected without producing a greater evil  the great difficulty that is complained of in the wellmanaged places is the floating poor who cannot be excluded i am told by any existing law from quartering themselves where they like open begging is not practised in many places but there is no law by which the poor can be prevented from returning to a place which they may have quitted voluntarily or from which they have been expelled as i was told were it not for this obstacle compulsory local regulations might i think be applied in many districts with good effect  it would be unfair to myself to quit this momentous subject without adding that i am a zealous friend to the great principle of the poor laws as tending if judiciously applied much more to elevate than to depress the character of the labouring classes i have never seen this truth developed as it ought to be in parliament  the day i dined with lord fl gower at his official residence in the phoenix park i met there with an intelligent gentleman mr page who was travelling in ireland expressly to collect information upon this subject which no doubt he means to publish if you should hear of this pamphlet when it comes out procure it for i am persuaded it will prove well worth reading farewell                     faithfully yours

wrangham  i received your kind letter last night for which you will accept my thanks i write upon the spur of that mark of your regard or my aversion to letterwriting might get the better of me  i find it difficult to speak publicly of good men while alive especially if they are persons who have power the world ascribes the eulogy to interested motives or to an adulatory spirit which i detest but of lord lonsdale i will say to you that i do not think there exists in england a man of any rank more anxiously desirous to discharge his duty in that state of life to which it has pleased god to call him his thought and exertions are constantly directed to that object and the more he is known the more is he beloved and respected and admired  94 memoirs ii 1556  i ought to have thanked you before for your version of virgils eclogues which reached me at last i have lately compared it line for line with the original and think it very well done i was particularly pleased with the skill you have shown in managing the contest between the shepherds in the third pastoral where you have included in a succession of couplets the sense of virgils paired hexameters i think i mentioned to you that these poems of virgil have always delighted me much there is frequently either an elegance or a happiness which no translation can hope to equal in point of fidelity your translation is very good indeed  you astonish me with the account of your books and i should have been still more astonished if you had told me you had read a third shall i say a tenth part of them my reading powers were never very good and now they are much diminished especially by candlelight and as to buying books i can affirm that in new books i have not spent five shillings for the last five years ie in reviews magazines pamphlets c c so that there would be an end of mr longman and mr cadell c c if nobody had more power or inclination to buy than myself and as to old books my dealings in that way for want of means have been very trifling nevertheless small and paltry as my collection is i have not read a fifth part of it i should however like to see your army      such forces met not nor so wide a camp     when agrican with fill his northern powers     besieged albracca as romances tell  not that i accuse you of romancing i verily believe that you have all the books you speak of dear wrangham are you and i ever like to meet in this world again yours is a corner of the earth mine is not so i never heard of anybody going to bridlington but all the world comes to the lakes farewell excuse this wretched scrawl it is like all that proceeds from my miserable pen                                                          ever faithfully yours                        wm wordsworth  dear wrangham  you are very good in sending one letter after another to inquire after a person so undeserving of attentions of this kind as myself dr johnson i think observes or rather is made to observe by some of his biographers that no man delights to give what he is accustomed to sell for example you mr thrale would rather part with anything in this way than your porter now though i have never been much of a salesman in matters of literature the whole of my returnsi do not say net profits but returnsfrom the writing trade not amounting to seven score pounds yet somehow or other i manufacture a letter and part with it as reluctantly as if it were really a thing of price but to drop the comparison i have so much to do with writing in the way of labour and profession that it is difficult to me to conceive how anybody can take up a pen but from constraint my writingdesk is to me a place of punishment and as my penmanship sufficiently testifies i always bend over it with some degree of impatience all this is said that you may know the real cause of my silence and not ascribe it in any degree to slight or forgetfulness on my part or an insensibility to your worth and the value of your friendship as to my occupations they look little at the present age but i live in hope of leaving something behind me that by some minds will be valued  i see no new books except by the merest accident of course your poem which i should have been pleased to read has not found its way to me you inquire about old books you might almost as well have asked for my teeth as for any of mine the only modern books that i read are those of travels or such as relate to matters of fact and the only modern books that i care for but as to old ones i am like yourselfscarcely anything comes amiss to me the little time i have to sparethe very little i may sayall goes that way if however in the line of your profession you want any bulky old commentaries on the scriptures such as not twelve strong men of these degenerate days will venturei do not say to read but to lift i can perhaps as a special favour accommodate you  i and mine will be happy to see you and yours here or anywhere but i am sorry the time you talk of is so distant a year and a half is a long time looking forward though looking back ten times as much is as brief as a dream my writing is wholly illegibleat least i fear so i had better therefore release you                     believe me my dear wrangham                      your affectionate friend                         w wordsworth95   59 poems of edward moxon  letter to moxon                     postmark dec 8 1826  dear sir  it is some time since i received your little volume for which i now return you my thanks and also for the obliging letter that accompanied it  your poem i have read with no inconsiderable pleasure it is full of natural sentiments and pleasing pictures among the minor pieces the last pleased me much the best and especially the latter part of it this little volume with what i saw of yourself during a short interview interest me in your welfare and the more so as i always feel some apprehension for the destiny of those who in youth addict themselves to the composition of verse it is a very seducing employment and though begun in disinterested love of the muses is too apt to connect itself with selflove and the disquieting passions which follow in the train of that our natural infirmity fix your eye upon acquiring independence by honourable business and let the muses come after rather than go before such lines as the latter of this couplet      where lovely woman chaste as heaven above     shines in the golden virtues of her love  and many other passages in your poem give proof of no commonplace sensibility i am therefore the more earnest that you should guard yourself against this temptation  excuse this freedom and believe me my dear sir very faithfully                     your obliged servant

rydal mount near kendal sept 24 1827  my dear sir  you will have no pain to suffer from my sincerity with a safe conscience i can assure you that in my judgment your verses are animated with true poetic spirit as they are evidently the product of strong feeling the sixth and seventh stanzas affected me much even to the dimming of my eye and faltering of my voice while i was reading them aloud having said this i have said enough now for the per contra  you will not i am sure be hurt when i tell you that the workmanship what else could be expected from so young a writer is not what it ought to be even in those two affecting stanzas it is not perfect      some touch of human sympathy find way     and whisper that though truths and science ray     with such serene effulgence oer thee shone  sympathy might whisper but a touch of sympathy could not truths and science ray for the ray of truth and science is not only extremely harsh but a ray shone is if not absolutely a pleonasm a great awkwardness a ray fell or shot may be said and a sun or a moon or a candle shone but not a ray i much regret that i did not receive these verses while you were here that i might have given you vivâ voce a comment upon them which would be tedious by letter and after all very imperfect if i have the pleasure of seeing you again i will beg permission to dissect these verses or any other you may be inclined to show me but i am certain that without conference with me or any benefit drawn from my practice in metrical composition your own high powers of mind will lead you to the main conclusions  you will be brought to acknowledge that the logical faculty has infinitely more to do with poetry than the young and the inexperienced whether writer or critic ever dreams of indeed as the materials upon which that faculty is exorcised in poetry are so subtle so plastic so complex the application of it requires an adroitness which can proceed from nothing but practice a discernment which emotion is so far from bestowing that at first it is ever in the way of it here i must stop only let me advert to two lines      but shall despondence therefore blench my brow     or pining sorrow sickly ardor oer  these are two of the worst lines in mere expression blench is perhaps miswritten for blanch if not i dont understand the word blench signifies to flinch if blanch be the word the next ought to be hair you cannot here use brow for the hair upon it because a white brow or forehead is a beautiful characteristic of youth sickly ardor oer was at first reading to me unintelligible i took sickly to be an adjective joined with ardor whereas you mean it as a portion of a verb from shakspeare sicklied oer with the pale cast of thought but the separation of the parts or decomposition of the word as here done is not to be endured  let me now come to your sisters verses for which i thank you they are surprisingly vigorous for a female pen but occasionally too rugged and especially for such a subject they have also the same faults in expression as your own but not i think in quite an equal degree much is to be hoped from feelings so strong and from a mind thus disposed i should have entered into particulars with these also had i seen you after they came into my hands your sister is no doubt aware that in her poem she has trodden the same ground as gray in his ode upon a distant prospect of eton college what he has been contented to treat in the abstract she has represented in particular and with admirable spirit but again my dear sir let me exhort you and do you exhort your sister to deal little with modern writers but fix your attention almost exclusively upon those who have stood the test of time you have not leisure to allow of your being tempted to turn aside from the right course by deceitful lights my household desire to be remembered to you in no formal way seldom have i parted never i was going to say with one whom after so short an acquaintance i lost sight of with more regret i trust we shall meet again if not sentence cut off with the autograph postscript pray do not forget to remember me to mr otway i was much pleased with him and with your fellowtraveller mr nimmo as i should have been no doubt with the young irishman had not our conversation taken so serious a turn the passage in tacitus which miltons line so strongly resembles is not in the agricola nor can i find it but it exists somewhere  w wordsworth97   61 of collins dyer thomson c  letter to rev alexander dyce                     rydal mount kendal jan 12 1829  dear sir  i regret to hear of the indisposition from which you have been suffering  that you are convinced98 gives me great pleasure as i hope that every other editor of collins will follow your example you are at perfect liberty to declare that you have rejected bells copy in consequence of my opinion of it and i feel much satisfaction in being the instrument of rescuing the memory of collins from this disgrace i have always felt some concern that mr home who lived several years after bells publication did not testify more regard for his deceased friends memory by protesting against this imposition mr mackenzie is still living and i shall shortly have his opinion upon the question and if it be at all interesting i shall take the liberty of sending it to you   97 memoirs ii 21214 with important

his native country and where in early life he practised as a painter i have often heard sir george beaumont express a curiosity about his pictures and a wish to see any specimen of his pencil that might survive if you are a rambler perhaps you may at some time or other be led into carmarthenshire and might bear in mind what i have just said of this excellent author  i had once a hope to have learned some unknown particulars of thomson about jedburgh but i was disappointed had i succeeded i meant to publish a short life of him prefixed to a volume containing the seasons the castle of indolence his minor pieces in rhyme and a few extracts from his plays and his liberty and i feel still inclined to do something of the kind these three writers thomson collins and dyer had more poetic imagination than any of their contemporaries unless we reckon chatterton as of that age i do not name pope for he stands alone as a man most highly gifted but unluckily he took the plain when the

that i deem it still prudent to employ an amanuensis but i had a more decisive reason for putting off payment nothing less than the hope that i might discharge my debt in person it seems better however to consult you beforehand i wish to make a tour in ireland and perhaps along with my daughter but i am ignorant of so many points as where to begin whether it be safe at this rioting period what is best worth seeing what mode of travelling will furnish the greatest advantages at the least expense dublin of coursethe wicklow mountainskillarney lakesand i think the ruins not far from limerick would be among my objects and return by the north but i can form no conjecture as to the time requisite for this and whether it would be best to take the steamboat from liverpool to cork beginning there or to go from whitehaven to dublin to start from whitehaven by steam to dublin would suit me as being nearer this place and a shorter voyage besides my son is settled near whitehaven and i could conveniently embark from his abode  i have read with great pleasure the sketches in ireland which mr otway was kind enough to present to me but many interesting things he speaks of in the west will be quite out of my reach in short i am as unprepared with tourists information as any man can be and sensible as i am of the very great value of your time i cannot refrain from begging you to take pity upon my ignorance and to give me some information keeping in mind the possibility of my having a female companion  it is time to thank you for the verses you so obligingly sent me  your sisters have abundance of spirit and feeling all that they want is what appears in itself of little moment and yet is of incalculably greatthat is workmanshipthe art by which the thoughts are made to melt into each other and to fall into light and shadow regulated by distinct preconception of the best general effect they are capable of producing this may seem very vague to you but by conversation i think i could make it appear otherwise it is enough for the present to say that i was much gratified and beg you would thank your sister for favouring me with the sight of compositions so distinctly marked with that quality which is the subject of them genius your own verses are to me very interesting and affect me much as evidences of high and puremindedness from which humblemindedness is inseparable i like to see and think of you among the stars and between death and immortality where three of these poems place you the dream of chivalry is also interesting in another way but it would be insincere not to say that something of a style more terse and a harmony more accurately balanced must be acquired before the bodily form of your verses will be quite worthy of their living soul you are probably aware of this tho perhaps not in an equal degree with myself nor is it desirable you should for it might tempt you to labour which would divert you from subjects of infinitely greater importance  many thanks for your interesting account of mr edgeworth i heartily concur with you in the wish that neither plato nor any other profane author may lead him from the truths of the gospel

our shady woods and green hills and invigorated streams the summer is passing on and i have not left home and perhaps shall not for it is far more from duty than inclination that i quit my dear and beautiful home and duty pulls two ways on the one side my mind stands in need of being fed by new objects for meditation and reflection the more so because diseased eyes have cut me off so much from reading and on the other hand i am obliged to look at the expense of distant travelling as i am not able to take so much out of my body by walking as heretofore  i have not got my ms back from the 101

works and the obliging letter accompanying it for both of which i offer my cordial thanks  english literature is greatly indebted to your labours and i have much pleasure in this occasion of testifying my respect for the sound judgment and conscientious diligence with which you discharge your duty as an editor peeles works were well deserving of the care you have bestowed upon them and as i did not previously possess a copy of any part of them the beautiful book which you have sent me was very acceptable  by accident i learned lately that you had made a book of extracts which i had long wished for opportunity and industry to execute myself i am happy it has fallen into so much better hands i allude to your selections from the poetry of english ladies i had only a glance at your work but i will take this opportunity of saying that should a second edition be called for i should be pleased with the honour of being consulted by you about it there is one poetess to whose writings i am especially partial the countess of winchelsea i have perused her poems frequently and should be happy to name such passages as i think most characteristic of her genius and most fit to be selected  i know not what to say about my intended edition of a portion of thomson there appears to be some indelicacy in one poet treating another in that way the example is not good though i think there are few to whom the process might be more advantageously applied than to thomson yet so sensible am i of the objection that i should not have entertained the thought but for the expectation held out to me by an acquaintance that valuable materials for a new life of thomson might be procured in this i was disappointed                      with much respect i remain dear sir

1830  my dear sir  my last was for want of room concluded so abruptly that i avail myself of an opportunity of sending you a few additional words free of postage upon the same subject  i observed that lady winchelsea was unfortunate in her modelspindarics and fables nor does it appear from her aristomenes that she would have been more successful than her contemporaries if she had cultivated tragedy she had sensibility sufficient for the tender parts of dramatic writing but in the stormy and tumultuous she would probably have failed altogether she seems to have made it a moral and religious duty to control her feelings lest they should mislead her of love as a passion she is afraid no doubt from a conscious inability to soften it down into friendship i have often applied two lines of her drama p 318 to her affections                           loves soft bands     his gentle cords of hyacinths and roses     wove in the dewy spring when storms are silent  by the by in the next page are two impassioned lines spoken to a person fainting      then let me hug and press thee into life     and lend thee motion from my beating heart  from the style and versification of this so much her longest work i conjecture that lady winchelsea had but a slender acquaintance with the drama of the earlier part of the preceding century yet her style in rhyme is often admirable chaste tender and vigorous and entirely free from sparkle antithesis and that overculture which reminds one by its broad glare its stiffness and heaviness of the double daisies of the garden compared with their modest and sensitive kindred of the fields perhaps i am mistaken but i think there is a good deal of resemblance in her style and versification to that of tickell to whom dr johnson justly assigns a high place among the minor poets and of whom goldsmith rightly observes that there is a strain of balladthinking through all his poetry and it is very attractive pope in that production of his boyhood the ode to solitude and in his essay on criticism has furnished proofs that at one period of his life he felt the charm of a sober and subdued style which he afterwards abandoned for one that is to my taste at least too pointed and ambitious and for a versification too timidly balanced  if a second edition of your specimens should be called for you might add from helen maria williams the sonnet to

may not hear the winds of night     nor count the heavy eavedrops as they fall  you have well characterised the poetic powers of this lady but after all her verses please me with all their faults better than those of mrs barbauld who with much higher powers of mind was spoiled as a poetess by being a dissenter and concerned with a dissenting academy one of the most pleasing passages in her

feeling in a matter so dignified as the renunciation of poetry for science one feels that an apology is necessary for verbal criticism i will therefore content myself with observing that joying for joy or joyance is not to my taste indeed i object to such liberties upon principle we should soon have no language at all if the unscrupulous coinage of the present day were allowed to pass and become a precedent for the future one of the first duties of a writer is to ask himself whether his thought feeling or image cannot be expressed by existing words or phrases before he goes about creating new terms even when they are justified by the analogies of the language the cataracts steep flow is both harsh and inaccurate thou hast seen me bend over the cataract would express one idea in simplicity and all that was required had it been necessary to be more particular steep flow are not the words that ought to have been used i remember campbell says in a composition that is overrun with faulty language and dark as winter was the flow of iser rolling rapidly that is flowing rapidly the expression ought to have been stream or current these may appear to you frigid criticisms but depend upon it no writings will live in which these rules are disregarded  female authorship is to be shunned as bringing in its train more and heavier evils than have presented themselves to your sisters ingenuous mind no true friend i am sure will endeavour to shake her resolution to remain in her own quiet and healthful obscurity this is not said with a view to discourage her from writing nor have the remarks made above any aim of the kind they are rather intended to assist her in writing with more permanent satisfaction to herself she will probably write less in proportion as she subjects her feelings to logical forms but the range of her sensibilities so far from being narrowed will extend as she improves in the habit of looking at things thro a steady light of words and to speak a little metaphysically words are not a mere vehicle but they are powers either to kill or animate106  106 extract of letter to professor hamilton dublin dec 23d 1829  67 his play hone eyesight failing c

punished by selfreproach  i liked your play marvellously having no objection to it but one which strikes me as applicable to a large majority of plays those of shakspeare himself not entirely exceptedi mean a little degradation of character for a more dramatic turn of plot your present of hones book was very acceptable and so much so that your part of the book is the cause why i did not write long ago i wished to enter a little minutely into notice of the dramatic extracts and on account of the smallness of the print deferred doing so till longer days would allow me to read without candlelight which i have long since given up but alas when the days lengthened my eyesight departed and for many months i could not read three minutes at a time you will be sorry to hear that this infirmity still hangs about me and almost cuts me off from reading altogether but how are you and how is your dear sister i long much as we all do to know  for ourselves this last year owing to my sisters dangerous illness the effects of which are not yet got over has been an anxious one and melancholy but no more of this my sister has probably told everything about the family so that i may

summer weather  107 memoirs ii 223  108 on a proposed tour  it appeared with the suddenness of a pantomimic trick stayed longer than we had a right to expect and was as rapidly succeeded by high wind bitter cold and winter snow over hill and dale  i am not surprised that you are so well pleased with mr quillinan the more you see of him the better you will like him you ask what are my employments according to dr johnson they are such as entitle me to high commendation for i am not only making two blades of grass grow where only one grew before but a dozen in plain language i am draining a bit of spungy ground109 in the field where this goes on i am making a green terrace that commands a beautiful view of our two lakes rydal and windermere and more than two miles of intervening vale with

valuable present of websters dramatic works and the specimens111 your publisher was right in insisting upon the whole of webster otherwise the book might have been superseded either by an entire edition separately given to the world or in some corpus of the dramatic writers the poetic genius of england with the exception of chaucer spenser milton dryden pope and a very few more is to be sought in her drama how it grieves one that there is so little probability of those valuable authors being read except by the curious i questioned my friend charles lamb whether it would answer for some person of real taste to undertake abridging the plays that are not likely to be read as wholes and telling such parts of the story in brief abstract as were ill managed in the drama he thought it would not i however am inclined to think it would  109 in the field to the sw below the garden at rydal  110 memoirs ii 224  111 specimens of british poetesses ad  the account of your indisposition gives me much concern it pleases me however to see that though you may suffer your industry does not relax and i hope that your pursuits are rather friendly than injurious to your health  you are quite correct in your notice of my obligation to dr darwin112 in the first edition of the poem it was acknowledged in a note which slipped out of its place in the last along with some others in putting together that edition i was obliged to cut up several copies and as several of the poems also changed their places some confusion and omission and in one instance a repetition was the consequence nothing however so bad as in the edition of 1820 where a long poem the lament of mary queen of scots was by mistake altogether omitted another unpleasantness arose from the same cause for in some instances notwithstanding repeated charges to the printer you have only two spenserian stanzas in a page i speak now of the last edition instead of three and there is the same irregularity in printing other forms of stanza  you must indeed have been fond of that ponderous quarto the excursion to lug it about as you did113 in the edition of 1827 it was diligently revised and the sense in several instances got into less room yet still it is a long poem for these feeble and fastidious times you would honour me much by accepting a copy of my poetical works but i think it better to defer offering it to you till a new edition is called for which will be ere long as i understand the present is getting low  112 in mr ws lines to enterprise ad  113 i had mentioned to mr w that when i had a curacy in cornwall i used frequently to carry the excursion down to the seashore and read it there ad  a word or two about collins you know what importance i attach to following strictly the last copy of the text of an author and i do not blame you for printing in the ode to evening brawling spring but surely the epithet is most unsuitable to the time the very worst i think that could have been chosen  i now come to lady winchelsea first however let me say a few words upon one or two other authoresses of your specimens british poetesses make but a poor figure in the poems by eminent ladies114  114 two volumes 1755 ad  but observing how injudicious that selection is in the case of lady winchelsea and of mrs aphra behn from whose attempts they are miserably copious i have thought something better might have been chosen by more competent persons who had access to the volumes of the several writers in selecting from mrs pilkington i regret that you omitted look at p 255 sorrow or at least that you did not abridge it the first and third paragraph are very affecting see also expostulation p 258 it reminds me strongly of one of the penitential hymns of burns the few lines upon st john the baptist by mrs killigrew vol ii p 6 are pleasing a beautiful elegy of miss warton sister to the poets of that name upon the death of her father has escaped your notice nor can i refer you to it has the duchess of newcastle written much verse her life of her lord and the extracts in your book and in the eminent ladies are all that i have seen of hers the mirth and melancholy has so many fine strokes of imagination that i cannot but think there must be merit in many parts of her writings how beautiful those lines from i dwell in groves to the conclusion yet better loved the more that i am known excepting the four verses after walk up the hills and surely the latter verse of the couplet      the tolling bell which for the dead rings out     a mill where rushing waters run about  is very noticeable no person could have hit upon that union of images without being possessed of true poetic feeling could you tell me anything of lady mary wortley montagu more than is to be learned from popes letters and her own she seems to have been destined for something much higher and better than she became a parallel between her genius and character and that of lady winchelsea her contemporary though somewhat prior to her would be well worth drawing  and now at last for the poems of lady winchelsea i will transcribe a note from a blank leaf of my own edition written by me before i saw the scanty notice of her in walpole by the by that book has always disappointed me when i have consulted it upon any particular occasion the note runs thus the fragment p 280 seems to prove that she was attached to james ii as does p 42 and that she suffered by the revolution the most celebrated of these poems but far from the best is the spleen the petition for an absolute retreat and the nocturnal reverie are of much superior merit see also for favourable specimens p 156 on the death of mr thynne p 263 and p 280 fragment the fable of love death and reputation p 29 is ingeniously told thus far my own note i will now be more particular p 3 our vanity c and p 163 are noticeable as giving some account from herself of her authorship see also p 148 where she alludes to the spleen she was unlucky in her models pindaric odes and french fables but see p 70 the blindness of elymas for proof that she could write with powers of a high order when her own individual character and personal feelings were not concerned for less striking proofs of this power see p 4 all is vanity omitting verses 5 and 6 and reading clouds that are lost and gone c there is merit in the two next stanzas and the last stanza towards the close contains a fine reproof for the ostentation of louis xiv and one magnificent verse      spent the astonished hours forgetful to adore  but my paper is nearly out as far as for my garments p 36 the poem is charming it then falls off revives at p 39 give me there p 41 c reminds me of dyers grongar hill it revives p 47 towards the bottom and concludes with sentiments worthy of the writer though not quite so happily expressed as other parts of the poem see pages 82 92 whilst in the muses paths i stray p 113 the cautious lovers p 118 has little poetic merit but is worth reading as characteristic of the author p 143 deep lines of honour c to maturer age p 151 if shortened would be striking p 154 characteristic p 159 from meanwhile ye living parents to the close omitting nor could we hope and the five following verses p 217 last paragraph p 259 that you have115 pp 262 263 p 280 was lady w a r catholic p 290 and to the clouds

his ministers should have been so infatuated their stupidity not to say their crimes has given an impulse to the revolutionary and democratic spirit throughout europe which is premature and from which much immediate evil may be apprehended whatever things may settle into at last whereas had the government conformed to the increasing knowledge of the people and not surrendered itself to the counsels of the priests and the bigoted royalists things might have been kept in an even course to the mutual improvement and benefit of both governed and governors  in france incompatible things are aimed ata monarchy and democracy to be united without an intervening aristocracy to constitute a graduated scale of power and influence i cannot conceive how an hereditary monarchy can exist without an hereditary peerage in a country so large as france nor how either can maintain their ground if the law of the napoleon code compelling equal division of property by will be not repealed and i understand that a vast majority of the french are decidedly adverse to the repeal of that law which i cannot but think will ere long be found injurious both to france and in its collateral effects to the rest of europe                     ever dear mr gordon                         cordially and faithfully yours                             wm wordsworth  my dear mr gordon  thanks for your hint about rhenish strength from wine is good from water still better                                       one is glad to see tyranny baffled and foolishness put to shame but the french king and his ministers will be unfairly judged by all those who take not into consideration the difficulties of their position it is not to be doubted that there has long existed a determination and that plans have been laid to destroy the government which the french received as they felt at the hands of the allies and their pride could not bear moreover the constitution had it been their own choice would by this time have lost favour in the eyes of the french as not sufficiently democratic for the high notion that people entertain of their fitness to govern themselves but for my own part id rather fill the office of a parish beadle than sit on the throne where the duke of orleans has suffered himself to be placed  the heat is gone and but that we have too much rain again the country would be

the 23d ult but that it had been forwarded to coleorton hall leicestershire where we stopped a week on our road i am truly glad to find that your good spirits put you upon writing what you call nonsense and so much of it but i assure you it all passed with me for very agreeable sense or something better and continues to do so even in this learned spot which you will not be surprised to hear when i tell you that at a dinnerparty the other day i heard a head of a house a clergyman also gravely declare that the rotten boroughs as they are called should instantly be abolished without compensation to their owners that slavery should be destroyed with like disregard of the claims for rights he would allow none of the proprietors and a multitude of extravagances of the same sort therefore say i vive la bagatelle motley is your only wear  117 memoirs ii 2301  you tell me kindly that you have often asked yourself where is mr wordsworth and the question has readily been solved for you he is at cambridge a great mistake so late as the 5th of november i will tell you where i was a solitary equestrian entering the romantic little town of ashford in the waters on the edge of wilds of derbyshire at the close of day when guns were beginning to be left let off and squibs to be fired on every side so that i thought it prudent to dismount and lead my horse through the place and so on to bakewell two miles farther you must know how i happened to be riding through these wild regions it was my wish that dora should have the benefit of her pony while at cambridge and very valiantly and economically i determined unused as i am to horsemanship to ride the creature myself i sent james with it to lancaster there mounted stopped a day at manchester a week at coleorton and so reached the end of my journey safe and sound not however without encountering two days of tempestuous rain thirtyseven miles did i ride in one day through the worse of these storms and what was my resource guess again writing verses to the memory of my departed friend sir george beaumont whose house i had left the day before while buffetting the other storm i composed a sonnet upon the splendid domain at chatsworth which i had seen in the morning as contrasted with the secluded habitations of the narrow dells in the park and as i passed through the tame and manufacturedisfigured country of lancashire i was reminded by the faded leaves of spring and threw off a few stanzas of an ode to may  but too much of self and my own performances upon my steeda descendant no doubt of pegasus though his owner and present rider knew nothing of it now for a word about professor airey i have seen him twice but i did not communicate your message it was at dinner and at an evening party and i thought it best not to speak of it till i saw him which i mean to do upon a morning call  there is a great deal of intellectual activity within the walls of this college and in the university at large but conversation turns mainly upon the state of the country and the late change in the administration the fires have extended to within 8 miles of this place from which i saw one of the worst if not absolutely the worst indicated by a redness in the skya few nights ago  i am glad when i fall in with a member of parliament as it puts me upon writing to my friends which i am always disposed to defer without such a determining advantage at present we have two members mr cavendish one of the representatives of the university and lord morpeth under the masters roof we have also here lady blanche wife of mr cavendish and sister of lord morpeth she is a great admirer of mrs hemans poetry there is an interesting person in this university for a day or two whom i have not yet seenkenelm digby author of the broadstone of honor a book of chivalry which i think was put into your hands at rydal mount we have also a respectable show of blossom in poetry two brothers of the name of tennison in particular are not a little promising of science i can give you no account though perhaps i may pick up something for a future letter which may be long in coming for reasons before mentioned mrs w and my daughter of whom you inquire are both well the latter rides as often as weather and regard for the age of her pony will allow she has resumed her german labours and is not easily drawn from what she takes to therefore i hope miss hamilton will not find fault if she does not write for some time as she will readily conceive that with this passion upon her and many engagements she will be rather averse to writing in fact she owes a long letter to her brother in germany who by the bye tells us that he will not cease to look out for the book of kant you wished for farewell with a thousand kind remembrances to yourself and sister and the rest of your amiable family in which mrs w and dora join                     believe me most faithfully yours

before my return from scotland arrived your letter and verses for both of which i thank you as they exhibit your mind under those varied phases which i have great pleasure in contemplating my reply is earlier than it would have been but for the opportunity of a frank from one of the members for the university of oxforda friend of mr southeys and mine who by way of recreating himself after the fatigues of the last session had taken a trip to see the manchester railway and kindly and most unexpectedly came on to give a day apiece to southey and me he is like myself in poor heart at the aspect of public affairs in his opinion the ministers when they brought in the bill neither expected nor wished it to be carried all they wanted was an opportunity of saying to the people behold what great things we would have done for you had it been in our power we must now content ourselves with the best we can get but to return to your letter to speak frankly you appear to be at least threefourths gone in love therefore think about the last quarter in the journey the picture you give of the lady makes one wish to see her more familiarly than i had an opportunity of doing were it only to ascertain whether as you astronomers have in your observatories magnifying glasses for the stars you do not carry about with you also when you descend to common life coloured glasses and claude loraine mirrors for throwing upon objects that interest you enough for the purpose such lights and hues as may be most to the taste of the intellectual vision in a former letter you mention francis edgeworth he is a person not to be forgotten if you be in communication with him pray present him my very kind respects and say that he was not unfrequently in my thoughts during my late poetic rambles and particularly when i saw the objects which called forth a sonnet that i shall send you he was struck with my mention of a sound in the eagles notes much and frequently resembling the yelping and barking of a dog and quoted a passage in eschylus where the eagle is called the flying hound of the air and he suggested that eschylus might not only allude by that term to his being a bird of chase or prey but also to this barking voice which i do not recollect ever hearing noticed the other day i was forcibly reminded of the circumstances under which the pair of eagles were seen that i described in the letter to mr edgeworth his brother it was the promontory of fairhead on the coast of antrim and no spectacle could be grander at dunally castle a ruin seated at the tip of one of the horns of the bay of oban i saw the other day one of these noble creatures cooped up among the ruins and was incited to give vent to my feelings as you shall now see      dishonoured rock and ruin that by law     tyrannic keep the bird of jove imbarred     like a lone criminal whose life is spared     vexed is he and screams loudthe last i saw     was on the wing and struck my soul with awe     now wheeling low then with a consort paired     from a bold headland their loved aerys guard     flying above atlantic wavesto draw     light from the fountain of the setting sun     such was this prisoner once and when his plumes     the seablast ruffles as the storm comes on     in spirit for a moment he resumes     his rank mong freeborn creatures that live free     his power his beauty and his majesty  you will naturally wish to hear something of sir walter scott and particularly of his health i found him a good deal changed within the last three or four years in consequence of some shocks of the apoplectic kind but his friends say that he is very much better and the last accounts up to the time of his going on board were still more favourable he himself thinks his age much against him but he has only completed his 60th year but a friend of mine was here the other day who has rallied and is himself again after a much severer shock and at an age several years more advanced so that i trust the world and his friends may be hopeful with good reason that the life and faculties of this man who has during the last six and twenty years diffused more innocent pleasure than ever fell to the lot of any human being to do in his own lifetime may be spared voltaire no doubt was full as extensively known and filled a larger space probably in the eye of europe for he was a great theatrical writer which scott has not proved himself to be and miscellaneous to that degree that there was something for all classes of readers but the pleasure afforded by his writings with the exception of some of his tragedies and minor poems was not pure and in this scott is greatly his superior  as dora has told your sister sir w was our guide to yarrow the pleasure of that day induced me to add a third to the two poems upon yarrow yarrow revisited it is in the same measure and as much in the same spirit as matter of fact would allow you are artist enough to know that it is next to impossible entirely to harmonise things that rest upon their poetic credibility and are idealised by distance of time and space with those that rest upon the evidence of the hour and have about them the thorny points of actual life i am interrupted by a stranger and a gleam of fine weather reminds me also of taking advantage of it the moment i am at liberty for we have had a week of

in congratulating me on my late ramble in scotland i set off with a severe inflammation in one of my eyes which was removed by being so much in the open air and for more than a month i scarcely saw a newspaper or heard of their contents during this time we almost forgot my daughter and i the deplorable state of the country my spirits rallied and with exercisefor i often walked scarcely less than twenty miles a dayand the employment of composing verses amid scenery the most beautiful and at a season when the foliage was most rich and varied the time flew away delightfully and when we came back into the world again it seemed as if i had waked from a dream that never was to return we travelled in an open carriage with one horse driven by dora and while we were in the highlands i walked most of the way by the side of the carriage which left us leisure to observe the beautiful appearances the rainbows and coloured mists floating about the hills were more like enchantment than anything i ever saw even among the alps there was in particular the day we made the tour of loch lomond in the steamboat a fragment of a rainbow so broad so splendid so glorious with its reflection in the calm water it astonished every one on board a party of foreigners especially who could not refrain from expressing their pleasure in a more lively manner than we are accustomed to do my object in going to scotland so late in the season was to see sir walter scott before his departure we stayed with him three days and he quitted abbotsford the day after we left it his health has undoubtedly been much shattered by successive shocks of apoplexy but his friends say he is so much recovered that they entertain good hopes of his life and faculties being spared mr lockhart tells me that he derived benefit by a change of his treatment made by his london physicians and that he embarked in good spirits  as to public affairs i have no hope but in the goodness of almighty god the lords have recovered much of the credit they had lost by their conduct in the roman catholic question as an englishman i am deeply grateful for the stand which they have made but i cannot help fearing that they may be seduced or intimidated our misfortune is that the disapprovers of this monstrous bill give way to a belief that nothing can prevent its being passed and therefore they submit  as to the cholera i cannot say it appals me much it may be in the order of providence to employ this scourge for bringing the nation to its senses though history tells us in the case of the plague at athens and other like visitations that men are never so wicked and depraved as when afflictions of that kind are upon them so that after all one must come round to our only support submission to the will of god and faith in the ultimate goodness of his dispensations  i am sorry you did not mention your son in whose health and welfare and progress in his studies i am always much interested pray remember me kindly

before he quitted abbotsford for london on his way to naples on the morning of our departure he composed a few lines for doras album and wrote them in it we prize this memorial very much and the more

of the 26th of nov had been misdirected to penrith where the postmaster detained it some time expecting probably that i should come to that place which i have often occasion to visit when it reached me i was engaged in assisting my wife to make out some of my mangled and almost illegible mss which inevitably involved me in endeavours to correct and improve them my eyes are subject to frequent inflammations of which i had an attack and am still suffering from it while that was going on you would nevertheless have heard from me almost as soon as i received your letter could i have replied to it in terms in any degree accordant to my wishes your exhortations troubled me in a way you cannot be in the least aware of for i have been repeatedly urged by some of my most valued friends and at times by my own conscience to undertake the task you have set before me but i will deal frankly with you a conviction of my incompetence to do justice to the momentous subject has kept me and i fear will keep me silent my sixtysecond year will soon be completed and though i have been favoured thus far in health and strength beyond most men of my age yet i feel its effects upon my spirits they sink under a pressure of apprehension to which at an earlier period of my life they would probably have been superior there is yet another obstacle i am no ready master of prose writing having been little practised in the art this last consideration will not weigh with you nor would it have done with myself a few years ago but the bare mention of it will serve to show that years have deprived me of courage in the sense the word bears when applied by chaucer to the animation of birds in spring time  what i have already said precludes the necessity of otherwise confirming your assumption that i am opposed to the spirit you so justly characterise122 to your opinions upon this subject my judgment if i may borrow your own word responds providence is now trying this empire through her political institutions sound minds find their expediency in principles unsound their principles in expediency on the proportion of these minds to each other the issue depends from calculations of partial expediency in opposition to general principles whether those calculations be governed by fear or presumption nothing but mischief is to be looked for but in the present stage of our affairs the class that does the most harm consists of wellintentioned men who being ignorant of human nature think that they may help the thoroughpaced reformers and revolutionists to a certain point then stop and that the machine will stop with them after all the question is fundamentally one of piety and morals of piety as disposing men who are anxious for social improvement to wait patiently for gods good time and of morals as guarding them from doing evil that good may come or thinking that any ends can be so good as to justify wrong means for attaining them in fact means in the concerns of this life are infinitely more important than ends which are to be valued mainly according to the qualities and virtues requisite for their attainment and the best test of an end being good is the purity of the means which by the laws of god and our nature must be employed in order to secure it even the interests of eternity become distorted the moment they are looked at through the medium of impure means scarcely had i written this when i was told by a person in the treasury that it is intended to carry the reform bill by a new creation of peers if this be done the constitution of england will be destroyed and the present lord chancellor after having contributed to murder it may consistently enough pronounce in his place its éloge funèbre  122 as revolutionary  i turn with pleasure to the sonnets you have addressed to me and if i did not read them with unqualified satisfaction it was only from consciousness that i was unworthy of the enconiums they bestowed upon me  among the papers i have lately been arranging are passages that would prove as forcibly as anything of mine that has been published you were not mistaken in your supposition that it is the habit of my mind inseparably to connect loftiness of imagination with that humility of mind which is best taught in scripture  hoping that you will be indulgent to my silence which has been from various causes protracted contrary to my wish                     believe me to be dear sir                        very faithfully yours                         wm wordsworth123  123 memoirs ii 2524   76 of poetry and prose milton and shakspeare reform c  letter to professor hamilton dublin                     nov 22 1831  my dear mr hamilton  you send me showers of verses which i receive with much pleasure as do we all yet have we fears that this employment may seduce you from the path of science which you seem destined to tread with so much honour to yourself and profit to others again and again i must repeat that the composition of verse is infinitely more of an art than men are prepared to believe and absolute success in it depends upon innumerable minutiae which it grieves me you should stoop to acquire a knowledge of milton talks of pouring easy his unpremeditated verse it would be harsh untrue and odious to say there is anything like cant in this but it is not true to the letter and tends to mislead i could point out to you five hundred passages in milton upon which labour has been bestowed and twice five hundred more to which additional labour would have been serviceable not that i regret the absence of such labour because no poem contains more proofs of skill acquired by practice these observations are not called out by any defects or imperfections in your last pieces especially they are equal to the former ones in effect have many beauties and are not inferior in execution but again i do venture to submit to your consideration whether the poetical parts of your nature would not find a field more favourable to their exercise in the regions of prose not because those regions are humbler but because they may be gracefully and profitably trod with footsteps less careful and in measures less elaborate and now i have done with the subject and have only to add that when you write verses you would not fail from time to time to let me have a sight of them provided you will allow me to defer criticism on your diction and versification till we meet my eyes are so often useless both for reading and writing that i cannot tax the eyes and pens of others with writing down observations which to indifferent persons must be tedious  upon the whole i am not sorry that your project of going to london at present is dropped it would have grieved me had you been unfurnished with an introduction from me to mr coleridge yet i know not how i could have given you onehe is often so very unwell a few weeks ago he had had two attacks of cholera and appears to be so much broken down that unless i were assured he was something in his better way i could not disturb him by the introduction of any one his most intimate friend is mr green a man of science and a distinguished surgeon if to him you could procure an introduction he would let you know the state of coleridges health and to mr green whom i once saw you might use my name with a view to further your wish if it were at all needful  shakspeares sonnets excuse this leap are not upon the italian model which miltons are they are merely quatrains with a couplet tacked to the end and if they depended much upon the versification they would unavoidably be heavy  one word upon reform in parliament a subject to which somewhat reluctantly you allude you are a reformer are you an approver of the bill as rejected by the lords or to use lord greys words anything as efficienthe means if he means anything for producing change then i earnestly entreat you to devote hours and hours to the study of human nature in books in life and in your own mind and beg and pray that you would mix with society not in ireland and scotland only but in england a fount of destiny which if once poisoned away goes all hope of quiet progress in well doing the constitution of england which seems about to be destroyed offers to my mind the sublimest contemplation which the history of society and government have ever presented to it and for this cause especially that its principles have the character of preconceived ideas archetypes of the pure intellect while they are in fact the results of a humbleminded experience think about this apply it to what we are threatened with and farewell  wm wordsworth124   77 of the reform bill  extract of letter to lord lonsdale                     rydal mount feb 17 1832  my lord

though with my eyes open to the great hazard of doing so my support however would be found in standing by a great principle for without being unbecomingly personal i may state to your lordship that it has ever been the habit of my mind to trust that expediency will come out of fidelity to principles rather than to seek my principles of action in calculations of expediency  124 memoirs ii 2557 with

state of public affairs has troubled me much i cannot see how the government is to be carried on but by such sacrifices to the democracy as will sooner or later upset everything whoever governs it will be by outbidding for popular favour those who went before them sir robert peel was obliged to give way in his government to the spirit of reform as it is falsely called these men are going beyond him and if ever he shall come back it will only i fear be to carry on the movement in a shape somewhat less objectionable than it will take from the whigs in the mean while the radicals or republicans are cunningly content to have this work done ostensibly by the whigs while in fact they themselves are the whigs masters as the whigs well know but they hope to be preserved from destruction by throwing themselves back upon the tories when measures shall be urged upon them by their masters which they may think too desperate what i am most afraid of is alterations in the constituency and in the duration of parliament which will bring it more and more under the dominion of the lower and lowest classes on this account i fear the proposed corporation reform as a step towards household

this illness it will be a profound consolation to you my dear brother and to us all that it is borne with perfect resignation and that her thoughts are such as the good and pious would wish she reads much both religious and miscellaneous works  if you see mr watson remember me affectionately to him  i was so distressed with the aspect of public affairs that were it not for our dear sisters illness

written to you long since but really i have for some time from private and public causes of sorrow and apprehension been in a great measure deprived of those genial feelings which thro life have not been so much accompaniments of my character as vital principles of my existence  my dear sister has been languishing more than seven months in a sickroom nor dare i or any of her friends entertain a hope that her strength will ever be restored and the course of public affairs as i think i told you before threatens in my view destruction to the institutions of the country an event which whatever may rise out of it hereafter cannot but produce distress and misery for two or three generations at least in any times i am but at best a poor and unpunctual correspondent yet i am pretty sure you would have heard from me but for this reason therefore let the statement pass for an apology as far as you think fit  the verses called forth by your love and the disappointment that followed i have read with much pleasure tho grieved that you should have suffered so much as poetry they derive an interest from your philosophical pursuits which could not but recommend the verses even to indifferent readers and must give them in the eyes of your friends a great charm the style appears to me good and the general flow of the versification harmonious but you deal somewhat more in dactylic endings and identical terminations than i am accustomed to think legitimate sincerely do i congratulate you upon being able to continue your philosophical pursuits under such a pressure of personal feeling  it gives me much pleasure that you and coleridge have met and that you were not disappointed in the conversation of a man from whose writings you had previously drawn so much delight and improvement he and my beloved sister are the two beings to whom my intellect is most indebted and they are now proceeding as it were pari passu along the path of sickness i will not say towards the grave but i trust towards a blessed immortality  it was not my intention to write so seriously my heart is full and you must excuse it  you do not tell me how you like cambridge as a place nor what you thought of its buildings and other works of art did you not see oxford as well surely you would not lose the opportunity it has greatly the advantage over cambridge in its happy intermixture of streets churches and collegiate buildings  i hope you found time when in london to visit the british museum  a fortnight ago i came hither to my son and daughter who are living a gentle happy quiet and useful life together my daughter dora is also with us on this day i should have returned but an inflammation in my eyes makes it unsafe for me to venture in an open carriage the weather being exceedingly disturbed  a week ago appeared here mr ws landor the poet and author of the imaginary conversations which probably have fallen in your way we had never met before tho several letters had passed between us and as i had not heard that he was in england my gratification in seeing him was heightened by surprise we passed a day together at the house of my friend mr rawson on the banks of wastwater his conversation is lively and original his learning great tho he will not allow it and his laugh the heartiest i have heard of a long time it is not much less than twenty years since he left england for france and afterwards italy where he hopes to end his days nay he has fixed near florence upon the spot where he wishes to be buried remember me most kindly to your sisters dora begs her love and thanks to your sister eliza for her last most interesting letter which she will answer when she can command a frank                     ever faithfully yours                         wm

tedious apologies for not answering your very kind and welcome letter long and long ago i received it in london when my mind was in a most uneasy state and when my eyes were useless both for writing and reading so that an immediate reply was out of my power and since i have been doubtful where to address you accept this and something better as my excuse that i have very often thought of you with kindness and good wishes for your welfare and that of your fine boys who must recommend themselves to all that come in their way let me thank you in doras name for your present of the remains of lucretia davidson a very extraordinary young creature of whom i had before read some account in mr southeys review of this volume surely many things not often bestowed must concur to make genius an enviable gift this truth is painfully forced upon ones attention in reading the effusions and story of this enthusiast hurried to her grave so early you have i understand been a good deal in dublin the place i hope has less of the fever of intellectual or rather literary ambition than edinburgh and is less disquieted by factions and cabals of persons as to those of parties they must be odious and dreadful enough but since they have more to do with religion the adherents of the different creeds perhaps mingle little together and so the mischief to social intercourse though great will be somewhat less  i am not sure but that miss jewsbury has judged well in her determination of going to india europe is at present a melancholy spectacle and these two islands are likely to reap the fruit of their own folly and madness in becoming for the present generation the two most unquiet and miserable spots upon the earth may you my dear friend find the advantage of the poetic spirit in raising you in thought at least above the contentious clouds never before did i feel such reason to be grateful for what little inspiration heaven has graciously bestowed upon my humble intellect what you kindly wrote upon the interest you took during your travels in my verses could not but be grateful to me because your own show that in a rare degree you understand and sympathise with me we are all well god be thanked i am a wretched correspondent as this scrawl abundantly shows i know also that you have far too much both of receiving and writing letters but i cannot conclude without expressing a wish that from time to time you would let us hear from you and yours and how you prosper all join with me in kindest remembrance to yourself and your boys especially to charles of whom we know most believe me dear mrs hemans not the less for my long silence  faithfully and affectionately yours  wm wordsworth129   82 tuition at the university  letter to a nephew  rydal mount june 17

i have only one observation to make to which i should attach importance if i thought it called for in your case which i do not i mean the moral duty of avoiding to encumber yourself with private pupils in any number you are at an age when the blossoms of the mind are setting to make fruit and the practice of pupilmongering is an absolute blight for this process whatever determination you come to may god grant that it proves for your benefit this prayer i utter with earnestness being deeply interested my dear c in all that concerns you i have said nothing of the uncertainty hanging over all the establishments especially the religious and literary ones of the country because if they are to be overturned the calamity would be so widely spread that every mode of life would be involved in it and nothing survive for hopeful calculation  129 memoirs ii 2612  we are always delighted to hear of any or all of you god bless you my dear c                     most faithfully your affectionate

am afraid you will think me very unworthy the trouble you took in writing to us and sending your pamphlet a thousand little things have occurred to prevent my calling upon mrs wordsworth who is ever ready to write for me in respect to the question that you have so ably handled since the night when the reform bill was first introduced i have been convinced that the institutions of the country cannot be preserved it is a mere question of time a great majority of the present parliament i believe are in the main favourable to the preservation of the church but among these many are ignorant how that is to be done add to the portion of those who with good intentions are in the dark the number who will be driven or tempted to vote against their consciences by the clamour of their sectarian and infidel constituents under the reform bill and you will have a daily augmenting power even in this parliament which will be more and more hostile to the church every week and every day you will see from the course which my letter thus far has taken that i regard the prayer of the petitioners to whom you are opposed as formidable still more from the effect which if granted it will ultimately have upon the church and through that medium upon the monarchy and upon social order than for its immediate tendency to introduce discord in the universities and all those deplorable consequences which you have so feelingly painted as preparatory to their destruction  i am not yet able to use my eyes for reading or writing but your pamphlet has been twice read to me  god bless you

suspect some private cause of dislike such as is said to have influenced swift in regard to dryden himself  132 memoirs ii 2745  shirleys death reminded me of a sad close of the life of a literary person sanderson by name in the neighbouring county of cumberland he lived in a cottage by himself though a man of some landed estate his cottage from want of care on his part took fire in the night the neighbours were alarmed they ran to his rescue he escaped dreadfully burned from the flames and lay down he was in his seventieth year much exhausted under a tree a few yards from the door his friends in the meanwhile endeavoured to save what they could of his property from the flames he inquired most anxiously after a box in which his manuscripts and published pieces had been deposited with a view to a publication of a laboriouslycorrected edition and upon being told that the box was consumed he expired in a few minutes saying or rather sighing out the words then i do not wish to live poor man though the circulation of his works had not extended beyond a circle of fifty miles diameter perhaps at furthest he was most anxious to survive in the memory of the few who were likely to hear of him  the publishing trade i understand continues to be much depressed and authors are driven to solicit or invite subscriptions as being in many cases the only means for giving their works

overscrupulous modesty i could object to it  135 memoirs ii 2778  136 i had requested permission to dedicate a little book specimens of english sonnets to mr w ad  be assured that mr southey will not have the slightest unwillingness to your making any use you think proper of his memoir of bampfylde i shall not fail to mention the subject to him upon the first opportunity  you propose to give specimens of the best sonnetwriters in our language may i ask if by this be meant a selection of the best sonnets best both as to kind and degree a sonnet may be excellent in its kind but that kind of very inferior interest to one of a higher order though not perhaps in every minute particular quite so well executed and from the pen of a writer of inferior genius it should seem that the best rule to follow would be first to pitch upon the sonnets which are best both in kind and perfectness of execution and next those which although of a humbler quality are admirable for the finish and happiness of the execution taking care to exclude all those which have not one or other of these recommendations however striking they might be as characteristic of the age in which the author lived or some peculiarity of his manner the 10th sonnet of donne beginning death be not proud is so eminently characteristic of his manner and at the same time so weighty in the thought and vigorous in the expression that i would entreat you to insert it though to modern taste it may be repulsive quaint and laboured there are two sonnets of russell which in all probability you may have noticed could then the babes and the one upon philoctetes the last six lines of which are firstrate southeys sonnet to winter pleases me much but above all among modern writers that of sir egerton brydges upon echo and silence miss williamss sonnet upon twilight is pleasing that upon hope of great merit  do you mean to have a short preface upon the construction of the sonnet though i have written so many i have scarcely made up my own mind upon the subject it should seem that the sonnet like every other legitimate composition ought to have a beginning a middle and an end in other words to consist of three parts like the three propositions of a syllogism if such an illustration may be used but the frame of metre adopted by the italians does not accord with this view and as adhered to by them it seems to be if not arbitrary best fitted to a division of the sense into two parts of eight and six lines each milton however has not submitted to this in the better half of his sonnets the sense does not close with the rhyme at the eighth line but overflows into the second portion of the metre now it has struck me that this is not done merely to gratify the ear by variety and freedom of sound but also to aid in giving that pervading sense of intense unity in which the excellence of the sonnet has always seemed to me mainly to consist instead of looking at this composition as a piece of architecture making a whole out of three parts i have been much in the habit of preferring the image of an orbicular bodya sphere or a dewdrop all this will appear to you a little fanciful and i am well aware that a sonnet will often be found excellent where the beginning the middle and the end are distinctly marked and also where it is distinctly separated into two parts to which as i before observed the strict italian model as they write it is favourable of this last construction of sonnet russells upon philoctetes is a fine specimen the first eight lines give the hardship of the case the six last

most pathetic circumstance while he was lying under the tree and his friends were saving what they could from the flames he desired them to bring out the box that contained his papers if possible a person went back for it but the bottom dropped out and the papers fell into the flames and were consumed immediately upon hearing this the poor old man expired137   89 the poems of lady winchelsea

obliging letter till i could procure a frank as i had little more to say than to thank you for your attention to lady winchelsea138 and for the extracts you sent me  137 memoirs ii 27881  138 ie to mr ws request that i would if possible furnish him with some particulars about her ad  i expected to find at this place my friend lady frederick bentinck through whom i intended to renew my request for materials if any exist among the finch family whether manuscript poems or anything else that would be interesting but lady f unluckily is not likely to be in westmoreland i shall however write to her without some additional materials i think i should scarcely feel strong enough to venture upon any species of publication connected with this very interesting woman notwithstanding the kind things you say of the value of my critical remarks  i am glad you have taken skelton in hand and much wish i could be of any use to you in regard to his life i am certain of having read somewhere i thought it was in burnss history of cumberland and westmoreland but i am mistaken that skelton was born at branthwaite hall in the county of cumberland certain it is that a family of that name possessed the place for many generations and i own it would give me some pleasure to make out that skelton was a brother cumbrian branthwaite hall is about six miles from cockermouth my native place tickell of the spectator one of the best of our minor poets as johnson has truly said was born within two miles of the same town these are mere accidents it is true but i am foolish enough to attach some interest to them  if it would be more agreeable to you i would mention your views in respect to skelton to mr southey i should have done so before but it slipped my memory when i saw him mr southey is undoubtedly much engaged but i cannot think that he would take ill a letter from you on any literary subject at all events i shall in a few days mention your intention of editing skelton and ask if he has anything to suggest  i meditate a little tour in scotland this autumn my principal object being to visit sir walter scott but as i take my daughter along with me we probably shall go to edinburgh glasgow and take a peep at the western highlands this will not bring us near aberdeen139 if it suited you to return to town by the lakes i should be truly glad to see you at rydal mount near ambleside you might at all events call on mr southey in your way i would prepare an introduction for you by naming your intention to mr s i have added this because my scotch tour would i fear make it little likely that i should be at home about the 10th september your return however may be deferred                     believe me my dear sir                     very respectfully your obliged

genuine relish for poetical publications in cumberland if i may judge from the fact of not a copy of my poems having been sold there by one of the leading booksellers though cumberland is my native county byron and scott are i am persuaded the only popular writers in that lineperhaps the word ought rather to be that they are fashionable writers  my poor sister is something better in health pray remember me very affectionately to charles lamb and to his dear sister if she be in a state to receive such communications from her friends i hope mr rogers is well give my kindest regards to him also

the rev alexander dyce  rydal mount dec 4 1833  my dear sir   your elegant volume of sonnets142 which you did me the honour to dedicate to me was received a few months after the date of the accompanying letter and the copy for mr southey was forwarded immediately as you may have learned long ago by a letter from himself supposing you might not be returned from scotland i have deferred offering my thanks for this mark of your attention and about the time when i should otherwise probably have written i was seized with an inflammation in my eyes from the effects of which i am not yet so far recovered as to make it prudent for me to use them in writing or reading143  141 memoirs ii 283  142 specimens of english sonnets ad  143 this letter is in the handwriting of miss d wordsworth but signed by mr w ad  the selection of sonnets appears to me to be very judicious if i were inclined to make an exception it would be in the single case of the sonnet of coleridge upon schiller which is too much of a rant for my taste the one by him upon linleys music is much superior in execution indeed as a strain of feeling and for unity of effect it is very happily done i was glad to see mr southeys sonnet to winter a lyrical poem of my own upon the disasters of the french army in russia has so striking a resemblance to it in contemplating winter under two aspects that in justice to mr southey who preceded me i ought to have acknowledged it in a note and i shall do so upon some future occasion  how do you come on with skelton and is there any prospect of a new edition of your specimens of british poetesses if i could get at the original works of the elder poetesses such as the duchess of newcastle mrs behn orinda c i should be happy to assist you with my judgment in such a publication which i think might be made still more interesting than this first edition especially if more matter were crowded into a page the two volumes of poems by eminent ladies helen maria williamss works mrs smiths sonnets and lady winchelseas poems form the scanty materials which i possess for assisting such a publication  it is a remarkable thing that the two best ballads perhaps of modern times viz auld robin grey and the lament for the defeat of the scots at floddenfield are both from the pens of females  i shall be glad to hear that your health is improved and your spirits good so that the world may continue to be benefited by your judicious and tasteful labours  pray let me hear from you at your leisure and believe me dear sir                     very faithfully yours                            w wordsworth  ps it is a pity that mr hartley coleridges sonnets had not been published before your collection was made as there are several well worthy of a place in it last midsummer i made a fortnights tour in the isle of man staffa iona c which produced between thirty and forty sonnets some of which i think would please you  could not you contrive to take the lakes in your way sometimes to or from scotland i need not say how glad i should be to see you for a few days  what a pity that mr hebers wonderful collection of books is about to be dispersed144  144 memoirs

you intended as a dedication of your poems to me i need scarcely say that as a private letter such expressions from such a quarter could not have been received by me but with pleasure of no ordinary kind unchecked by any consideration but the fear that my writings were overrated by you and my character thought better of than it deserved but i must say that a public testimony in so high a strain of admiration is what i cannot but shrink from be this modesty true or false it is in me you must bear with it and make allowance for it and therefore as you have submitted the whole to my judgment i am emboldened to express a wish that you would instead of this dedication in which your warm and kind heart has overpowered you simply inscribe them to me with such expression of respect or gratitude as would come within the limits of the rule which after what has been said above will naturally suggest itself of course if the sheet has been struck off i must hope that my shoulders may become a little more atlantean than i now feel them to be  my sister is not quite so well she mrs w and dora all unite with me in best wishes and kindest remembrances to yourself and yours and

gomm                     rydal mount april 16 1834  my dear sir  your verses for which i sincerely thank you are an additional proof of the truth which forced from me many years ago the exclamation o many are the poets that are sown by nature146 the rest of that paragraph also has some bearing upon your position in the poetical world the thoughts and images through both the poems and the feelings also are eminently such as become their several subjects but it would be insincerity were i to omit adding that there is here and there a want of that skill in workmanship which i believe nothing but continued practice in the art can bestow i have used the word art from a conviction which i am called upon almost daily to express that poetry is infinitely more of an art than the world is disposed to believe nor is this any dishonour to it both for the reason that the poetic faculty is not rarely bestowed and for this cause also that men would not be disposed to ascribe so much to inspiration if they did not feel how near and dear to them poetry is  146 excursion book i  with sincere regards and best wishes to yourself and lady gomm                     believe me to be very sincerely yours

of the opportunity of mr gravess return to acknowledge the honour you have done me in prefixing my name to your volume of beautiful poems and to thank you for the copy you have sent me with your own autograph where there is so much to admire it is difficult to select and therefore i shall content myself with naming only two or three pieces and first let me particularise the piece that stands second in the volume flowers and music in a sick room this was especially touching to me on my poor sisters account who has long been an invalid confined almost to her chamber the feelings are sweetly touched throughout this poem and the imagery very beautiful above all in the passage where you describe the colour of the petals of the wild rose this morning i have read the stanzas upon elysium with great pleasure you have admirably expanded the thought of chateaubriand if we had not been disappointed in our expected pleasure of seeing you here i should have been tempted to speak of many other passages and poems with which i have been delighted  your health i hope148 is by this time reëstablished your son charles looks uncommonly well and we have had the pleasure of seeing him and his friends several times but as you are aware we are much engaged with visitors at this season of the year so as not always to be able to follow our inclinations as to whom we would wish to see i cannot conclude without thanking you for your sonnet upon a place so dear to me as grasmere it is worthy of the subject with kindest remembrances in which unite mrs w my sister and dora i remain dear mrs hemans                     your much obliged friend                       wm wordsworth  i have written very hastily to spare my eyes a liberty which you will excuse149  148 this hope alas was not realised mrs hemans died in the following year may 16 1835  149 memoirs ii 2912   95 of the church of england c  letter to the venerable archdeacon wrangham                     rydal mount feb 2 1835  my dear wrangham  sincere thanks are due from me for the attention you paid to mrs ws letter written during my absence you know the favourable opinion i entertain of mr graves and i was under a promise to let him know if any vacancy occurred in the neighbourhood and to do all i could without infringing upon prior or stronger claims to promote the attainment of his wishes                                       the mind of every thinking man who is attached to the church of england must at this time be especially turned to reflections upon all points of ecclesiastical polity government and management which may tend to strengthen the establishment in the affections of the people and enlarge the sphere of its efficiency it cannot then i feel be impertinent in me though a layman to express upon this occasion my satisfaction qualified as it is by what has been said above in finding from this instance that our diocesan is unwilling to station clergymen in cures with which they are locally connected some years ago when the present bishop of london then of chester was residing in this neighbourhood i took the liberty of strenuously recommending to him not to ordain young men to curacies where they had been brought up or in the midst of their own relatives i had seen too much of the mischief of this especially as affecting the functions and characters of ministers born and bred up in the lower classes of society it has been painful to me to observe the false position as the french would call it in which men so placed are their habits their manners and their talk their acquaintanceships their friendships and let me say their domestic affections naturally and properly draw them one way while their professional obligations point out another and accordingly if they are sensible of both they live in a perpetual conflict and are liable to be taxed with pride and ingratitude as seeming to neglect their old friends when they only associate with them with that reserve and under those restraints which their sacred profession enjoins if on the other hand they fall into unrestrained familiarity with the associates of their earlier life and boyish days how injurious to their ministry such intercourse would be must flash upon every mans mind whose thoughts have turned for a moment to the subject allow me to add a word upon the allimportant matter of testimonials the case of the rector of  and of  presses it closely upon my mind had the individuals who signed those documents been fitly impressed with the awfullness of the act they were about to engage in they could not have undertaken it would it not be a good plan for bishops to exclude testimonials from relatives and near connections it is painful to notice what a tendency there is in mens minds to allow even a slight call of private regard to outweigh a very strong claim of duty to the public and not less in sacred concerns than in civil  your hands my dear friend have failed as well as my eyes so that we are neither of us in very flourishing trim for active correspondence be assured however i participate the feelings you express last year has robbed me of coleridge of charles lamb james losh rudd of trinity fleming just gone and other schoolfellows and contemporaries i cannot forget that shakspeare who scarcely survived fifty i am now near the close of my sixtyfifth year wrote      in me that time of life thou dost behold     when yellow leaves or few or none do hang     upon the bough  how much more reason have we to break out into such a strain let me hear from you from time to time

          with your omnipresence of the deity151 i was acquainted long ago having read it and other parts of your writings with much pleasure though with some abatement such as you yourself seem sufficiently aware of and which in the works of so young a writer were by me gently judged and in many instances regarded though in themselves faults as indications of future excellence in your letter for which also i thank you you allude to your preface and desire to know if my opinion concurs with yours on the subject of sacred poetry that preface has been read to me and i can answer in the affirmative but at the same time allow me frankly to tell you that what most pleased me in that able composition is to be found in the few concluding paragraphs beginning it is now seven years since c  151 mr montgomery informed the now bishop of lincoln that this poem when forwarded to wordsworth was not in the condition in which it is now but that it had been almost rewritten and was also his earliest poemcomposed when he was nineteen g                                       i cannot conclude without one word of literary advice which i hope you will deem my advanced age entitles me to give do not my dear sir be anxious about any individuals opinion concerning your writings however highly you may think of his genius or rate his judgment be a severe critic to yourself and depend upon it no persons decision upon the merit of your works will bear comparison in point of value with your own you must be conscious from what feeling they have flowed and how far they may or may not be allowed to claim on that account permanent respect and above all i would remind you with a view to tranquillise and steady your mind that no man takes the trouble of surveying and pondering anothers writings with a hundredth part of the care which an author of sense and genius will have bestowed upon his own add to this reflection another which i press upon you as it has supported me through life viz that posterity will settle all accounts justly and that works which deserve to last will last and if undeserving this fate the sooner they perish the better                     believe me to be faithfully                        your much obliged                            w wordsworth152  152 memoirs ii 2946   97 a new church at cockermouth  letter to james stanger esq  my dear sir  the obstacle arising out of conflicting opinions in regard to the patronage one must be prepared for in every project of this kind mutual givingway is indispensable and i hope it will not ultimately be wanting in this case  the point immediately to be attended to is the raising a sufficient sum to insure from the church building societies a portion of the surplus fund which they have at command and which i know on account of claims from many places they are anxious to apply as speedily as possible if time be lost that sum will be lost to cockermouth  in the question of the patronage as between the bishop and the people i entirely concur with you in preference of the former such is now the force of public opinion that bishops are not likely to present upon merely selfish considerations and if the judgment of one be not good that of his successor may make amends and probably will but elections of this sort when vested in the inhabitants have as far as my experience goes given rise to so many cabals and manoeuvres and caused such enmities and heartburnings that christian charity has been driven out of sight by them and how often and how soon have the successful party been seen to repent of their own choice  the course of public affairs being what it is in respect to the church i cannot reconcile myself to delay from a hope of succeeding at another time if we can get a new church erected at cockermouth great will be the benefit with the blessing of god to that place and our success cannot i trust but excite some neighbouring places to follow the example  the little that i can do in my own sphere shall be attempted immediately with especial view to insure the cooperation of the societies happy should i be if you and other gentlemen would immediately concur in this endeavour                     i remain c                       wm wordsworth153   98 of the same                     rydal mount jan 1836 my dear c  now let me tell you but more for your fathers sake than yours that in a letter which i received from lord lonsdale yesterday he generously proposes to endow a new church at cockermouth with 150l per annum from a conversation with him in the autumn i expected he would do as much though he did not then permit me as he has done now to mention it publicly154   99 classic scenes holy land  we often think with much interest of your sister eliza and

of poems c letter to professor henry reed of philadelphia                     london august 19 1837  my dear sir  upon returning from a tour of several months upon the continent i find two letters from you awaiting my arrival along with the edition of my poems you have done me the honour of editing to begin with the former letter april 25 1836 it gives me concern that you should have thought it necessary not to apologise for that you have not done but to explain at length why you addressed me in the language of affectionate regard it must surely be gratifying to one whose aim as an author has been the hearts of his fellowcreatures of all ranks and in all stations to find that he has succeeded in any quarter and still more must he be gratified to learn that he has pleased in a distant country men of simple habits and cultivated taste who are at the same time widely acquainted with literature your second letter accompanying the edition of the poems i have read but unluckily have it not before me it was lent to serjeant talfourd on account of the passage in it that alludes to the possible and desirable establishment of english copyright in america i shall now hasten to notice the edition which you have superintended of my poems this i can do with much pleasure as the book which has been shown to several persons of taste mr rogers in particular is allowed to be far the handsomest specimen of printing in double columns which they have seen allow me to thank you for the pains you have bestowed upon the work do not apprehend that any difference in our several arrangements of the poems can be of much importance you appear to understand me far too well for that to be possible i have only to regret in respect to this volume that it should have been published before my last edition in the correction of which i took great pains as my last labour in that way and which moreover contains several additional pieces it may be allowed me also to express a hope that such a law will be passed ere long by the american legislature as will place english authors in general upon a better footing in america than at present they have obtained and that the protection of copyright between the two countries will be reciprocal the vast circulation of english works in america offers a temptation for hasty and incorrect printing and that same vast circulation would without adding to the price of each copy of an english work in a degree that could be grudged or thought injurious by any purchaser allow an american remuneration which might add considerably to the comforts of english authors who may be in narrow circumstances yet who at the same time may have written solely from honourable motives besides justice is the foundation on which both law and practice ought to rest  having many letters to write on returning to england after so long an absence i regret that i must be so brief on the present occasion i cannot conclude however without assuring you that the acknowledgments which i receive from the vast continent of america are among the most grateful that reach me what a vast field is there open to the english mind acting through our noble language let us hope that our authors of true genius will not be unconscious of that thought or inattentive to the duty which it imposes upon them of doing their utmost to instruct to purify and to elevate their readers that such may be my own endeavour through the short time i shall have to remain in this world is a prayer in which i am sure you and your lifes partner will join me believe me

        brinsop court sept 20 1837  my dear mr quillinan  we are heartily glad to learn from your letter just received that in all probability by this time you must have left the unhappy country in which you have been so long residing i should not have been sorry if you had entered a little more into peninsular politics for what is going on there is shocking to humanity and one would be glad to see anything like an opening for the termination of these unnatural troubles  156 memoirs ii 3446  the position of the miguelites relatively to the conflicting so called liberal parties is just what i apprehended and expressed very lately to mr robinson  he came down with us to hereford with a view to a short tour on the banks of the wye which has been prevented by an unexpected attack of my old complaint of inflammation in the eye and in consequence of this dora will accompany me home with a promise on her part of returning to london before the month of october is out our places are taken in tomorrows coach for liverpool so that since we must be disappointed of seeing you and jemima here we trust that you will come on to rydal from leeds this very day dora had read to me your poem again it convinces me along with your other writings that it is in your power to attain a permanent place among the poets of england your thoughts feelings knowledge and judgment in style and skill in metre entitle you to it and if you have not yet succeeded in gaining it the cause appears to me merely to lie in the subjects which you have chosen it is worthy of note how much of grays popularity is owing to the happiness with which his subject is selected in three places his hymn to adversity his ode on the distant prospect of eton college and his elegy i ought however in justice to you to add that one cause of your failure appears to have been thinking too humbly of yourself so that you have not reckoned it worth while to look sufficiently round you for the best subjects or to employ as much time in reflecting condensing bringing out and placing your thoughts and feelings in the best point of view as is necessary i will conclude this matter of poetry and my part of the letter with requesting that as an act of friendship at your convenience you would take the troublea considerable one i ownof comparing the corrections in my last edition with the text in the preceding one you know my principles of style better i think than any one else and i should be glad to learn if anything strikes you as being altered for the worse you will find the principal changes are in the white doe in which i had too little of the benefit of your help and judgment there are several also in the sonnets both miscellaneous and political in the other poems they are nothing like so numerous but here also i should be glad if you would take the like trouble jemima i am sure will be pleased to assist you in the comparison by reading new or old as you may think fit with love to her i remain  my dear mr quillinan                     faithfully yours                       william wordsworth157   102 on a tour  letter to the earl of lonsdale  after having had excellent health during my long ramble in herefordshire it is unfortunate that i should thus be disabled at the conclusion the mischief came to me in herefordshire whither i had gone on my way home to see my brotherinlaw who by his horse falling with him some time ago was left without the use of his limbs  i was lately a few days with mr rogers at broadstairs and also with the archbishop of canterbury at addington park they were both well and i was happy to see the archbishop much stronger than his slender and almost feeble appearance would lead one to expect we walked up and down in the park for three hours one day and nearly four the next without his seeming to be the least fatigued i mention this as we must all feel the value of his life in this state of public affairs  the cholera prevented us getting as far as naples which was the only disappointment we met with as a man of letters i have to regret that this most interesting tour was not made by me earlier in life as i might have turned the notices it has supplied me with to more account than i now expect to do with respectful remembrances to lady lonsdale and to your lordship in which mrs w unites                     i remain my dear lord faithfully

            dec 23 1837  my dear sir  i have just received your valuable present of bentleys works for which accept my cordial thanks as also for the leaf to be added to akenside  is it recorded in your memoir of akensidefor i have not leisure nor eyesight at present to lookthat he was fond of sitting in st jamess park with his eyes upon westminster abbey this i am sure i have either read or heard of him and i imagine that it was from mr rogers i am not unfrequently a visitor on hampstead heath and seldom pass by the entrance of mr dysons villa on goulders hill close by without thinking of the pleasure which akenside often had there  i cannot call to mind a reason why you should not think some passages in the power of sound equal to anything i have produced when first printed in the yarrow revisited i placed it at the end of the volume and in the last edition of my poems at the close of the poems of imagination indicating thereby my own opinion of it  how much do i regret that i have neither learning nor eyesight thoroughly to enjoy bentleys masterly dissertation upon the epistles of phalaris many years ago i read the work with infinite pleasure as far as i know or rather am able to judge it is without a rival in that department of literature a work of which the english nation may be proud as long as acute intellect and vigorous powers and profound scholarship shall be esteemed in the world  let me again repeat my regret that in passing to and from scotland you have never found it convenient to visit this part of the country i should be delighted to see you and i am sure mr southey would be the same and in his house you would find an inexhaustible collection of books many curious no doubt but his classical library is much the least valuable part of it the death of his excellent wife was a deliverance for herself and the whole family so great had been her sufferings of mind and body  you do not say a word about skelton and i regret much your disappointment in respect of middleton                     i remain my dear sir                        faithfully your much obliged                           wm wordsworth159  159 memoirs ii 3501   104 presidency of royal dublin society patronage of genius canons of criticism family news  letter to sir william r hamilton                     rydal mount dec 21 1837  my dear sir william  the papers had informed me of the honour conferred upon you and i was intending to congratulate you on the occasion when your letter arrived the electors have done great credit to themselves by appointing you and not a little by rejecting the ultraliberal archbishop and that by so decided a majority we are much pleased that your sister who we conclude is well has sent her poems to press and wish they may obtain the attention we are sure they will merit your own two sonnets for which i thank you we read that is mrs w and myself dora is in the south with interest but to the main purport of your letter you pay me an undeserved compliment in requesting my opinion how you could best promote some of the benefits which the society at whose head you are placed aims at as to patronage you are right in supposing that i hold it in little esteem for helping genius forward in the fine arts especially those whose medium is words sculpture and painting may be helped by it but even in those departments there is much to be dreaded the french have established an academy at rome upon an extensive scale and so far from doing good i was told by every one that it had done much harm the plan is this they select the most distinguished students from the school or academy at paris and send them to rome with handsome stipends by which they are tempted into idleness and of course into vice so that it looks like a contrivance for preventing the french nation and the world at large profiting by the genius which nature may have bestowed and which left to itself would in some cases perhaps have prospered the principal i was indeed told the only condition imposed upon these students is that each of them send annually some work of his hands to paris when at rome i saw a good deal of english artists they seemed to be living happily and doing well tho as you are aware the public patronage any of them receive is trifling  genius in poetry or any department of what is called the belles lettres is much more likely to be cramped than fostered by public support better wait to reward those who have done their work tho even here national rewards are not necessary unless the labourers be if not in poverty at least in narrow circumstances let the laws be but just to them and they will be sure of attaining competence if they have not misjudged their own talents or misapplied them  the cases of chatterton burns and others might it should seem be urged against the conclusion that help beforehand is not required but i do think that in the temperament of the two i have mentioned there was something which however favourable had been their circumstances however much they had been encouraged and supported would have brought on their ruin as to what patronage can do in science discoveries in physics mechanic arts c you know far better than i can pretend to do  as to better canons of criticism and general improvement of scholars i really speaking without affectation am so little of a critic or scholar that it would be presumptuous in me to write upon the subject to you if we were together and you should honour me by asking my opinion upon particular points that would be a very different thing and i might have something to say not wholly without value but where could i begin with so comprehensive an argument and how could i put into the compass of a letter my thoughts such as they may be with anything like order it is somewhat mortifying to me to disappoint you you must upon reflection i trust perceive that in attempting to comply with your wish i should only lose myself in a wilderness i have been applied to to give lectures upon poetry in a public institution in london but i was conscious that i was neither competent to the office nor the public prepared to receive what i should have felt it my duty to say however inadequately  i have had a very pleasant and not profitless tour on the continent tho with one great drawback the being obliged on account of the cholera to return without seeing naples and its neighbourhood had it not been for the state of my eyes which became inflamed after i got back to england i should have been able to take liverpool in my way home at the time you were there the attack continued for a long time and has left a weakness in the organ which does not yet allow me either to read or write but with care i hope to come about  my sister continues in the same enfeebled state of mind and body mrs w is well but your godson we hear is suffering from derangement of the stomach so that at present he is not a thriving child but his elder brother is now remarkably so and he about the same age was subject to the same trials we trust that your little family are all flourishing and with our united affectionate regards believe me faithfully                     dear sir w yours                        wm wordsworth  i am sorry that i cannot send this thro lord northampton because he tells me he is coming northward160

sir william  from a hope of something starting up in my mind which might prevent my letter being an utter disappointment i have not answered yours as i wished to do by return of post but i am really still as much at a loss how to make my letter worth reading as if i had replied immediately allow me however to thank you for your last which has completely done away with the vagueness of the former i now distinctly understand you and as to one of your leading points viz availing myself of publication through your society i may say that if there had been among my papers anything of the kind you wish for i should have gladly forwarded it to you but it is not so nor dare i undertake to promise anything of the kind for the future though prevailed upon by mr coleridge to write the first preface to my poems which tempted or rather forced me to add a supplement to it and induced by my friendship for him to write the essay upon epitaphs now appended to the excursion but first composed for the friend i have never felt inclined to write criticism though i have talked and am daily talking a great deal if i were several years younger out of friendship to you mainly i would sit down to the task of giving a body to my notions upon the essentials of poetry a subject which could not be properly treated without adverting to the other branches of fine art but at present with so much before me that i could wish to do in verse and the melancholy fact brought daily more and more home to my conviction that intellectual labour by its action on the brain and nervous system is injurious to the bodily powers and especially to my eyesight i should only be deceiving myself and misleading you were i to encourage a hope that much as i could wish to be your fellowlabourer however humbly i shall ever become so  having disposed of this rather painful part of the subject of your letter let me say that though it is principally matters of science in which publication through your society would be serviceable and indeed in that department eminently so i concur with you in thinking that the same vehicle would be useful for bringing under the notice of the thinking part of the community critical essays of too abstract a character to be fit for popularity there are obviously even in criticism two ways of affecting the minds of menthe one by treating the matter so as to carry it immediately to the sympathies of the many and the other by aiming at a few select and superior minds that might each become a centre for illustrating it in a popular way mr coleridge whom you allude to acted upon the world to a great extent thro the latter of these processes and there cannot be a doubt that your society might serve the cause of just thinking and pure taste should you as president of it hold up to view the desirableness of first conveying to a few thro that channel reflections upon literature and art which if well meditated would be sure of winning their way directly or in their indirect results to a gradually widening circle  may i not encourage a hope that during the ensuing summer or at the worst at no distant period you and i might meet when a few hours conversation would effect more than could come out of a dozen letters dictated and hastily as i am obliged to dictate this from an unexpected interruption when mrs w and i were sitting down with the pen in her hand  you are right in your recollection that i named to you the subject of foreign piracy as injurious to english authors and i may add now that if it could be put a stop to i believe that it would rarely happen that successful writers on works of imagination and feeling at least would stand in need of pensions from government or would feel themselves justified in accepting them upon this subject i have spoken a great deal to mps of all parties and with several distinguished americans i have also been in correspondence with the present chancellor of the exchequer upon it and dwelt upon the same topic in a letter which i had occasion to write to sir robert peel mr lytton bulwer as perhaps you know drew the attention of parliament to it during the late session lord palmerston said in answer to him that the attention of government had already been directed to the measure and that it would not be lost sight of or something to that purpose i may claim some credit for my exertions in this business and full as much or more for the pains which i have taken for many years to interest men in the house of commons in the extension of the term of copyrighta measure which i trust is about to be brought to a successful close by the exertions of my admirable friend serjeant talfourd to him i have written upon the argument more than once when this is effected i trust the other part of the subject will be taken up with spirit and if the foreign secretary in whose department the matter lies should be remiss i trust he will be stimulated thro parliament to which desirable end the services of distinguished societies like yours and the notice of the question by men of letters in reviews or otherwise would greatly contribute good authors if justice were done to them by their own and foreign countries now that reading is spread and spreading so widely would very few of them be in need except thro their own fault  when i was in town last august the american minister mr stephenson spoke to me with much indignation of the law and practice by which copyright was secured in england for american authors while there was no reciprocity for english writers in america  but i must conclude or i shall miss the post the father of your godson is here and begs to be remembered to you  did i ever mention to you that owing to the sea having swallowed up his fatherinlaws coalpits  income is much reduced and he therefore feels it necessary to endeavour to procure a couple of pupils who could afford to pay rather handsomely for the advantages they would have under his roof by this time he would have succeeded but parents in the south have an unaccountable objection to sending their sons so far north as the same might not be felt in ireland i take the liberty of mentioning his wish to you being persuaded that if you can you will assist him in his views if your address to your society should be published could you send it me and acquaint me with what you have done

mount dec 23 1839  my dear sir  the year is upon the point of expiring and a letter of yours dated may 7th though not received till late in june for i was moving about all last spring and part of the summer remains unacknowledged i have also to thank you for the acceptable present of the two volumes which reached me some time afterwards                                       your letters are naturally turned upon the impression which my poems have made and the estimation they are held or likely to be held in through the vast country to which you belong i wish i could feel as lively as you do upon this subject or even upon the general destiny of those works pray do not be long surprised at this declaration there is a difference of more than the length of your life i believe between our ages i am standing on the brink of that vast ocean i must sail so soon i must speedily lose sight of the shore and i could not once have conceived how little i now am troubled by the thought of how long or short a time they who remain on that shore may have sight of me the other day i chanced to be looking over a ms poem belonging to the year 1803 though not actually composed till many years afterwards it was suggested by visiting the neighbourhood of dumfries in which burns had resided and where he died it concluded thus      sweet mercy to the gales of heaven     this minstrel led his sins forgiven      the rueful conflict the heart riven       with vain endeavour     and memory of earths bitter leaven       effaced for ever  here the verses closed but i instantly added the other day      but why to him confine the prayer     when kindred thoughts and yearnings bear     on the frail heart the purest share         with all that live     the best of what we do and are         just god forgive  the more i reflect upon this last exclamation the more i feel and perhaps it may in some degree be the same with you justified in attaching comparatively small importance to any literary monument that i may be enabled to leave behind it is well however i am convinced that men think otherwise in the earlier part of their lives and why it is so is a point i need not touch upon in writing to you  before i dismiss this subject let me thank you for the extract from your intelligent friends letter and allow me to tell you that i could not but smile at your boston critic placing my name by the side of cowley i suppose he cannot mean anything more than that the same measure of reputation or fame if that be not too presumptuous a word is due to us both  german transcendentalism which you say this critic is infected by would be a woeful visitation for the world  the way in which you speak of me in connection with your possible visit to england was most gratifying and i here repeat that i should be truly glad to see you in the delightful spot where i have long dwelt and i have the more pleasure in saying this to you because in spite of my old infirmity my strength exceeds that of most men of my years and my general health continues to be as it always has been remarkably good a page of blank paper stares me in the face and i am not sure that it is worth while to fill it with a sonnet which broke from me not long ago in reading an account of misdoings in many parts of your republic mrs wordsworth will however transcribe it      men of the western world in fates dark book     whence these opprobrious leaves of dire portent  to turn to another subject you will be sorry to learn that several of my most valued friends are likely to suffer from the monetary derangements in america my family however is no way directly entangled unless the mississippi bonds prove invalid there is an opinion pretty current among discerning persons in england that republics are not to be trusted in money concernsi suppose because the sense of honour is more obtuse the responsibility being divided among so many for my own part i have as little or less faith in absolute despotisms except that they are more easily convinced that it is politic to keep up their credit by holding to their engagements what power is maintained by this practice was shown by great britain in her struggle with buonaparte this lesson has not been lost on the leading monarchical states of europe but too much of this                     believe me to remain                        faithfully

illness he was a most amiable man and i have reason to believe was one of the best scholars in europe we were all strongly attached to him and as his poor father writes the loss is to him and to his

most affectionately condole with you and those who are around you at this melancholy time the departed was beloved in this house as he deserved to be but our sorrow great as it is for our own sakes is still heavier for yours and his brothers he is a power gone out of our family and they will be perpetually reminded of it but the best of all consolations will be with you with them with us and all his numerous relatives and friends especially with mrs hoare that his life had been as blameless as mans could well be and through the goodness of god he is gone to his reward                     i

but a want of due sympathy with you in your affliction my not having earlier given an answer to your letter in truth i was so much moved by it that i had not at first sufficient resolution to bring my thoughts so very close to your trouble as must have been done had i taken up the pen immediately i have been myself distressed in the same way though my two children were taken from me at an earlier age one in her fifth the other in his seventh year and within half a year of each other i can therefore enter into your sorrows more feelingly than for others is possible who have not suffered like losses  your departed daughter struck me as having one of the most intelligent and impressive countenances i ever looked upon and i spoke of her as such to mrs wordsworth miss fenwick and to others the indications which i saw in her of a somewhat alarming state of health i could not but mention to you when you accompanied me a little way from your own door you spoke something encouraging but they continued to haunt me so that your kind letter was something less of a shock than it would otherwise have been though not less of a sorrow  166 memoirs ii 3601  167 ellen parry daughter of dr parry who died april 28 1840 wordsworth saw her april 28 1839 he was again at summer hill bath in april 1840  how pathetic is your account of the piety with which the dear creature supported herself under those severe trials of mind and body with which it pleased god to prepare her for a happier world the consolation which children and very young persons who have been religiously brought up draw from the holy scriptures ought to be habitually on the minds of adults of all ages for the benefit of their own souls and requires to be treated in a loftier and more comprehensive train of thought and feeling than by writers has been usually bestowed upon it it does not therefore surprise me that you hinted at my own pen being employed upon the subject as brought before the mind in your lamented daughters own most touching case i wish i were equal to anything so holy but i feel that i am not it is remarkable however that within the last few days the subject has been presented to my mind by two several persons both unknown to me which is something of a proof how widely its importance is felt and also that there is a feeling that i am not wholly unworthy of treating it  your letter my dear sir i value exceedingly and shall take the liberty as i have done more than once with fit reverence of reading it in quarters where it is likely to do good or rather where i know it must do good  wishing and praying that the almighty may bestow upon yourself the partner in your bereavement and all the fellowsufferers in your household that consolation and support which can proceed only from his grace                     i remain my dear dr parry                          most faithfully your much obliged                                  w wordsworth168   112 religion and

many things in extenuation the chief that old one of the state of my eyes which never leaves me at liberty either to read or write a tenth part as much as i could wish and as otherwise i ought to do  168 memoirs ii 3623  it cannot but be highly gratifying to me to learn that my writings are prized so highly by a poet and critic of your powers the essay upon them which you have so kindly sent me seems well qualified to promote your views in writing it i was particularly pleased with your distinction between religion in poetry and versified religion for my own part i have been averse to frequent mention of the mysteries of christian faith not from a want of a due sense of their momentous nature but the contrary i felt it far too deeply to venture on handling the subject as familiarly as many scruple not to do i am far from blaming them but let them not blame me nor turn from my companionship on that account besides general reasons for diffidence in treating subjects of holy writ i have some especial ones i might err in points of faith and i should not deem my mistakes less to be deprecated because they were expressed in metre even milton in my humble judgment has erred and grievously and what poet could hope to atone for his apprehensions169 in the way in which that mighty mind has done  i am not at all desirous that any one should write an elaborate critique on my poetry170 there is no call for it if they be from above they will do their own work in course of time if not they will perish as they ought but scarcely a week passes in which i do not receive grateful acknowledgments of the good they have done to the minds of the several writers they speak of the relief they have received from them under affliction and in grief and of the calmness and elevation of spirit which the poems either give or assist them in attaining as these benefits are not without a traceable bearing upon the good of the immortal soul the sooner perhaps they are pointed out and illustrated in a work like yours the better  169 sic qu misapprehensions ha  170 sic 1 poems ii a  pray excuse my talking so much about myself your letter and critique called me to the subject but i assure you it would have been more grateful to me to acknowledge the debt we owe you in this house where we have read your poems with no common pleasure your abbot of muchelnage also makes me curious to hear more of him  but i must conclude  i was truly sorry to have missed you when you and mrs alford called at rydal mrs w unites with me in kind regards to you both and believe me                     my dear sir                            faithfully yours                              wm wordsworth171   113 memorandum of a conversation on sacred poetry by rev r p graves  i must try to give you a summary of a long conversation i had with wordsworth on the subject of sacred poetry and which i wish i were able to report in full in the course of it he expressed to me the feelings of reverence which prevented him from venturing to lay his hand on what he always thought a subject too high for him and he accompanied this with the earnest protest that his works as well as those of any other poet should not be considered as developing all the influences which his own heart recognised but rather those which he considered himself able as an artist to display to advantage and which he thought most applicable to the wants and admitted by the usages of the world at large this was followed by a most interesting discussion upon milton cowper the general progress of religion as an element of poetry and the gradual steps by which it must advance to a power comprehensive and universally admitted steps which are defined in their order by the constitution of the human mind and which must proceed with vastly more slowness in the case of the progress made by collective minds than it does in an individual soul172   114 visit of queen adelaide to rydal mount  letter to lady frederick bentinck                     july 1840  i hope dear lady frederick that nothing will prevent my appearance at lowther towards the end of next week but i have for these last few years been visited always with a serious inflammation in my eyes about this season of the year which causes me to have fears about the fulfilment of any engagement however agreeable pray thank lord lonsdale on my part for his thinking of me upon this occasion  171 memoirs ii 3646  172 ibid ii 366  on monday morning a little before nine a beautiful and bright day the queen dowager and her sister appeared at rydal i met them at the lower waterfall with which her majesty seemed much pleased upon hearing that it was not more than half a mile to the higher fall she said briskly she would go though lord denbigh and lord howe felt that they were pressed for time having to go upon keswick lake and thence to paterdale i walked by the queens side up to the higher waterfall and she seemed to be struck much with the beauty of the scenery her step was exceedingly light but i learned that her health is not good or rather that she still suffers from the state of her constitution which caused her to go abroad  upon quitting the park of rydal nearly opposite our own gate the queen was saluted with a pretty rural spectacle nearly fifty children drawn up in avenue with bright garlands in their hands three large flags flying and a band of music they had come from ambleside and the garlands were such as are annually prepared at this season for a ceremony called the rushbearing and the parishclerk of ambleside hit upon this way of showing at rydal the same respect to the queen which had been previously shown at ambleside i led the queen to the principal points of view in our little domain particularly to that through the summer house which shows the lake of rydal to such advantage the queen talked more than once about having a cottage among the lakes which of course was nothing more than a natural way of giving vent to the pleasure which she had in the country you will think i fear that i have dwelt already too long upon the subject and i shall therefore only add that all went off satisfactorily and that every one was delighted with her majestys demeanour lord and lady sheffield were the only persons of her suite whom i had seen before lord howe was pleased with the sight of the pictures from his friend sir george beaumonts pencil and showed them to the queen who having sat some little time in the house took her leave cordially shaking mrs wordsworth by the hand as a friend of her own rank might have done she had also inquired for dora who was introduced to her i hope she will come again into the country and visit lowther  pray excuse the above long story which i should not have ventured upon but that you expressed a wish upon the subject  what enchanting weather i hope and do not doubt that you all enjoy it my dear lady frederick as we are doing  i ought not to forget that two days ago i went over to see mr southey or rather mrs southey for he is past taking pleasure in the presence of any of his friends he did not recognise me till he was told then his eyes flashed for a moment with their former brightness but he sank into the state in which i had found him patting with both hands his books affectionately like a child having attempted in vain to interest him by a few observations i took my leave after five minutes or so it was for me a mournful visit and for his poor wife also his health is good and he may live many years though the body is much enfeebled                     ever affectionately yours                           wm wordsworth  we hope your lameness will soon leave you that you may ramble about as usual173   115

could tear himself away from this lovely country at this charming season i say charming notwithstanding this is a dull day but yesterday was most glorious i hope our excellent friend does not mean to remain in london  we have had no visits from strangers since my return so that the press of the season seems to be over the leaves are not changed here so much as at lowther and of course not yet so

mount monday evening  the accident after which you inquire dear lady frederick with so much feeling might have been fatal but through gods mercy we escaped without bodily injury as far as i know worth naming these were the particulars about three miles beyond keswick on the ambleside road is a small bridge from the top of which we got sight of the mail coach coming towards us at about forty yards distance just before the road begins to descend a narrow steep and winding slope nothing was left for j who drove the gig in which we were but to cross the bridge and as the road narrowed up the slope that was in our front to draw up as close to the wall on our left our side of the road as possible this he did both of us hoping that the coachman would slacken his pace down the hill and pass us as far from our wheel as the road would allow but he did neither on the contrary he drove furiously down the hill and though as we afterwards ascertained by the track of his wheels he had a yard width of road to spare he made no use of it in consequence of this recklessness and his want of skill the wheel of his coach struck our wheel most violently drove back our horse and gig some yards and then sent us all together through a small gap in the wall with the stones of the wall tumbling about us into a plantation that lay a yard perpendicular below the level of the road from which the horse and gig with us in it had been driven the shafts were broken off close to the carriage and we were partly thrown and partly leaped out after breaking the traces the horse leaped back into the road and galloped off the shafts and traces sticking to him nor did the poor creature stop till he reached the turnpike at grasmere seven miles from the spot where the mischief was done we sent by the coach for a chaise to take us to rydal and hired a cart to take the broken gig to be mended at keswick  the mercy was that the violent shock from the coach did not tear off our wheel for if this had been done j and probably i also must have fallen under the hind wheels of the coach and in all likelihood been killed we have since learned that the coachman had only just come upon the road which is in a great many places very dangerous and that he was wholly unpractised in driving fourinhand pray excuse this long and minute account i should have written to you next day but i waited hoping to be able to add that my indisposition was gone as i now trust it is  with respectful remembrances to lord lonsdale and kindest regards to yourself and miss thompson i remain                     dear lady

 rydal mount jan 13 1841 my dear mr reed  it is gratifying to learn that through your means mr alston has been reminded of me we became acquainted many years ago through our common friend mr coleridge who had seen much of mr alston when they were both living at rome                                       you mention the sonnet i wrote upon haydons picture of the duke of wellington i have known haydon and wilkie also from their contemporaneous introduction to the world as artists their powers were perceived and acknowledged by my lamented friend sir george beaumont and patronised by him accordingly and it was at his house where i first became acquainted with them both haydon is bent upon coming to rydal next summer with a view to paint a likeness of me not as a mere matteroffact portrait but one of a poetical character in which he will endeavour to place his friend in some favourite scene of these mountains i am rather afraid i own of any attempt of this kind notwithstanding my high opinion of his ability but if he keeps in his present mind which i doubt it will be in vain to oppose his inclination he is a great enthusiast possessed also of a most active intellect but he wants that submissive and steady good sense which is absolutely necessary for the adequate development of power in that art to which he is attached  as i am on the subject of painting it may be worth while to add that pickersgill came down last summer to paint a portrait of me for sir robert peels gallery at drayton manor it was generally thought here that this work was more successful than the one he painted some years ago for st johns college at the request of the master and fellows177  177 memoirs ii 3734   119 of peaces apology for cathedrals  i have no especial reason for writing at this moment of time but i have long wished to thank you for the apology for cathedrals which i have learned is from your pen the little work does you great credit it is full of that wisdom which the heart and imagination alone could adequately supply for such a subject and is moreover very pleasingly diversified by styles of treatment all good in their kind i need add no more than that i entirely concur in the views you take but what avails it the mischief is done and they who have been most prominent in setting it on foot will have to repent of their narrow comprehension which however is no satisfaction to us who from the first foresaw the evil tendency of the measure178  178 extract of letter to john peace esq jan 19 1841 memoirs ii 376  120 of the task of cowper and shenstone  though i can make but little use of my eyes in writing or reading i have lately been reading cowpers task aloud and in so doing was tempted to look over the parallelisms for which mr southey was in his edition indebted to you knowing how comprehensive your acquaintance with poetry is i was rather surprised that you did not notice the identity of the thought and accompanying illustrations of it in a passage of shenstones ode upon rural elegance compared with one in the task where cowper speaks of the inextinguishable love of the country as manifested by the inhabitants of cities in their culture of plants and flowers where the want of air cleanliness and light is so unfavourable to their growth and beauty the germ of the main thought is to be found in horace      nempe inter varias nutritur

at my own house the bishop of new jersey he is a man of no ordinary powers of mind and attainments of warm feelings and sincere piety indeed i never saw a person of your country which is remarkable for cordiality whose manner was so thoroughly cordial he had been greatly delighted with his reception in england and what he had seen of it both in art and nature by the by i heard him preach an excellent sermon in london i believe this privilege is of modern date the bishop has furnished me with his funeral sermon upon bishop white to assist me in fulfilling a request which you first made to me viz that i would add a sonnet to my ecclesiastical series upon the union of the two episcopal churches of england and america183 i will endeavour to do so when i have more leisure than at present

answering your kind letter from the cape long ago but the want of matter that seemed worth sending so far unless i confined myself to what you must he well assured of my sincere esteem and regard for yourself and lady gomm and the expression of good wishes for your health and happiness i am still in the same difficulty but cannot defer writing longer lest i should appear to myself unworthy of your friendship or respect  you describe the beauties of rio janeiro in glowing colours and your animated picture was rendered still more agreeable to me by the sight which i had enjoyed a little before of a panorama of the same scene executed by a friend of mine who in his youth studied at the academy with a view to practise painting as a profession he was a very promising young artist but having a brother a brazilian merchant he changed his purpose and went to rio where he resided many years and made a little fortune which enabled him to purchase and build in cumberland where i saw his splendid portrait of that magnificent region what an intricacy of waters and what boldness and fantastic variety in the mountains i suppose taking the region as a whole it is scarcely anywhere surpassed  if the different quarters of the globe should ever become subject to one empire rio ought to be the metropolis it is so favoured in every respect and so admirably placed for intercourse with all the countries of the earth your approach to the cape was under awful circumstances and with three great wrecks strewn along the coast of the bay lady gomms spirit and fortitude as described by you are worthy of all admiration and i am sure she will sympathise with the verses i send to commemorate a noble exploit of one of her sex the inhumanity with which the shipwrecked were lately treated upon the french coast impelled me to place in contrast the conduct of an english woman and her parents under like circumstances as it occurred some years ago almost immediately after i had composed my tribute to the memory of grace darling i learnt that the queen and queen dowager had both just subscribed towards the erection of a monument to record her heroism upon the spot that witnessed it  of public news i say nothing as you will hear everything from quarters more worthy of attention i hope all goes on to your satisfaction mainly so at least in your new government and that the disposition which you will have taken with you to benefit the people under your rule has not been nor is likely to be frustrated in any vexatious or painful degree  yesterday i went over to keswick to attend the funeral of my excellent friend mr southey his genius and abilities are well known to the world and he was greatly valued for his generous disposition and moral excellence his illness was long and afflicting his mind almost extinguished years before the breath departed mr rogers i have not been in communication with since i saw you in london but be assured i shall bear in memory your message and deliver it if he and i live to meet again and now my dear sir wm repeating the united best good wishes of mrs w and myself for you and lady gomm and for your safe return to your own country i

pleasure by the interest you take in the various passages in which i speak of the poets my contemporaries who are no more dear southey one of the most eminent is just added to the list a few days ago i went over to keswick to attend his remains to their last earthly abode for upwards of three years his mental faculties have been in a state of deplorable decay and his powers of recognition except very rarely and but for a moment have been during more than half that period all but extinct his bodily health was grievously impaired and his medical attendant says that he must have died long since but for the very great strength of his natural constitution as to his literary remains they must be very considerable but except his epistolary correspondence more or less unfinished his letters cannot but be very numerous and if carefully collected and judiciously selected will i doubt not add greatly to his reputation he had a fine talent for that species of composition and took much delight in throwing off his mind in that way mr taylor the dramatic author is his literary executor  though i have written at great and i fear tiresome length i will add a few words upon the wish you express that i would pay a tribute to the english poets of past ages who never had the fame they are entitled to and have long been almost entirely neglected had this been suggested to me earlier in life or had it come into my thoughts the thing in all probability would have been done at present i cannot hope it will but it may afford you some satisfaction to be told that in the ms poem upon my poetic education there is a whole book of about 600 lines192 upon my obligations to writers of imagination and chiefly the poets though i have not expressly named those to whom you allude and for whom and many others of their age i have a high respect  the character of the schoolmaster about whom you inquire had like the wanderer in the excursion a solid foundation in fact and reality but like him it was also in some degree a composition i will not and need not call it an inventionit was no such thing but were i to enter into details i fear it would impair the effect of the whole upon your mind nor could i do it to my own satisfaction i send you according to your wish the additions to the ecclesiastical sonnets and also the last poem from my pen i threw it off two or three weeks ago being in a great measure impelled to it by the desire i felt to do justice to the memory of a heroine whose conduct presented some time ago a striking contrast to the inhumanity with which our countrymen

the recommendation made by your lordship to the queen and graciously approved by her majesty that the vacant office of poet laureate should be offered to me affords me high gratification sincerely am i sensible of this honour and let me be permitted to add that the being deemed worthy to succeed my lamented and revered friend mr southey enhances the pleasure i receive upon this occasion  the appointment i feel however imposes duties which far advanced in life as i am i cannot venture to undertake and therefore must beg leave to decline the acceptance of an offer that i shall always remember with no unbecoming pride  her majesty will not i trust disapprove of a determination forced upon me by reflections which it is impossible for me to set aside  deeply feeling the distinction conferred upon me and grateful for the terms in which your lordship has made the communication                     i have the honour to be                      my lord                       your

the queens approbation offered me the vacant laureateship had i been several years younger i should have accepted the office with pride and pleasure but on friday i shall enter god willing my 74th year and on account of so advanced an age i begged permission to decline it not venturing to undertake its duties for though as you are aware the formal taskwork of new year and birthday odes was abolished194 when the appointment was given to mr southey he still considered himself obliged in conscience to produce and did produce verses some of very great merit upon important public occasions he failed to do so upon the queens coronation and i know that this omission caused him no little uneasiness the same might happen to myself upon some important occasion and i should be uneasy under the possibility i hope therefore that neither you nor lord lonsdale nor any of my friends will blame me for what i have done  194 southeys account in his life and correspondence renders this statement questionable  i was slow to send copies of grace darling about except to female friends lest i should seem to attach too much importance to the production though it was on a subject which interested the whole nation but as the verses seem to have given general pleasure i now venture to send the enclosed copies one for mr colvill and the other for my old friend mr ocallaghan begging that you would present them at your own convenience with the best of good wishes and every kind and respectful remembrance to lord lonsdale who we are happy to learn is doing so well and also not forgetting miss

chamberlain from pressing the offer upon him with an assurance that the duties of laureate had not recently extended beyond the annual ode and might in his case be considered as merely nominal and would not in any way interfere with his repose and retirement  the same post brought also the following letter                     whitehall april 3 1843  my dear sir  i hope you may be induced to reconsider your decision with regard to the appointment of poet laureate  the offer was made to you by the lord chamberlain with my entire concurrence not for the purpose of imposing on you any onerous or disagreeable duties but in order to pay you that tribute of respect which is justly due to the first of living poets  the queen entirely approved of the nomination and there is one unanimous feeling on the part of all who have heard of the proposal and it is pretty generally known that there could not be a question about the selection  do not be deterred by the fear of any obligations which the appointment may be supposed to imply i will undertake that you shall have nothing required from you  but as the queen can select for this honourable appointment no one whose claims for respect and honour on account of eminence as a poet can be placed in competition with yours i trust you will not longer hesitate to accept it                     believe me my dear sir                          with sincere esteem                                  most faithfully yours                                     robert peel  i write this in haste from my place in the house of

appointment are entirely removed  sir robert peel has also done me the honour of uniting his wish with that which your lordship has urged in a manner most gratifying to my feelings so that under these circumstances and sanctioned as the recommendation has been by her majestys gracious approval it is with unalloyed pleasure that i accept this high distinction                     i have the honour to

by the very kind and most gratifying letter with which you have honoured me and by a second communication from the lord chamberlain to the same effect and in a like spirit i have accepted with unqualified pleasure a distinction sanctioned by her majesty and which expresses upon authority entitled to the highest respect a sense of the national importance of poetic literature and so favourable an opinion of the success with which it has been cultivated by one who after this additional mark of your esteem cannot refrain from again assuring you how deeply sensible he is of the many

of your handwriting was very welcome and not the less so because your sister had led me to expect a letter from you  the laureateship was offered to me in the most flattering terms by the lord chamberlain of course with the approbation of the queen but i declined it on account of my advanced age i then received a second letter from his lordship urging my acceptance of it and assuring me that it was intended merely as an honorary distinction for the past without the smallest reference to any service to be attached to it from sir r peel i had also a letter to the same effect and the substance and manner of both were such that if i had still rejected the offer i should have been little at peace with my own mind  thank you for your translations the longer poem195 would have given me more pain than pleasure but for your addition which sets all right  195 referring to a translation by sir wrh of die ideale of schiller to which a stanza was added by sir wg  the attack upon wsl to which you allude was written by my soninlaw but without any sanction from me much less encouragement in fact i knew nothing about it or the preceding article of landor that had called it forth till after mr qs had appeared he knew very well that i should have disapproved of his condescending to notice anything that a man so deplorably tormented by ungovernable passion as that unhappy creature might eject his character may be given in two or three words a madman a badman yet a man of genius as many a madman is i have not eyesight to spare for periodical literature so with exception of a newspaper now and then i never look into anything of the kind except some particular article may be recommended to me by a friend upon whose judgment i can rely  you are quite at liberty to print when and where you like any verses which you may do me the honour of writing upon or addressing to me  your godson his sister and four brothers are all doing well he is a very clever boy and more than that

communicating the intelligence of the death of that admirable artist and amiable man my old friend mr alston mr w and i are not acquainted and therefore i take it very kindly that he should have given me this melancholy information with most interesting particulars of the last few hours of the life of the deceased he also sent me a copy of verses addressed by himself to me i presume some little time ago and printed in the christian souvenir you have probably seen the lines and if so i doubt not you will agree with me that they indicate a true feeling of the leading characteristics of my poems at least i am sure that i wished them such as he represents them to be too partially no doubt  it would give me pleasure could i make this letter so long due more worthy of perusal by touching upon any topics of a public or private nature that might interest you but beyond the assurance which i can give you that i and mine are and have been in good health i know not where to find them this spring i have not left home for london or anywhere else and during the progress of it and the summer i have had much pleasure in noting the flowers and blossoms as they appeared and disappeared successively an occupation from which at least with reference to my own grounds a residence in town for the three foregoing spring seasons cut me off though my health continues thank god to be very good and i am active as most men of my age my strength for very long walks among the mountains is of course diminishing but weak or strong in body i shall ever remain in heart and mind                     faithfully your much obliged friend                           wm wordsworth  ps mr southeys literary executors are making a collection of his letters which will prove highly interesting to the

letter to the rev afterwards dean henry alford199                     rydal mount feb 28 1844  my dear sir  i am pleased to hear what you are about but i am far too advanced in life to venture upon anything so difficult to do as hymns of devotion  the one of mine which you allude to is quite at your service only i could wish the first line of the fifth stanza to be altered thus      each field is then a hallowed spot  or you might omit the stanza altogether if you thought proper the piece being long enough without it  wishing heartily for your success and knowing in what able hands the work is                     i remain my dear sir                        faithfully yours                             wm wordsworth200  198 memoirs ii 4056  199 this was written in answer to an inquiry

frederick bentinck                     march 31 1844  my dear lady frederick  we have known each other too long and too intimately for you not to be well aware of the reasons why i have not earlier condoled with you upon your bereavement201 i feel it deeply and sympathise with you as much and as truly as you possibly could wish i have also grieved for the rest of your family and household and not the least for miss thompson whose faithful and strong attachment to your revered father i have for a long time witnessed with delight and admiration through my kind friend mr obrien i have heard of you both and in his second letter he informs me to my great sorrow that miss thompson has been exceedingly ill god grant that she may soon recover as you both will stand in need of all your bodily strength to support you under so sad a loss but how much is there to be thankful for in every part of lord lonsdales life to its close how gently was he dealt with in his last moments and with what fortitude and christian resignation did he bear such pains as attended his decline and prepared the way for his quiet dissolution of my own feelings upon this loss i shall content myself with saying that as long as i retain consciousness i shall cherish the memory of your father for his inestimable worth and as one who honoured me with his friendship and who was to myself and my children the best benefactor the sympathy which i now offer dear lady frederick is shared by my wife and my daughter and my son william and will be also participated in by my elder son when he hears of the sad event  201 lord lonsdales death  i wrote to dr jackson202 to inquire whether the funeral was to be strictly private and learnt from him that it is to be so otherwise i should not have deprived myself of the melancholy satisfaction of attending accept dear lady frederick my best wishes and be assured of my prayers for your support and believe me                     your very affectionate friend

                 1844  in your last letter you speak so feelingly of the manner in which my birthday april 7 has been noticed both privately in your country and somewhat publicly in my own neighbourhood that i cannot forbear adding a word or two upon the subject it would have delighted you to see the assemblage in front of our house some dancing upon the gravel platform old and young as described in goldsmiths travels and others children i mean chasing each other upon the little plot of lawn to which you descend by steps from the platform we had music of our own preparing and two sets of casual itinerants italians and germans came in successively and enlivened the festivity there were present upwards of 300 children and about 150 adults of both sexes and all ages the children in their best attire and of that happy and i may say beautiful race which is spread over this highlyfavoured portion of england the tables were tastefully arranged in the open air204oranges and gingerbread in piles decorated with evergreens and spring flowers and all partook of tea the young in the open air and the old within doors i must own i wish that little commemorations of this kind were more common among us it is melancholy to think how little that portion of the community which is quite at ease in their circumstances have to do in a social way with the humbler classes they purchase commodities of them or they employ them as labourers or they visit them in charity for the sake of supplying their most urgent wants by almsgiving but this alas is far from enough one would wish to see the rich mingle with the poor as much as may be upon a footing of fraternal equality the old feudal dependencies and relations are almost gone from england and nothing has yet come adequately to supply their place there are tendencies of the right kind here and there but they are rather accidental than aught that is established in general manners why should not great landowners look for a substitute for what is lost of feudal paternity in the higher principles of christianised humanity and humbleminded brotherhood and why should not this extend to those vast communities which crowd so many parts of england under one head in the different sorts of manufacture which for the want of it are too often the pests of the social state we are however improving and i trust that the example set by some millowners will not fail to influence others  204 the fête was given by miss fenwick then at rydal  it gave me pleasure to be told that mr kebles dedication of his praelectiones had fallen in your way and that you had been struck by it205  205 see memoirs c xlv  it is not for me to say how far i am entitled to the honour which he has done me but i can sincerely say that it has been the main scope of my writings to do what he says i have accomplished and where could i find a more trustworthy judge  what you advise in respect to a separate publication of my church poetry i have often turned in my own mind but i have really done so little in that way compared with the magnitude of the subject that i have not courage to venture on such a publication besides it would not i fear pay its expenses the sonnets were so published upon the recommendation of a deceased nephew of mine one of the first scholars of europe and as good as he was learned the volume did not i believe clear itself and a great part of the impression though latterly offered at a reduced price still remains i believe in mr moxons hands in this country people who do not grudge laying out their money for new publications on personal or fugitive interests that every one is talking about are very unwilling to part with it for literature which is unindebted to temporary excitement if they buy such at all it must be in some form for the most part that has little to recommend it but low price  and now my dear sir with many thanks for the trouble you have been at and affectionate wishes for your welfare                     believe me faithfully yours                          wm wordsworth   139 classfellows and schoolfellows  letter to basil montagu esq                     rydal mount oct 1 1844  my dear montagu  absence from home has prevented my replying earlier to your letter which gave me much pleasure on many accounts and particularly as i learned from it that you are so industrious and to such good effect i dont wonder at your mention of the friends whom we have lost by death bowles the poet still lives and rogersall that survive of the poetical fraternity with whom i have had any intimacy southey campbell and cary are no more of my classfellows and schoolfellows very few remain my intimate associates of my own college are all gone long since myers my cousin terrot jones my fellowtraveller fleming and his brother raincock of pembroke bishop middleton of the same collegeit has pleased god that i should survive them all then there are none left but joseph cottle of the many friends i made at bristol and in somersetshire yet we are only in our 75th year but enough of this sad subject let us be resigned under all dispensations and thankful for that is our duty however difficult it may be to perform it i send you the lock of hair which you desired white as snow and taken from a residue which is thinning rapidly  you neither mention your own health nor mrs montagus i conclude therefore that both of you are doing well pray remember me kindly to her and believe me my dear montagu your faithful and affectionate friend                     wm wordsworth  in speaking of our bristol friends i forgot to mention john pinney but him i have neither seen nor heard of for many years206  206 memoirs ii 41112   140 from home the queen review of poems c  letter to professor reed                     nov 18 1844  my dear mr reed  mrs wordsworth and i have been absent from home for a month past and we deferred acknowledging your acceptable letter till our return among the places to which we went on visits to our friends was cambridge where i was happy to learn that great improvement was going on among the young men they were become much more regular in their conduct and attentive to their duties our host was the master of trinity college dr whewell successor to my brother dr wordsworth who filled the office for more than twenty years highly to his honour and resigned before he was disqualified by age lest as his years advanced his judgment might be impaired and his powers become unfit for the responsibility without his being aware of it this you will agree with me was a noble example may it be followed by others  on our return home we were detained two hours at northampton by the vast crowd assembled to greet the queen on her way to burleigh house shouts and ringing of bells there were in abundance but these are things of course it did please us however greatly to see every village we passed through for the space of twentytwo miles decorated with triumphal arches and every cottage however humble with its little display of laurel boughs and flowers hung from the windows and over the doors the people young and old were all making it holiday and the queen could not but be affected with these universal manifestations of affectionate loyalty as i have said we were detained two hours and i much regret that it did not strike me at the moment to throw off my feelings in verse for i had ample time to have done so and might perhaps have contrived to present through some of the authorities the tribute to my royal mistress how must these words shock your republican ears but you are too well acquainted with mankind and their history not to be aware that love of country can clothe itself in many shapes  i need not say what pleasure it would give us to see you and mrs reed in our beautiful place of abode  i have no wish to see the review of my poems to which you allude nor should i read it if it fell in my way it is too late in life for me to profit by censure and i am indifferent to praise merely as such mrs wordsworth will be happy to write her opinion of the portrait as you request                     believe me my dear mr reed                        faithfully yours                            wm wordsworth207  207 memoirs ii 41213   141 the laureateship contemporaries c tennyson  letter to professor reed                     rydal mount ambleside july 1 1845  my dear mr reed  i have as usual been long in your debt which i am pretty sure you will excuse as heretofore it gave me much pleasure to have a glimpse of your brother under circumstances which no doubt he will have described to you he spoke of his health as improved and i hope it will continue to do so i understood from him that it was probable he should call at rydal before his return to his own country i need not say to you i shall be glad truly glad to see him both for his own sake and as so nearly connected with you my absence from home lately was not of more than three weeks i took the journey to london solely to pay my respects to the queen upon my appointment to the laureateship upon the decease of my friend mr southey the weather was very cold and i caught an inflammation in one of my eyes which rendered my stay in the south very uncomfortable i nevertheless did in respect to the object of my journey all that was required the reception given me by the queen at her ball was most gracious mrs everett the wife of your minister among many others was a witness to it without knowing who i was it moved her to the shedding of tears this effect was in part produced i suppose by american habits of feeling as pertaining to a republican government to see a greyhaired man of seventyfive years of age kneeling down in a large assembly to kiss the hand of a young woman is a sight for which institutions essentially democratic do not prepare a spectator of either sex and must naturally place the opinions upon which a republic is founded and the sentiments which support it in strong contrast with a government based and upheld as ours is i am not therefore surprised that mrs everett was moved as she herself described to persons of my acquaintance among others to mr rogers the poet by the by of this gentleman now i believe in his eightythird year i saw more than of any other person except my host mr moxon while i was in london he is singularly fresh and strong for his years and his mental faculties with the exception of his memory a little not at all impaired it is remarkable that he and the rev w bowles were both distinguished as poets when i was a schoolboy and they have survived almost all their eminent contemporaries several of whom came into notice long after them since they became known burns cowper mason the author of caractacus and friend of gray have died thomas warton laureate then byron shelley keats and a good deal later208 scott coleridge crabbe southey lamb the ettrick shepherd cary the translator of dante crowe the author of lewesdon hill and others of more or less distinction have disappeared and now of english poets advanced in life i cannot recall any but james montgomery thomas moore and myself who are living except the octogenarian with whom i began  208  walter scott died 21st sept 1832 st coleridge  25th july 1834 charles lamb  27th dec 1834 geo crabbe  3rd feb 1832 felicia hemans  16th may 1835 robert southey  21st march 1843   i saw tennyson when i was in london several times he is decidedly the first of our living poets and i hope will live to give the world still better things you will be pleased to hear that he expressed in the strongest terms his gratitude to my writings to this i was far from indifferent though persuaded that he is not much in sympathy with what i should myself most value in my attempts viz the spirituality with which i have endeavoured to invest the material universe and the moral relations under which i have wished to exhibit its most ordinary appearances i ought not to conclude this first portion of my letter without telling you that i have now under my roof a cousin who some time ago was introduced improperly i think she being then a child to the notice of the public as one of the english poetesses in an article of the quarterly so entitled her name is emmeline fisher and her mother is my first cousin what advances she may have made in latter years i do not know but her productions from the age of eight to twelve were not less than astonishing she only arrived yesterday and we promise ourselves much pleasure in seeing more of her our dear friend miss fenwick is also under our roof so is katharine southey her late fathers youngest daughter so that we reckon ourselves rich though our only daughter is far from us being gone to oporto with her husband on account of her enfeebled frame and most unfortunately soon after her arrival she was seized with a violent attack of rheumatic fever caused by exposure to the evening air we have also been obliged lately to part with four grandsons very fine boys who are gone with their father to italy to visit their mother kept there by severe illness which sent her abroad two years ago under these circumstances we old people keep our spirits as well as we can trusting the end to gods goodness  now for the enclosed poem209 which i wrote the other day and which i send to you hoping it may give you some pleasure as a scanty repayment for all that we owe you our dear friend miss fenwick is especially desirous that her warmest thanks should be returned to you for all the trouble you have taken about her bonds but to return to the verses if you approve pray forward them with my compliments and thanks for his letter to  in his letter he states that with others he is strenuously exerting himself in endeavours to abolish slavery and as one of the means of disposing the public mind to that measure he is about to publish selections from various authors in behalf of humanity he begs an original composition from me i have nothing bearing directly upon slavery but if you think this little piece would serve his cause indirectly pray be so kind as to forward it to him he speaks of himself as deeply indebted to my writings  209 the poem enclosed is the westmoreland girl dated june 6 1845 the text corresponds with that in the one volume edition with the exception of the two stanzas added in the next letter and in the 1st stanza thoughtless has been substituted for simple and in the 18th is laid for must lie hr  i have not left room to subscribe myself more than                     affectionately yours                           wm wordsworth210  210 memoirs ii 41417   142 poems of imagination new edition c portrait c  letter to professor reed                     brinsop court sept 27 1845  my dear mr reed  the sight of your letter was very welcome and its contents proved most agreeable it was well that you did not forward my little poem to the party he entertaining the opinions he holds and being of the character you describe i shall therefore be gratified if you as you propose write him a note expressing that i have nothing among my mss that would suit his purpose the verses are already printed in the new edition of my poems double column which is going through the press it will contain about 300 verses not found in the previous edition i do not remember whether i have mentioned to you that following your example i have greatly extended the class entitled poems of the imagination thinking as you must have done that if imagination were predominant in the class it was not indispensable that it should pervade every poem which it contained limiting the class as i had done before seemed to imply and to the uncandid or unobserving it did so that the faculty which is the primum mobile in poetry had little to do in the estimation of the author with the pieces not arranged under that head i therefore feel much obliged to you for suggesting by your practice the plan which i have adopted in respect to the prefaces my own wish would be that now the poems should be left to speak for themselves without them but i know that this would not answer for the purposes of sale they will therefore be printed at the end of the volume and to this i am in some degree reconciled by the matter they contain relating to poetry in general and the principles they inculcate i hope that upon the whole the edition will please you in a very few instances i have altered the expression for the worse on account of the same feeling or word occurring rather too near the passage for example the sonnet on baptism begins blest be the church but unfortunately the word occurs some three or four lines just before or after i have therefore though reluctantly substituted the less impressive word dear be the church i mention this solely to prevent blame on your part in this and a few similar cases where an injurious change has been made the book will be off my hands i hope in about two weeks                                       mrs wordsworth and i left home four days ago and do not intend to return if all goes well in less than five or six weeks from this time we purpose in our way home to visit york the cathedral of which city has been restored and then we shall go to leeds on a visit to our friend mr james marshall in full expectation that we shall be highly delighted by the humane and judicious manner in which his manufactory is managed and by inspecting the schools which he and his brother have established and superintended we also promise ourselves much pleasure from the sight of the magnificent church which upon the foundation of the old parish church of that town has been built through the exertions and by the munificence of the present incumbent that excellent and able man dr hook whom i have the honour of reckoning among my friends  this letter is written by the side of my brotherinlaw who eight years ago became a cripple confined to his chair by the accident of his horse falling with him in the high road where he lay without power to move either hand or leg but left in perfect possession of his faculties his bodily sufferings are by this time somewhat abated but they still continue severe his patience and cheerfulness are so admirable that i could not forbear mentioning him to you he is an example to us all and most undeserving should we be if we did not profit by it his family have lately succeeded in persuading him to have his portrait taken as he sits in his armchair it is an excellent likeness one of the best i ever saw and will be invaluable to his family this reminds me of mr inman and a promise which he made that he would send us a copy of your portrait of myself i say a promise though it scarcely amounted to that absolutely but it was little short of it do you think he could find time to act upon his own wish in this matter in which i feel interested on mrs wordsworths account who reckons that portrait much the best both as to likeness and execution of all that have been made of me and she is an excellent judge in adverting to this subject i of course presume that you would have no objection to the picture being copied if the artist were inclined to do it  my paper admonishes me that i must conclude pray let me know in your next how mrs reed and your family are in health and present my good wishes to her                     ever your faithful and much obliged friend                       wm wordsworth211   143 of the college of maynooth c  letter to a nephew                     rydal mount june 30 1845  my dear c  i ought to have acknowledged my debt to you long ago but the inflammation in one of my eyes which seized me on my first arrival in london kept its ground for a long time i had your two first pamphlets read to me and immediately put them into circulation among my friends in this neighbourhood but wishing to read them myself i did not like to write to you till i had done so as there were one or two passages on which i wished to make a remark  211 memoirs ii 41821  as to your arguments they are unanswerable and the three tracts do you the greatest possible credit but the torrent cannot be stemmed unless we can construct a body i will not call it a party upon a new and true principle of action as you have set forth certain questions are forced by the present conduct of government upon the mind of every observing and thinking person first and foremost are we to have a national english church or is the church of england to be regarded merely as a sect and is the right to the throne to be put on a new foundation is the present ministry prepared for this and all that must precede and follow it is ireland an integral and inseparable portion of the empire or not if it be i cannot listen to the argument in favour of endowing romanism upon the ground of superiority of numbers the romanists are not a majority in england and ireland taken as they ought to be together as to scotland it has its separate kirk by especial covenant are the ministers prepared to alter fundamentally the basis of the union between england and ireland and to construct a new one if they be let them tell us so at once in short they are involving themselves and the nation in difficulties from which there is no escapefor them at least none what i have seen of your letter to lord john m i like as well as your two former tracts and i shall read it carefully at my first leisure moment212  212 memoirs ii 1512   144 of the heresiarch of the church of rome  letter to joseph cottle esq                     rydal mount dec 6 1845  my dear old friend  now for your little tract heresiarch church of rome i have perused it carefully and go the whole length with you in condemnation of romanism and probably much further by reason of my having passed at least three years of life in countries where romanism was the prevailing or exclusive religion and if we are to trust the declaration by their fruits ye shall know them i have stronger reasons in the privilege i have named for passing a severe condemnation upon leading parts of their faith and courses of their practice than others who have never been eyewitnesses of the evils to which i allude your little publication is well timed and will i trust have such an effect as you aimed at upon the minds of its readers  and now let me bid you affectionately good bye with assurance that i do and shall retain to the last a remembrance of your kindness and of the many pleasant and happy hours which at one of the most interesting periods of my life i passed in your neighbourhood and in your company                     ever most faithfully yours                          william wordsworth213  213 memoirs ii 1523   145 family trials  letter to professor reed                     rydal mount jan 23 1846  my dear mr reed                                       i hope to be able to send you an impression of an engraving from a picture of mr haydon representing me in the act of climbing helvellyn there is great merit in this work and the sight of it will show my meaning on the subject of expression this i think is attained but then i am stooping and the inclination of the head necessarily causes a foreshortening of the features below the nose which takes from the likeness accordingly so that upon the whole yours has the advantage especially under the circumstance of your never having seen the original mrs wordsworth has been looking over your letters in vain to find the address of the person in london through whose hands any parcel for you might be sent pray take the trouble of repeating the address in your next letter and your request shall be attended to of sending you my two letters upon the offensive subject of a railway to and through our beautiful neighbourhood                                       you will be sorry to hear that mrs wordsworth and i have been and still are under great trouble and anxiety our daughterinlaw fell into bad health between three and four years ago she went with her husband to madeira where they remained nearly a year she was then advised to go to italy after a prolonged residence there her six children whom her husband returned to england for went at her earnest request to that country under their fathers guidance there he was obliged on account of his duty as a clergyman to leave them four of the number resided with their mother at rome three of whom took a fever there of which the youngest as noble a boy of nearly five years as ever was seen died being seized with convulsions when the fever was somewhat subdued the father in a distracted state of mind is just gone back to italy and we are most anxious to hear the result my only surviving brother also the late master of trinity college cambridge and an inestimable person is in an alarming state of health and the only child of my eldest brother long since deceased is now languishing under mortal illness at ambleside he was educated to the medical profession and caught his illness while on duty in the mediterranean he is a truly amiable and excellent young man and will be universally regretted these sad occurrences with others of like kind have thrown my mind into a state of feeling which the other day vented itself in the two sonnets which mrs wordsworth will transcribe as the best acknowledgment she can make for mrs reeds and your kindness                     ever faithfully and affectionately

to find that my last had been despatched without acknowledgment for your kindness in sending me the admirable engraving of bishop white which i was delighted on many accounts to receive this omission was owing to the distressed state of mind in which i wrote and which i throw myself on your goodness to excuse i ought to have written again by next post but we really have been and still are in such trouble from various causes that i could not take up the pen and now must beg you to accept this statement as the only excuse which i can offer we have had such accounts from my daughterinlaw at rome that her mother and brother are just gone thither to support her her mother being seventy years of age  do you know anything of a wretched set of religionists in your country superstitionists i ought to say called mormonites or latterday saints would you believe it a niece of mrs wordsworths has just embarked we believe at liverpool with a set of the deluded followers of that wretch in an attempt to join their society her name is  a young woman of good abilities and well educated but early in life she took from her mother and her connections a methodistical turn and has gone on in a course of what she supposes to be piety till she has come to this miserable close if you should by chance hear anything about her pray let us know  the report of my brothers decease which we look for every day has not yet reached us my nephew is still lingering on from day to day                     ever faithfully and affectionately yours                            wm wordsworth  the print of bishop white

monument of governor malartie is conceived with appropriate feeling and just discrimination long may the finished monument last as a tribute to departed worth and as a check and restraint upon intemperate desires for change to which the inhabitants of the island may hereafter be liable  before this letter reaches you the newspapers will probably have told you that i have been recently put in nomination unknown to myself for the high office of lord rector of the university of glasgow and that there was a majority of twentyone votes in my favour in opposition to the premier lord john russell the forms of the election however allowed lord john russell to be returned through the single vote of the subrector voting for his superior to say the truth i am glad of this result being too advanced in life to undertake with comfort any considerable public duty and it might have seemed ungracious to decline the office  men of rank or of high station with the exception of the poet campbell who was i believe educated at this university have almost invariably been chosen for a rector of this ancient university and that another exception was made in my favour by a considerable majority affords a proof that literature independent of office does not want due estimation i should not have dwelt so long upon this subject had anything personal to myself occurred in which you could have taken interest  as you do not mention your own health or that of lady gomm i infer with pleasure that the climate agrees with you both that this may continue to be so is my earnest and sincere wish in which mrs wordsworth cordially unites                     believe me dear sir william                         faithfully yours                             william wordsworth216   148

its former situation  we are expecting mr cuthbert southey today from his curacy seven or eight miles distant he is busy in carrying through the press the first volume of his fathers letters or rather collecting and preparing them for it do you happen to have any in your possession if so be so kind as to let me or his son know what they are if you think they contain anything which would interest the public                                       mrs w and i are thank god both in good health and possessing a degree of strength beyond what is usual at our age being both in our seventyninth year

sorrow is not without heartfelt i may say heavenly consolation dear and good and faithful and dutiful jane breathed her last about twelve oclock last night the doctor had seen her at noon he found her much weaker she said to him i cannot stand now but he gave us no reason to believe her end was so very near you shall hear all particulars when we are permitted to meet which god grant may be soon nothing could be more gentle than her departure  yesterday mary read to her in my presence some chapters from the new testament and her faculties were as clear as any ones in perfect health and so

says i feel myself in so many respects unworthy of your love and too likely to become more so this was in 1844 worldlyminded i am not on the contrary my wish to benefit those within my humble sphere strengthens seemingly in exact proportion to my inability to realise those wishes what i lament most is that the spirituality of my nature does not expand and rise the nearer i approach the grave as yours does and as it fares with my beloved partner the pleasure which i derive from gods works in his visible creation is not with me i think impaired but reading does not interest me as it used to do and i feel that i am becoming daily a less instructive companion to others excuse this egotism i feel it necessary to your understanding what i am and how little you would gain by habitual intercourse with me however greatly i might benefit from intercourse with you223   153 hopefulness  writing to a friend at a time of public excitement he thus speaks after all as an excellent bishop of the scotch

         ratzeburg  no little fish thrown back again into the water no fly unimprisoned from a childs hand could more buoyantly enjoy its element than i this clean and peaceful house with this lovely view of the town groves and lake of ratzeburg from the window at which i am writing my spirits certainly and my health i fancied were beginning to sink under the noise dirt and unwholesome air of our hamburg hotel i left it on sunday sept 23rd with a letter of introduction from the poet klopstock to the amtmann of ratzeburg the amtmann received me with kindness and introduced me to the worthy pastor who agreed to board and lodge me for any length of time not less than a month the vehicle in which i took my place was considerably larger than an english stagecoach to which it bore much the same proportion and rude resemblance that an elephants ear does to the human its top was composed of naked boards of different colours and seeming to have been parts of different wainscots instead of windows there were leathern curtains with a little eye of glass in each they perfectly answered the purpose of keeping out the prospect and letting in the cold i could observe little therefore but the inns and farmhouses at which we stopped they were all alike except in size one great room like a barn with a hayloft over it the straw and hay dangling in tufts through the boards which formed the ceiling of the room and the floor of the loft from this room which is paved like a street sometimes one sometimes two smaller ones are enclosed at one end these are commonly floored in the large room the cattle pigs poultry men women and children live in amicable community yet there was an appearance of cleanliness and rustic comfort one of these houses i measured it was an hundred feet in length the apartments were taken off from one corner between these and the stalls there was a small interspace and here the breadth was fortyeight feet but thirtytwo where the stalls were of course the stalls were on each side eight feet in depth the faces of the cows c were turned towards the room indeed they were in it so that they had at least the comfort of seeing each others faces stallfeeding is universal in this part of germany a practice concerning which the agriculturist and the poet are likely to entertain opposite opinionsor at least to have very different feelings the woodwork of these buildings on the outside is left unplastered as in old houses among us and being painted red and green it cuts and tesselates the buildings very gaily from within three miles of hamburg almost to molln which is thirty miles from it the country as far as i could see it was a dead flat only varied by woods at molln it became more beautiful i observed a small lake nearly surrounded with groves and a palace in view belonging to the king of great britain and inhabited by the inspector of the forests we were nearly the same time in travelling the thirtyfive miles from hamburg to ratzeburg as we had been in going from london to yarmouth one hundred and twentysix miles  the lake of ratzeburg runs from south to north about nine miles in length and varying in breadth from three miles to half a mile about a mile from the southernmost point it is divided into two of course very unequal parts by an island which being connected by a bridge and a narrow slip of land with the one shore and by another bridge of immense length with the other shore forms a complete isthmus on this island the town of ratzeburg is built the pastors house or vicarage together with the amtmanns amtsschreibers and the church stands near the summit of a hill which slopes down to the slip of land and the little bridge from which through a superb military gate you step into the islandtown of ratzeburg this again is itself a little hill by ascending and descending which you arrive at the long bridge and so to the other shore the water to the south of the town is called the little lake which however almost engrosses the beauties of the whole the shores being just often enough green and bare to give the proper effect to the magnificent groves which occupy the greater part of their circumference from the turnings windings and indentations of the shore the views vary almost every ten steps and the whole has a sort of majestic beauty a feminine grandeur at the north of the great lake and peeping over it i see the seven church towers of lubec at the distance of twelve or thirteen miles yet as distinctly as if they were not three the only defect in the view is that ratzeburg is built entirely of red bricks and all the houses roofed with red tiles to the eye therefore it presents a clump of brickdust red yet this evening oct 10th twenty minutes past five i saw the town perfectly beautiful and the whole softened down into complete keeping if i may borrow a term from the painters the sky over ratzeburg and all the east was a pure evening blue while over the west it was covered with light sandy clouds hence a deep red light spread over the whole prospect in undisturbed harmony with the red town the brownred woods and the yellowred reeds on the skirts of the lake two or three boats with single persons paddling them floated up and down in the rich light which not only was itself in harmony with all but brought all into harmony  i should have told you that i went back to hamburg on thursday sept 27th to take leave of my friend who travels southward and returned hither on the monday following from empfelde a village half way from ratzeburg i walked to hamburg through deep sandy roads and a dreary flat the soil everywhere white hungry and excessively pulverised but the approach to the city is pleasing light cool country houses which you can look through and see the gardens behind them with arbours and trellis work and thick vegetable walls and trees in cloisters and piazzas each house with neat rails before it and green seats within the rails every object whether the growth of nature or the work of man was neat and artificial it pleased me far better than if the houses and gardens and pleasure fields had been in a nobler taste for this nobler taste would have been mere apery the busy anxious moneyloving merchant of hamburg could only have adopted he could not have enjoyed the simplicity of nature the mind begins to love nature by imitating human conveniences in nature but this is a step in intellect though a low oneand were it not so yet all around me spoke of innocent enjoyment and sensitive comforts and i entered with unscrupulous sympathy into the enjoyments and comforts even of the busy anxious moneyloving merchants of hamburg in this charitable and catholic mood i reached the vast ramparts of the city these are huge green cushions one rising above the other with trees growing in the interspaces pledges and symbols of a long peace of my return i have nothing worth communicating except that i took extra post which answers to posting in england these north german post chaises are uncovered wicker carts an english dustcart is a piece of finery a chef doeuvre of mechanism compared with them and the horsesa savage might use their ribs instead of his fingers for a numeration table wherever we stopped the postilion fed his cattle with the brown rye bread of which he eat himself all breakfasting together only the horses had no gin to their water and the postilion no water to his gin now and henceforward for subjects of more interest to you and to the objects in search of which i loft you namely the literati and literature of germany  believe me i walked with an impression of awe on my spirits as w and myself accompanied mr klopstock to the house of his brother the poet which stands about a quarter of a mile from the city gate it is one of a row of little commonplace summerhouses for so they looked with four or five rows of young meagre elm trees before the windows beyond which is a green and then a dead flat intersected with several roads whatever beauty thought i may be before the poets eyes at present it must certainly be purely of his own creation we waited a few minutes in a neat little parlour ornamented with the figures of two of the muses and with prints the subjects of which were from klopstocks odes225  225 there is a rhetorical amplitude and brilliancy in the messias says mr carlyle which elicits in our critic mr taylor an instinct truer than his philosophy is neither has the still purer spirit of klopstocks odes escaped him perhaps there is no writing in our language that offers so correct an emblem of him as this analysis i remember thinking taylors clear outline of the messias the most satisfying account of a poem i ever read it fills the mind with a vision of pomp and magnificence which it is pleasanter to contemplate as it were from afar massed together in that general survey than to examine part by part mr taylor and mr carlyle agree in exalting that ode of klopstocks in which he represents the muse of britain and the muse of germany running a race the piece seems to me more rhetorical than strictly poetical and if the younger muses power of keeping up the race depends on productions of this sort i would not give a penny for her chance at least if the contest relates to pure poetry klopstocks herman mentioned afterwards consists of three chorusdramas as mr taylor calls them the battle of herman herman and the princes and the death of herman herman is the arminius of the roman historians sc  the poet entered i was much disappointed in his countenance and recognised in it no likeness to the bust there was no comprehension in the forehead no weight over the eyebrows no expression of peculiarity moral or intellectual on the eyes no massiveness in the general countenance he is if anything rather below the middle size he wore very large halfboots which his legs filled so fearfully were they swollen however though neither w nor myself could discover any indications of sublimity or enthusiasm in his physiognomy we were both equally impressed with his liveliness and his kind and ready courtesy he talked in french with my friend and with difficulty spoke a few sentences to me in english his enunciation was not in the least affected by the entire want of his upper teeth the conversation began on his part by the expression of his rapture at the surrender of the detachment of french troops under general humbert their proceedings in ireland with regard to the committee which they had appointed with the rest of their organizing system seemed to have given the poet great entertainment he then declared his sanguine belief in nelsons victory and anticipated its confirmation with a keen and triumphant pleasure his words tones looks implied the most vehement antigallicanism the subject changed to literature and i inquired in latin concerning the history of german poetry and the elder german poets to my great astonishment he confessed that he knew very little on the subject he had indeed occasionally read one or two of their elder writers but not so as to enable him to speak of their merits professor ebeling he said would probably give me every information of this kind the subject had not particularly excited his curiosity he then talked of milton and glover and thought glovers blank verse superiour to miltons226  226 leonidus an epic poem by r glover first appeared in may 1737 in the fifth edition published in 1770 it was corrected and extended from nine books to twelve glover was the author of boadicea and medea tragedies which had some success on the stage i believe that leonidas has more merit in the conduct of the design and in the delineation of character than as poetry  he write an epic poem said thomson who never saw a mountain glover had seen the sun and moon yet he seems to have looked for their poetical aspects in homer and milton rather than in the sky there is not a single simile in leonidas says lyttleton that is borrowed from any of the ancients and yet there is hardly any poem that has such a variety of beautiful comparisons the similes of milton come so flat and dry out of glovers mangle that they are indeed quite another thing from what they appear in the poems of that immortal ex gr       like wintry clouds which opening for a time      tinge their black folds with gleams of scattered light  is not this miltons silver lining stretched and mangled      the queen of night     gleamd from the centre of th etherial vault     and oer the raven plumes of darkness shed     her placid light  this is flattened from the wellknown passage in comus      soon will savage mars     deform the lovely ringlets of thy shrubs  a genteel improvement upon miltons bush with frizzled hair implicit then we have      delicious to the sight     soft dales meandring show their flowery laps     among rude piles of nature  spoiled from      the flowery lap     of some irriguous valley spread its store  thus does this poet shatter and dissolve the blooming sprays of another mans plantation instead of pushing through them some new shoots of his own to crown them with fresh blossoms  milton himself borrowed as much as glover aye ten times more yet every passage in his poetry is miltonicmore than anything else on the other hand his imitators miltonize yet produce nothing worthy of milton the important characteristic of whose writings my father well expressed when he said the reader of milton must be always on his duty he is surrounded with sense a man must have his sense to imitate him worthily how we look through his words at the deluge as he floods it upon us in book xi l 73853the attic bees produce honey so flavoured with the thyme of hymettus that it is scarcely eatable though to smell the herb itself in a breezy walk upon that celebrated mount would be an exceeding pleasure thus certain epic poems are overpoweringly flavoured with herbs of milton while yet the fragrant balm and fresh breeze of his poetry is not to be found in them sc  w and myself expressed our surprise and my friend gave his definition and notion of harmonious verse that it consisted the english iambic blank verse above all in the apt arrangement of pauses and cadences and the sweep of whole paragraphs      with many a winding bout     of linked sweetness long drawn out  and not in the even flow much less in the prominence or antithetic vigour of single lines which were indeed injurious to the total effect except where they were introduced for some specific purpose klopstock assented and said that he meant to confine glovers superiority to single lines227  227 the abrupt and laconic structure of glovers periods appears at the very commencement of leonidas which has something military in its movement but rather the stiff gait of the drilled soldier than the proud march of the martial hero       the virtuous spartan who resignd his life      to save his country at th oetaen straits      thermopylae when all the peopled east      in arms with xerxes filled the grecian plains      o muse record the hellespont they passed      oerpowering thrace the dreadful tidings swift      to corinth flew her isthmus was the seat      of grecian council orpheus thence returns      to lacedaemon in assembly full c  glovers best passages are of a soft character this is a pleasing homerism                                   lycis dies      for boistrous war illchosen he was skilld      to tune the lulling flute and melt the heart      or with

                placid were his days      which flowd through blessings as a river pure      whose sides are flowery and whose meadows fair      meets in his course a subterranean void      there dips his silver head again to rise      and rising glide through flowrs and meadows new      so shall oïleus in those happier fields      where never tempests roar nor humid clouds      in mists dissolve nor white descending flakes      of winter violate th eternal green      where never gloom of trouble shades the mind      nor gust of passion heaves the quiet breast      nor dews of grief are sprinkled     bk x sc   he told us that he had read milton in a prose translation when he was fourteen228 i understood him thus myself and w interpreted klopstocks french as i had already construed it he appeared to know very little of milton or indeed of our poets in general he spoke with great indignation of the english prose translation of his messiah all the translations had been bad very badbut the english was no translationthere were pages on pages not in the original and half the original was not to be found in the translation w told him that i intended to translate a few of his odes as specimens of german lyricshe then said to me in english i wish you would render into english some select passages of the messiah and revenge me of your countryman    228 this was accidentally confirmed to me by an old german gentleman at helmstadt who had been klopstocks school and bedfellow among other boyish anecdotes he related that the young poet set a particular value on a translation of the paradise lost and always slept with it under his pillow  it was the liveliest thing which he produced in the whole conversation he told us that his first ode was fifty years older than his last i looked at him with much emotioni considered him as the venerable father of german poetry as a good man as a christian seventyfour years old with legs enormously swollen yet active lively cheerful and kind and communicative my eyes felt as if a tear were swelling into them in the portrait of lessing there was a toupee periwig which enormously injured the effect of his physiognomyklopstock wore the same powdered and frizzled by the bye old men ought never to wear powderthe contrast between a large snowwhite wig and the colour of an old mans skin is disgusting and wrinkles in such a neighbourhood appear only channels for dirt it is an honour to poets and great men that you think of them as parts of nature and anything of trick and fashion wounds you in them as much as when you see venerable yews clipped into miserable peacocksthe author of the messiah should have worn his own grey hairhis powder and periwig were to the eye what mr virgil would be to the ear  klopstock dwelt much on the superiour power which the german language possessed of concentrating meaning he said he had often translated parts of homer and virgil line by line and a german line proved always sufficient for a greek or latin one in english you cannot do this i answered that in english we could commonly render one greek heroic line in a line and a half of our common heroic metre and i conjectured that this line and a half would be found to contain no more syllables than one german or greek hexameter he did not understand me229 and i who wished to hear his opinions not to correct them was glad that he did not  229 klopstocks observation was partly true and partly erroneous in the literal sense of his words and if we confine the comparison to the average of space required for the expression of the same thought in the two languages it is erroneous i have translated some german hexameters into english hexameters and find that on the average three english lines will express four lines german the reason is evident our language abounds in monosyllables and dissyllables the german not less than the greek is a polysyllable language but in another point of view the remark was not without foundation for the german possessing the same unlimited privilege of forming compounds both with prepositions and with epithets as the greek it can express the richest single greek word in a single german one and is thus freed from the necessity of weak or ungraceful paraphrases i will content myself with one example at present viz the use of the prefixed participles ver zer ent and weg thus reissen to rend verreissen to rend away zerreissen to rend to pieces entreissen to rend off or out of a thing in the active sense or schmelzen to meltver zer ent schmelzenand in like manner through all the verbs neuter and active if you consider only how much we should feel the loss of the prefix be as in bedropt besprinkle besot especially in our poetical language and then think that this same mode of composition is carried through all their simple and compound prepositions and many of their adverbs and that with most of these the germans have the same privilege as we have of dividing them from the verb and placing them at the end of the sentence you will have no difficulty in comprehending the reality and the cause of this superior power in the german of condensing meaning in which its great poet exulted it is impossible to read half a dozen pages of wieland without perceiving that in this respect the german has no rival but the greek and yet i feel that concentration or condensation is not the happiest mode of expressing this excellence which seems to consist not so much in the less time required for conveying an impression as in the unity and simultaneousness with which the impression is conveyed it tends to make their language more picturesque it depictures images better we have obtained this power in part by our compound verbs derived from the latin and the sense of its great effect no doubt induced our milton both to the use and the abuse of latin derivatives but still these prefixed particles conveying no separate or separable meaning to the mere english reader cannot possibly act on the mind with the force or liveliness of an original and homogeneous language such as the german is and besides are confined to certain words  we now took our leave at the beginning of the french revolution klopstock wrote odes of congratulation he received some honorary presents from the french republic a golden crown i believe and like our priestley was invited to a seat in the legislature which he declined but when french liberty metamorphosed herself into a fury he sent back these presents with a palinodia declaring his abhorrence of their proceedings and since then he has been perhaps more than enough an antigallican i mean that in his just contempt and detestation of the crimes and follies of the revolutionists he suffers himself to forget that the revolution itself is a process of the divine providence and that as the folly of men is the wisdom of god so are their iniquities instruments of his goodness from klopstocks house we walked to the ramparts discoursing together on the poet and his conversation till our attention was diverted to the beauty and singularity of the sunset and its effects on the objects around us there were woods in the distance a rich sandy light nay of a much deeper colour than sandy lay over these woods that blackened in the blaze over that part of the woods which lay immediately under the intenser light a brassy mist floated the trees on the ramparts and the people moving to and fro between them were cut or divided into equal segments of deep shade and brassy light had the trees and the bodies of the men and women been divided into equal segments by a rule or pair of compasses the portions could not have been more regular all else was obscure it was a fairy sceneand to increase its romantic character among the moving objects thus divided into alternate shade and brightness was a beautiful child dressed with the elegant simplicity of an english child riding on a stately goat the saddle bridle and other accoutrements of which were in a high degree costly and splendid before i quit the subject of hamburg let me say that i remained a day or two longer than i otherwise should have done in order to be present at the feast of st michael the patron saint of hamburg expecting to see the civic pomp of this commercial republic i was however disappointed there were no processions two or three sermons were preached to two or three old women in two or three churches and st michael and his patronage wished elsewhere by the higher classes all places of entertainment theatre c being shut up on this day in hamburg there seems to be no religion at all in lubec it is confined to the women the men seem determined to be divorced from their wives in the other world if they cannot in this you will not easily conceive a more singular sight than is presented by the vast aisle of the principal church at lubec seen from the organloft for being filled with female servants and persons in the same class of life and all their caps having gold and silver cauls it appears like a rich pavement of gold and silver  i will conclude this letter with the mere transcription of notes which my friend w made of his conversations with klopstock during the interviews that took place after my departure on these i shall make but one remark at present and that will appear a presumptuous one namely that klopstocks remarks on the venerable sage of königsburg are to my own knowledge injurious and mistaken and so far is it from being true that his system is now given up that throughout the universities of germany there is not a single professor who is not either a kantean or a disciple of fichte whose system is built on the kantean and presupposes its truth or lastly who though an antagonist of kant as to his theoretical work has not embraced wholly or in part his moral system and adopted part of his nomenclature klopstock having wished to see the calvary of cumberland and asked what was thought of it in england i went to remnants the english bookseller where i procured the analytical review in which is contained the review of cumberlands calvary i remembered to have read there some specimens of a blank verse translation of the messiah i had mentioned this to klopstock and he had a great desire to see them i walked over to his house and put the book into his hands on adverting to his own poem he told me he began the messiah when he was seventeen he devoted three entire years to the plan without composing a single line he was greatly at a loss in what manner to execute his work there were no successful specimens of versification in the german language before this time the first three cantos he wrote in a species of measured or numerous prose this though done with much labour and some success was far from satisfying him he had composed hexameters both latin and greek as a school exercise and there had been also in the german language attempts in that style of versification these were only of very moderate meritone day he was struck with the idea of what could be done in this wayhe kept his room a whole day even went without his dinner and found that in the evening he had written twentythree hexameters versifying a part of what he had before written in prose from that time pleased with his efforts he composed no more in prose today he informed me that he had finished his plan before he read milton he was enchanted to see an author who before him had trod the same path this is a contradiction of what he said before he did not wish to speak of his poem to any one till it was finished but some of his friends who had seen what he had finished tormented him till he had consented to publish a few books in a journal he was then i believe very young about twentyfive the rest was printed at different periods four books at a time the reception given to the first specimens was highly flattering he was nearly thirty years in finishing the whole poem but of these thirty years not more than two were employed in the composition he only composed in favourable moments besides he had other occupations he values himself upon the plan of his odes and accuses the modern lyrical writers of gross deficiency in this respect i laid the same accusation against horace he would not hear of itbut waived the discussion he called rousseaus ode to fortune a moral dissertation in stanzas230 i spoke of drydens st cecilia but be did not seem familiar with our writers he wished to know the distinctions between our dramatic and epic blank verse  230 a la fortune liv ii ode vi oeuvres de jean baptiste rousseau p121 edit 1820 one of the latter strophes of this ode concludes with two lines which as the editor observes have become a proverb and of which the thought and expression are borrowed from lucretius cripitur persona manet res iii v 58       montrez nous guerriers magnanimes      votre vertu dans

a great mystic poet after referring to the vain complaints and maledictions of men against this power he beautifully concludes       ma ella sè beata e ciò non ode      con laltre prime creature lieta      volve sua spera e beata si gode  jb rousseau was born in 1669 began his career at the close of the age of louis quatorze died at brussels march 17 1741 he had been banished from france by an intrigue on a false charge as now seems clear of having composed and distributed defamatory verses in 1712 and it was engraved upon his tomb that he was thirty years an object of envy and thirty of compassion belonging to the classical school of the 17th century of which he was the last survivor he came somewhat into conflict with the spirit of the 18th which was preparing a new vintage and would have none but new wine in new bottles rousseau however was a very finished writer in his way and has been compared to pindar horace anacreon and malherbe his ode to m le comte du luc is as fine an example as i know of the modern classical style this is quite different from that which is exemplified in wordsworths laodamia and serjeant talfourds ion for in them the subjects only are ancient while both the form and spirit are modern whereas in the odes of rousseau a modern subject is treated as far as difference of times and language will allow in the manner and tone of the ancients samson agonistes and goethes iphigenia in tauris are conformed to ancient modes of thought but in them the subject also is taken from antiquity rousseaus works consist of odes epistles in verse cantatas epigrams c c he wrote for the stage at the beginning of his literary life but with no great success sc  he recommended me to read his hermann before i read either the messiah or the odes he flattered himself that some time or other his dramatic poems would be known in england he had not heard of cowper he thought that voss in his translation of the iliad had done violence to the idiom of the germans and had sacrificed it to the greeks not remembering sufficiently that each language has its particular spirit and genius231 he said lessing was the first of their dramatic writers i complained of nathan as tedious he said there was not enough of action in it but that lessing was the most chaste of their writers he spoke favourably of goethe but said that his sorrows of werter was his best work better than any of his dramas he preferred the first written to the rest of goethes dramas schillers robbers he found so extravagant that he could not read it i spoke of the scene of the setting sun232 he did not know it he said schiller could not live he thought don carlos the best of his dramas but said that the plot was inextricableit was evident he knew little of schillers works indeed he said he could not read them bürger he said was a true poet and would live that schiller on the contrary must soon be forgotten that he gave himself up to the imitation of shakespeare who often was extravagant but that schiller was ten thousand times more so233  231 voss who lived from feb 20 1751 to march 1826 was author of the luise a rural epopaea of simple structure divided into three idyls which relate the betrothment and marriage of the heroine this is a pleasing and very peculiar poem composed in hexameter verse the charm of the narrative says mr t consists in the minute description of the local domestic manners of the personages the charm consists i think in the blending of these manners with the beauty of nature and the ease and suitability of the versification vosss translation of the odyssey is praised for being so perfect an imitation of the original the greek has been rendered with a fidelity and imitative harmony so admirable that it suggests to the scholar the original wording and reflects as from a mirror every beauty and every blemish of the ancient poem hist survey pp 6168 s c  232 act iii sc 2 the night scene which is the 5th of act iv is fine too in a frantic way the songs it contains are very spirited that sung by the robbers is worthy of a thug it goes beyond our notions of any european bandit and transports us to the land of jaggernat s c  233 the works of bürger who was born on the first day of 1748 died june 8 1794 consist of poems 2 vols macbeth altered from shakespeare pronounced by taylorno good judge of shakespearein some respects superiour to the original munchaüsens travels translations of the six first books of the iliad and some others papers philological and political his fame rests chiefly on three ballads the wild hunter the parsons daughter and lenore the powerful diction and admirable harmonyrhythm sound rhyme of these compositions mr taylor describes as the result of laborious art it strikes me from the outline which he has given of bürgers history that the violent feelings the lifelike expression of which constitutes their power and value may have been partly the reflex of the poets own mind his seems to have been a life of mismanagement from youth till middle age like milton he lost a beloved second wife by childbed in the first year of marriage like him he married a third time but without his special necessityblindness and unkind daughters he wedded a lady who had fallen in love with his poetry or perhaps his poetical reputation an union founded as it appears in vanity ended in vexation of spirit and as death which had deprived him of two wives did not release him from a third he obtained his freedom at the end of little more than three years from a court of justice why did klopstock undervalue by preference of such a poet the loftyminded schillerthe dearest to england of all german bards perhaps because the author of wallenstein was a philosopher and had many things in his philosophy which the author of the messiah could not find in his heaven and earth sc  he spoke very slightingly of kotzebue as an immoral author in the first place and next as deficient in power at vienna said he they are transported with him but we do not reckon the people of vienna either the wisest or the wittiest people of germany he said wieland was a charming author and a sovereign master of his own language that in this respect goethe could not be compared to him nor indeed could any body else he said that his fault was to be fertile to exuberance i told him the oberon had just been translated into english he asked me if i was not delighted with the poem i answered that i thought the story began to flag about the seventh or eighth book and observed that it was unworthy of a man of genius to make the interest of a long poem turn entirely upon animal gratification he seemed at first disposed to excuse this by saying that there are different subjects for poetry and that poets are not willing to be restricted in their choice i answered that i thought the passion of love as well suited to the purposes of poetry as any other passion but that it was a cheap way of pleasing to fix the attention of the reader through a long poem on the mere appetite well but said he you see that such poems please every body i answered that it was the province of a great poet to raise people up to his own level not to descend to theirs he agreed and confessed that on no account whatsoever would he have written a work like the oberon he spoke in raptures of wielands style and pointed out the passage where retzia is delivered of her child as exquisitely beautiful234    234 oberon canto viii stanzas 6980 the little touch about the new born babes returning its mothers kiss is very romantic though put modestly in the form of a query           und scheint nicht jeden kuss      sein kleiner mund dem ihren zu entsaugen  the word entsaugen suck off is expressiveit very naturally characterises the kiss of an infant five minutes of age wieland had great nursery experience my sweetest hours says he in a letter quoted in the survey are those in which i see about me in all their glee of childhood my whole posse of little halfway things between apes and angels  mr sothebys translation of the oberon made the poem popular in this country the original first appeared in 1780 s c  i said that i did not perceive any very striking passages but that i made allowance for the imperfections of a translation of the thefts of wieland he said they were so exquisitely managed that the greatest writers might be proud to steal as he did he considered the books and fables of old romance writers in the light of the ancient mythology as a sort of common property from which a man was free to take whatever he could make a good use of an englishman had presented him with the odes of collins which he had read with pleasure he knew little or nothing of gray except his elegy written in a country churchyard he complained of the fool in lear i observed that he seemed to give a terrible wildness to the distress but still he complained he asked whether it was not allowed that pope had written rhymed poetry with more skill than any of our writersi said i preferred dryden because his couplets had greater variety in their movement he thought my reason a good one but asked whether the rhyme of pope were not more exact this question i understood as applying to the final terminations and observed to him that i believed it was the case but that i thought it was easy to excuse some inaccuracy in the final sounds if the general sweep of the verse was superiour i told him that we were not so exact with regard to the final endings of lines as the french he did not seem to know that we made no distinction between masculine and feminine ie single or double rhymes at least he put inquiries to me on this subject he seemed to think that no language could be so far formed as that it might not be enriched by idioms borrowed from another tongue i said this was a very dangerous practice and added that i thought milton had often injured both his prose and verse by taking this liberty too frequently i recommended to him the prose works of dryden as models of pure and native english i was treading upon tender ground as i have reason to suppose that he has himself liberally indulged in the practice  the same day i dined at mr klopstocks where i had the pleasure of a third interview with the poet we talked principally about indifferent things i asked him what he thought of kant he said that his reputation was much on the decline in germany that for his own part he was not surprised to find it so as the works of kant were to him utterly incomprehensiblethat he had often been pestered by the kanteans but was rarely in the practice of arguing with them his custom was to produce the book open it and point to a passage and beg they would explain it this they ordinarily attempted to do by substituting their own ideas i do not want i say an explanation of your own ideas but of the passage which is before us in this way i generally bring the dispute to an immediate conclusion he spoke of wolfe as the first metaphysician they had in germany wolfe had followers but they could hardly be called a sect and luckily till the appearance of kant about fifteen years ago germany had not been pestered by any sect of philosophers whatsoever but that each man had separately pursued his inquiries uncontrolled by the dogmas of a master kant had appeared ambitious to be the founder of a sect that he had succeeded but that the germans were now coming to their senses again that nicolai and engel had in different ways contributed to disenchant the nation235 but above all the incomprehensibility of the philosopher and his philosophy he seemed pleased to hear that as yet kants doctrines had not met with many admirers in englanddid not doubt but that we had too much wisdom to be duped by a writer who set at defiance the common sense and common understandings of men we talked of tragedy he seemed to rate highly the power of exciting tearsi said that nothing was more easy than to deluge an audience that it was done every day by the meanest writers  i must remind you my friend first that these notes are not intended as specimens of klopstocks intellectual power or even colloquial prowess to judge of which by an accidental conversation and this with strangers and those two foreigners would be not only unreasonable but calumnious secondly i attribute little other interest to the remarks than what is derived from the celebrity of the person who made them lastly if you ask me whether i have read the messiah and what i think of it i answeras yet the first four books only and as to my opinionthe reasons of which hereafteryou may guess it from what i could not help muttering to myself when the good pastor this morning told me that klopstock was the german miltona very german milton indeedheaven preserve you and                               st coleridge  235 these disenchanters put one in mind of the ratcatchers who are said and supposed to rid houses of rats and yet the rats somehow or other continue to swarm the kantean rats were not aware i believe when klopstock spoke thus of the extermination that had befallen them and even to this day those acute animals infest the old house and steal away the daily bread of the childrenif the old notions of space and time and the old proofs of religious verities by way of the understanding and speculative reason must be called such whether or no these are their true spiritual sustenance or the necessary guard and vehicle of it is perhaps a question  but who were nicolai and engel and what did they against the famous enchanter the former was born in 1733 at berlin where he carried on his fathers business of bookselling pursued literature with marked success and attained to old age full of literary honours by means of three critical journals the literaturbriefe the bibliothek der schönen wissenschaftern and the allgemeine deutsche bibliothek which he conducted with the powerful cooperation of lessing and of his intimate friend mendelssohn and to which he contributed largely himself he became very considerable in the german world of letters and so continued for the space of twenty years jördens in his lexicon speaks highly of the effect of nicolais writings in promoting freedom of thought enlightened views in theology and philosophy and a sound taste in fine literaturedescribes him as a brave battler with intolerance hypocrisy and confused conceptions in religion with empty subtleties obscurities and terminologies that can but issue in vain fantasies in his controversial writings on the sonamed critical philosophy he engaged with the kritik der reinen vernunft on its appearance in 1781 in the allgemeine deutsche bibliothek first explained his objections to it in the 11th vol of his reisebeschreibung description of a journey through germany and switzerland in the year 1781 and afterwards in his romance entitled the life and opinions of sempronius gundibert a german philosopher sought to set forth the childish crotchets and abuses imputable to many disciples of this philosophy in their native absurdity the ratsbone alluded to by klopstock was doubtless contained in the abovenamed romance which the old poet probably esteemed more than nicolais more serious polemics  gundibert has had its day but in a fiction destined to a day of longer durationgoethes faustthe satirist is himself most effectively satirised there he is in that strange yet beautiful temple pinned to the wall in a ridiculous attitude to be laughed at as long as the temple itself is visited and admired this doom came upon him not so much for his campaign against the kanteans as for his joys of werterbecause he had dared to ridicule a book which certainly offered no small temptations to the parodist indeed he seems to have been engaged in a series of hostilities with fichte lavater wieland herder and goethe  see mr haywards excellent translation of faust of which i have heard a literary german say that it gave a better notion of the original than any other which he had seen   in the walpurgisnacht of the faust he thus addresses the goblin dancers       ihr seyd noch immer da nein das ist unerhört      verschwindet doch wir haben ja aufgeklärt       fly vanish unheard of impudence what still there      in this enlightened age too when you have been      proved not to existshelleys translation  do we not see the doughty reviewer before us magisterially waving his hand and commanding the apparitions to

stream forth from my contemporarys brains how are we still haunted the speech of faust concerning him is mistranslated by shelley who understood the humour of the piece as well as the poetry but not the particular humours of it nothing can be more expressive of a conceited narrowminded reviewer oh hehe is absolutely everywherewhat others dance he must decide upon if he cant chatter about every step tis as good as not made at all nothing provokes him so much as when we go forward if youd turn round and round in a circle as he does in his old mill hed approve of that perhaps especially if youd consult him about it  a man of such spirited habitudes says mr carlyle after affirming that nicolai wrote against kants philosophy without comprehending it and judged of poetry as of brunswick mum by its utility is now by the germans called a philister nicolai earned for himself the painful preeminence of being erz philister arch philistine he an old enemy of goethes says mr hill in explanation of the title in which he appears in the walpurgisnacht had published an account of his phantasmal illusions pointing them against fichtes system of idealism which he evidently confounded with what coleridge would have called subjective idolism  such was this wondrous disenchanter in the eyes of later critics than klopstock a man strong enough to maintain a long fight against genius not wise enough to believe in it and befriend it how many a controversialist seems a mighty giant to those who are predisposed to his opinions while in the eyes of others he is but a blind floundering polyphemus who knows not how to direct his heavy blows if not a menacing scarecrow with a stake in his hand which he has no power to drive home i remember reading a thin volume in which all metaphysicians that had ever left their thoughts behind them were declared utterly in the wrongall up to but not including the valiant author himself the world had lain in darkness till he appeared like a new phoebus on the scene this great man despatched kants systemnever having read a syllable of any work of kantsin a page and a quarter and the exploit had its celebraters and admirers yet strange to say the metaphysical world went on just as if nothing had happenedafter the sun was up it went groping about as if it had never been enlightened and actually ever since has continued to talk as if locke berkeley hume kant and other metaphysicians understood the nature of the things they wrote about rather more than the mass of mankind instead of less verschwindet doch might this author say as nicolai said to the spectres of the brocken and the phantoms of literature       verschwindet doch wir haben ja aufgeklärt  engel opposed kant in philosophical treatises one of which is entitled zwei gerpräche den werth der kritik betreffend he too occupied a considerable space in literaturehis works fill twelve volumes besides a few other pieces to him says jördens the criticism of taste and of art speculative practical and popular philosophy owe many of their later advances in germany jördens pronounces his romance entitled lorenz stark a masterpiece in its way and says of his plays that they deserve a place beside the best of lessings he was the author of a miscellaneous work entitled the philosopher for the world and is praised by cousin as a meritorious anthropologist engel was born september 11 1741 at parchim of which his father was pastor in mecklenburgschwerin died june 28 1802 neither nicolai nor engel is noticed by cousin among the adversaries of kants doctrine the intelligent adversarieswho assailed it with skill and knowledge rather proved its strength than discovered its weakness fortius acri ridiculum but this applies only to transient triumphs where the object of attack though it furnishes occasion for ridicule affords no just cause for it sc                                        b personal reminiscences 1836 by the hon mr justice coleridge  in the summer of 1836 i went on the northern circuit with baron parke we took bowness and storrs in our way from appleby to lancaster and i visited wordsworth and my dear friend arnold from storrs it was my fortune to have to try the great hornby castle cause as it was called this i did at the end of the circuit returning from liverpool to lancaster for the purpose arnold was kind enough to lend me his house foxhow for the vacation and when the circuit ended my wife and children accompanied me to it and we remained there six weeks during that time mr and mrs wordsworth were our only neighbours and we scarcely saw any one besides but we needed no other addition to the lovely and loveable country in which we were he was extremely kind both in telling us where to go and very often going with us he was engaged in correcting the press for a new edition of his poems the london post i think went out at 2 pm and then he would say he was at our service a walk with him in that country was a real treat i never met with a man who seemed to know a country and the people so well or to love them better nor one who had such exquisite taste for rural scenery he had evidently cultivated it with great care he not only admired the beauties but he could tell you what were the peculiar features in each scene or what the incidents to which it owed its peculiar charm he combined beyond any man with whom i ever met the unsophisticated poetic delight in the beauties of nature with a somewhat artistic skill in developing the sources and conditions of them in examining the parts of a landscape he would be minute and he dealt with shrubs flowerbeds and lawns with the readiness of a practiced landscapegardener his own little grounds afforded a beautiful specimen of his skill in this latter respect and it was curious to see how he had imparted the same faculty in some measure to his gardenerjames dixon i think was his name i found them together one morning in the little lawn by the mount james and i said he are in a puzzle here the grass here has spots which offend the eye and i told him we must cover them with soaplees that he says will make the green there darker than the rest then i said we must cover the whole he objected that will not do with reference to the little lawn to which you pass from this cover that i said to which he replies you will have an unpleasant contrast with the foliage surrounding it  beside this warm feeling and exquisite taste which made him so delightful a guide his favourite spots had a human interest engrafted on themsome tradition some incident some connection with his own poetry or himself or some dear friend these he brought out in a striking way apart from these he was well pleased to discourse on poetry or poets and here appeared to me to be his principal scholarship he was extremely well read in english poetry and he would in his walk review a poem or a poet with admirable precision and fairness he did not intrude his own poetry or himself but he did not decline to talk about either and he spoke of both simply unboastingly and yet with a manly consciousness of their worth it was clear he thought he had achieved a high place among poets it had been the aim of his life humanly speaking and he had taken worthy pains to accomplish and prepare himself for the enterprise he never would sacrifice anything he thought right on reflection merely to secure present popularity or avert criticism which he thought unfounded but he was a severe critic on himself and would not leave a line or an expression with which he was dissatisfied until he had brought it to what he liked he thought this due to the gift of poetry and the character of the poet carelessness in the finish of composition he seemed to look on almost as an offence i remember well that after speaking with love and delight of a very popular volume of poetry he yet found great fault with the want of correctness and finish reciting one of the poems and pointing out inaccuracies in it he said i like the volume so much that if i was the author i think i should never rest till i had nearly rewritten it no doubt he carried this in his own case to excess when he corrected so largely in the decline of life poems written in early manhood under a state of feelings and powers which it was impossible to reproduce and yet which was necessary generally speaking for successful alteration i cannot but agree with many who think that on this account the earlier copies of his poems are more valuable than the later  1836 september wednesday 21wordsworth and i started in my carriage for lowther crossed kirkstone to paterdale by ulleswater going through the glenridding walks236 and calling at hallsteads we reached the castle time enough before dinner for him to give me a walk  236 i remember well asking him if we were not trespassing on private pleasuregrounds here he said no the walks had indeed been inclosed but he remembered them open to the public and he always went through them when he chose at lowther we found among the visitors the late lord w and describing our walk he made the same observation that we had been trespassing but wordsworth maintained his point with somewhat more warmth than i either liked or could well account for but afterwards when we were alone he told me he had purposely answered lord w stoutly and warmly because he had done a similar thing with regard to some grounds in the neighbourhood of penrith and excluded the people of penrith from walking where they had always enjoyed the right before he had evidently a pleasure in vindicating these rights and seemed to think it a duty jtc  after luncheon on thursday 22d we had an open carriage and proceeded to haweswater it is a fine lake entirely unspoilt by bad taste on one side the bank rises high and steep and is well clothed with wood on the other it is bare and more sloping wordsworth conveyed a personal interest in it to me by telling me that it was the first lake which my uncle237 had seen on his coming into this country he was in company with wordsworth and his brother john wordsworth pointed out to me somewhere about the spot on the hillside a little out of the track from which they first saw the lake and said he well remembered how his face brightened and how much delight he appeared to feel yesterday morning we returned to this place we called on our way and took our luncheon at hallsteads and also called at paterdale hall at both it was gratifying to see the cordial manner of ws reception he seemed loved and honoured and his manner was of easy hearty kindness to them  237 see memoirs vol i pp 1478  my tour with him was very agreeable and i wish i could preserve in my memory more of his conversation than i shall be able to do i was anxious to get from him anecdotes of himself and my uncle and of their works he told me of himself that his first verses were a popian copy written at school on the pleasure of change then he wrote another on the second centenary of the schools foundation that he had written these verses on the holidays and on the return to school that he was rather the poet of the school the first verses from which he remembered to have received great pleasure were miss carters poem on spring a poem in the sixline stanza which he was particularly fond of and had composed much in for example ruth he said there was some foundation in fact however slight for every poem he had written of a narrative kind so slight indeed sometimes as hardly to deserve the name for example the somnambulist was wholly built on the fact of a girl at lyulphs tower being a sleepwalker and the water lily on a ship bearing that name michael was founded on the son of an old couple having become dissolute and run away from his parents and on an old shepherd having been seven years in building up a sheepfold in a solitary valley the brothers on a young shepherd in his sleep having fallen down a crag his staff remaining suspended midway many incidents he seemed to have drawn from the narration of mrs wordsworth or his sister ellen for example in the excursion and they must have told their stories well for he said his principle had been to give the oral part as nearly as he could in the very words of the speakers where he narrated a real story dropping of course all vulgarisms or provincialisms and borrowing sometimes a bible turn of expression these former were mere accidents not essential to the truth in representing how the human heart and passions worked and to give these last faithfully was his object if he was to have any name hereafter his hope was on this and he did think he had in some instances succeeded238 that the sale of his poems increased among the classes below the middle and he had had constantly statements made to him of the effect produced in reading michael and other such of his poems i added my testimony of being unable to read it aloud without interruption from my own feelings she was a phantom of delight he said was written on his dear wife of whom he spoke in the sweetest manner a manner full of the warmest love and admiration yet with delicacy and reserve he very much and repeatedly regretted that my uncle had written so little verse he thought him so eminently qualified by his very nice ear his great skill in metre and his wonderful power and happiness of expression he attributed in part his writing so little to the extreme care and labour which he applied in elaborating his metres he said that when he was intent on a new experiment in metre the time and labour he bestowed were inconceivable that he was quite an epicure in sound latterly he thought he had so much acquired the habit of analysing his feelings and making them matter for a theory or argument that he had rather dimmed his delight in the beauties of nature and injured his poetical powers he said he had no idea how christabelle was to have been finished and he did not think my uncle had ever conceived in his own mind any definite plan for it that the poem had been composed while they were in habits of daily intercourse and almost in his presence and when there was the most unreserved intercourse between them as to all their literary projects and productions and he had never heard from him any plan for finishing it not that he doubted my uncles sincerity in his subsequent assertions to the contrary because he said schemes of this sort passed rapidly and vividly through his mind and so impressed him that he often fancied he had arranged things which really and upon trial proved to be mere embryos i omitted to ask him what seems obvious enough now whether in conversing about it he had never asked my uncle how it would end the answer would have settled the question he regretted that the story had not been made to end the same night in which it begun there was difficulty and danger in bringing such a personage as the witch to the daylight and the breakfasttable and unless the poem was to have been long enough to give time for creating a second interest there was a great probability of the conclusion being flat after such a commencement  238 you could not walk with him a mile without seeing what a loving interest he took in the play and working of simple natures as you ascend kirkstone from paterdale you have a bright stream leaping down from rock to rock on your right with here and there silent pools one of wordsworths poor neighbours worked all the week over kirkstone i think in some mines and returning on saturday evenings used to fish up this little stream we met him with a string of small trout w offered to buy them and bid him take them to the mount nay said the man i cannot sell them sir the little children at home look for them for supper and i cant disappoint them it was quite pleasant to see how the mans answer delighted the poet jtc                                       a great number of my uncles sonnets he said were written from the cat and salutation or a publichouse with some such name in smithfield where my uncle imprisoned himself for some time and they appeared in a newspaper i think he said the morning chronicle  he remembered his writing a great part of the translation of wallenstein and he said there was nothing more astonishing than the ease and rapidity with which it was done  sept 29th foxhowwe are just setting out in a promising day for a second trip to keswick intending if possible to penetrate into wastdale over the sty head before i go i wish to commemorate a walk with the poet on a drizzly muddy day the turf sponging out water at every step through which he stalked as regardless as if he were of iron and with the same fearless unchanged pace over rough and smooth slippery and sound we went up by the old road239 from ambleside to keswick and struck off from the tableland on the left over the fell ground till he brought me out on a crag bounded as it were by two ascents and showing me in front as in a frame grasmere lake the one green island the church village c and the surrounding mountains it is a lovely scene strikingly described in his verses beginning      when to the attractions of the busy world     preferring studious leisure c240  oct 7thyesterday wordsworth drove me to lowwovel and then we ascended a great way towards kirkstone by troutbeck passing by many interesting cots barns and farmhouses where w had constantly something to point out in the architecture or the fringes of moss fern c on the roofs or walls we crossed the valley and descended on troutbeck church whence we came down to the turnpike road and i left the poet who was going on to assist sir t pasley in laying out his grounds i turned homeward till i met my horse                                       239 this old road was very steep after the fashion of former days crossing the hill straight over its highest point a new cut had been made somewhat diminishing the steepness but still leaving it a very inconvenient and difficult ascent at length another alteration was made and the road was carried on a level round the foot of the hill my friend arnold pointed these out to me and quizzing my politics said the first denoted the old tory corruption the second bit by bit the third radical reform jtc  240 see poems on the naming of places  as we walked i was admiring the neverceasing sound of water so remarkable in this country i was walking he said on the mountains with  the eastern traveller it was after rain and the torrents were full i said i hope you like your companionsthese bounding joyous foaming streams no said the traveller pompously i think they are not to be compared in delightful effect with the silent solitude of the arabian desert my mountain blood was up i quickly observed that he had boots and a stout greatcoat on and said i am sorry you dont like this perhaps i can show you what will please you more i strode away and led him from crag to crag hill to vale and vale to hill for about six hours till i thought i should have had to bring him home he was so tired                                       october 10thi have passed a great many hours today with wordsworth in his house i stumbled on him with proof sheets before him he read me nearly all the sweet stanzas written in his copy of the castle of indolence241 describing himself and my uncle and he and mrs w both assured me the description of the latter at that time was perfectly accurate that he was almost as a great boy in feelings and had all the tricks and fancies there described mrs w seemed to look back on him and those times with the fondest affection then he read me some lines which formed part of a suppressed portion of the waggoner but which he is now printing on the rock of names so called because on it they had carved out their initials  ww    wm wordsworth mh    mary w dw    dorothy wordsworth stc    samuel taylor coleridge jw    john wordsworth sh    sarah hutchinson  241 poems founded on the affections  this rock was about a mile beyond wythburn chapel to which they used to accompany my uncle in going to keswick from grasmere and where they would meet him when he returned this led him to read much of the waggoner to me it seems a very favourite poem of his and he read me splendid descriptions from it he said his object in it had not been understood it was a play of the fancy on a domestic incident and lowly character he wished by the opening descriptive lines to put his reader into the state of mind in which he wished it to be read if he failed in doing that he wished him to lay it down he pointed out with the same view the glowing lines on the state of exultation in which ben and his companions are under the influence of liquor then he read the sickening languor of the morning walk contrasted with the glorious uprising of nature and the songs of the birds here he has added about six most exquisite lines  we walked out on the turf terrace on the loughrigg side of rydal water most exquisitely did the lake and opposite bank look thence he led me home under loughrigg through lovely spots i had never seen before his conversation was on critical subjects arising out of his attempts to alter his poems he said he considered the white doe as in conception the highest work he had ever produced the mere physical action was all unsuccessful but the true action of the poem was spiritualthe subduing of the will and all inferior passions to the perfect purifying and spiritualising of the intellectual nature while the doe by connection with emily is raised as it were from its mere animal nature into something mysterious and saintlike he said he should devote much labour to perfecting the execution of it in the mere business parts in which from anxiety to get on with the more important parts he was sensible that imperfections had crept in which gave the style a feebleness of character  he talked of milton and observed how he sometimes indulged himself in the paradise lost in lines which if not in time you could hardly call verse instancing      and tiresias and phineus prophets old  and then noticed the sweetflowing lines which followed and with regard to which he had no doubt the unmusical line before had been inserted  paradise regained he thought the most perfect in execution of anything written by milton that and the merchant of venice in language he thought were almost faultless with the exception of some little straining in some of the speeches about the caskets he said they were perfect the genuine english expressions of the ideas of their own great minds thomson he spoke of as a real poet though it appeared less in his seasons than in his other poems he had wanted some judicious adviser to correct his taste but every person he had to deal with only served to injure it he had however a true love and feeling for nature and a greater share of poetical imagination as distinguished from dramatic than any man between milton and him as he stood looking at ambleside seen across the valley embosomed in wood and separated from us at sufficient distance he quoted from thomsons hymn on solitude and suggested the addition or rather insertion of a line at the close where he speaks of glancing at london from norwood the line he said should have given something of a more favourable impression  ambition 242 and pleasure vain     october 14th foxhowwe have had a delightful day today the weather being fine wordsworth agreed to go with us into easedale so we got three ponies for mary and madge and fred and alley alternately and walked from grasmere he trudging243 before with his green gauze shade over his eyes and in his plaid jacket and waistcoat first he turned aside at a little farmhouse and took us into a swelling field to look down on the tumbling stream which bounded it and which we saw precipitated at a distance in a broad white sheet from the mountain a beautiful waterbreak of the same stream was before us at our feet and he noticed the connection which it formed in the landscape with the distant waterfall then as he mused for an instant he said i have often thought what a solemn thing it would be if we could have brought to our mind at once all the scenes of distress and misery which any spot however beautiful and calm before us has been witness to since the beginning that waterbreak with the glassy quiet pool beneath it that looks so lovely and presents no images to the mind but of peacethere i remember the only son of his father a poor man who lived yonder was drowned he missed him came to search and saw his body dead in the pool we pursued our way up the stream not a very easy way for the horses near to the waterfall before mentioned and so gradually up to the tarn oh what a scene the day one of the softest and brightest in autumn the lights various the mountains in the richest colouring fern covering them with reddish gold in great part here and there trees in every variety of autumn foliage and the rock itself of a kind of lilac tint the outlines of the mountains very fine the tarn which might almost be called a lake for size and abundance of water with no culture or trees or habitation around it here and there a great rock stretching into it like a promontory and high mountains surrounding it on three sides on two of them almost precipitate on the fourth side it is more open and on this the stream crossed by four great steppingstones runs out of it and descends into grasmere vale and lake he pointed out the precipitous mountain at the head of the tarn and told us an incident of his sister and himself coming from langdale which lies on the other side he having for some reason parted she encountered a fog and was bewildered at last she sat down and waited in a short time it began to clear she could see that a valley was before her in time she saw the backs of cattle feeding which emerged from the darkness and at last the tarn and then found she had stopped providentially and was sitting nearly on the edge of the precipice our return was somewhat more perilous for the riders than the ascent but we accomplished it safely and in our return turned in butterlip how a circular soft green hill surrounded with oak trees at the head of grasmere it is about twenty acres and belongs to a london banker purchased as i suppose with a view to building on it it is a lovely spot for a house with delicious views of the lake and church easedale helm crag c i have seen no place i think on which i should so much like to build my retreat  242 i cannot fill the blank jtc  243 i used the word trudging at the time it denoted to me his bold way of walking jtc  october 16thsince church we have taken our last walk with wordsworth m was mounted on dora ws pony he led us up on loughrigg round to the tarn by the back of loughrigg to the foot of grasmere lake and so home by this side of rydal the weather warm and fine and a lovely walk it was the views of the mountains langdale way the tarn itself and its banks and the views on grasmere and rydal waters are almost beyond anything i have seen even in this country  he and mrs w came this evening to bid us farewell we parted with great i believe mutual regret certainly they have been kind to us in a way and degree which seemed unequivocally to testify good liking to us and them it is impossible not to love the more i have seen of wordsworth the more i admire him as a poet and as a man he has the finest and most discriminating feeling for the beauties of nature that i ever witnessed he expresses himself in glowing and yet manly language about them there is much simplicity in his character much naïveté but it is all generous and highly moral244  244 memoirs ii 30015                                          c recollections of tour in italy by hc robinson                      oct 18 1850  my dear sir  i feel quite ashamed i assure you of sending you the itinerary of my journey with mr wordsworth so poorly accompanied as it must be and the more because mr wordsworth seems to have thought that i might be able to make a contribution to your work worth your acceptance at the same time i am much relieved by recollecting that he himself cared nothing for the connection which a place might have with a great poet unless an acquaintance with it served to illustrate his works he made this remark in the church of st onofrio at rome where tasso lies buried the place which on this account interested him more than any other on the journey was vaucluse while he cared nothing for arezzo which claims to be the place of petrarchs birth indeed a priest on the spot on another visit said it is not certain that he was born there much less in the house marked with his name mr w was not without the esprit de corps even before his official dignity and took great interest in savona on account of chiabrera as appears in the musings near aquapendente perhaps the most beautiful of these memorials of the italian touralas too few as he himself repeatedly said of the journey it is too late i have matter for volumes he said once had i but youth to work it up it is remarkable how in this admirable poem meditation predominates over observation it often happened that objects of universal attraction served chiefly to bring back to his mind absent objects dear to him when we were on that noble spot the amphitheatre at nismes i observed his eyes fixed in a direction where there was the least to be seen and looking that way i beheld two very young children at play with flowers and i overheard him say to himself oh you darlings i wish i could put you in my pocket and carry you to rydal mount  it was mr theed the sculptor who informed us of the pine tree being the gift of sir george beaumont this incident occurred within a few minutes after our walking up the pincian hill and this was the very first observation mr w made at rome  it was a remark justly made on the memorials of the swiss journey in 1820 that mr w left unnoticed the great objects which have given rise to innumerable commonplace verses and huge piles of bad prose and which every body talks about while he dwelt on impressions peculiar to himself as a reproach nothing can be more idle and unmeaning i expected it would be so with these latter poems and so i found it there are not more than two others which bring anything to my mind  the most important of these is the cuckoo at laverna i recollect perfectly well that i heard the cuckoo at laverna twice before he heard it and that it absolutely fretted him that my ear was first favoured and that he exclaimed with delight i hear it i hear it it was at laverna too that he led me to expect that he had found a subject on which he would write and that was the love which birds bore to st francis he repeated to me a short time afterwards a few lines which i do not recollect among those he has written on st francis in this poem on the journey one night only i heard him in bed composing verses and on the following day i offered to be his amanuensis but i was not patient enough i fear and he did not employ me a second time he made inquiries for st franciss biography as if he would dub him his leibheiliger bodysaint as goethe saying that every one must have one declared st philip neri to be his  the painter monk at camaldoli also interested him but he heard my account only in addition to a very poor exhibition of professional talent but he would not allow the pictures to be so very poor as every nun ought to be beautiful when she takes the veil  i recollect too the pleasure he expressed when i said to him you are now sitting in dantes chair it faces the south transept of the cathedral at florence  i have been often asked whether mr w wrote anything on the journey and my answer has always been little or nothing seeds were cast into the earth and they took root slowly this reminds me that i once was privy to the conception of a sonnet with a distinctness which did not once occur on the longer italian journey this was when i accompanied him into the isle of man we had been drinking tea with mr and mrs cookson and left them when the weather was dull very soon after leaving them we passed the church tower of bala sala the upper part of the tower had a sort of frieze of yellow lichens mr w pointed it out to me and said its a perpetual sunshine i thought no more of it till i read the beautiful sonnet      broken in fortune but in mind entire245  and then i exclaimed i was present at the conception of this sonnet at least of the combination of thought out of which it arose  i beg to subscribe myself

wordsworth  by lady richardson and mrs davy of the oaks ambleside  1 lady richardson  lancrigg easedale august 26 1841  wordsworth made some striking remarks on goethe in a walk on the terrace yesterday he thinks that the german poet is greatly overrated both in this country and his own he said he does not seem to me to be a great poet in either of the classes of poets at the head of the first class i would place homer and shakspeare whose universal minds are able to reach every variety of thought and feeling without bringing their own individuality before the reader they infuse they breathe life into every object they approach but you never find themselves at the head of the second class those whom you can trace individually in all they write i would place spenser and milton in all that spenser writes you can trace the gentle affectionate spirit of the man in all that milton writes you find the exalted sustained being that he was now in what goethe writes who aims to be of the first class the universal you find the man himself the artificial man where he should not be found so consider him a very artificial writer aiming to be universal and yet constantly exposing his individuality which his character was not of a kind to dignify he had not sufficiently clear moral perceptions to make him anything but an artificial writer  tuesday the 2d of may wordsworth and miss f came early to walk about and dine he was in a very happy kindly mood we took a walk on the terrace and he went as usual to his favourite points on our return he was struck with the berries on the holly tree and said why should not you and i go and pull some berries from the other side of the tree which is not seen from the window and then we can go and plant them in the rocky ground behind the house we pulled the berries and set forth with our tool i made the holes and the poet put in the berries he was as earnest and eager about it as if it had been a matter of importance and as he put the seeds in he every now and then muttered in his low solemn tone that beautiful verse from burnss vision      and wear thou this she solemn said     and bound the holly round my head     the polished leaves and berries red           did rustling play     and like a passing thought she fled           in light away  he clambered to the highest rocks in the tom intake and put in the berries in such situations as nature sometimes does with such true and beautiful effect he said i like to do this for posterity some people are selfish enough to say what has posterity done for me but the past does much for us   ii additional sent to the present editor by lady richardson  august 28th 1841mr wordsworth miss fenwick and mrs hill came to dine and it rained on the whole day but happily the poet talked on from two to eight without being weary as we certainly were not after dinner when we came to the drawingroom the conversation turned on the treatment of wordsworth by the reviews of the day i had never heard him open out on it before and was much struck with the manner in which he did it from his present elevation looking calmly back on the past and at the same time feeling that an irreparable injury had been done to him at the time when life and hope were young as nearly as i can i shall record his words as they were spoken he said  at the time i resolved to dedicate myself to poetry and separate myself from the ordinary lucrative professions it would certainly have been a great object to me to have reaped the profits i should have done from my writings but for the stupidity of mr gifford and the impertinence of mr jeffrey it would have enabled me to purchase many books which i could not obtain and i should have gone to italy earlier which i never could afford to do until i was sixtyfive when moxon gave me a thousand pounds for my writings this was the only kind of injury mr jeffrey did me for i immediately perceived that his mind was of that kind that his individual opinion on poetry was of no consequence to me whatever that it was only by the influence his periodical exercised at the time in preventing my poems being read and sold that he could injure me for feeling that my writings were founded on what was true and spiritual in human nature i knew the time would come when they must be known and i never therefore felt his opinion of the slightest value except in preventing the young of that generation from receiving impressions which might have been of use to them through life i say this i hope not in a boasting spirit but i am now daily surprised by receiving letters from various places at home and abroad expressive of gratitude to me from persons i never saw or heard of as this occurs now i may fairly conclude that it might have been so when the poems appeared but for the tyranny exercised over public opinion by the edinburgh and quarterly reviews  december 1841wordsworth and miss fenwick spent the shortest day of the year with us he brought with him his epitaph on southey and as we sat round the fire after dinner my mother asked him to read it to us which he did in his usual impressive manner he asked our impression of it my mother ventured to tell him of one word or rather two which she thought might be altered with advantage they were these      wide was his range but neer in human breast     did private feeling find a holier nest  holier nest were the words she objected to as not being a correct union of ideas he took the suggestion most kindly and said it had been much discussed in his own mind and in his family circle but that he saw the force of what she said and that he was aware many others would see it also he said there was yet time to change it and that he should consult judge coleridge whether the line as he once had it      did private feeling meet in holier rest  would not be more appropriate to the simplicity of an epitaph where you con every word and where every word is expected to bear an exact meaning we all thought this was an improvement during tea he talked with great animation of the separation of feeling between the rich and poor in this country the reason of this he thinks is the greater freedom we enjoy that the line of demarcation not being so clearly laid down in this country by the law as in others people fancy they must make it for themselves he considers christianity the only cure for this state of things he spoke of his own desire to carry out the feeling of brotherhood with regard to servants which he all along endeavoured to do he doubted whether he might not have had better servants on a different system but he thought it right to endeavour to inspire your domestics with a feeling of common interest my mother said she entirely agreed with him but she had always found it most difficult   iii lady richardson continued  november 1843wordsworth holds the critical power very low infinitely lower than the inventive and he said today that if the quantity of time considered in writing critiques on the works of others were given to original composition of whatever kind it might be it would be much better employed it would make a man find out sooner his own level and it would do infinitely less mischief a false or malicious criticism may do much injury to the minds of others a stupid invention either in prose or verse is quite harmless  december 22d 1843the shortest day is past and it was a very pleasant one to us for wordsworth and miss fenwick offered to spend it with us they came early and although it was misty and dingy he proposed to walk up easedale we went by the terrace and through the little gate on the fell round by brimmer head having diverged a little up from easedale nearly as far as the ruined cottage he said when he and his sister wandered there so much that cottage was inhabited by a man of the name of benson a waller its last inhabitant he said on the terrace this is a striking anniversary to me for this day fortyfour years ago my sister and i took up our abode at grasmere and three days after we found out this walk which long remained our favourite haunt there is always something very touching in his way of speaking of his sister the tones of his voice become more gentle and solemn and he ceases to have that flow of expression which is so remarkable in him on all other subjects it is as if the sadness connected with her present condition was too much for him to dwell upon in connection with the past although habit and the omnipotence of circumstance have made its daily presence less oppressive to his spirits he said that his sister spoke constantly of their early days but more of the years they spent together in other parts of england than those at grasmere as we proceeded on our walk he happened to speak of the frequent unhappiness of married persons and the low and wretched principles on which the greater number of marriages were formed he said that unless there was a strong foundation of love and respect the unavoidable breaks and cataracts of domestic life must soon end in mutual aversion for that married life ought not to be in theory and assuredly it never was in practice a system of mere submission on either side but it should be a system of mutual cooperation for the good of each if the wife is always expected to conceal her difference of opinion from her husband she ceases to be an equal and the man loses the advantage which the marriage tie is intended to provide for him in a civilised and christian country he then went on to say that although he never saw an amiable single woman without wishing that she were married from his strong feeling of the happiness of a wellassorted marriage yet he was far from thinking that marriage always improved people it certainly did not unless it was a congenial marriage247   iv mrs davy  the oaks ambleside monday jan 22 1844  while mrs quillinan was sitting with us today henry fletcher ran in to say that he had reserved his summons for oxford he had been in suspense about rooms as an exhibitioner at balliol and must be off within an hour his young cousins and i went down with him to wait for the mail in the marketplace we found mr wordsworth walking about before the postoffice door in very charming mood his spirits were excited by the bright morning sunshine and he entered at once on a full flow of discourse he looked very benevolently on henry as he mounted on the top of the coach and seemed quite disposed to give an old mans blessing to the young man entering on an untried field and then nowise interrupted by the hurrying to and fro of ostlers with their smoking horses or passengers with their carpet bags he launched into a dissertation in which there was i thought a remarkable union of his powerful diction and his practical thoughtful good sense on the subject of college habits and of his utter distrust of all attempts to nurse virtue by an avoidance of temptation he expressed also his entire want of confidence from experience he said of highlywrought religious expression in youth the safest training for the mind in religion he considered to be a contemplating of the character and personal history of christ work it he said into your thoughts into your imagination make it a real presence in the mind i was rejoiced to hear this plain loving confession of a christian faith from wordsworth i never heard one more earnest more as if it came out of a devoutly believing heart  247 the close of lady richardsons reminiscences here in the memoirs is not given as being more fully introduced under december 1841 p 438 the repetition of the same sentiments in 1843 however is noticeable for a vivid and sweetly toned paper on wordsworth by lady richardsonbased on the memoirssee sharpes london magazine for march 1853 pp 14855 g                        the oaks march 5 1844  on our way to lancrigg today we called at foxhow we met mr wordsworth there and asked him to go with us it was a beautiful day one of his very own mild days of this month he kindly consented and walked with us to meet the carriage at pelter bridge on our drive he mentioned with marked pleasure a dedication written by mr keble and sent to him for his approval and for his permission to have it prefixed to mr kebles new volumes of latin lectures on poetry delivered at oxford mr wordsworth said that he had never seen any estimate of his poetical powers or more especially of his aims in poetry that appeared to him so discriminating and so satisfactory he considers praise a perilous and a difficult thing on this subject he often quotes his lamented friend sir george beaumont whom in his intercourse with men of genius literary aspirants he describes as admirable in the modesty which he inculcated and practised on this head  the oaks ambleside july 11 1844  mr and mrs wordsworth at dinner along with our family party mr and mrs price from rugby two aunts of mrs ps and her brother mr rose a young clergyman a devout admirer of wordsworth joined us at tea a circle was made as large as our little parlour could hold mr price sat next to mr wordsworth and by design or fortunate accident introduced some remark on the powers and the discourse of coleridge mr wordsworth entered heartily and largely on the subject he said that the liveliest and truest image he could give of coleridges talk was that of a majestic river the sound or sight of whose course you caught at intervals which was sometimes concealed by forests sometimes lost in sand then came flashing out broad and distinct then again took a turn which your eye could not follow yet you knew and felt that it was the same river so he said there was always a train a stream in coleridges discourse always a connection between its parts in his own mind though one not always perceptible to the minds of others mr wordsworth went on to say that in his opinion coleridge had been spoilt as a poet by going to germany the bent of his mind which was at all times very much to metaphysical theology had there been fixed in that direction if it had not been so said wordsworth he would have been the greatest the most abiding poet of his age his very faults would have made him popular meaning his sententiousness and laboured strain while he had enough of the essentials of a poet to make him deservedly popular in a higher sense                                       mr price soon after mentioned a statement of coleridges respecting himself recorded in his table talk namely that a visit to the battlefield of marathon would raise in him no kindling emotion and asked mr wordsworth whether this was true as a token of his mind at first mr wordsworth said oh that was a mere bravado for the sake of astonishing his hearers but then correcting himself he added and yet it might in some sense be true for coleridge was not under the influence of external objects he had extraordinary powers of summoning up an image or series of images in his own mind and he might mean that his idea of marathon was so vivid that no visible observation could make it more so a remarkable instance of this added mr wordsworth is his poem said to be composed in the vale of chamouni now he never was at chamouni or near it in his life mr wordsworth next gave a somewhat humorous account of the rise and progress of the ancient mariner it arose he said out of the want of five pounds which coleridge and i needed to make a tour together in devonshire we agreed to write jointly a poem the subject of which coleridge took from a dream which a friend of his had once dreamt concerning a person suffering under a dire curse from the commission of some crime i said wordsworth supplied the crime the shooting of the albatross from an incident i had met with in one of shelvockes voyages we tried the poem conjointly for a day or two but we pulled different ways and only a few lines of it are mine from coleridge the discourse then turned to scotland mr wordsworth in his best manner with earnest thoughts given out in noble diction gave his reasons for thinking that as a poet scott would not live i dont like he said to say all this or to take to pieces some of the best reputed passages of scotts verse especially in presence of my wife because she thinks me too fastidious but as a poet scott cannot live for he has never in verse written anything addressed to the immortal part of man in making amusing stories in verse he will be superseded by some newer versifier what he writes in the way of natural description is merely rhyming nonsense as a prose writer mr wordsworth admitted that scott had touched a higher vein because there he had really dealt with feeling and passion as historical novels professing to give the manners of a past time he did not attach much value to those works of scotts so called because that he held to be an attempt in which success was impossible this led to some remarks on historical writing from which it appeared that mr wordsworth has small value for anything but contemporary history he laments that dr arnold should have spent so much of his time and powers in gathering up and putting into imaginary shape the scattered fragments of the history of rome248  these scraps of wordsworths large thoughtful earnest discourse seem very meagre as i note them down and in themselves perhaps hardly worth preserving and yet this is an evening which those who spent it in his company will long remember his venerable head his simple natural and graceful attitude in his armchair his respectful attention to the slightest remarks or suggestions of others in relation to what was spoken of his kindly benevolence of expression as he looked round now and then on the circle in our little parlour all bent to devour up his discourse filled up and enlarged the meaning which i fear is but ill conveyed in the words as they are now set down   v lady richardson wordsworths birthday  on tuesday april the 7th 1844 my mother249 and i left lancrigg to begin our yorkshire journey we arrived at rydal mount about three oclock and found the tables all tastefully decorated on the esplanade in front of the house the poet was standing looking at them with a very pleased expression of face he received us very kindly and very soon the children began to arrive the grasmere boys and girls came first and took their places on the benches placed round the gravelled part of the esplanade their eyes fixed with wonder and admiration on the tables covered with oranges gingerbread and painted eggs ornamented with daffodils laurels and moss gracefully intermixed the plot soon began to thicken and the scene soon became very animated neighbours old and young of all degrees ascended to the mount to keep the poets seventyfourth birthday and every face looked friendly and happy each child brought its own mug and held it out to be filled with tea in which ceremony all assisted large baskets of currant cakes were handed round and liberally dispensed and as each detachment of children had satisfied themselves with tea and cake they were moved off to play at hide and seek among the evergreens on the grassy part of the mount the day was not bright but it was soft and not cold and the scene viewed from the upper windows of the house was quite beautiful and one i should have been very sorry not to have witnessed it was innocent and gay and perfectly natural miss f the donor of the fête looked very happy and so did all the poets household the children who amounted altogether to above 300 gave three cheers to mr wordsworth and miss f after some singing and dancing and after the division of eggs gingerbread and oranges had taken place we all began to disperse we spent the night at the oaks and set off on our journey the following morning the gay scene at the mount often comes before me as a pleasant dream it is perhaps the only part of the island where such a reunion of all classes could have taken place without any connection of landlord and tenant or any clerical relation or school direction wordsworth while looking at the gambols on the mount expressed his conviction that if such meetings could oftener take place between people of different condition a much more friendly feeling would be created than now exists in this country between the rich and poor  248 but see memorials of italy sonnets on roman historians  249 mrs fletcher                                       july 12th 1844wordsworth spoke much during the evening of his early intercourse with coleridge on some one observing that it was difficult to carry away a distinct impression from coleridges conversation delightful as every one felt his outpourings to be wordsworth agreed but said he was occasionally very happy in clothing an idea in words and he mentioned one which was recorded in his sisters journal during a tour they all made together in scotland they passed a steam engine and wordsworth made some observation to the effect that it was scarcely possible to divest oneself of the impression on seeing it that it had life and volition yes replied coleridge it is a giant with one idea                                       he discoursed at great length on scotts works his poetry he considered of that kind which will always he in demand and that the supply will always meet it suited to the age he does not consider that it in any way goes below the surface of things it does not reach to any intellectual or spiritual emotion it is altogether superficial and he felt it himself to be so his descriptions are not true to nature they are addressed to the ear not to the mind he was a master of bodily movements in his battlescenes but very little productive power was exerted in popular creations   duddon excursion  on friday the 6th september 1844 i set off to breakfast at rydal mount it being the day fixed by mr wordsworth for our longprojected excursion to the valley of the duddon                                       the rain fell in torrents and it became doubtful whether we should set off or not but as it was a thundershower we waited till it was over and then wordsworth mr quillinan miss hutchinson and i set forth in our carriage to coniston where we were to find the rydal mount carriage awaiting us with mr hutchinson wordsworth talked very agreeably on the way to coniston and repeated several verses of his own which he seemed pleased that serjeant talfourd had repeated to him the day before he mentioned a singular instance of t campbells inaccuracy of memory in having actually printed as his own a poem of wordsworths the complaint he repeated it beautifully as we were going up the hill to coniston on reaching the inn in the village of coniston the rain again fell in torrents at length the carriages were ordered to the door with the intention of our returning home but just as they were ready the sun broke out and we turned the horses head towards ulpha kirk the right bank of coniston was all new to me after we passed the village and old man of coniston the scenery ceases to be bold and rugged but is very pleasing the road passing through hazel copses the openings showing nice little cornfields and comfortable detached farms with old uncropped trees standing near them some very fine specimens of old ash trees which i longed to transport to easedale where they have been so cruelly lopped the opening towards the sea as we went on was very pleasing but the first striking view of the duddon was looking down upon it soon after we passed broughton where you turn to the right and very soon after perceive the peculiar beauty of the valley although it does not take its wild and dreamlike beauty till you pass ulpha kirk we reversed the order of the sonnets and saw the river first in radiant progress towrd the deep instead of tracing this child of the clouds from its cradle in the lofty waste we reached the kirk of ulpha between five and six the appearance of the little farmhouse inn at once made anything approaching to a dinner an impossibility had we wished it ever so much but in due time we had tea and boiled ham with two eggs apiece and were much invigorated by this our first duddonian meal the hostess was evidently surprised that we thought of remaining all night so humbly did she think of the accommodation she had to offer she remembered mr wordsworth sleeping there fifteen years ago because it was just after the birth of her daughter a nice comely girl who attended us at tea mr quillinan showed great good nature and unselfishness in the arrangements he made and the care he took of the admirable horse which i saw him feeding out of a tub a manger being too great a refinement for ulpha                                       after tea although it was getting dark we went to the churchyard which commands a beautiful view towards seathwaite and we then walked in that direction through a lane where the walls were more richly covered by moss and fern than any i ever saw before a beautiful darkcoloured tributary to the duddon comes down from the moors on the left hand about a mile from ulpha and soon after we had passed the small bridge over this stream mr wordsworth recollected a well which he had discovered some thirty or forty years before we went off the road in search of it through a shadowy embowered path and as it was almost dark we should probably have failed in finding it had we not met a very tiny boy with a can of water in his hand who looked at us in speechless amazement when the poet said is there a well here my little lad we found the well and then joined the road again by another path leaving the child to ponder whether we were creatures of earth or air                                       saturday morning was cloudy but soft and lovely in its hazy effects when i went out about seven i saw wordsworth going a few steps and then moving on and stopping again in a very abstracted manner so i kept back but when he saw me he advanced and took me again to the churchyard to see the morning effects which were very lovely he said he had not slept well that the recollection of former days and people had crowded upon him and most of all my dear sister and when i thought of her state and of those who had passed away coleridge and southey and many others while i am left with all my many infirmities if not sins in full consciousness how could i sleep and then i took to the alteration of sonnets and that made the matter worse still then suddenly stopping before a little bunch of harebell which along with some parsley fern grew out of the wall near us he exclaimed how perfectly beautiful that is      would that the little flowers that grow could live     conscious of half the pleasure that they give  he then expatiated on the inexhaustible beauty of the arrangements of nature its power of combining in the most secret recesses and that it must be for some purpose of beneficence that such operations existed after breakfast we got into the cart of the inn which had a seat swung into it upon which a bolster was put in honour i presume of the poet laureate in this we jogged on to seathwaite getting out to ascend a craggy eminence on the right which mrs wordsworth admired the view from it is very striking you see from it all the peculiarities of the vale the ravine where the duddon deserts the haunts of men the spots of stationary sunshine and the homesteads which are scattered here and there both on the heights and in the lower ground near protecting rocks and craggy steeps seathwaite i had a perfect recollection of and the way we approached it twenty years ago from coniston over walna scar is the way mr wordsworth still recommends as the most beautiful we went on some distance beyond the chapel and every new turning and opening among the hills allured us on till at last the poet was obliged to exercise the word of command that we should proceed no further the return is always a flat thing so i shall not detail it except that we reached our respective homes in good time and i hope i shall never cease to think with gratitude and pleasure of the kindness of my honoured guide through the lovely scenes he has rescued from obscurity although it happily still remains an unvitiated region which stands in no need of the veil of twilight to soften or disguise its features as it glistens in the mornings sun it fills the spectators heart with gladsomeness  november 21my mother and i called at rydal last saturday to see the wordsworths after their autumnal excursion we found him only at home looking in great vigour and much the better for this little change of scene and circumstance he spoke with much interest of a communication he had had from a benevolent surgeon at manchester an admirer of his who thinks that a great proportion of the blindness in this country might be prevented by attention to the diseases of the eye in childhood he spoke of two very interesting blind ladies he had seen at leamington one of whom had been at rydal mount a short time before her total eclipse and now derived the greatest comfort from the recollection of these beautiful scenes almost the last she looked on he spoke of his own pleasure in returning to them and of the effect of the first view from orrest head the point mentioned in his unfortunate250 sonnet which has he said you are aware exposed me to the most unlooked for accusations they actually accuse me of desiring to interfere with the innocent enjoyments of the poor by preventing this district becoming accessible to them by a railway now i deny that it is to that class that this kind of scenery is either the most improving or the most attractive for the very poor the great god of nature has mercifully spread out his bible everywhere the common sunshine green fields the blue sky the shining river are everywhere to be met with in this country and it is only an individual here and there among the uneducated classes who feels very deeply the poetry of lakes and mountains and such persons would rather wander about where they like than rush through the country in a railway it is not therefore the poor as a class that would benefit morally or mentally by a railway conveyance while to the educated classes to whom such scenes as these give enjoyment of the purest kind the effect would be almost entirely destroyed  250 see the sonnet and letters on the furness railway vol ii p 321 g  wednesday 20th nova most remarkable halo was seen round the moon soon after five oclock today the colours of the rainbow were most brilliant and the circle was entire for about five minutes  thursday mr wordsworth dined here with the balls davys and mr jefferies mr w spoke with much delight of the moon the day before and said his servant whom he called dear james called his attention to it                                       wednesday dec 18ththe wordsworths and quillinans sat two hours with us he said he thought dr arnold was mistaken in the philosophy of his view of the danger of miltons satan being represented without horns and hoofs that miltons conception was as true as it was grand that making sin ugly was a commonplace notion compared with making it beautiful outwardly and inwardly a hell it assumed every form of ambition and worldliness the form in which sin attacks the highest natures                                       this day sunday the 9th of february the snow is again falling fast but very gently yesterday the 8th was a beautiful day we had a very pleasant visit of above an hour from wordsworth and his wife he was in excellent spirits and repeated with a solemn beauty quite peculiar to himself a sonnet he had lately composed on young england and his indignant burst where then is old our dear old england was one of the finest bursts of nature and art combined i have ever heard my dear mothers face too while he was repeating it was a fine addition to the picture and i could not help feeling they were both noble specimens of dear old england mrs wordsworth too is a goodly type of another class of old england more thoroughly english perhaps than either of the others but they made an admirable trio and mrs wordsworths face expressed more admiration of her husband in his bardic mood than i ever saw before he discussed mesmerism very agreeably stating strongly his detestation of clairvoyance not only on the presumption of its being altogether false but supposing it for argument sake to be true then he thinks it would be an engine of enormous evil putting it in the power of any malicious person to blast the character of another and shaking to the very foundations the belief in individual responsibility he is not disposed to reject without examination the assertions with regard to the curative powers of mesmerism he spoke today with pleasure of having heard that mr lockhart had been struck by his lines from a mss poem printed in his railwaysonnet pamphlet                                       february 24thsnow still on the ground it has never been quite clear of snow since the 27th january partial thaws have allowed us to peep out into the world of ambleside and rydal and last saturday we drank tea at foxhow and met the wordsworths and miss f he is very happy to have his friend home again and was in a very agreeable mood he repeated his sonnet on the pennsylvanians and again that on young england which i admire so much                                       march 6thwordsworth whom we met yesterday at dinner at the oaks expressed his dislike to monuments in churches partly from the absurdity and falsehood of the epitaphs which sometimes belonged to them and partly from their injuring the architectural beauties of the edifice as they grievously did in westminster abbey and many other cathedrals he made an exception in favour of those old knightly monuments which he admitted added to the solemnity of the scene and were in keeping with the buildings and he added i must also except another monument which once made a deep impression on my mind it was in a small church near st albans and i once left london in the afternoon so as to sleep at st albans the first night and have a few hours of evening light to visit this church it was before the invention of railways and i determined that i would always do the same but the year after railways existed and i have never been able to carry out my project again all wandering is now over well i went to this small country church and just opposite the door at which you enter the figure of the great lord bacon in pure white was the first thing that presented itself i went there to see his tomb but i did not expect to see himself and it impressed me deeply there he was a man whose fame extends over the whole civilised world sitting calmly age after age in white robes of pure alabaster in this small country church seldom visited except by some stray traveller he having desired to be interred in this spot to lie near his mother  on referring to mallets life of bacon i see he mentions that he was privately buried at st michaels church near st albans and it adds the spot that contains his remains lay obscure and undistinguished till the gratitude of a private man formerly his servant sir thomas meautys erected a monument to his name and memory this makes it probable that the likeness is a correct one  november 8th 1845on our way to take an early dinner at foxhow yesterday we met the poet at the foot of his own hill and he engaged us to go to tea to the mount on our way home to hear their adventures he and his mary having just returned from a six weeks wander among their friends during their absence we always feel that the road between grasmere and ambleside is wanting in something beautiful as it is we reached the mount before six and found dear mrs wordsworth much restored by her tour she has enjoyed the visit to her kith and kin in herefordshire extremely and we had a nice comfortable chat round the fire and the teatable after tea in speaking of the misfortune it was when a young man did not seem more inclined to one profession than another wordsworth said that he had always some feeling of indulgence for men at that age who felt such a difficulty he had himself passed through it and had incurred the strictures of his friends and relations on this subject he said that after he had finished his college course he was in great doubt as to what his future employment should be he did not feel himself good enough for the church he felt that his mind was not properly disciplined for that holy office and that the struggle between his conscience and his impulses would have made life a torture he also shrank from the law although southey often told him that he was well fitted for the higher parts of the profession he had studied military history with great interest and the strategy of war and he always fancied that he had talents for command and he at one time thought of a military life but then he was without connections and he felt if he were ordered to the west indies his talents would not save him from the yellow fever and he gave that up at this time he had only a hundred a year upon this he lived and travelled and married for it was not until the late lord lonsdale came into possession that the money which was due to them was restored he mentioned this to show how difficult it often was to judge of what was passing in a young mans mind but he thought that for the generality of men it was much better that they should be early led to the exercise of a profession of their own choice  december 1846henry fletcher and i dined at the mount on the 21st of this month the party consisted of mr crabb robinson their christmas guest mrs arnold miss martineau and ourselves my mothers cold was too bad to allow her to go which i regretted as it was like all their little meetings most sociable and agreeable wordsworth was much pleased with a little notice of his new edition in the examiner he thought it very well done he expressed himself very sweetly at dinner on the pleasant terms of neighbourly kindness we enjoyed in the valleys it will be pleasant in after times to remember his words and still more his manner when he said this it was done with such perfect simplicity and equality of feeling without the slightest reference to self and i am sure without thinking of himself at the time as more than one of the little circle whose friendly feeling he was commending                                       october 1846wordsworth dined with us one day last week and was in much greater vigour than i have seen him all this summer                                       he mentioned incidentally that the spelling of our language was very much fixed in the time of charles the second and that the attempts which had been made since and are being made in the present day were not likely to succeed he entered his protest as usual against carlyles style and said that since johnson no writer had done so much to vitiate the english language he considers lord chesterfield the last good english writer before johnson then came the scotch historians who did infinite mischief to style with the exception of smollett who wrote good pure english he quite agreed to the saying that all great poets wrote good prose he said there was not one exception he does not think burnss prose equal to his verse but this he attributes to his writing his letters in english words while in his verse he was not trammelled in this way but let his numbers have their own way  lancrigg novembermr and mrs wordsworth took an early dinner with us on the 26th of this month he was very vigorous and spoke of his majority at glasgow also of his reception at oxford he told us of an application he had just had from a glasgow publisher that he should write a sonnet in praise of fergusson and allan ramsay to prefix to a new edition of those poets which was about to appear he intended to reply that burnss lines to fergusson would be a much more appropriate tribute than anything he could write and he went on to say that burns owed much to fergusson and that he had taken the plan of many of his poems from fergusson and the measure also he did not think this at all detracted from the merit of burns for he considered it a much higher effort of genius to excel in degree than to strike out what may be called an original poem he spoke highly of the purity of language of the scotch poets of an earlier period gavin douglass and others and said that they greatly excelled the english poets after chaucer which he attributed to the distractions of england during the wars of york and lancaster  december 25th 1846my mother and i called at rydal mount yesterday early to wish our dear friends the blessings of the season mrs w met us at the door most kindly and we found him before his good fire in the diningroom with a flock of robins feasting at the window he had an old tattered book in his hand and as soon as he had given us a cordial greeting he said in a most animated manner i must read to you what mary and i have this moment finished it is a passage in the life of thomas elwood he then read to us the following extract  some little time before i went to alesbury prison i was desired by my quondam master milton to take an house for him in the neighbourhood where i dwell that he might get out of the city for the safety of himself and his family the pestilence then growing hot in london i took a pretty box for him in gileschalford a mile from me of which i gave him notice and intended to have waited on him and seen him well settled in it but was prevented by that imprisonment  but now being released and returned home i soon made a visit to him to welcome him into the country  after some common discourses had passed between us he called for a manuscript of his which being brought he delivered to me bidding me take it home with me and read it at my leisure and when i had so done return it to him with my judgment thereupon  when i came home and had set myself to read it i found it was that excellent poem which he entituled paradise lost after i had with the best attention read it through i made him another visit and returned him his book with due acknowledgment of the favour he had done me in communicating it to me he asked me how i liked it and what i thought of it which i modestly but freely told him and after some further discourse about it i pleasantly said to him thou hast said much here of paradise lost but what hast thou to say of paradise found he made me no answer but sate some time in a muse then brake off that discourse and fell upon another subject after the sickness was over and the city well cleansed and become safely habitable again he returned thither and when afterwards i went to wait on him there which i seldom failed of doing whenever my occasions drew me to london he showed me his second poem called paradise regained and in a pleasant tone said to me this is owing to you for you put it into my head by the question you put to me at chalford which before i had not thought of but from this digression i return to the family i then lived in  wordsworth was highly diverted with the apology of the worthy quaker for the digression which has alone saved him from oblivion he offered to send us the old book which came a few days after and i shall add another digression in favour of john milton to whom he appears to have been introduced about the year 1661 by a dr paget it is thus notified apropos to thomas elwood feeling a desire for more learning than he possessed which having expressed to isaac pennington with whom he himself lived as tutor to his children he says isaac pennington had an intimate acquaintance with dr paget a physician of note in london and he with john milton a gentleman of great note for learning throughout the learned world for the accurate pieces he had written on various subjects and occasions this person having filled a public station in the former times lived now a private and retired life in london and having wholly lost his sight kept always a man to read to him which usually was the son of some gentleman of his acquaintance whom in kindness he took to improve in his learning  he received me courteously as well for the sake of dr paget who introduced me as of isaac pennington who recommended me to both whom he bore a good respect and having inquired divers things of me with respect to my former progression in learning he dismissed me to provide myself of such accommodations as might be most suitable to my future studies  i went therefore and took myself a lodging as near to his house which was then in jewinstreet as conveniently i could and from thenceforward went every day in the afternoon except on the first days of the week and sitting by him in his diningroom read to him in such books in the latin tongue as he pleased to hear me read   vi mrs davy continued  the oaks ambleside jan 15 1845  we dined today at rydal mount mr wordsworth during dinner grave and silent till on some remark having been made on the present condition of the church he most unreservedly gave his own views and gave expression as i have only once heard him give before to his own earnest devout humble feelings as a christian in the evening being led by some previous conversation to speak of st paul he said oh what a character that is how well we know him how human yet how noble how little outward sufferings moved him it is not in speaking of these that he calls himself wretched it is when he speaks of the inward conflict paul and david he said may be called the two shakspearian characters in the bible both types as it were of human nature in its strength and its weakness moses is grand but then it is chiefly from position from the office he had entrusted to him we do not know moses as a man as a brother man  april 7 1846i went to the mount today to pay my respects to mr wordsworth on his birthday i found him and dear mrs wordsworth very happy in the arrival of their four grandsons the two elder are to go to rossall next week some talk concerning schools led mr wordsworth into a discourse which in relation to himself i thought very interesting on the dangers of emulation as used in the way of help to school progress mr wordsworth thinks that envy is too likely to go along with this and therefore would hold it to be unsafe in my own case he said i never felt emulation with another man but once and that was accompanied by envy it is a horrid feeling this once was in the study of italian which he continued i entered on at college along with  i forget the name he mentioned i never engaged in the proper studies of the university so that in these i had no temptation to envy any one but i remember with pain that i had envious feelings when my fellowstudent in italian got before me i was his superior in many departments of mind but he was the better italian scholar and i envied him the annoyance this gave me made me feel that emulation was dangerous for me and it made me very thankful that as a boy i never experienced it i felt very early the force of the words be ye perfect even as your father in heaven is perfect and as a teacher or friend or counsellor of youth i would hold forth no other motive to exertion than this there is i think none other held forth in the gospels no permission is given to emulation there there must always be a danger of incurring the passion of vanity by emulation if we try to outstrip a fellowcreature and succeed we may naturally enough be proud the true lesson of humility is to strive after conformity to that excellence which we never can surpass never even by a great distance attain to there was in the whole manner as well as matter of mr wordsworths discourse on this subject a deep veneration for the will of god concerning us which i shall long remember with interest and delighti hope with profit oh one other time he added smiling one other time in my life i felt envy it was when my brother was nearly certain of success in a foot race with me i tripped up his heels this must have been envy                                                          lesketh how jan 11 1847  in a morning visit by our fireside today from mr wordsworth something led to the mention of milton whose poetry he said was earlier a favourite with him than that of shakspeare speaking of miltons not allowing his daughters to learn the meaning of the greek they read to him or at least not exerting himself to teach it to them he admitted that this seemed to betoken a low estimate of the condition and purposes of the female mind and yet where could he have picked up such notions said mr w in a country which had seen so many women of learning and talent but his opinion of what women ought to be it may be presumed is given in the unfallen eve as contrasted with the right condition of man before his maker      he for god only she for god in him  now that said mr wordsworth earnestly is a low a very low and a very false estimate of womans condition he was amused on my showing him the almost contemporary notice of milton by wycherly and after reading it spoke a good deal of the obscurity of men of genius in or near their own times but the most singular thing he continued is that in all the writings of bacon there is not one allusion to shakspeare  lasketh how jan 10 1849  a long fireside visit from mr wordsworth this morning in highly sociable spirits speaking much of old days and old acquaintances he spoke with much regret of scotts careless views about money and said that he had often spoken to him of the duty of economy as a means to insure literary independence scotts reply always was oh i can make as much as i please by writing this said mr w was marvellous to me who had never written a line with a view to profit speaking of his own prose writing he said that but for coleridges irregularity of purpose he should probably have left much more in that kind behind him when coleridge was proposing to publish his friend he mr wordsworth offered contributions coleridge expressed himself pleased with the offer but said i must arrange my principles for the work and when that is done i shall be glad of your aid but this arrangement of principles never took place mr wordsworth added i think my nephew dr conversations and personal reminiscences  wordsworth251 will after my death collect and publish all i have written in prose  on this day as i have heard him more than once before mr wordsworth in a way very earnest and to me very impressive and remarkable disclaimed all value for all concern about posthumous fame252  e conversations and reminiscences recorded by the now bishop of lincoln c  remember first read the ancient classical authors then come to us and you will be able to judge for yourself which of us is worth reading  the first book of homer appears to be independent of the rest the plan of the odyssey is more methodical than that of the iliad the character of achilles seems to me one of the grandest ever conceived there is something awful in it particularly in the circumstance of his acting under an abiding foresight of his own death one day conversing with payne knight and uvedale price concerning homer i expressed my admiration of nestors speech as eminently natural where he tells the greek leaders that they are mere children in comparison with the heroes of old whom he had known253 but said knight and price that passage is spurious however i will not part with it it is interesting to compare the same characters ajax for instance as treated by homer and then afterwards by the greek dramatists and to mark the difference of handling in the plays of euripides politics come in as a disturbing force homers characters act on physical impulse there is more introversion in the dramatist whence aristotle rightly calls him tsagichhôtatos the towerscene where helen comes into the presence of priam and the old trojans displays one of the most beautiful pictures anywhere to be seen priams speech254 on that occasion is a striking proof of the courtesy and delicacy of the homeric age or at least of homer himself  251 on another occasion i believe he intimated a desire that his works in prose should be edited by his soninlaw mr quillinan memoirs ii 466  252 memoirs ii 43766  253 iliad i 260  254 ibid iii 156  catullus translated literally from the greek succeeding roman writers did not so because greek had then become the fashionable universal language they did not translate but they paraphrased the ideas remaining the same their dress different hence the attention of the poets of the augustan age was principally confined to the happy selection of the most appropriate words and elaborate phrases and hence arises the difficulty of translating them  the characteristics ascribed by horace to pindar in his ode pindarum quisquis c are not found in his extant writings horace had many lyrical effusions of the theban bard which we have not how graceful is horaces modesty in his ego apis matinae more modoque as contrasted with the dircaean swan horace is my great favourite i love him dearly  i admire virgils high moral tone for instance that sublime aude hospes contemnere opes c and his dantem jura catonem what courage and independence of spirit is there there is nothing more imaginative and awful than the passage      arcades ipsum     credunt se vidisse jovem c255  in describing the weight of sorrow and fear on didos mind virgil shows great knowledge of human nature especially in that exquisite touch of feeling256      hoc visum nulli non ipsi effata sorori  the

nature and is strong by our weaknesses almost all her errors and corruptions are abuses of what is good  i think buchanans maiae calendae equal in sentiment if not in elegance to anything in horace

poet for life i was impressed with a conviction that there were four english poets whom i must have continually before me as exampleschaucer shakspeare spenser and milton these i must study and equal if i could and i need not think of the rest258  258 this paragraph was communicated by mr hc robinson  i have been charged by some with disparaging pope and dryden this is not so i have committed much of both to memory as far as pope goes he succeeds but his homer is not homer but pope  i cannot account for shakspeares low estimate of his own writings except from the sublimity the superhumanity of his genius they were infinitely below his conception of what they might have been and ought to have been  the mind often does not think when it thinks that it is thinking if we were to give our whole soul to anything as the bee does to the flower i conceive there would be little difficulty in any intellectual employment hence there is no excuse for obscurity in writing  macbeth is the best conducted of shakspeares plays the fault of julius caesar hamlet and lear is that the interest is not and by the nature of the case could not be sustained to their conclusion the death of julius caesar is too overwhelming an incident for any stage of the drama but the last it is an incident to which the mind clings and from which it will not be torn away to share in other sorrows the same may be said of the madness of lear again the opening of hamlet is full of exhausting interest there is more mind in hamlet than in any other play more knowledge of human nature the first act is incomparable there is too much of an everyday sick room in the deathbed scene of catherine in henry the eighthtoo much of leeches and apothecaries vials zanga is a bad imitation of othello garrick never ventured on othello he could not submit to a blacked face he rehearsed the part once during the rehearsal quin entered and having listened for some time with attention exclaimed well done david but wheres the teakettle alluding to the print of hogarth where a black boy follows his mistress with a teakettle in his hand in stature garrick was short a fact which conveys a high notion of his powers is that he was able to act out the absurd stagecostume of those days he represented coriolanus in the attire of cheapside i remember hearing from sir g beaumont that while he was venting as lear the violent paroxysms of his rage in the awful tempest scene his wig happened to fall off the accident did not produce the slightest effect on the gravity of the house so strongly had he impregnated every breast with his own emotions  some of my friends hc for instance doubt whether poetry on contemporary persons and events can be good but i instance spensers marriage and miltons lycidas true the persae is one of the worst of aeschyluss plays at least in my opinion  milton is falsely represented by some as a democrat he was an aristocrat in the truest sense of the word see the quotation from him in my convention of cintra259 indeed he spoke in very proud and contemptuous terms of the populace comus is rich in beautiful and sweet flowers and in exuberant leaves of genius but the ripe and mellow fruit is in samson agonistes when he wrote that his mind was hebraized indeed his genius fed on the writings of the hebrew prophets this arose in some degree from the temper of the times the puritan lived in the old testament almost to the exclusion of the new  the works of the old english dramatists are the gardens of our language  one of the noblest things in milton is the description of that sweet quiet morning in the paradise regained after that terrible night of howling wind and storm the contrast is divine260  259 page 174 vol i where milton speaks of the evils

ease with his own conscience is sure to quarrel with all government order and law  the influence of lockes essay was not due to its own merits which are considerable but to external circumstances it came forth at a happy opportunity and coincided with the prevalent opinions of the time the jesuit doctrines concerning the papal power in deposing kings and absolving subjects from their allegiance had driven some protestant theologians to take refuge in the theory of the divine right of kings this theory was unpalatable to the world at large and others invented the more popular doctrine of a social contract in its place a doctrine which history refutes but locke did what he could to accommodate this principle to his own system  the only basis on which property can rest is right derived from prescription  the best of lockes works as it seems to me is that in which he attempts the leasthis conduct of the understanding  in the summer of 1827 speaking of some of his contemporaries wordsworth said t moore has great natural genius but he is too lavish of brilliant ornament his poems smell of the perfumers and milliners shops he is not content with a ring and a bracelet but he must have rings in the ears rings on the noserings everywhere  walter scott is not a careful composer he allows himself many liberties which betray a want of respect for his reader for instance he is too fond of inversions ie he often places the verb before the substantive and the accusative before the verb w scott quoted as from me      the swan on sweet st marys lake     floats double swan and shadow  instead of still thus obscuring my idea and betraying his own uncritical principles of composition  byron seems to me deficient in feeling professor wilson i think used to say that beppo was his best poem because all his faults were there brought to a height i never read the english bards through his critical prognostications have for the most part proved erroneous  sir james mackintosh said of me to m de staël wordsworth is not a great poet but he is the greatest man among poets madame de staël complained of my style  now whatever may be the result of my experiment in the subjects which i have chosen for poetical compositionbe they vulgar or be they noti can say without vanity that i have bestowed great pains on my style full as much as any of my contemporaries have done on theirs i yield to none in love for my art i therefore labour at it with reverence affection and industry my main endeavour as to style has been that my poems should be written in pure intelligible english lord byron has spoken severely of my compositions however faulty they may be i do not think that i ever could have prevailed upon myself to print such lines as he has done for instance      i stood at venice on the bridge of sighs     a palace and a prison on each hand  some person ought to write a critical review analysing lord byrons language in order to guard others against imitating him in these respects  shelley is one of the best artists of us all i mean in workmanship of style  at calgarth dining with mrs and the miss watsons  a very fine portrait of the late bishop in the diningroom mr wordsworth there a very agreeable party walked home with him in the evening to rydal it rained all the way we met a poor woman in the road she sobbed as she passed us mr wordsworth was much affected with her condition she was swollen with dropsy and slowly hobbling along with a stick having been driven from one lodging to another it was a dark stormy night mr wordsworth brought her back to the lowwood inn where by the landlords leave she was housed in one of his barns  one day i met mr mt sadler at the late archbishops sadler did not know me and before dinner he began to launch forth in a critical dissertation on contemporary english poetry among living poets your grace may know there is one called wordsworth whose writings the world calls childish and puerile but i think some of them wonderfully pathetic now mr sadler said the archbishop what a scrape you are in here is mr wordsworth but go down with him to dinner and you will find that though a great poet he does not belong to the genus irritabile this was very happy  after returning one day from church at addington i took the liberty of saying a few words on the sermon we had heard it was a very homely performance i am rather surprised my lord archbishop that when your grace can have the choice of so many preachers in england you do not provide better for yourself oh said he i think i can bear bad preaching better than most people and i therefore keep it to myself this seemed to me a very pleasing trait in the gentle and loveable character of that admirable man  patriarchal usages have not

park at rydal near the path to the upper waterfall  s in the work you mentioned to me confounds imagery and imagination sensible objects really existing and felt to exist are imagery and they may form the materials of a descriptive poem where objects are delineated as they are imagination is a subjective term it deals with objects not as they are but as they appear to the mind of the poet  the imagination is that intellectual lens through the medium of which the poetical observer sees the objects of his observation modified both in form and colour or it is that inventive dresser of dramatic tableaux by which the persons of the play are invested with new drapery or placed in new attitudes or it is that chemical faculty by which elements of the most different nature and distant origin are blended together into one harmonious and homogeneous whole  a beautiful instance of the modifying and investive power of imagination may be seen in that noble passage of dyers ruins of rome261 where

there is that immortal and unextinguishable yearning for something pure and spiritual which will plead against these poetical sensualists as long as man remains what he is  261 1 37      the pilgrim

world they are nothing more than these little specks in the texture of this hearthrug  as i was riding doras pony from rydal to cambridge i got off as i occasionally did to walk i fell in with a sweetlooking peasant girl of nine or ten years old she had been to carry her fathers dinner who was working in the fields and she was wheeling a little wheelbarrow in which she collected manure from the roads for her garden at home after some talk i gave her a penny for which she thanked me in the sweetest way imaginable i wish i had asked her whether she could read and whether she went to school but i could not help being struck with the happy arrangement which nature has made for the education of the heart an arrangement which it seems the object of the present age to counteract instead of to cherish and confirm i imagined the happy delight of the father in seeing his child at a distance and watching her as she approached to perform her errand of love i imagined the joy of the mother in seeing her return i am strongly of opinion an opinion you perhaps have seen expressed by me in a letter to mr rose263 that this is the discipline which is more calculated by a thousand degrees to make a virtuous and happy nation than the allengrossing estranging eleemosynary institutions for education which perhaps communicate more knowledge in these institutions what the pupils gain in knowledge they often lose in wisdom this is a distinction which must never be lost sight of  263 see vol i pp 3408 g  education should never be wholly eleemosynary but must the parent suffer privations for the

               f reminiscences of the rev rp graves ma formerly of windermere now of dublin  i remember mr wordsworth saying that at a particular stage of his mental progress he used to be frequently so rapt into an unreal transcendental world of ideas that the external world seemed no longer to exist in relation to him and he had to reconvince himself of its existence by clasping a tree or something that happened to be near him i could not help connecting this fact with that obscure passage in his great ode on the intimations of immortality in which he speaks of            those obstinate questionings       of sense and outward things       fallings from us vanishings       blank misgivings of a creature     moving about in worlds not realised c  i heard him once make the remark that it would be a good habit to watch closely the first involuntary thoughts upon waking in the morning as indications of the real current of the moral being  i was struck by what seemed to me a beautiful analogy which i once heard him draw and which was new to methat the individual characters of mankind showed themselves distinctively in childhood and youth as those of trees in spring that of both of trees in summer and of human kind in middle life they were then alike to a great degree merged in a dull uniformity and that again in autumn and in declining age there appeared afresh all their original and inherent variety brought out into view with deeper marking of character with more vivid contrast and with greater accession of interest and beauty  he thought the charm of robinson crusoe mistakenly ascribed as it commonly is done to its naturalness attaching a full value to the singular yet easily imagined and most picturesque circumstances of the adventurers position to the admirable painting of the scenes and to the knowledge displayed of the working of human feelings he yet felt sure that the intense interest created by the story arose chiefly from the extraordinary energy and resource of the hero under his difficult circumstances from their being so far beyond what it was natural to expect or what would have been exhibited by the average of men and that similarly the high pleasure derived from his successes and good fortunes arose from the peculiar source of these uncommon merits of his character  i have heard him pronounce that the tragedy of othello platos records of the last scenes of the career of socrates and isaac waltons life of george herbert were in his opinion the most pathetic of human compositions  in a walk one day after stopping according to his custom to claim admiration for some happy aspect of the landscape or beautiful composition on a smaller scale of natural objects caught by him at the precisely best point of view in the midst of his conversation on other subjects he added goodhumouredly that there were three callings for success in which nature had furnished him with qualificationsthe callings of poet landscapegardener and critic of pictures and works of art on hearing this i could not but remember how his qualifications for the second were proved by the surprising variety of natural beauties he managed to display to their best advantage from the very circumscribed limits of the garden at rydal mount an invisible hand of art everywhere working to use his own exquisite expression in the very spirit of nature and how many there were who have owed the charm of their grounds and gardens to direction sought from his wellknown taste and feeling as to works of art his criticism was not that of one versed in the history of the schools but always proceeding upon first principles the prima philosophia as he called it and it was as it appeared to me of the highest order  he was a very great admirer of virgil not so much as a creative poet but as the most consummate master of language that perhaps ever existed from him and horace who was an especial favourite and lucretius he used to quote much265  265 memoirs ii 46783                                         g on the death of coleridge  the death of coleridge was announced to us by his friend wordsworth it was the sunday evening after the event occurred that my brother and i walked over to the mount where we found the poet alone one of the first things we heard from him was the death of one who had been he said his friend for more than thirty years he then continued to speak of him called him the most wonderful man that he had ever knownwonderful for the originality of his mind and the power he possessed of throwing out in profusion grand central truths from which might be evolved the most comprehensive systems wordsworth as a poet regretted that german metaphysics had so much captivated the taste of coleridge for he was frequently not intelligible on this subject whereas if his energy and his originality had been more exerted in the channel of poetry an instrument of which he had so perfect a mastery wordsworth thought he might have done more permanently to enrich the literature and to influence the thought of the nation than any man of the age as it was however he said he believed coleridges mind to have been a widely fertilising one and that the seed he had so lavishly sown in his conversational discourses and the sibylline leaves not the poems so called by him which he had scattered abroad so extensively covered with his annotations had done much to form the opinions of the highesteducated men of the day although this might be an influence not likely to meet with adequate recognition after mentioning in answer to our inquiries about the circumstances of their friendship that though a considerable period had elapsed during which they had not seen much of each other coleridge and he had been for more than two years uninterruptedly in as close intimacy as man could be with man he proceeded to read to us the letter from henry nelson coleridge which conveyed the tidings of his great relations death and of the manner of it it appeared that his death was a relief from intense pain which however subsided at the interval of a few days before the event and that shortly after this cessation of agony he fell into a comatose state the most interesting part of the letter was the statement that the last use he made of his faculties was to call his children and other relatives and friends around him to give them his blessing and to express his hope to them that the manner of his end might manifest the depth of his trust in his saviour christ as i heard this i was at once deeply glad at the substance and deeply affected by wordsworths emotion in reading it when he came to this part his voice at first faltered and then broke but soon divine faith that the change was a blest one overcame aught of human grief and he concluded in an equable though subdued tone before i quit this subject i will tell you what i was interested in hearing from a person of the highest abilities266 whom i had the good fortune of meeting at rydal mount he said that he had visited coleridge about a month before his death and had perceived at once his countenance pervaded by a most remarkable serenity on being congratulated on his appearance coleridge replied that he did now for the first time begin to hope from the mitigation of his pains that his health was undergoing a permanent improvement alas he was deceived yet may we not consider this hopeful feeling which is i believe by no means uncommon to be under such circumstances a valuable blessing but that what he felt most thankful for was the deep calm peace of mind which he then enjoyed a peace such as he had never before experienced or scarcely hoped for this he said seemed now settled upon him and all things were thus looked at by him through an atmosphere by which all were reconciled and harmonised267  266 dr whewell g  267 extract of a letter to a friend by rev rp graves ma formerly of windermere now of dublin memoirs pp 28890   h further reminiscences of wordsworth by the same sent to the present editor  i remember to have been very much struck by what appeared to me the wisdom of a plan suggested by wordsworth for the revision of the authorised version of the bible and of the book of common prayer  with regard to the former no one he said could be more deeply convinced of the inestimable value of its having been made when it was and being what it is in his opinion it was made at the happy juncture when our language had attained adequate expansion and flexibility and when at the same time its idiomatic strength was unimpaired by excess of technical distinctions and conventional refinements and these circumstances though of course infinitely subordinate to the spiritual influence of its subjectmatter he considered to be highly important in connection with a volume which naturally became a universally recognised standard of the language for thus the fresh well of english undefiled was made a perennial blessing to the nation in no slight degree conducive to the robust and manly thinking and character of its inhabitants he was satisfied too as to its general and most impartial accuracy and its faithfulness in rendering not only the words but the style the strength and the spirit and the character of the original records he attached too the value one might suppose he would attach to the desirableness of leaving undisturbed the sacred associations which to the feelings of aged christians belonged to the ipsissima verba which had been their support under the trials of life  and so with regard to the prayer book he reverenced and loved it as the churchs precious heritage of primitive piety equally admirable for its matter and its style it may be interesting to add that in reference to this latter point i have heard him pronounce that many of the collects seemed to him examples of perfection consisting according to his impression of words whose signification filled up without excess or defect the simple and symmetrical contour of some majestic meaning and whose sound was a harmony of accordant simplicity and grandeur a combination he added such as we enjoy in some of the best passages of shakespeare  but notwithstanding that he held these opinions which will evince that he was not one who would lightly touch either sacred volume he did not think that plain mistakes in the translation of the bible or obsolete words or renderings commonly misunderstood should be perpetually handed down in our authorised version of the volume of inspiration or that similar blemishes in the prayer book which as being of human composition would admit of freer though still reverential handling should be permitted to continue as stumblingblocks interfering with its acceptableness and usefulness  the plan which he suggested as meeting the difficulties of the case was the following  that by proper authority a committee of revision of the english bible should be appointed whose business should be retaining the present authorised version as a standard to be departed from as little as possible to settle upon such indubitable corrections of meaning and improvements of expression as they agreed ought to be made and have these printed in the margin of all bibles published by authority that as an essential part of the scheme this committee of revision should be renewed periodically but not too frequentlyhe appeared to think that periods of fifty years might serveat which times it should be competent to the committee to authorise the transference from the margin into the text of all such alterations as had stood the test of experience and criticism during the previous period as well as to fix on new marginal readings  he was of opinion that in the constitution of the committee care should be taken to appoint not only divines of established reputation for sound theology and especially for their knowledge in connection with the original languages of the sacred volume but some one author at least noted for his mastery over the vernacular language  it will be seen that this plan while it provides for corrections of errors and substitution of understood for obsolete or mistaken expressions leaves undisturbed the associations of aged christians and prepares the younger generation for receiving the marginal amendments into the text wordsworth conceived that fixing the duration of the period of revision was of great consequence both as obviating all agitation in the way of call for such a process and as tending in the matter of critical discussions respecting the sanctioning cancelling and proposing of amendments to bring them to something of definitiveness in preparation for each era of revision  the same process under certain modifications he thought applicable to the book of common prayer in this he deprecated all tampering with doctrine considering that alterations ought to be confined to changes rendering the services more clearly understood or more conveniently used it is fair to add however that i have heard him express a strong desire that the athanasian creed were rid of the socalled damnatory clauses at the same time declaring that no one was ever more profoundly convinced than himself of the truth of the doctrine of the trinity  he was in favour of a collection of metrical hymns more peculiarly christian in character than the psalter being set forth by authority for use in the church and for the choice of such hymns he thought a committee should be appointed in which the knowledge of divine of poet and of laymen trusted for common sense and experience in life should be severally and conjointly engaged as a practical suggestion of moment in the composition of such hymns he advised that composers should not in the fourline stanza do more than make the second and fourth lines rhyme leaving the other two unrhymed he said would give an important addition of freedom both to the sense and the style  rp graves windermere 1850  to the above memorandum i now sept 1874 add two items of which i retain a distinct remembrance  1 he was in favour of the officiating clergyman being allowed to introduce into his reading of the lessons in church the authorised marginal corrections  2 he expressed in very strong terms his opinion that the prefatory portion of the marriage service should be altered so as to make it not only less repulsive to modern feelings but more accordant with the higher aspects of the union to be solemnised  passion in poetryone day speaking of passion as an element of poetry he referred to his own poems and said that he thought there was a stronger fire of passion than was elsewhere to be found among them in the lyrical burst near the

is the longing of the shield  chronological classification of poemsmany years ago i expressed to wordsworth a wish that his poems were printed in the order of their composition assigning as reasons for the wish the great interest which would attach to observing the progressive development of the poets thought and the interpretative value of the light mutually reflected by poems of the same period i remember being surprised by the feeling akin to indignation which he manifested at the suggestion he said that such proceeding would indicate on the part of a poet an amount of egotism placing interest in himself above interest in the subjects treated by him which could not belong to a true poet caring for the elements of poetry in their right proportion and designing to bring to bear upon the minds of his readers the best influences at his command in the way best calculated to make them effectual i felt that his ground of objection made me revere him the more both as a man and as a poet yet i retained the opinion that much might be said on the readers part in the case of a great poet for such an arrangement of his poems as i had been suggesting and i welcomed in afterdays the concession made by him in consenting to put dates to the poems while adhering to their classification according to subject or predominant element  verbal criticismwordsworth not only sympathised with the feelings expressed in southeys touching lines upon the dead but admired very much the easy flow of the verse and the perfect freedom from strain in the expression by which they are marked yet in the first two stanzas he noted three flaws and suggested changes by which they might have been easily avoided i have underlined the words he took exception to      my days among the dead are past     around me i behold      whereer these casual eyes are cast         the mighty minds of old     my neverfailing friends are they     with whom i converse day by day      with them i take delight in weal         and seek relief in woe     and while i understand and feel         how much to them i owe     my cheeks have often been bedewd     with tears of thoughtful gratitude  in the first stanza for whereer these casual eyes are cast which he objected to as not simple and natural and as scarcely correct he suggested whereer a casual look i cast and for converse the accent of which he condemned as belonging to the noun and not to the verb he suggested commune in the second stanza he pointed out the improper sequence of tenses in the third and fifth lines which he corrected by reading in the latter my cheeks are oftentimes bedewd of the narrative poems of his friend well executed as he considered them and of the mainly external action of imagination or fancy in which they deal i have certainly heard him pronounce a very depreciatory opinion whether i ever heard him use the hard words attributed to him i would not give five shillings for a ream of them i cannot now assert but if used they were said in reference to the nobler kind of imaginative power which reveals to man the deep places and sublimer affinities of his own being but to some others of southeys verses as well as to the lines above quoted and to his prose writings in general he was wont to give liberal praise and no one could doubt the sincerity and warmth of his admiration of the intellect and virtues of the man or the brotherly affection towards him which he not unfrequently expressed  rp graves dublin 1875   i an americans reminiscences  to professor henry reed                     philadelphia sept 1850  my dear friend  you have asked me to write out as fully as i can an account of my visit to wordsworth last summer of which your letter of introduction was the occasion feeling very grateful to you for the pleasure which that visit gave me and desiring to make a more minute record of it than either the letter i addressed to you from keswick or my journal written at the time contains i gladly comply with your request  it was about noon on the 18th of august 1849 that i set out with my friends from their house near bowness to ride to ambleside our route was along the shore of lake windermere it was my first day among the english lakes and i enjoyed keenly the loveliness which was spread out before me my friends congratulated me on the clearness of the atmosphere and the bright skies twilight is allimportant in bringing out the full beauty of the lake region and in this respect i was very fortunate i had already been deeply moved by the tranquil beauty of windermere for as i came out of the cottage formerly professor wilsons where i had passed the night there it lay in all its grandeur its clear waters its green islands and its girdle of solemn mountains it was quite dark when i had been conducted to this cottage the night before so that i saw the lake for the first time in the light of early morning the first impression was confirmed by every new prospect as we rode along the vale seemed a very paradise for its sweet seclusion i had been told that after switzerland i should find little to attract me in this region but such was not the case nothing can be more lovely than these lakes and mountains the latter thickly wooded and rising directly from the waters edge the foliage is of the darkest green giving to the lake in which it is reflected the same sombre hue it seemed the fittest dwellingplace for a poet amid all this quiet beauty  it was halfpast one when we reached ambleside where i left mr and mrs b and walked on alone to rydal mount i was full of eager expectations as i thought how soon i should perhaps be in the presence of wordsworththat after long years of waiting of distant reverential admiration and love i was as i hoped to be favoured with a personal interview with the great poetphilosopher to whom you and i and so many many others feel that we are under the deepest obligation for the good which has come to us from his writings at two oclock i was at the wicket gate opening into wordsworths grounds i walked along the gravel pathway leading through shrubbery to the open space in front of the long twostory cottage the poets dwelling your sketch of the house by inman is a correct one but it gives no idea of the view from it which is its chief charm rydal mere with its islands and the mountains beyond it are all in sight i had but a hasty enjoyment of this beauty nor could i notice carefully the flowers which were blooming around it was evident that the greatest attention had been paid to the grounds for the flowerbeds were tastefully arranged and the gravel walks were in complete order one might be well content i thought to make his abode at a spot like this  a boy of about twelve years was occupied at one of the flowerbeds as i passed by he followed me to the door and waited my commands i asked if mr wordsworth was in he was diningwould i walk into the drawingroom and wait a short time i was shown into the drawingroom or study i know not which to call it here i am i said to myself in the great poets house here his daily life is spent here in this room doubtless much of his poetry has been writtenwords of power which are to go down with those of shakspeare and spenser and milton while our english tongue endures it was a long apartment the ceiling low with two windows at one end looking out on the lawn and shrubbery many engravings were on the walls the famous madonna of raphael known as that of the dresden gallery hung directly over the fireplace inmans portrait of the poet your gift to mrs wordsworth being a copy of the one painted for you had a conspicuous place the portrait of bishop white also your gift the engraving from inmans picture i also noticed                                       i could have waited patiently for a long time indulging the thoughts which the place called up in a few minutes however i heard steps in the entry the door was opened and wordsworth came in it could be no other a tall figure a little bent with age his hair thin and grey and his face deeply wrinkled the expression of his countenance was sad mournful i might say he seemed one on whom sorrow pressed heavily he gave me his hand and welcomed me cordially though without smiling will you walk out sir and join us at the table said he i am engaged to dine elsewhere but you can sit with us said he so leading the way he conducted me to the diningroom at the head of the table sat mrs wordsworth and their three grandchildren made up the party it was a humble apartment not ceiled the rafters being visible having a large oldfashioned chimneyplace with a high mantelpiece                                       wordsworth asked after mr ticknor of boston who had visited him a few months before and for whom he expressed much regard some other questions led me to speak of the progress we were making in america in the extension of our territory the settlements on the pacific c all this involving the rapid spread of our english tongue wordsworth at this looked up and i noticed a fixing of his eye as if on some remote object he said that considering this extension of our language it behoved those who wrote to see to it that what they put forth was on the side of virtue this remark although thrown out at the moment was made in a serious thoughtful way and i was much impressed by it i could not but reflect that to him a deep sense of responsibility had ever been present to purify and elevate has been the purpose of all his writings such may have been at that moment his own inward meditation and he may have had in mind the coming generations who are to dwell upon his words                                       queen victoria was mentionedher visit to ireland which had just been madethe courage she had shown that is a virtue said he which she has to a remarkable degree which is very much to her credit                                       inmans portrait of him i alluded to as being very familiar to me the copy which hung in the room calling it to mind which led him to speak of the one painted by pickersgill for st johns college cambridge i was a member of that college he said and the fellows and students did me the honour to ask me to sit and allowed me to choose the artist i wrote to mr rogers on the subject and he recommended pickersgill who came down soon afterwards and the picture was painted here he believed he had sat twentythree times my impression is he was in doubt whether inmans or pickersgills portrait was the better one                                       he spoke with great animation of the advantage of classical study greek especially where said he would one look for a greater orator than demosthenes or finer dramatic poetry next to shakspeare than that of aeschylus and sophocles not to speak of euripides herodotus he thought the most interesting and instructive book next to the bible which had ever been written modern discoveries had only tended to confirm the general truth of his narrative thucydides he thought less of                                       france was our next subject and one which seemed very near his heart he had been much in that country at the outbreak of the revolution and afterwards during its wildest excesses at the time of the september massacres he was at orleans addressing mrs w he said i wonder how i came to stay there so long and at a period so exciting he had known many of the abbés and other ecclesiastics and thought highly of them as a class they were earnest faithful men being unmarried he must say they were the better able to fulfil their sacred duties they were married to their flocks in the towns there seemed he admitted very little religion but in the country there had always been a great deal i should like to spend another month in france he said before i close my eyes he seemed to feel deep commiseration for the sorrows of that unhappy country it was evidently the remembrance of hopes which in his youth he had ardently cherished and which had been blighted on which his mind was dwelling i alluded to henry the fifth to whom many eyes were i thought beginning to turn with him he remarked there would be a principle for which men could contendlegitimacy the advantage of this he stated finely  there was tenderness i thought in the tones of his voice when speaking with his wife and i could not but look with deep interest and admiration on the woman for whom this illustrious man had for so many years cherished feelings of reverential love      peace settles where the intellect is meek  is a line which you will recall from one of the beautiful poems wordsworth has addressed to her and this seemed peculiarly the temper of her spiritpeace the holy calmness of a heart to whom love had been an unerring light surely we may pray my friend that in the brief season of separation which she has now to pass she may be strengthened with divine consolation  i cannot forbear to quote here that beautiful passage near the end of the great poem the prelude as an utterance by the author of tender feelings in his own matchless way after speaking of his sister in tones of deepest thankfulness he adds                           thereafter came     one whom with thee friendship had early prized     she came no more a phantom to adorn     a moment but an inmate of the heart     and yet a spirit there for me enshrined     to penetrate the lofty and the low     even as one essence of pervading light     shines in the brightness of ten thousand stars     and the meek worm that feeds her lonely lamp     couched in the dewy grass  i have been led away from my narrative but i wished to record the feelings which had arisen within me with regard to this excellent lady she who has been as  has so happily expressed it in his letter to you almost like the poets guardian angel for near fifty years                                       i may here mention that throughout the conversation wordsworths manner was animated and that he took pleasure in it evidently his words were very choice each sentence seemed faultless no one could have listened to his talk for five minutes even on ordinary topics without perceiving that he was a remarkable man not that he was brilliant but there was sustained vigour and that mode of expression which denotes habitual thoughtfulness  when the clock struck four i thought it time for me to go wordsworth told me to say to his friends in america that he and his wife were well that they had had a great grief of late in the loss of their only daughter which he supposed they would never get over this explained as i have already mentioned the sadness of his manner such strength of the affections in old age we rarely see and yet the poet has himself condemned as you remember in the excursion long and persevering grief for objects of our love removed from this unstable world reminding one so sorrowing of                                that state     of pure imperishable blessedness     which reason promises and holy writ     ensures to all believers  but as if foreseeing his own case he has added with touching power      and if there be whose tender frames have drooped     even to the dust apparently through weight     of anguish unrelieved and lack of power     an agonising sorrow to transmute     deem not that proof is here of hope withheld     when wanted most a confidence impaired     so pitiably that having ceased to see     with bodily eyes they are borne down by love     of what is lost and perish through regret  the weakness of his bodily frame it was which took away his power of tranquil endurance bowed down by the weight of years he had not strength to sustain this further burden grief for a muchloved child his mind happily retained its clearness though his body was decaying                                       he walked out into the entry with me and then asked me to go again into the diningroom to look at an oak chest or cabinet he had therea piece of old furniture curiously carved it bore a latin inscription which stated that it was made 300 years ago for william wordsworth who was the son of c c giving the ancestors of said william for many generations and ending on whose souls may god have mercy this wordsworth repeated twice and in an emphatic way as he read the inscription it seemed to me that he took comfort in the religious spirit of his ancestors and that he was also adopting the solemn ejaculation for himself there was something very impressive in his manner  i asked to see the cast from chantreys bust of him which he at once showed me also a crayon sketch by haydon which i understood him to say west had pronounced the finest crayon he had ever seen he referred also to another sketch by margaret gillies i think which was there  we then went out together on the lawn and stood for a while to enjoy the views and he pulled open the shrubbery or hedge in places that i might see to better advantage he accompanied me to the gate and then said if i had a few minutes longer to spare he would like to show me the waterfall which was close bythe lower fall of rydal i gladly assented and he led the way across the grounds of lady fleming which were opposite to his own to a small summerhouse the moment we opened the door the waterfall was before us the summerhouse being so placed as to occupy the exact spot from which it was to be seen the rocks and shrubbery around closing it in on every side the effect was magical the view from the rustic house the rocky basin into which the water fell and the deep shade in which the whole was enveloped made it a lovely scene wordsworth seemed to have much pleasure in exhibiting this beautiful retreat it is described in one of his earlier poems the evening walk  as we returned together he walked very slowly occasionally stopping when he said anything of importance and again i noticed that looking into remote space of which i have already spoken his eyes though not glistening had yet in them the fire which betokened the greatness of his genius this no painter could represent and this it was which gave to his countenance its high intellectual expression                                       hartley coleridge he spoke of with affection there is a single line he added in one of his fathers poems which i consider explains the afterlife of the son he is speaking of his own confinement in london and then says      but thou my child shalt wander like a breeze                                       of southey he said that he had had the misfortune to outlive his faculties his mind he thought had been weakened by long watching by the sickbed of his wife who had lingered for years in a very distressing state  the last subject he touched on was the international copyright questionthe absence of protection in our country to the works of foreign authors he said mildly that he thought it would be better for us if some acknowledgment however small was made the fame of his own writings as far as it was of pecuniary advantage to him he had long regarded with indifference happily he had an income more than sufficient for all his wants he remarked he had once seen a volume of his poems published in an american newspaper  i happened to have in my pocket the small volume of selections which you made some years ago i produced it and asked at the same time if he had ever seen it he replied he had not he took it with evident interest turned to the titlepage which he read with its motto he began the preface then in the same way but here i must record a trifling incident which may yet be worth noting we were standing together in the road wordsworth reading aloud as i have said when a man accosted us asking charitya beggar of the better class wordsworth scarcely looking off the book thrust his hands into his pockets as if instinctively acknowledging the mans right to beg by this prompt action he seemed to find nothing however and he said in a sort of soliloquy i have given to four or five already today as if to account for his being then unprovided  wordsworth as he turned over one leaf after another said but i shall weary you sir by no means said i for i could have been content to stand there for hours to hear as i did the poet read from time to time with fitting emphasis the choice passages which your preface and biographical sketch contain imagine with what delight i listened to the venerable man and to hear too from his own lips such words as these your own most true reflection his has been a life devoted to the cultivation of the poets art for its best and most lasting usesa selfdedication as complete as the world has ever witnessed your remark with regard to his having outlived many of his contemporaries among the poets he read with affecting simplicity his manner being that of one who looked backward to the past with entire tranquillity and forward with sure hope i felt that his honoured life was drawing rapidly to a close and with him there was evidently the same consciousness  he made but little comment on your notice of him occasionally he would say as he came to a particular fact thats quite correct or after reading a quotation from his own works he would add thats from my writings these quotations he read in a way that much impressed me it seemed almost as if he was awed by the greatness of his own power the gifts with which he had been endowed it was a solemn time to me this part of my interview and to you my friend it would have been a crowning happiness to stand as i did by his side on that bright summer day and thus listen to his voice i thought of his long life that he was one who had felt himself from early youth a renovated spirit singled out for holy servicesone who had listened to the teachings of nature and communed with his own heart in the seclusion of those beautiful vales until his thoughts were ready to be uttered for the good of his fellowmen and there had come back to him offerings of love and gratitude and reverent admiration from a greater multitude than had ever before paid their homage to a living writer and these acknowledgments have been for benefits so deep and lasting that words seem but a poor return but i will not attempt to describe further the feelings which were strongly present to me at that moment when i seemed most to realise in whose presence i stood                                       he walked with me as far as the main road to ambleside as we passed the little chapel built by lady fleming which has been the occasion as you remember of one of his poems there were persons tourists evidently talking with the sexton at the door their inquiries i fancied were about wordsworth perhaps as to the hour of service the next day sunday with the hope of seeing him there one of them caught sight of the venerable man at the moment and at once seemed to perceive who it was for she motioned to the others to look and they watched him with earnest gaze i was struck with their looks of delighted admiration he stopped when we reached the main road saying that his strength would not allow him to walk further giving me his hand he desired again to be remembered to you and others in america and wished me a safe return to my friends and so we parted i went on my way happy in the recollection of this to me memorable interview my mind was in a tumult of excitement for i felt that i had been in the familiar presence of one of the noblest of our race and this sense of wordsworths intellectual greatness had been with me during the whole interview i may speak too of the strong perception of his moral elevation which i had at the same time no word of unkindness had fallen from him he seemed to be living as if in the presence of god by habitual recollection a strange feeling almost of awe had impressed me while i was thus with him believing that his memory will be had in honour in all coming time i could not but be thankful that i had been admitted to intimate intercourse with him then when he was so near the end of life to you my dear friend i must again say i owe this happiness and to you it has been denied you also of all others of our countrymen would have most valued such an interview for to you the great poets heart has been in an especial manner opened in private correspondence no other american has he honoured in the same degree and by no one else in this country has the knowledge and appreciation of his poetry been so much extended the love which has so long animated you has been such that multitudes have been influenced to seek for joy and refreshment from the same pure source  i have been led as i said at the beginning of my letter to make this record partly from your suggestion and partly from a remark of southey which i have lately seen to the effect that wordsworth was one of whom posterity would desire to know all that can be remembered you will not i trust deem the incidents i have set down trivial or consider any detail too minute the object of which was only to bring the living man before you now that he has gone for ever from our sight in this world i am led to look back to the interview with a deeper satisfaction and it may be that this full account of it will have value hereafter to you it was due that i should make the record by myself these remembrances will ever be cherished among my choicest possessions  believe me my dear friend yours faithfully  ellis yarnall268  268 memoirs ii 483500     j recollections of wordsworth  by aubrey de vere esq  sent to the present editor and now first published   part i  it was about eight years before his death that i had the happiness of making acquaintance with wordsworth during the next four years i saw a good deal of him chiefly among his own mountains and besides many delightful walks with him i had the great honour of passing some days under his roof the strongest of my impressions respecting him was that made by the manly simplicity and lofty rectitude which characterised him in one of his later sonnets he writes of himself thus as a true man who long had served the lyreit was because he was a true man that he was a true poet and it was impossible to know him without being reminded of this in any case he must have been recognised as a man of original and energetic genius but it was his strong and truthful moral nature his intellectual sincerity the abiding conscientiousness of his imagination which enabled that genius to do its great work and bequeath to the england of the future the most solid mass of deephearted and authentic poetry which has been the gift to her of any poet since the elizabethan age there was in his nature a veracity which had it not been combined with an idealising imagination not less remarkable would to many have appeared prosaic yet had he not possessed that characteristic the products of his imagination would have lacked reality they might still have enunciated a deep and sound philosophy but they would have been divested of that human interest which belongs to them in a yet higher degree all the little incidents of the neighbourhood were to him important  the veracity and the ideality which are so signally combined in wordsworths poetic descriptions of nature made themselves at least as much felt whenever nature was the theme of his discourse in his intense reverence for nature he regarded all poetical delineations of her with an exacting severity and if the descriptions were not true and true in a twofold sense the more skilfully executed they were the more was his indignation roused by what he deemed a pretence and a deceit an untrue description of nature was to him a profaneness a heavenly message sophisticated and falsely delivered he expatiated much to me one day as we walked among the hills above grasmere on the mode in which nature had been described by one of the most justly popular of englands modern poetsone for whom he preserved a high and affectionate respect he took pains wordsworth said he went out with his pencil and notebook and jotted down whatever struck him mosta river rippling over the sands a ruined tower on a rock above it a promontory and a mountain ash waving its red berries he went home and wove the whole together into a poetical description after a pause wordsworth resumed with a flashing eye and impassioned voice but nature does not permit an inventory to be made of her charms he should have left his pencil and notebook at home fixed his eye as he walked with a reverent attention on all that surrounded him and taken all into a heart that could understand and enjoy then after several days had passed by he should have interrogated his memory as to the scene he would have discovered that while much of what he had admired was preserved to him much was also most wisely obliterated that which remainedthe picture surviving in his mindwould have presented the ideal and essential truth of the scene and done so in a large part by discarding much which though in itself striking was not characteristic in every scene many of the most brilliant details are but accidental a true eye for nature does not note them or at least does not dwell on them on the same occasion he remarked scott misquoted in one of his novels my lines on yarrow he makes me write      the swans on sweet st marys lake     float double swans and shadow  but i wrote      the swan on still st marys lake  never could i have written swans in the plural the scene when i saw it with its still and dim lake under the dusky hills was one of utter loneliness there was one swan and one only stemming the water and the pathetic loneliness of the region gave importance to the one companion of that swan its own white image in the water it was for that reason that i recorded the swan and the shadow had there been many swans and many shadows they would have implied nothing as regards the character of the scene and i should have said nothing about them he proceeded to remark that many who could descant with eloquence on nature cared little for her and that many more who truly loved her had yet no eye to discern herwhich he regarded as a sort of spiritual discernment he continued indeed i have hardly ever known any one but myself who had a true eye for nature one that thoroughly understood her meanings and her teachingsexcept here he interrupted himself one person there was a young clergyman called frederick faber269 who resided at ambleside he had not only as good an eye for nature as i have but even a better one and sometimes pointed out to me on the mountains effects which with all my great experience i had never detected  269 afterwards father faber of the oratory his sir launcelot abounds in admirable descriptions  truth he used to saythat is truth in its largest sense as a thing at once real and ideal a truth including exact and accurate detail and yet everywhere subordinating mere detail to the spirit of the wholethis he affirmed was the soul and essence not only of descriptive poetry but of all poetry he had often he told me intended to write an essay on poetry setting forth this principle and illustrating it by references to the chief representatives of poetry in its various departments it was this twofold truth which made shakspeare the greatest of all poets it was well for shakspeare he remarked that he gave himself to the drama it was that which forced him to be sufficiently human his poems would otherwise from the extraordinarily metaphysical character of his genius have been too recondite to be understood his youthful poems in spite of their unfortunate and unworthy subjects and his sonnets also reveal this tendency nothing can surpass the greatness of shakspeare where he is at his greatest but it is wrong to speak of him as if even he were perfect he had serious defects and not those only proceeding from carelessness for instance in his delineations of character he does not assign as large a place to religious sentiment as enters into the constitution of human nature under normal circumstances if his dramas had more religion in them they would be truer representations of man as well as more elevated and of a more searching interest wordsworth used to warn young poets against writing poetry remote from human interest dante he admitted to be an exception but he considered that shelley and almost all others who had endeavoured to outsoar the humanities had suffered deplorably from the attempt i once heard him say i have often been asked for advice by young poets all the advice i can give may be expressed in two counsels first let nature be your habitual and pleasurable study human nature and material nature secondly study carefully those firstclass poets whose fame is universal not local and learn from them learn from them especially how to observe and how to interpret nature  those who knew wordsworth only from his poetry might have supposed that he dwelt ever in a region too serene to admit of human agitations this was not the fact there was in his being a region of tumult as well as a higher region of calm though it was almost wholly in the latter that his poetry lived it turned aside from mere personal excitements and for that reason doubtless it developed more deeply those special ardours which belong at once to the higher imagination and to the moral being the passion which was suppressed elsewhere burned in his sonnets to liberty and added a deeper sadness to the yewtrees of borrowdale but his heart as well as his imagination was ardent when it spoke most powerfully in his poetry it spoke with a stern brevity unusual in that poetry as in the poem there is a change and i am poor and the still more remarkable one a slumber did my spirit seal a poem impassioned beyond the comprehension of those who fancy that wordsworth lacks passion merely because in him passion is neither declamatory nor latently sensual he was a man of strong affections strong enough on one sorrowful occasion to withdraw him for a time from poetry270  270 for us the stream of fiction ceased to flow dedicatory stanzas to the white doe of rylstone  referring once to two young children of his who had died about forty years previously he described the details of their illnesses with an exactness and an impetuosity of troubled excitement such as might have been expected if the bereavement had taken place but a few weeks before the lapse of time appeared to have left the sorrow submerged indeed but still in all its first freshness yet i afterwards heard that at the time of the illness at least in the case of one of the two children it was impossible to rouse his attention to the danger he chanced to be then under the immediate spell of one of those fits of poetic inspiration which descended on him like a cloud till the cloud had drifted he could see nothing beyond under the level of the calm there was however the precinct of the storm it expressed itself rarely but vehemently partaking sometimes of the character both of indignation and sorrow all at once the trouble would pass away and his countenance bask in its habitual calm like a cloudless summer sky his indignation flamed out vehemently when he heard of a base action i could kick such a man across england with my naked foot i heard him exclaim on such an occasion the more impassioned part of his nature connected itself especially with his political feelings he regarded his own intellect as one which united some of the faculties which belong to the statesman with those which belong to the poet and public affairs interested him not less deeply than poetry it was as patriot not poet that he ventured to claim fellowship with dante271 he did not accept the term reformer because it implied an organic change in our institutions and this he deemed both needless and dangerous but he used to say that while he was a decided conservative he remembered that to preserve our institutions we must be ever improving them he was indeed from first to last preëminently a patriot an impassioned as well as a thoughtful one yet his political sympathies were not with his own country only but with the progress of humanity till disenchanted by the excesses and follies of the first french revolution his hopes and sympathies associated themselves ardently with the new order of things created by it and i have heard him say that he did not know how any generousminded young man entering on life at the time of that great uprising could have escaped the illusion to the end his sympathies were ever with the cottage hearth far more than with the palace if he became a strong supporter of what has been called the hierarchy of society it was chiefly because he believed the principle of equality to be fatal to the wellbeing and the true dignity of the poor moreover in siding politically with the crown and the coronets he considered himself to be siding with the weaker party in our democratic days  271 see his sonnet on the seat of dante close to the duomo at florence poems of early and late years  the absence of lovepoetry in wordsworths works has often been remarked upon and indeed brought as a charge against them he once told me that if he had avoided that form of composition it was by no means because the theme did not interest him but because treated as it commonly has been it tends rather to disturb and lower the readers moral and imaginative being than to elevate it he feared to handle it amiss he seemed to think that the subject had been so long vulgarised that few poets had a right to assume that they could treat it worthily especially as the theme when treated unworthily was such an easy and cheap way of winning applause it has been observed also that the religion of wordsworths poetry at least of his earlier poetry is not as distinctly revealed religion as might have been expected from this poets wellknown adherence to what he has called emphatically the lord and mighty paramount of truths he once remarked to me himself on this circumstance and explained it by stating that when in youth his imagination was shaping for itself the channel in which it was to flow his religious convictions were less definite and less strong than they had become on more mature thought and that when his poetic mind and manner had once been formed he feared that he might in attempting to modify them have become constrained he added that on such matters he ever wrote with great diffidence remembering that if there were many subjects too low for song there were some too high wordsworths general confidence in his own powers which was strong though far from exaggerated rendered more striking and more touching his humility in all that concerned religion it used to remind me of what i once heard mr rogers say viz there is a special character of greatness about humility for it implies that a man can in an unusual degree estimate the greatness of what is above us fortunately his diffidence did not keep wordsworth silent on sacred themes his later poems include an unequivocal as well as beautiful confession of christian faith and one of them the primrose of the rock is as distinctly wordsworthian in its inspiration as it is christian in its doctrine wordsworth was a high churchman and also in his prose mind strongly antiroman catholic partly on political grounds but that it was otherwise as regards his mind poetic is obvious from many passages in his christian poetry especially those which refer to the monastic system and the schoolmen and his sonnet on the blessed virgin whom he addresses as      our tainted natures solitary boast  he used to say that the idea of one who was both virgin and mother had sunk so deep into the heart of humanity that there it must ever remain  wordsworths estimate of his contemporaries was not generally high i remember his once saying to me i have known many that might he called very clever men and a good many of real and vigorous abilities but few of genius and only one whom i should call wonderful that one was coleridge at any hour of the day or night he would talk by the hour if there chanced to be any sympathetic listener and talk better than the best page of his writings for a pen half paralysed his genius a child would sit quietly at his feet and wonder till the torrent had passed by the only man like coleridge whom i have known is sir william hamilton astronomer royal of dublin i remember however that when i recited by his fireside alfred tennysons two political poems you ask me why though ill at ease and of old sat freedom on the heights the old bard listened with a deepening attention and when i had ended said after a pause i must acknowledge that those two poems are very solid and noble in thought their diction also seems singularly stately he was a great admirer of philip van artevelde in the case of a certain poet since dead and never popular he said to me i consider his sonnets to be the best of modern times adding of course i am not including my own in any comparison with those of others he was not sanguine as to the future of english poetry he thought that there was much to be supplied in other departments of our literature and especially he desired a really great history of england but he was disposed to regard the roll of english poetry as made up and as leaving place for little more except what was likely to be eccentric or imitational  in his younger days wordsworth had had to fight a great battle in poetry for both his subjects and his mode of treating them were antagonistic to the maxims then current it was fortunate for posterity no doubt that his long militant estate was animated by some mingling of personal ambition with his love of poetry speaking in an early sonnet of      the poets who on earth have made us heirs     of truth and pure delight by heavenly lays  he concludes      oh might my name be numbered among theirs     then gladly would i end my mortal days  he died at eighty and general fame did not come to him till about fifteen years before his death this perhaps might have been fifteen years too soon if he had set any inordinate value on it but it was not so shelley tells us that fame is love disguised and it was intellectual sympathy that wordsworth had always valued far more than reputation give me thy love i claim no other fee had been his demand on his reader when fame had laid her tardy garland at his feet he found on it no fresher green than his rydalian laurels had always worn once he said to me it is indeed a deep satisfaction to hope and believe that my poetry will be while it lasts a help to the cause of virtue and truthespecially among the young as for myself it seems now of little moment how long i may be remembered when a man pushes off in his little boat into the great seas of infinity and eternity it surely signifies little how long he is kept in sight by watchers from the shore  such are my chief recollections of the great poet whom i knew but in his old age but whose heart retained its youth till his daughter doras death he seemed to me one who from boyhood had been faithful to a high vocation one who had esteemed it his office to minister in an age of conventional civilisation at natures altar and who had in his later life explained and vindicated such lifelong ministration even while he seemed to apologise for it in the memorable confession      but who is innocent by grace divine     not otherwise o nature are we thine272  272 evening voluntary  it was to nature as first created not to nature as corrupted by disnatured passions that his song had attributed such high and healing powers in singing her praise he had chosen a theme loftier than most of his readers knewloftier as he perhaps eventually discovered than he had at first supposed it to be utterly without shakspeares dramatic faculty he was richer and wider in the humanities than any poet since shakspeare wholly unlike milton in character and in opinions he abounds in passages to be paralleled only by milton in solemn and spiritual sublimity and not even by milton in pathos it was plain to those who knew wordsworth that he had kept his great gift pure and used it honestly and thoroughly for that purpose for which it had been bestowed he had ever written with a conscientious reverence for that gift but he had also written spontaneously he had composed with carenot the exaggerated solicitude which is prompted by vanity and which frets itself to unite incompatible excellences but the diligence which shrinks from no toil while eradicating blemishes that confuse a poems meaning and frustrate its purpose he regarded poetry as an art but he also regarded art not as the compeer of nature much less her superior but as her servant and interpreter he wrote poetry likewise no doubt in a large measure because selfutterance was an essential law of his nature if he had a companion he discoursed like one whose thoughts must needs run on in audible current if he walked alone among his mountains he murmured old songs he was like a pine grove vocal as well as visible but to poetry he had dedicated himself as to the utterance of the highest truths brought within the range of his lifes experience and if his poetry has been accused of egotism the charge has come from those who did not perceive that it was with a human not a mere personal interest that he habitually watched the processes of his own mind he drew from the fountain that was nearest at hand what he hoped might be a refreshment to those far off he once said speaking of a departed man of genius who had lived an unhappy life and deplorably abused his powers to the lasting calamity of his country a great poet must be a great man and a great man must be a good man and a good man ought to be a happy man to know wordsworth was to feel sure that if he had been a great poet it was not merely because he had been endowed with a great imagination but because he had been a good man a great man and a man whose poetry had in an especial sense been the expression of a healthily happy moral being  aubrey

has since reached a deservedly high place both in the literary and political world but who was then known chiefly as an accomplished and amusing young man of society was to attend it dressed in the character of the father of english poetry grave old chaucer what said wordsworth m go as chaucer then it only remains for me to go as m                                          part ii  sonnetrydal

wordsworth at rydal to which he went from the still more beautiful shores of ulswater where he had been sojourning at halsteads he had been one of wordsworths warmest admirers when their number was small and in 1842 he dedicated a volume of poems to him273 he taught me when a boy of 18 years old to admire the great bard i had been very enthusiastically praising lord byrons poetry my father calmly replied wordsworth is the great poet of modern times much surprised i asked and what may his special merits be the answer was they are very various as for instance depth largeness elevation and what is rare in modern poetry an entire purity in his noble laodamia they are chiefly majesty and pathos a few weeks afterwards i chanced to take from the library shelves a volume of wordsworth and it opened on laodamia some strong calm hand seemed to have been laid on my head and bound me to the spot till i had come to the end as i read a new world hitherto unimagined opened itself out stretching far away into serene infinitudes the region was one to me unknown but the harmony of the picture attested its reality above and around were indeed  273 a song of faith devout exercises and sonnets pickering the dedication closed thus i may at least hope to be named hereafter among the friends of wordsworth      an ampler ether a diviner air     and fields invested with purpureal gleams  and when i reached the line      calm pleasures there abidemajestic pains  i felt that no tenants less stately could walk in so lordly a precinct i had been translated into another planet of songone with larger movements and a longer year a wider conception of poetry had become mine and the byronian enthusiasm fell from me like a bond that is broken by being outgrown the incident illustrates poetry in one of its many characters that of the deliverer the ready sympathies and inexperienced imagination of youth make it surrender itself easily despite its better aspirations or in consequence of them to a false greatness and the true greatness once revealed sets it free as early as 1824 walter savage landor in his imaginary conversation between southey and porson had pronounced wordsworths laodamia to be a composition such as sophocles might have exulted to own and a part of which might have been heard with shouts of rapture in the regions he describesthe elysian fields  wordsworth frequently spoke of death as if it were the taking of a new degree in the university of life i should like he remarked to a young lady to visit italy again before i move to another planet he sometimes made a mistake in assuming that others were equally philosophical we were once breakfasting at the house of mr rogers when wordsworth after gazing attentively round the room with a benignant and complacent expression turned to our host and wishing to compliment him said mr rogers i never see this house so perfect in its taste so exquisite in all its arrangements and decorated with such wellchosen pictures without fancying it the very house imaged to himself by the roman poet when in illustration of mans mortality he says linquenda est domus what is that you are saying replied mr rogers whose years between eighty and ninety had not improved his hearing i was remarking that your house replied wordsworth always reminds me of the ode more properly called an elegy though doubtless the lyrical measure not unnaturally causes it to be included among horaces odes in which the roman poet writes linquenda est domus that is since ladies being present a translation may be deemed desirable the house is or has to be left and again et placens uxorand the pleasing wife though as we must all regret that part of the quotation is not applicable on the present occasion the town bard on whom no angle smiled more than the end of st jamessplace did not enter into the views of the bard of the mountains his answer was what children call making a great face and the ejaculation dont talk latin in the society of ladies when i was going away he remarked what a stimulus the mountain air has on the appetite i made a sign to edmund to hand him the cutlets a second time i was afraid he would stick his fork into that beautiful woman who sat next him wordsworth never resented a jest at his own expense once when we had knocked three times in vain at the door of a london house i exclaimed quoting his sonnet written on westminsterbridge      dear god the very houses seem asleep  he laughed heartily then smiled gravely and lastly recounted the occasion and described the early morning on which that sonnet was written he did not recite more than a part of it to the accompaniment of distant cab and carriage and i thought that the door was opened too soon  wordsworth despite his dislike to great cities was attracted occasionally in his later years      to the proud margin of the thames     and lambeths venerable towers  where his society was courted by persons of the most different character but he complained bitterly of the great city it was next to impossible he remarked to tell the truth in it yesterday i was at s house the duchess of s showing me the pictures observed this is the portrait of my brother naming him and it is considered very like to this i assented partly perhaps in absence of mind but partly i think with an impression that her graces brother was probably a person whose face every one knew or was expected to know so that as i had never met him my answer was in fact a lie it is too bad that when more than seventy years old i should be brought from the mountains to london in order to tell a lie he made his complaint wherever he went laying the blame however not so much on himself or on the duchess as on the corrupt city and some of those who learned how the most truthful man in england had thus quickly been subverted by metropolitan snares came to the conclusion that within a few years more no virtue would be left extant in the land he was likewise maltreated in lesser ways this morning i was compelled by my engagements to eat three breakfastsone with an aged and excellent gentleman who may justly be esteemed an accomplished man of letters although i cannot honestly concede to him the title of a poet one at a fashionable party and one with an old friend whom no pressure would induce me to neglectalthough for this my first breakfast today i was obliged to name the early hour of seven oclock as he lives in a remote part of london  but it was only among his own mountains that wordsworth could be understood he walked among them not so much to admire them as to converse with them they exchanged thoughts with him in sunshine or flying shadow giving him their own and accepting his day and night at all hours and in all weather he would face them if it rained he might fling his plaid over him but would take no admonition he must have his way on such occasions dutiful as he was in higher matters he remained incurably wayward in vain one reminded him that a letter needed an answer or that the storm would soon be over it was very necessary for him to do what he liked and one of his dearest friends said to me with a smile of the most affectionate humour he wrote his ode to duty and then he had done with that matter this very innocent form of lawlessness corresponding with the classic expression indulge genio seemed to belong to his genius not less than the sympathetic reverence with which he looked up to the higher and universal laws sometimes there was a battle between his reverence for nature and his reverence for other things the friend already alluded to was once remarking on his varying expressions of countenance that rough old face is capable of high and real beauty i have seen in it an expression quite of heavenly peace and contemplative delight as the may breeze came over him from the woods while he was slowly walking out of church on a sunday morning and when he had half emerged from the shadow a flippant person present inquired did you ever chance miss f to observe that heavenly expression on his countenance as he was walking into church on a fine may morning a laugh was the reply the ways of nature harmonised with his feelings in age as well as in youth he could understand no estrangement gathering a wreath of white thorn on one occasion he murmured as he slipped it into the ribbon which bound the golden tresses of his youthful companion      and what if i enwreathed my own       twere no offence to reason     the sober hills thus deck their brows       to meet the wintry season                                          k from recollections of the last days of shelley and byron  by ej trelawny 1858 moxon  some days after this conversation i walked to lausanne to breakfast at the hotel with an old friend captain daniel roberts of the navy he was out sketching but presently came in accompanied by two english ladies with whom he had made acquaintance whilst drawing and whom he brought to our hotel the husband of one of them soon followed i saw by their utilitarian garb as well as by the blisters and blotches on their cheeks lips and noses that they were pedestrian tourists fresh from the snowcovered mountains the blazing sun and frosty air having acted on their unseasoned skins as boiling water does on the lobster by dyeing his dark coat scarlet the man was evidently a denizen of the north his accent harsh skin white of an angular and bony build and selfconfident and dogmatic in his opinions the precision and quaintness of his language as well as his eccentric remarks on common things stimulated my mind our icy islanders thaw rapidly when they have drifted into warmer latitudes broken loose from its antisocial system mystic castes coteries sets and sects they lay aside their purseproud tufthunting and toadying ways and are very apt to run risk in the enjoyment of all their senses besides we were compelled to talk in strange company if not from good breeding to prove our breed as the gift of speech is often our principal if not sole distinction from the rest of the brute animals  to return to our breakfast the travellers flushed with health delighted with their excursion and with appetites earned by bodily and mental activity were in such high spirits that roberts and i caught the infection of their mouth we talked as loud and fast as if under the exhilarating influence of champagne instead of such a sedative compound as café au lait i can rescue nothing out of oblivion but a few last words the stranger expressed his disgust at the introduction of carriages into the mountain districts of switzerland and at the old fogies who used them  as to the arbitrary pitiless godless wretches he exclaimed who have removed natures landmarks by cutting roads through alps and apennines until all things are reduced to the same dead level they will he arraigned hereafter with the unjust they have robbed the best specimens of what men should be of their freeholds in the mountains the eagle the black cock and the red deer they have tamed or exterminated the lover of nature can nowhere find a solitary nook to contemplate her beauties yesterday he continued at the break of day i scaled the most rugged height within my reach it looked inaccessible this pleasant delusion was quickly dispelled i was rudely startled out of a deep reverie by the accursed jarring jingling and rumbling of a calèche and harsh voices that drowned the torrents fall  the stranger now hearing a commotion in the street sprang on his feet looked out of the window and rang the bell violently  waiter he said is that our carriage why did you not tells us come lasses be stirring the freshness of the day is gone you may rejoice in not having to walk there is a chance of saving the remnants of skin the sun has left on our chins and noses today we shall he stewed instead of barbecued  on their leaving the room to get ready for their journey my friend roberts told me the strangers were the poet wordsworth his wife and sister  who could have divined this i could see no trace in the hard features and weatherstained brow of the outer man of the divinity within him in a few minutes the travellers reappeared we cordially shook hands and agreed to meet again at geneva now that i knew that i was talking to one of the veterans of the gentle craft as there was no time to waste in idle ceremony i asked him abruptly what he thought of shelley as a poet  nothing he replied as abruptly  seeing my surprise he added a poet who has not produced a good poem before he is twentyfive we may conclude cannot and never will do so  the cenci i said eagerly  wont do he replied shaking his head as he got into the carriage a roughcoated scotch terrier followed him  this hairy fellow is our fleatrap he shouted out as they started off  when i recovered from the shock of having heard the harsh sentence passed by an elder bard on a younger brother of the muses i exclaimed  after all poets are but earth it is the old storyenvycain and abel professions sects and communities in general right or wrong hold together men of the pen excepted if one of their guild is worsted in the battle they do as the rooks do by their inky brothersfly from him cawing and screaming if they dont fire the shot they sound the bugle to charge  i did not then know that the fullfledged author never reads the writings of his contemporaries except to cut them up in a review that being a work of love in after years shelley being dead wordsworth confessed this fact he was then induced to read some of shelleys poems and admitted that shelley was the greatest master of harmonious verse in our modern literature pp 48274  274 see our index under shelley g     l from

cottage loughrigg ambleside july 26 1826  rydal where we now are has an air of repose and seclusion which i have rarely seen surpassed the first few days we were here we perfectly luxuriated in the purity and sweetness of the air and the delicious stillness of its pastures and woods it is interesting too on another account as being the residence of the poet wordsworth his house is about a quarter of a mile from ours and since osler joined us we have obtained an introduction to him and he favoured us with his company at tea one evening last week he is a very interesting man remarkably simple in his manners full of enthusiasm and eloquence in conversation especially on the subject of his favourite artpoetrywhich he seems to have studied in a very philosophical spirit and about which he entertains some peculiar opinions spenser shakspeare and milton are his favourites among the english poets especially the latter whom he almost idolises he expressed one opinion which rather surprised me and in which i could not concurthat he preferred the samson agonistes to comus he recited in vindication of his judgment one very fine passage from the former poem and in a very striking manner his voice is deep and pathetic and thrills with feeling he is toryishat least what would he considered soin his political principles though he disclaims all connection with party and certainly argues with great fairness and temper on controverted topics such as parliamentary reform and catholic emancipation we took a long walk with him the other evening to the scene of one of his pastorals in the neighbourhood of grasmere he has a good deal of general conversation and has more the manners of a man of the world than i should have expected from his poems but his discourse indicates great simplicity and purity of mind indeed nothing renders his conversation more interesting than the unaffected tone of elevated morality and devotion which pervades it we have been reading his long poem the excursion since we came here i particularly recommend it to your notice barring some few extra vagancies into which his peculiar theory has led him his fourth book the last contains specimens both of versification sentiment and imagery scarcely inferior to what you will find in the best passages of milton he spoke with great plainness and yet with candour of his contemporaries he admitted the power of byron in describing the workings of human passion but denied that he knew anything of the beauties of nature or succeeded in describing them with fidelity this he illustrated by examples he spoke with deserved severity of byrons licentiousness and contempt of religious decorum he told us he thought the greatest of modern geniuses had he given his powers a proper direction and one decidedly superior to byron was shelley a young man author of queen mab who died lately at rome vol i pp 724                     manchester july 16 1830  though i am busy i feel rather melancholy and i am continually reminded how sad my life would be without the society and affection of those we love and how terribly awful the dispensation of death must be to those who cannot anticipate a future reunion and regard it as the utter extinction of all human interests and affections i am solacing myself with wordsworth do you know i shall become a thorough convert to him much of his poetry is delicious and i perfectly adore his philosophy to me he seems the purest the most elevated and the most christian of poets i delight in his deep and tender piety and his spirit of exquisite sympathy with whatever is lovely and grand in the breathing universe around us vol i p 86                                        m anecdote of crabbe  from diary of sir walter scott  talking of wordsworth he w told anne a story the object of which as she understood it was to show that crabbe had no imagination crabbe sir george beaumont and wordsworth were sitting together in murrays room in albemarlestreet sir george after sealing a letter blew out the candle which had enabled him to do so and exchanging a look with wordsworth began to admire in silence the undulating thread of smoke which slowly arose from the expiring wick when crabbe put on the extinguisher anne laughed at the instance and inquired if the taper was wax and being answered in the negative seemed to think that there was no call on mr crabbe to sacrifice his sense of smell to their admiration of beautiful and evanescent forms in two other men i should have said why it is affectations with sir hugh evans merry wives of windsor act i scene 1 but sir george is the man in the world most void of affectation and then he is an exquisite painter and no doubt saw where the incident would have succeeded in painting the error is not in you yourself receiving deep impressions from slight hints but in supposing that precisely the same sort of impression must arise in the mind of men otherwise of kindred feeling or that the commonplace folk of the world can derive such inductions at any time or under any circumstances275                                          n later opinion of loud brougham  i am just come from breakfasting with henry taylor to meet wordsworth the same party as when he had southeymill elliot charles villiers wordsworth may be bordering on sixty hardfeatured brown wrinkled with prominent teeth and a few scattered gray hairs but nevertheless not a disagreeable countenance and very cheerful merry courteous and talkative much more so than i should have expected from the grave and didactic character of his writings he held forth on poetry painting politics and metaphysics and with a great deal of eloquence he is more conversible and with a greater flow of animal spirits than southey he mentioned that he never wrote down as he composed but composed walking riding or in bed and wrote down after that southey always composes at his desk he talked a great deal of brougham whose talents and domestic virtues he greatly admires that he was very generous and affectionate in his disposition full of duty and attention to his mother and had adopted and provided for a whole family of his brothers children and treats his wifes children as if they were his own he insisted upon taking them both with him to the drawingroom the other day when he went in state as chancellor

mistaken in supposing that mrs hemans could as easily have managed the spear of minerva as her needle her brave and beautiful life and her singlehanded upbringing of her many boys worthily make one

wordsworth habitually referred to his wife for the help of her judgment on his poems mrs wordsworth did not indeed possess the creative and colouring power of imagination that belonged to his sister as well as to himself but her simple truthfulness her strong good sense which no sophistry could impose upon and her delicate feeling for propriety rendered her judgment a test of utmost value with regard to any subjects of which it could take adequate cognisance and these were confined within no narrow rangethe workings of nature as it lived and moved around her social equities and charities religious and moral truth tried by the heart as well as by the head and verbal expression required by her to avoid the regions of the merely abstract and philosophical and keep to the lower but more poetical ground of idiomatic strength and transparent logic  p 457 l 18 the almost contemporary notice of milton a still more significant contemporary notice of milton than the wellknown one of the text occurs in the censure of the rota upon mr miltons book entituled the ready and easie way to establish a free commonwealth 1660 by james harrington as comes out at p 16 my oceana as it seems to have escaped the commentators a short quotation must be given here though you have scribled your eyes out your works have never been printed but for the company of chandlers and tobaccomen who are your stationers and the onely men that vend your labors pp 45 he a member of the rota said that he himself reprieved the whole defence of the people of england for a groat that was sentenced to vile mundungus and had sufferd inevitably but for him though it cost you much oyle and the rump 300l a year c ibid this of the defence  p 459 l 7 onward horace ode iv 2 1 ibid 2 27  p 462 l 15 walter scott is not a careful composer c this recurs in mr aubrey do veres recollections p 487 onward i venture as a scot to observe that for this one slight misquotation by scott on which so large a conclusion is built the quotations by wordsworth from others would furnish twentyfold he was singularly inexact in quotation as even these notes and illustrations will satisfy in the placesscarcely in a single instance being verbally accurate sweet certainly was a perfectly fitting word for the sequestered lake of st mary in its serene summer beauty moreover swans are not usually found singly but in pairs and a pair surely differenced not greatly the symbol of loneliness the latter remark points to wordsworths further objection as stated to mr de vere as supra  p 492 l 26 in the case of a certain poet since dead c i may record what his own son has not felt free to do that this was sir aubrey de vere whose song of faith and other poems has not yet gathered its ultimate renown wordsworth greatly admired the modest little volume see one of his sonnets on page 495 nor with the laureates poemplay of queen mary tudor winning inevitable welcome ought it to be forgottenas even prominent critics of it are sorrowfully forgettingthat sir aubrey de vere so long ago as 1847 published his drama of mary tudor i venture to affirm that it takes its placea lofty onebeside philip van artevelde and that it need fear no comparison with queen mary early and comparatively modern supreme poetry somehow gets out of sight for long  p 497 1 15 read no angel smiled i can only offer the plea of an old worthy who
