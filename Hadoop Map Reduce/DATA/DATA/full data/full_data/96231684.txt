54     xii scarborough        56     editors preface   turners harbors of england as it is generally called is a book which for various reasons has never received from readers of mr ruskins writings the attention it deserves true it has always been sought after by connoisseurs and collectors never fail with their eleven or twelve guineas whenever a set of artists proofs of the first edition of 1856 comes into the market but to the general reader the book with its twelve exquisitely delicate mezzotintsfour of which mr ruskin has declared to be among the very finest executed by turner from his marine subjectsis practically unknown  the primary reason for this neglect is not far to seek since 1877 no new edition of the work has been published and thus it has gradually passed from public knowledge though still regarded with lively interest by those to whom mr ruskins wordsparticularly words written in further unfolding of the subtleties of turners artat all times appeal so strongly  in his own preface mr ruskin has told us all that in 1856 it was necessary to know of the genesis of the harbors that account may now be supplemented with the following additional facts in 1826 turner in conjunction with lupton the engraver projected and commenced a serial publication entitled the ports of england but both artist and engraver lacked the opportunity required to carry the undertaking to a successful conclusion and three numbers only were completed each of these contained two engravings part i introducing scarborough and whitby duly appeared in 1826 part ii with dover and ramsgate in 1827 and in 1828 part iii containing sheerness and portsmouth closed the seriesa twentyeight years afterwards that is in 1856 five years after turners death these six plates together with six new ones were published by messrs e gambart  co at whose invitation mr ruskin consented to write the essay on turners marine painting which accompanied them the book a handsome folio appears to have been immediately successful for in the following year a second edition was called for this was a precise reprint of the 1856 edition but unhappily the delicate plates already began to exhibit signs of wear the copyright which had not been retained by mr ruskin but remained the property of messrs e gambart  co then passed to messrs day  son who after producing the third edition of 1859 in turn disposed of it to mr t j allman allman issued a fourth edition in 1872 and then parted with his rights to messrs smith elder  co who in 1877 brought out the fifth and until now last edition since that date the work has been out of print and has remained practically inaccessible to the ordinary reader      a to ornament the covers of these parts turner designed a     vignette which was printed upon the center of the front wrapper of     each as the ports of england is an exceptionally scarce book and     as the vignette can be obtained in no other form a facsimile of it     is here given the original drawing was presented by mr ruskin to     the fitzwilliam museum at cambridge where it may now be seen  it is matter for congratulation that at length means have been found to bring the harbors of england once more into currency and to issue the book through mr george allen at a price which will place it within the reach of the reading public at large  the last edition of 1877 with its worn and retouched platesb was published at twentyfive shillings less than a third of that sum will suffice to procure a copy of this new issue in which the prints save for their reduced size more nearly approach the clearness and beauty of the originals of 1856 than any of the three editions which have immediately preceded it      b by this time 1877 the plates had become considerably worn and     were accordingly retouched by mr chas a tomkins but such     retouching proved worse than useless the delicacy of the finer work     had entirely vanished and the plates remained but a ghost of their     former selves such as no one would recognize as doing justice to     turner the fifth is unquestionably the least satisfactory of the     five original editions containing luptons engravings  i have before me the following interesting letter addressed by mr ruskins father to mr w smith williams for many years literary adviser to messrs smith elder  co       chamouni august 4th 1856       my dear siri hear that in the athenæum of 26th july there is      a good article on my sons harbors of england and i should be      greatly obliged by mr gordon smith sending me that number       the history of this book i believe i told you gambart the      french publisher and picture dealer said some 18 months ago that      he was going to put out 12 turner plates never published of      english harbors and he would give my son two good turner drawings      for a few pages of text to illustrate themc john agreed and      wrote the text when poorly in the spring of 1855 at tunbridge      wells and it seems the work has just come out it was in my      opinion an extremely well done thing and more likely as far as it      went if not to be extremely popular at least to be received      without cavil than anything he had written if there is a very      favorable review in the athenæum  it may tend to disarm the      critics and partly influence opinion of his larger workswith      our united kind regards       yours very truly      john james ruskin      c mr e gambart who is still living states that to the best of     his recollection he paid mr ruskin 150 guineas for his work     probably this was the price originally agreed upon the two turner     drawings being ultimately accepted as a more welcome and appropriate     form of remuneration  in all save one particular the text here given follows precisely that of the previous issues it has been the good fortune of the present editor to be able to restore a characteristic passage suppressed from motives of prudence when the work was originally plannedd the proofsheets of the first edition worked upon by mr ruskin were given by him to his old nurse annee she fortunately carefully preserved them and in turn gave them to mr allen some ten years before he became mr ruskins publisher these proofs had been submitted as they came from the press to mr w h harrison well known to readers of on the old road etc as my first editor who marked them freely with notes and suggestions to one passage he appears to have taken so decided an objection that its author was prevailed upon to delete it but whilst deferring thus to the judgment of others and consenting to remove a sentence which he doubtless regarded with particular satisfaction as expressing a decided opinion upon a favorite picture mr ruskin indulged in one of those pleasantries which now and again we observe in his informal letters though seldom if ever in his serious writings in the margin below the canceled passage he wrote boldly sacrificed to the muse of prudence j rf      d see post p 19      e see præterita she died march 30th 1871      f the accompanying illustration is a facsimile of the portion of     the proofsheet described aboveslightly reduced to fit the smaller     page  that mr harrison was justified in raising objection to this moderate estimate of turners picture will i think be readily allowed in those days mr ruskins influence was comparatively speaking small and the expression of an opinion which heaped praise upon the single painting of a partially understood painter at the expense of a great and popular institution would only have served to arouse opposition and possibly to attract ridicule it is different today we know the keen enthusiasm of the author of the seven lamps and have seen again and again how he expresses himself in terms of somewhat exaggerated admiration when writing of a painter whom he appreciates or a picture that he loves to us this enthusiasm is an attractive characteristic it has never been permitted to distort the vision or cloud the critical faculty and we follow the teaching of the master all the more closely because we feel his fervor and know how completely he becomes possessed with a subject which appeals to his imagination or his heart i have therefore not scrupled to revive the words which he consented to immolate at the shrine of prudence  it is not my province here to enter into any criticism of the pages which follow but for the benefit of those who are not versed in the minutiæ of shelleyan topics a word may be said regarding mr ruskins referenceg to the poet who met his death in the bay of spezzia the don juan was no traitorous craft fuller and more authentic information is to hand now than the meager facts at the disposal of a writer in 1856 and we know that the greed of man and not the lack of seaworthiness in his tiny vessel caused percy shelley to            suffer a sea change     into something rich and strange      g see post p 3  there is unhappily no longer any room for doubt that the don juan was willfully run down by a felucca whose crew coveted the considerable sum of money they believed byron to have placed on board and cared nothing for the sacrifice of human life in their eagerness to seize the gold  the twelve engravings to which reference has already been made have been reproduced by the photogravure process from a selected set of early examples and in addition the plates so prepared have been carefully worked upon by mr allen himself it will thus be apparent that everything possible has been done to produce a worthy edition of a worthy book and to place in the hands of the public what to the present generation of readers is tantamount to a new work from a pen whichalashas now for so long a time been still  thomas j wise     authors original preface   among the many peculiarities which distinguished the late j m w turner from other landscape painters not the least notable in my apprehension were his earnest desire to arrange his works in connected groups and his evident intention with respect to each drawing that it should be considered as expressing part of a continuous system of thought the practical result of this feeling was that he commenced many series of drawingsand if any accident interfered with the continuation of the work hastily concluded themunder titles representing rather the relation which the executed designs bore to the materials accumulated in his own mind than the position which they could justifiably claim when contemplated by others the river scenery was closed without a single drawing of a rapidly running stream and the prints of his annual tours were assembled under the title of the rivers of france without including a single illustration either of the rhone or the garonne  the title under which the following plates are now presented to the public is retained merely out of respect to this habit of turners under that title he commenced the publication and executed the vignette for its titlepage intending doubtless to make it worthy of taking rank with if not far above the consistent and extensive series of the southern coast executed in his earlier years but procrastination and accident equally interfered with his purpose the excellent engraver mr lupton in cooperation with whom the work was undertaken was unfortunately also a man of genius and seems to have been just as capricious as turner himself in the application of his powers to the matter in hand had one of the parties in the arrangement been a mere plodding man of business the work would have proceeded but between the two men of talent it came very naturally to a stand they petted each other by reciprocal indulgence of delay and at turners death the series so magnificently announced under the title of the harbors of england consisted only of twelve plates all the less worthy of their highsounding title in that while they included illustrations of some of the least important of the wateringplaces they did not include any illustration whatever of such harbors of england as liverpool shields yarmouth or bristol such as they were however i was requested to undertake their illustration as the offer was made at a moment when much nonsense in various forms was being written about turner and his works and among the twelve plates there were fourh which i considered among the very finest that had been executed from his marine subjects i accepted the trust partly to prevent the really valuable series of engravings from being treated with injustice and partly because there were several features in them by which i could render more intelligible some remarks i wished to make on turners marine painting in general      h portsmouth sheerness scarborough and whitby  these remarks therefore i have thrown together in a connected form less with a view to the illustration of these particular plates than of the general system of shippainting which was characteristic of the great artist i have afterwards separately noted the points which seemed to me most deserving of attention in the plates themselves  of archæological information the reader will find none the designs themselves are in most instances little more than spirited seapieces with such indistinct suggestion of local features in the distance as may justify the name given to the subject but even when as in the case of the dover and portsmouth there is something approaching topographical detail i have not considered it necessary to lead the reader into inquiries which certainly turner himself never thought of nor do i suppose it would materially add to the interest of these cloud distances or rolling seas if i had the timewhich i have notto collect the most complete information respecting the raising of prospect rows and the establishment of circulating libraries  denmark hill 1856     the harbors of england   of all things living or lifeless upon this strange earth there is but one which having reached the midterm of appointed human endurance on it i still regard with unmitigated amazement i know indeed that all around me is wonderfulbut i cannot answer it with wondera dark veil with the foolish words nature of things upon it casts its deadening folds between me and their dazzling strangeness flowers open and stars rise and it seems to me they could have done no less the mystery of distant mountainblue only makes me reflect that the earth is of necessity mountainousthe seawave breaks at my feet and i do not see how it should have remained unbroken but one object there is still which i never pass without the renewed wonder of childhood and that is the bow of a boat not of a racingwherry or revenue cutter or clipper yacht but the blunt head of a common bluff undecked seaboat lying aside in its furrow of beach sand the sum of navigation is in that you may magnify it or decorate as you will you do not add to the wonder of it lengthen it into hatchetlike edge of ironstrengthen it with complex tracery of ribs of oakcarve it and gild it till a column of light moves beneath it on the seayou have made no more of it than it was at first that rude simplicity of bent plank that can breast its way through the death that is in the deep sea has in it the soul of shipping beyond this we may have more work more men more money we cannot have more miracle  for there is first an infinite strangeness in the perfection of the thing as work of human hands i know nothing else that man does which is perfect but that all his other doings have some sign of weakness affectation or ignorance in them they are overfinished or underfinished they do not quite answer their end or they show a mean vanity in answering it too well  but the boats bow is naïvely perfect complete without an effort the man who made it knew not he was making anything beautiful as he bent its planks into those mysterious everchanging curves it grows under his hand into the image of a seashell the seal as it were of the flowing of the great tides and streams of ocean stamped on its delicate rounding he leaves it when all is done without a boast it is simple work but it will keep out water and every plank thenceforward is a fate and has mens lives wreathed in the knots of it as the clothyard shaft had their deaths in its plumes  then also it is wonderful on account of the greatness of the thing accomplished no other work of human hands ever gained so much steamengines and telegraphs indeed help us to fetch and carry and talk they lift weights for us and bring messages with less trouble than would have been needed otherwise this saving of trouble however does not constitute a new faculty it only enhances the powers we already possess but in that bow of the boat is the gift of another world without it what prison wall would be so strong as that white and wailing fringe of sea what maimed creatures were we all chained to our rocks andromedalike or wandering by the endless shores wasting our incommunicable strength and pining in hopeless watch of unconquerable waves the nails that fasten together the planks of the boats bow are the rivets of the fellowship of the world their iron does more than draw lightning out of heaven it leads love round the earth  then also it is wonderful on account of the greatness of the enemy that it does battle with to lift dead weight to overcome length of languid space to multiply or systematize a given force this we may see done by the bar or beam or wheel without wonder but to war with that living fury of waters to bare its breast moment after moment against the unwearied enmity of oceanthe subtle fitful implacable smiting of the black waves provoking each other on endlessly all the infinite march of the atlantic rolling on behind them to their helpand still to strike them back into a wreath of smoke and futile foam and win its way against them and keep its charge of life from themdoes any other soulless thing do as much as this  i should not have talked of this feeling of mine about a boat if i had thought it was mine only but i believe it to be common to all of us who are not seamen with the seaman wonder changes into fellowship and close affection but to all landsmen from youth upwards the boat remains a piece of enchantment at least unless we entangle our vanity in it and refine it away into mere lath giving up all its protective nobleness for pace with those in whose eyes the perfection of a boat is swift fragility i have no sympathy the glory of a boat is first its steadiness of poiseits assured standing on the clear softness of the abyss and after that so much capacity of progress by oar or sail as shall be consistent with this defiance of the treachery of the sea and this being understood it is very notable how commonly the poets creating for themselves an ideal of motion fasten upon the charm of a boat they do not usually express any desire for wings or if they do it is only in some vague and halfunintended phrase such as flit or soar involving wingedness seriously they are evidently content to let the wings belong to horse or muse or angel rather than to themselves but they all somehow or other express an honest wish for a spiritual boat i will not dwell on poor shelleys paper navies and seas of quicksilver lest we should begin to think evil of boats in general because of that traitorous one in spezzia bay but it is a triumph to find the pastorally minded wordsworth imagine no other way of visiting the stars than in a boat no bigger than the crescent mooni and to find tennysonalthough his boating in an ordinary way has a very marshy and puntlike characterat last in his highest inspiration enter in where the wind began to sweep a music out of sheet and shroudj but the chief triumph of all is in dante he had known all manner of traveling had been borne through vacancy on the shoulders of chimeras and lifted through upper heaven in the grasp of its spirits but yet i do not remember that he ever expresses any positive wish on such matters except for a boat      i prologue to peter bell      j in memoriam ci      guido i wish that lapo thou and i       led by some strong enchantment might ascend       a magic ship whose charmed sails should fly       with winds at will whereer our thoughts might wend     so that no change nor any evil chance       should mar our joyous voyage but it might be       that even satiety should still enhance       between our souls their strict community     and that the bounteous wizard then would place       vanna and bice and our lapos love       companions of our wandering and would grace     with passionate talk wherever we might rove     our time and each were as content and free     as i believe that thou and i should be  and of all the descriptions of motion in the divina commedia i do not think there is another quite so fine as that in which dante has glorified the old fable of charon by giving a boat also to the bright sea which surrounds the mountain of purgatory bearing the redeemed souls to their place of trial only an angel is now the pilot and there is no stroke of laboring oar for his wings are the sails                            my preceptor silent yet     stood while the brightness that we first discerned     opened the form of wings then when he knew     the pilot cried aloud down down bend low     thy knees behold gods angel fold thy hands     now shalt thou see true ministers indeed     lo how all human means he sets at nought     so that nor oar he needs nor other sail     except his wings between such distant shores     lo how straight up to heaven he holds them reared     winnowing the air with those eternal plumes     that not like mortal hairs fall off or change        as more and more toward us came more bright     appeared the bird of god nor could the eye     endure his splendor near i mine bent down     he drove ashore in a small bark so swift     and light that in its course no wave it drank     the heavenly steersman at the prow was seen     visibly written blessed in his looks     within a hundred spirits and more there sat  i have given this passage at length because it seems to me that dantes most inventive adaptation of the fable of charon to heaven has not been regarded with the interest that it really deserves and because also it is a description that should be remembered by every traveler when first he sees the white fork of the felucca sail shining on the southern sea not that dante had ever seen such sailsk his thought was utterly irrespective of the form of canvas in any ship of the period but it is well to be able to attach this happy image to those felucca sails as they now float white and soft above the blue glowing of the bays of adria nor are other images wanting in them seen far away on the horizon the neapolitan felucca has all the aspect of some strange bird stooping out of the air and just striking the water with its claws while the venetian when its painted sails are at full swell in sunshine is as beautiful as a butterfly with its wings halfclosedl there is something also in them that might remind us of the variegated and spotted angel wings of orcagna only the venetian sail never looks majestic it is too quaint and strange yet with no peacocks pride or vulgar gayetynothing of miltons dalilah      so bedecked ornate and gay     like a stately ship     of tarsus bound for the isles     of javan or gadire     with all her bravery on and tackle trim     sails filled and streamers waving  that description could only have been written in a time of vulgar women and vulgar vessels the utmost vanity of dress in a woman of the fourteenth century would have given no image of sails filled or streamers waving nor does the look or action of a really stately ship ever suggest any image of the motion of a weak or vain woman the beauties of the court of charles ii and the gilded galleys of the thames might fitly be compared but the pomp of the venetian fisherboat is like neither the sail seems dyed in its fullness by the sunshine as the rainbow dyes a cloud the rich stains upon it fade and reappear as its folds swell or fall worn with the adrian storms its rough woof has a kind of noble dimness upon it and its colors seem as grave inherent and free from vanity as the spots of the leopard or veins of the seashell      k i am not quite sure of this not having studied with any care     the forms of mediæval shipping but in all the mss i have examined     the sails of the shipping represented are square      l it is not a little strange that in all the innumerable paintings     of venice old and modern no notice whatever had been taken of     these sails though they are exactly the most striking features of     the marine scenery around the city until turner fastened upon them     painting one important picture the sun of venice entirely in     their illustration  yet in speaking of poets love of boats i ought to have limited the love to modern poets dante in this respect as in nearly every other being far in advance of his age it is not often that i congratulate myself upon the days in which i happen to live but i do so in this respect that compared with every other period of the world this nineteenth century or rather the period between 1750 and 1850 may not improperly be called the age of boats while the classic and chivalric times in which boats were partly dreaded partly despised may respectively be characterized with regard to their means of locomotion as the age of chariots and the age of horses  for whatever perfection and costliness there may be in the present decorations harnessing and horsing of any english or parisian wheel equipage i apprehend that we can from none of them form any high ideal of wheel conveyance and that unless we had seen an egyptian king bending his bow with his horses at the gallop or a greek knight leaning with his poised lance over the shoulder of his charioteer we have no right to consider ourselves as thoroughly knowing what the word chariot in its noblest acceptation means  so also though much chivalry is yet left in us and we english still know several things about horses i believe that if we had seen charlemagne and roland ride out hunting from aix or coeur de lion trot into camp on a sunny evening at ascalon or a florentine lady canter down the val darno in dantes time with her hawk on her wrist we should have had some other ideas even about horses than the best we can have now but most assuredly nothing that ever swung at the quay sides of carthage or glowed with crusaders shields above the bays of syria could give to any contemporary human creature such an idea of the meaning of the word boat as may be now gained by any mortal happy enough to behold as much as a newcastle collier beating against the wind in the classical period indeed there was some importance given to shipping as the means of locking a battlefield together on the waves but in the chivalric period the whole mind of man is withdrawn from the sea regarding it merely as a treacherous impediment over which it was necessary sometimes to find conveyance but from which the thoughts were always turned impatiently fixing themselves in green fields and pleasures that may be enjoyed by landthe very supremacy of the horse necessitating the scorn of the sea which would not be trodden by hoofs  it is very interesting to note how repugnant every oceanic idea appears to be to the whole nature of our principal english mediæval poet chaucer read first the man of lawes tale in which the lady constance is continually floated up and down the mediterranean and the german ocean in a ship by herself carried from syria all the way to northumberland and there wrecked upon the coast thence yet again driven up and down among the waves for five years she and her child and yet all this while chaucer does not let fall a single word descriptive of the sea or express any emotion whatever about it or about the ship he simply tells us the lady sailed here and was wrecked there but neither he nor his audience appear to be capable of receiving any sensation but one of simple aversion from waves ships or sands compare with his absolutely apathetic recital the description by a modern poet of the sailing of a vessel charged with the fate of another constance      it curled not tweed alone that breeze     for far upon northumbrian seas       it freshly blew and strong     where from high whitbys cloistered pile     bound to st cuthberts holy isle       it bore a bark along     upon the gale she stooped her side     and bounded oer the swelling tide       as she were dancing home     the merry seamen laughed to see     their gallant ship so lustily       furrow the green sea foam  now just as scott enjoys this sea breeze so does chaucer the soft air of the woods the moment the older poet lands he is himself again his poverty of language in speaking of the ship is not because he despises description but because he has nothing to describe hear him upon the ground in spring      these woodes else recoveren greene     that drie in winter ben to sene     and the erth waxeth proud withall     for sweet dewes that on it fall     and the poore estate forget     in which that winter had it set     and then becomes the ground so proude     that it wol have a newe shroude     and maketh so queint his robe and faire     that it had hewes an hundred paire     of grasse and floures of inde and pers     and many hewes full divers     that is the robe i mean ywis     through which the ground to praisen is  in like manner wherever throughout his poems we find chaucer enthusiastic it is on a sunny day in the good greenwood but the slightest approach to the seashore makes him shiver and his antipathy finds at last positive expression and becomes the principal foundation of the frankeleines tale in which a lady waiting for her husbands return in a castle by the sea behaves and expresses herself as follows        another time wold she sit and thinke     and cast her eyen dounward fro the brinke     but whan she saw the grisly rockes blake     for veray fere so wold hire herte quake     that on hire feet she might hire not sustene     than wold she sit adoun upon the grene     and pitously into the see behold     and say right thus with careful sighes cold       eterne god that thurgh thy purveance     ledest this world by certain governance     in idel as men sain ye nothing make     but lord thise grisly fendly rockes blake     that semen rather a foule confusion     of werk than any faire creation     of swiche a parfit wise god and stable     why han ye wrought this werk unresonable  the desire to have the rocks out of her way is indeed severely punished in the sequel of the tale but it is not the less characteristic of the age and well worth meditating upon in comparison with the feelings of an unsophisticated modern french or english girl among the black rocks of dieppe or ramsgate  on the other hand much might be said about that peculiar love of green fields and birds in the middle ages and of all with which it is connected purity and health in manners and heart as opposed to the too frequent condition of the modern mind        as for the birds in the thicket     thrush or ousel in leafy niche     linnet or finchshe was far too rich     to care for a morning concert to which       she was welcome without a ticketm      m thomas hood  but this would lead us far afield and the main fact i have to point out to the reader is the transition of human grace and strength from the exercises of the land to those of the sea in the course of the last three centuries  down to elizabeths time chivalry lasted and grace of dress and mien and all else that was connected with chivalry then came the ages which when they have taken their due place in the depths of the past will be by a wise and clearsighted futurity perhaps well comprehended under a common name as the ages of starch periods of general stiffening and bluishwhitening with a prevailing washerwomans taste in everything involving a change of steel armor into cambric of natural hair into peruke of natural walking into that which will disarrange no wristbands of plain language into quips and embroideries and of human life in general from a green racecourse where to be defeated was at worst only to fall behind and recover breath into a slippery pole to be climbed with toil and contortion and in clinging to which each mans foot is on his neighbors head  but meanwhile the marine deities were incorruptible it was not possible to starch the sea and precisely as the stiffness fastened upon men it vanished from ships what had once been a mere raft with rows of formal benches pushed along by laborious flap of oars and with infinite fluttering of flags and swelling of poops above gradually began to lean more heavily into the deep water to sustain a gloomy weight of guns to draw back its spiderlike feebleness of limb and open its bosom to the wind and finally darkened down from all its painted vanities into the long low hull familiar with the overflying foam that has no other pride but in its daily duty and victory while through all these changes it gained continually in grace strength audacity and beauty until at last it has reached such a pitch of all these that there is not except the very loveliest creatures of the living world anything in nature so absolutely notable bewitching and according to its means and measure heartoccupying as a wellhandled ship under sail in a stormy day any ship from lowest to proudest has due place in that architecture of the sea beautiful not so much in this or that piece of it as in the unity of all from cottage to cathedral into their great buoyant dynasty yet among them the fisherboat corresponding to the cottage on the land only far more sublime than a cottage ever can be is on the whole the thing most venerable i doubt if ever academic grove were half so fit for profitable meditation as the little strip of shingle between two black steep overhanging sides of stranded fishingboats the clear heavy wateredge of ocean rising and falling close to their bows in that unaccountable way which the sea has always in calm weather turning the pebbles over and over as if with a rake to look for something and then stopping a moment down at the bottom of the bank and coming up again with a little run and clash throwing a foots depth of salt crystal in an instant between you and the round stone you were going to take in your hand sighing all the while as if it would infinitely rather be doing something else and the dark flanks of the fishingboats all aslope above in their shining quietness hot in the morning sun rusty and seamed with square patches of plank nailed over their rents just rough enough to let the little flatfooted fisherchildren haul or twist themselves up to the gunwales and drop back again along some stray rope just round enough to remind us in their broad and gradual curves of the sweep of the green surges they know so well and of the hours when those old sides of seared timber all ashine with the sea plunge and dip into the deep green purity of the mounded waves more joyfully than a deer lies down among the grass of spring the soft white cloud of foam opening momentarily at the bows and fading or flying high into the breeze where the seagulls toss and shriekthe joy and beauty of it all the while so mingled with the sense of unfathomable danger and the human effort and sorrow going on perpetually from age to age waves rolling forever and winds moaning forever and faithful hearts trusting and sickening forever and brave lives dashed away about the rattling beach like weeds forever and still at the helm of every lonely boat through starless night and hopeless dawn his hand who spread the fishers net over the dust of the sidonian palaces and gave into the fishers hand the keys of the kingdom of heaven  next after the fishingboatwhich as i said in the architecture of the sea represents the cottage more especially the pastoral or agricultural cottage watchful over some pathless domain of moorland or arable as the fishingboat swims humbly in the midst of the broad green fields and hills of ocean out of which it has to win such fruit as they can give and to compass with net or drag such flocks as it may findnext to this oceancottage ranks in interest it seems to me the small overwrought undercrewed illcaulked merchant brig or schooner the kind of ship which first shows its couple of thin masts over the low fields or marshes as we near any thirdrate seaport and which is sure somewhere to stud the great space of glittering water seen from any seacliff with its four or five squareset sails of the larger and more polite tribes of merchant vessels threemasted and passengercarrying i have nothing to say feeling in general little sympathy with people who want to go anywhere nor caring much about anything which in the essence of it expresses a desire to get to other sides of the world but only for homely and stayathome ships that live their life and die their death about english rocks neither have i any interest in the higher branches of commerce such as traffic with spice islands and porterage of painted teachests or carved ivory for all this seems to me to fall under the head of commerce of the drawingroom costly but not venerable i respect in the merchant service only those ships that carry coals herrings salt timber iron and such other commodities and that have disagreeable odor and unwashed decks but there are few things more impressive to me than one of these ships lying up against some lonely quay in a black seafog with the furrow traced under its tawny keel far in the harbor slime the noble misery that there is in it the might of its rent and strained unseemliness its waveworn melancholy resting there for a little while in the comfortless ebb unpitied and claiming no pity still less honored least of all conscious of any claim to honor casting and craning by due balance whatever is in its hold up to the pier in quiet truth of time spinning of wheel and slackening of rope and swinging of spade in as accurate cadence as a waltz music one or two of its crew perhaps away forward and a hungry boy and yelping dog eagerly interested in something from which a blue dull smoke rises out of pot or pan but darkbrowed and silent their limbs slack like the ropes above them entangled as they are in those inextricable meshes about the patched knots and heaps of illreefed sable sail what a majestic sense of service in all that languor the rest of human limbs and hearts at utter need not in sweet meadows or soft air but in harbor slime and biting fog so drawing their breath once more to go out again without lament from between the two skeletons of pierheads vocal with wash of under wave into the gray troughs of tumbling brine there as they can with slacked rope and patched sail and leaky hull again to roll and stagger far away amidst the wind and salt sleet from dawn to dusk and dusk to dawn winning day by day their daily bread and for last reward when their old hands on some winter night lose feeling along the frozen ropes and their old eyes miss mark of the lighthouse quenched in foam the solong impossible rest that shall hunger no more neither thirst any moretheir eyes and mouths filled with the brown seasand  after these most venerable to my mind of all ships properly so styled i find nothing of comparable interest in any floating fabric until we come to the great achievement of the 19th century for one thing this century will in after ages be considered to have done in a superb manner and one thing i think only it has not distinguished itself in political spheres still less in artistical it has produced no golden age by its reason neither does it appear eminent for the constancy of its faith its telescopes and telegraphs would be creditable to it if it had not in their pursuit forgotten in great part how to see clearly with its eyes and to talk honestly with its tongue its natural history might have been creditable to it also if it could have conquered its habit of considering natural history to be mainly the art of writing latin names on white tickets but as it is none of these things will be hereafter considered to have been got on with by us as well as might be whereas it will always be said of us with unabated reverence  they built ships of the line  take it all in all a ship of the line is the most honorable thing that man as a gregarious animal has ever produced by himself unhelped he can do better things than ships of the line he can make poems and pictures and other such concentrations of what is best in him but as a being living in flocks and hammering out with alternate strokes and mutual agreement what is necessary for him in those flocks to get or produce the ship of the line is his first work into that he has put as much of his human patience common sense forethought experimental philosophy selfcontrol habits of order and obedience thoroughly wrought handwork defiance of brute elements careless courage careful patriotism and calm expectation of the judgment of god as can well be put into a space of 300 feet long by 80 broad and i am thankful to have lived in an age when i could see this thing so done  considering then our shipping under the three principal types of fishingboat collier and ship of the line as the great glory of this age and the new forest of mast and yard that follows the windings of the thames to be take it all in all a more majestic scene i dont say merely than any of our streets or palaces as they now are but even than the best that streets and palaces can generally be it has often been a matter of serious thought to me how far this chiefly substantial thing done by the nation ought to be represented by the art of the nation how far our great artists ought seriously to devote themselves to such perfect painting of our ships as should reveal to later generationslost perhaps in clouds of steam and floating troughs of ashesthe aspect of an ancient ship of battle under sail  to which i fear the answer must be sternly this that no great art ever was or can be employed in the careful imitation of the work of man as its principal subject that is to say art will not bear to be reduplicated a ship is a noble thing and a cathedral a noble thing but a painted ship or a painted cathedral is not a noble thing art which reduplicates art is necessarily secondrate art i know no principle more irrefragably authoritative than that which i had long ago occasion to express all noble art is the expression of mans delight in gods work not in his own  how it will be asked are stanfield isabey and prout necessarily artists of the second order because they paint ships and buildings instead of trees and clouds yes necessarily of the second order so far as they paint ships rather than sea and so far as they paint buildings rather than the natural light and color and work of years upon those buildings for in this respect a ruined building is a noble subject just as far as mans work has therein been subdued by natures and stanfields chief dignity is his being a painter less of shipping than of the seal of time or decay upon shippingn for a wrecked ship or shattered boat is a noble subject while a ship in full sail or a perfect boat is an ignoble one not merely because the one is by reason of its ruin more picturesque than the other but because it is a nobler act in man to meditate upon fate as it conquers his work than upon that work itself      n as in the very beautiful picture of this years academy the     abandoned  shipping therefore in its perfection never can become the subject of noble art and that just because to represent it in its perfection would tax the powers of art to the utmost if a great painter could rest in drawing a ship as he can rest in drawing a piece of drapery we might sometimes see vessels introduced by the noblest workmen and treated by them with as much delight as they would show in scattering luster over an embroidered dress or knitting the links of a coat of mail but ships cannot be drawn at times of rest more complicated in their anatomy than the human frame itself so far as that frame is outwardly discernible liable to all kinds of strange accidental variety in position and movement yet in each position subject to imperative laws which can only be followed by unerring knowledge and involving in the roundings and foldings of sail and hull delicacies of drawing greater than exist in any other inorganic object except perhaps a snow wreathothey present irrespective of sea or sky or anything else around them difficulties which could only be vanquished by draughtsmanship quite accomplished enough to render even the subtlest lines of the human face and form but the artist who has once attained such skill as this will not devote it to the drawing of ships he who can paint the face of st paul will not elaborate the parting timbers of the vessel in which he is wrecked and he who can represent the astonishment of the apostles at the miraculous draught will not be solicitous about accurately showing that their boat is overloaded      o the catenary and other curves of tension which a sail assumes     under the united influence of the wind its own weight and the     particular tensions of the various ropes by which it is attached or     against which it presses show at any moment complexities of     arrangement to which fidelity except after the study of a lifetime     is impossible  what it will perhaps be replied have then ships never been painted perfectly yet even by the men who have devoted most attention to them assuredly not a ship never yet has been painted at all in any other sense than men have been painted in landscapes with figures things have been painted which have a general effect of ships just as things have been painted which have a general effect of shepherds or banditti but the best average shippainting no more reaches the truth of ships than the equestrian troops in one of van der meulens battlepieces express the higher truths of humanity  illustration fig 1  take a single instance i do not know any work in which on the whole there is a more unaffected love of ships for their own sake and a fresher feeling of sea breeze always blowing than stanfields coast scenery now let the reader take up that book and look through all the plates of it at the way in which the most important parts of a ships skeleton are drawn those most wonderful junctions of mast with mast corresponding to the knee or hip in the human frame technically known as tops under its very simplest form in one of those poor collier brigs which i have above endeavored to recommend to the readers affection the junction of the topgallantmast with the topmast when the sail is reefed will present itself under no less complex and mysterious form than this in fig 1 a horned knot of seven separate pieces of timber irrespective of the two masts and the yard the whole balanced and involved in an apparently inextricable web of chain and rope consisting of at least sixteen ropes about the topgallantmast and some twentyfive crossing each other in every imaginable degree of slackness and slope about the topmast twothirds of these ropes are omitted in the cut because i could not draw them without taking more time and pains than the point to be illustrated was worth the thing as it is being drawn quite well enough to give some idea of the facts of it well take up stanfields coast scenery and look through it in search of tops and you will invariably find them represented as in fig 2 or even with fewer lines the example fig 2 being one of the tops of the frigate running into portsmouth harbor magnified to about twice its size in the plate  illustration fig 2  well but it was impossible to do more on so small a scale by no means but take what scale you choose of stanfields or any other marine painters most elaborate painting and let me magnify the study of the real top in proportion and the deficiency of detail will always be found equally great i mean in the work of the higher artists for there are of course many efforts at greater accuracy of delineation by those painters of ships who are to the higher marine painter what botanical draughtsmen are to the landscapists but just as in the botanical engraving the spirit and life of the plant are always lost so in the technical shippainting the life of the ship is always lost without as far as i can see attaining even by this sacrifice anything like completeness of mechanical delineation at least i never saw the ship drawn yet which gave me the slightest idea of the entanglement of real rigging  respecting this lower kind of shippainting it is always matter of wonder to me that it satisfies sailors some years ago i happened to stand longer than pleased my pensioner guide before turners battle of trafalgar at greenwich hospital a picture which at a moderate estimate is simply worth all the rest of the hospitalgroundwallspictures and models put together my guide supposing me to be detained by indignant wonder at seeing it in so good a place assented to my supposed sentiments by muttering in a low voice well sir it is a shame that that thing should be there we ought to a ad a uggins thats sartain i was not surprised that my sailor friend should be disgusted at seeing the victory lifted nearly right out of the water and all the sails of the fleet blowing about to that extent that the crews might as well have tried to reef as many thunderclouds but i was surprised at his perfect repose of respectful faith in uggins who appeared to meunfortunate landsman as i wasto give no more idea of the look of a ship of the line going through the sea than might be obtained from seeing one of the correct models at the top of the hall floated in a fishpond  leaving however the sailor to his enjoyment on such grounds as it may be of this model drawing and being prepared to find only a vague and hasty shadowing forth of shipping in the works of artists proper we will glance briefly at the different stages of excellence which such shadowing forth has reached and note in their consecutive changes the feelings with which shipping has been regarded at different periods of art  1 mediæval period the vessel is regarded merely as a sort of seacarriage and painted only so far as it is necessary for complete display of the groups of soldiers or saints on the deck a great deal of quaint shipping richly hung with shields and gorgeous with banners is however thus incidently represented in 15thcentury manuscripts embedded in curly green waves of sea full of long fish and although there is never the slightest expression of real sea character of motion gloom or spray there is more real interest of marine detail and incident than in many later compositions  2 early venetian period a great deal of tolerably careful boatdrawing occurs in the pictures of carpaccio and gentile bellini deserving separate mention among the marine schools in confirmation of what has been stated above that the drawing of boats is more difficult than that of the human form for long after all the perspectives and foreshortenings of the human body were completely understood as well as those of architecture it remained utterly beyond the power of the artists of the time to draw a boat with even tolerable truth boats are always tilted up on end or too long or too short or too high in the water generally they appear to be regarded with no interest whatever and are painted merely where they are matters of necessity this is perfectly natural we pronounce that there is romance in the venetian conveyance by oars merely because we ourselves are in the habit of being dragged by horses a venetian on the other hand sees vulgarity in a gondola and thinks the only true romance is in a hackney coach and thus it was no more likely that a painter in the days of venetian power should pay much attention to the shipping in the grand canal than that an english artist should at present concentrate the brightest rays of his genius on a cabstand  3 late venetian period deserving mention only for its notably negative character none of the great venetian painters tintoret titian veronese bellini giorgione bonifazio ever introduce a ship if they can help it they delight in ponderous architecture in grass flowers blue mountains skies clouds and gay dresses nothing comes amiss to them but ships and the sea when they are forced to introduce these they represent merely a darkgreen plain with reddish galleys spotted about it here and there looking much like small models of shipping pinned on a green board in their marine battles there is seldom anything discernible except long rows of scarlet oars and men in armor falling helplessly through them  4 late roman period that is to say the time of the beginning of the renaissance landscape by the caracci claude and salvator first in their landscapes shipping begins to assume something like independent character and to be introduced for the sake of its picturesque interest although what interest could be taken by any healthy human creature in such vessels as were then painted has always remained a mystery to me the ships of claude having hulls of a shape something between a cocoanut and a highheeled shoe balanced on their keels on the top of the water with some scaffolding and crosssticks above and a flag at the top of every stick form perhaps the purest exhibition of human inanity and fatuity which the arts have yet produced the harbors also in which these model navies ride are worthy of all observation for the intensity of the false taste which endeavoring to unite in them the characters of pleasureground and port destroys the veracity of both there are many inlets of the italian seas where sweet gardens and regular terraces descend to the waters edge but these are not the spots where merchant vessels anchor or where bales are disembarked on the other hand there are many busy quays and noisy arsenals upon the shores of italy but queens palaces are not built upon the quays nor are the docks in any wise adorned with conservatories or ruins it was reserved for the genius of claude to combine the luxurious with the lucrative and rise to a commercial ideal in which cables are fastened to temple pillars and lighthouses adorned with rows of beaupots it seems strange also that any power which salvator showed in the treatment of other subjects utterly deserts him when he approaches the sea though always coarse false and vulgar he has at least energy and some degree of invention as long as he remains on land his terrestrial atrocities are animated and his rockborn fancies formidable but the sea air seems to dim his sight and paralyze his hand his love of darkness and destruction far from seeking sympathy in the rage of ocean disappears as he approaches the beach after having tortured the innocence of trees into demoniac convulsions and shattered the loveliness of purple hills into colorless dislocation he approaches the real wrath and restlessness of ocean without either admiration or dismay and appears to feel nothing at its shore except a meager interest in bathers fishermen and gentlemen in court dress bargaining for state cabins of all the pictures by men who bear the reputation of great masters which i have ever seen in my life except only some by domenichino the two large marines in the pitti palace attributed to salvator are on the whole the most vapid and vile examples of human want of understanding in the folly of claude there is still a gleam of grace and innocence there is refreshment in his childishness and tenderness in his inability but the folly of salvator is disgusting in its very nothingness it is like the vacuity of a plagueroom in an hospital shut up in uncleansed silence emptied of pain and motion but not of infection  5 dutch period although in artistical qualities lower than is easily by language expressible the italian marine painting usually conveys an idea of three facts about the seathat it is green that it is deep and that the sun shines on it the dark plain which stands for far away adriatic with the venetians and the glinting swells of tamed wave which lap about the quays of claude agree in giving the general impression that the ocean consists of pure water and is open to the pure sky but the dutch painters while they attain considerably greater dexterity than the italian in mere delineation of nautical incident were by nature precluded from ever becoming aware of these common facts and having in reality never in all their lives seen the sea but only a shallow mixture of seawater and sand and also never in all their lives seen the sky but only a lower element between them and it composed of marsh exhalation and fogbank they are not to be with too great severity reproached for the dullness of their records of the nautical enterprise of holland we only are to be reproached who familiar with the atlantic are yet ready to accept with faith as types of sea the small waves en papillote and perukelike puffs of farinaceous foam which were the delight of backhuysen and his compeers if one could but arrest the connoisseurs in the fact of looking at them with belief and magically introducing the image of a true seawave let it roll up to them through the roomone massive fathoms height and roods breadth of brine passing them by but oncedividing red sealike on right hand and leftbut at least setting close before their eyes for once in inevitable truth what a seawave really is its green mountainous giddiness of wrath its overwhelming crestheavy as iron fitful as flame clashing against the sky in long cloven edgeits furrowed flanks all ghastly clear deep in transparent death but all laced across with lurid nets of spume and tearing open into meshed interstices their churned veil of silver fury showing still the calm gray abyss below that has no fury and no voice but is as a grave always open which the green sighing mounds do but hide for an instant as they pass would they shuddering back from this wave of the true implacable sea turn forthwith to the papillotes it might be so it is what we are all doing more or less continually  well let the waves go their way it is not of them that we have here to reason but be it remembered that men who cannot enter into the mind of the sea cannot for the same reason enter into the mind of ships in their contention with it and the fluttering tottering highpooped flagbeset fleets of these dutch painters have only this much superiority over the caricatures of the italians that they indeed appear in some degree to have been studied from the highpooped and flagbeset nature which was in that age visible while the claude and salvator ships are ideals of the studio but the effort is wholly unsuccessful any one who has ever attempted to sketch a vessel in motion knows that he might as easily attempt to sketch a bird on the wing or a trout on the dart ships can only be drawn as animals must be by the high instinct of momentary perception which rarely developed itself in any dutch painter and least of all in their painters of marine and thus the awkward forms of shipping the shallow impurity of the sea and the cold incapacity of the painter joining in disadvantageous influence over them the dutch marine paintings may be simply but circumstantially described as the misrepresentation of undeveloped shipping in a discolored sea by distempered painters an exception ought to be made in favor of the boats of cuyp which are generally well floated in calm and sunny water and though rather punts or tubs than boats have in them some elements of a slow warm squaresailed sleepy grandeurrespectable always when compared either with the flickering follies of backhuysen or the monstrous unmanly and à fortiori unsailorly absurdities of metaphysical vessels puffed on their way by corpulent genii or pushed by protuberant dolphins which rubens and the other socalled historical painters of his time were accustomed to introduce in the mythology of their courtadulation that marvelous faith of the 18th century which will one day and that not far off be known for a thing more truly disgraceful to human nature than the polynesians dance round his feather idol or egyptians worship of the food he fattened on from salvator and domenichino it is possible to turn in a proud indignation knowing that theirs are no fair examples of the human mind but it is with humbled and woful anger that we must trace the degradation of the intellect of rubens in his pictures of the life of mary of medicisp      p the town of lyons seated upon a chariot drawn by two lions     lifts its eyes towards heaven and admires thereles nouveaux     epouxrepresented in the character of jupiter and junonotice     des tableaux du musée impérial 2nde partie paris 1854 p 235      the queen upon her throne holds with one hand the scepter in the     other the balance minerva and cupid are

opinion      with view of arrival at golden age all the sooner the court     determine to go by water and marie de medicis gives to her son the     government of the state under the emblem of a vessel of which he     holds the rudder      this piece of royal pilotage being on the whole the most     characteristic example i remember of the mythological marine above     alluded to is accordingly recommended to the readers serious     attention  6 modern period the gradual appreciation of the true character both of shipping and the ocean in the works of the painters of the last half century is part of that successful study of other elements of landscape of which i have long labored at a consistent investigation now partly laid before the public i shall not therefore here enter into any general inquiry respecting modern seapainting but limit myself to a notice of the particular feelings which influenced turner in his marine studies so far as they are shown in the series of plates which have now been trusted to me for illustration  among the earliest sketches from nature which turner appears to have made in pencil and indian ink when a boy of twelve or fourteen it is very singular how large a proportion consists of careful studies of stranded boats now after some fifteen years of conscientious labor with the single view of acquiring knowledge of the ends and powers of art i have come to one conclusion which at the beginning of those fifteen years would have been very astonishing to myselfthat of all our modern school of landscape painters next to turner and before the rise of the preraphaelites the man whose works are on the whole most valuable and show the highest intellect is samuel prout it is very notable that also in prouts early studies shipping subjects took not merely a prominent but i think even a principal place  the reason of this is very evident both turner and prout had in them an untaught inherent perception of what was great and pictorial they could not find it in the buildings or in the scenes immediately around them but they saw some element of real power in the boats prout afterwards found material suited to his genius in other directions and left his first love but turner retained the early affection to the close of his life and the last oil picture which he painted before his noble hand forgot its cunning was the wreckbuoy the last thoroughly perfect picture he ever painted was the old téméraire  the studies which he was able to make from nature in his early years are chiefly of fishingboats barges and other minor marine still life and his better acquaintance with this kind of shipping than with the larger kind is very marked in the liber studiorum in which there are five careful studies of fishingboats under various circumstances namely calais harbor sir john mildmays picture flint castle marine dabblers and the calm while of other shipping there are only two subjects both exceedingly unsatisfactory  turner however deemed it necessary to his reputation at that period that he should paint pictures in the style of vandevelde and in order to render the resemblance more complete he appears to have made careful drawings of the different parts of old dutch shipping i found a large number of such drawings among the contents of his neglected portfolios at his death some were clearly not by his own hand others appeared to be transcripts by him from prints or earlier drawings the quantity altogether was very great and the evidence of his prolonged attention to the subject more distinct than with respect to any other element of landscape of plants rocks or architecture there were very few careful pieces of anatomical study but several drawers were entirely filled with these memoranda of shipping  in executing the series of drawings for the work known as the southern coast turner appears to have gained many ideas about shipping which once received he laid up by him for use in after years the evidence of this laying by of thought in his mind as it were in reserve until he had power to express it is curious and complete throughout his life and although the southern coast drawings are for the most part quiet in feeling and remarkably simple in their mode of execution i believe it was in the watch over the cornish and dorsetshire coast which the making of those drawings involved that he received all his noblest ideas about sea and ships  of one thing i am certain turner never drew anything that could be seen without having seen it that is to say though he would draw jerusalem from some one elses sketch it would be nevertheless entirely from his own experience of ruined walls and though he would draw ancient shipping for an imitation of vandevelde or a vignette to the voyage of columbus from such data as he could get about things which he could no more see with his own eyes yet when of his own free will in the subject of ilfracombe he in the year 1818 introduces a shipwreck i am perfectly certain that before the year 1818 he had seen a shipwreck and moreover one of that horrible kinda ship dashed to pieces in deep water at the foot of an inaccessible cliff having once seen this i perceive also that the image of it could not be effaced from his mind it taught him two great facts which he never afterwards forgot namely that both ships and sea were things that broke to pieces he never afterwards painted a ship quite in fair order there is invariably a feeling about his vessels of strange awe and danger the sails are in some way loosening or flapping as if in fear the swing of the hull majestic as it may be seems more at the mercy of the sea than in triumph over it the ship never looks gay never proud only warlike and enduring the motto he chose in the catalogue of the academy for the most cheerful marine he ever painted the sun of venice going to sea marked the uppermost feeling in his mind      nor heeds the demon that in grim repose     expects his evening prey  i notice above the subject of his last marine picture the wreckbuoy and i am well persuaded that from that year 1818 when first he saw a ship rent asunder he never beheld one at sea without in his minds eye at the same instant seeing her skeleton  but he had seen more than the death of the ship he had seen the sea feed her white flames on souls of men and heard what a stormgust sounded like that had taken up with it in its swirl of a moment the last breaths of a ships crew he never forgot either the sight or the sound among the last plates prepared by his own hand for the liber studiorum all of them as was likely from his advanced knowledge finer than any previous pieces of the series and most of them unfortunately never published being retained beside him for some last touchforever delayed perhaps the most important is one of the body of a drowned sailor dashed against a vertical rock in the jaws of one merciless immeasurable wave he repeated the same idea though more feebly expressed later in life in a small drawing of grandville on the coast of france the sailor clinging to the boat in the marvelous drawing of dunbar is another reminiscence of the same kind he hardly ever painted a steep rocky coast without some fragment of a devoured ship grinding in the blanched teeth of the surgesjust enough left to be a token of utter destruction of his two most important paintings of definite shipwreck i shall speak presently  i said that at this period he first was assured of another fact namely that the sea also was a thing that broke to pieces the sea up to that time had been generally regarded by painters as a liquidly composed levelseeking consistent thing with a smooth surface rising to a watermark on sides of ships in which ships were scientifically to be embedded and wetted up to said watermark and to remain dry above the same but turner found during his southern coast tour that the sea was not this that it was on the contrary a very incalculable and unhorizontal thing setting its water mark sometimes on the highest heavens as well as on sides of shipsvery breakable into pieces half of a wave separable from the other half and on the instant carriageable miles inlandnot in any wise limiting itself to a state of apparent liquidity but now striking like a steel gauntlet and now becoming a cloud and vanishing no eye could tell whither one moment a flint cave the next a marble pillar the next a mere white fleece thickening the thundery rain he never forgot those facts never afterwards was able to recover the idea of positive distinction between sea and sky or sea and land steel gauntlet black rock white cloud and men and masts gnashed to pieces and disappearing in a few breaths and splinters among thema little blood on the rock angle like red seaweed sponged away by the next splash of the foam and the glistering granite and green water all pure again in vacant wrath so stayed by him forever the image of the sea  one effect of this revelation of the nature of ocean to him was not a little singular it seemed that ever afterwards his appreciation of the calmness of water was deepened by what he had witnessed of its frenzy and a certain class of entirely tame subjects were treated by him even with increased affection after he had seen the full manifestation of sublimity he had always a great regard for canal boats and instead of sacrificing these old and one would have thought unentertaining friends to the deities of storm he seems to have returned with a lulling pleasure from the foam and danger of the beach to the sedgy bank and stealthy barge of the lowland river thenceforward his work which introduces shipping is divided into two classes one embodying the poetry of silence and calmness the other of turbulence and wrath of intermediate conditions he gives few examples if he lets the wind down upon the sea at all it is nearly always violent and though the waves may not be running high the foam is torn off them in a way which shows they will soon run higher on the other hand nothing is so perfectly calm as turners calmness to the canal barges of england he soon added other types of languid motion the broadruddered barks of the loire the drooping sails of seine the arcaded barks of the italian lakes slumbering on expanse of mountainguarded wave the dreamy prows of pausing gondolas on lagoons at moonrise in each and all commanding an intensity of calm chiefly because he never admitted an instants rigidity the surface of quiet water with other painters becomes fixed with turner it looks as if a fairys breath would stir it but the fairys breath is not there so also his boats are intensely motionless because intensely capable of motion no other painter ever floated a boat quite rightly all other boats stand on the water or are fastened in it only his float in it it is very difficult to trace the reasons of this for the rightness of the placing on the water depends on such subtle curves and shadows in the floating object and its reflection that in most cases the question of entirely right or entirely wrong resolves itself into the estimation of an hair and what makes the matter more difficult still is that sometimes we may see a boat drawn with the most studied correctness in every part which yet will not swim and sometimes we may find one drawn with many easily ascertainable errors which yet swims well enough so that the drawing of boats is something like the building of them one may set off their lines by the most authentic rules and yet never be sure they will sail well it is however to be observed that turner seemed in those southern coast storms to have been somewhat too strongly impressed by the disappearance of smaller crafts in surf and was wont afterwards to give an uncomfortable aspect even to his gentlest seas by burying his boats too deeply when he erred in this or other matters it was not from want of pains for of all accessories to landscape ships were throughout his life those which he studied with the greatest care his figures whatever their merit or demerit are certainly never the beloved part of his work and though the architecture was in his early drawings careful and continued to be so down to the hakewells italy series it soon became mannered and false whenever it was principal he would indeed draw a ruined tower or a distant town incomparably better than any one else and a staircase or a bit of balustrade very carefully but his temples and cathedrals showed great ignorance of detail and want of understanding of their character but i am aware of no painting from the beginning of his life to its close containing modern shipping as its principal subject in which he did not put forth his full strength and pour out his knowledge of detail with a joy which renders those works as a series among the most valuable he ever produced take for instance    1 lord yarboroughs shipwreck   2 the trafalgar at greenwich hospital   3 the trafalgar in his own gallery   4 the pas de calais   5 the large cologne   6 the havre   7 the old téméraire  i know no fourteen pictures by turner for which these seven might be wisely changed and in all of these the shipping is thoroughly principal and studied from existing ships a large number of inferior works were however also produced by him in imitation of vandevelde representing old dutch shipping in these the shipping is scattered scudding and distant the sea gray and lightly broken such pictures are generally speaking among those of least value which he has produced two very important ones however belong to the imitative school lord ellesmeres founded on vandevelde and the dort at farnley on cuyp the latter as founded on the better master is the better picture but still possesses few of the true turner qualities except his peculiar calmness in which respect it is unrivaled and if joined with lord yarboroughs shipwreck the two may be considered as the principal symbols in turners early oil paintings of his two strengths in terror and repose among his drawings shipping as the principal subject does not always constitute a work of the first class nor does it so often occur for the difficulty in a drawing of getting good color is so much less and that of getting good form so much greater than in oil that turner naturally threw his elaborate studies of ship form into oil and made his noblest work in drawing rich in hues of landscape yet the cowes devonport and gosport from the england and wales the saltash is an inferior work united with two drawings of this series portsmouth and sheerness and two from farnley one of the wreck of an indiaman and the other of a ship of the line taking stores would form a series not indeed as attractive at first sight as many others but embracing perhaps more of turners peculiar unexampled and unapproachable gifts than any other group of drawings which could be selected the choice being confined to one class of subject  i have only to state in conclusion that these twelve drawings of the harbors of england are more representable by engraving than most of his works few parts of them are brilliant in color they were executed chiefly in brown and blue and with more direct reference to the future engraving than was common with turner they are also small in size generally of the exact dimensions of the plate and therefore the lines of the compositions are not spoiled by contraction while finally the touch of the painters hand upon the wavesurface is far better imitated by mezzotint engraving than by any of the ordinary expedients of line take them all in all they form the most valuable series of marine studies which have as yet been published from his works and i hope that they may be of some use hereafter in recalling the ordinary aspect of our english seas at the exact period when the nation had done its utmost in the wooden and woven strength of ships and had most perfectly fulfilled the old and noble prophecy                  they shall ride                 over ocean wide     with hempen bridle and horse of tree                         thomas of ercildoune     idover  illustration dover   this port has some right to take precedence of others as being that assuredly which first exercises the hospitality of england to the majority of strangers who set foot on her shores i place it first therefore among our present subjects though the drawing itself and chiefly on account of its manifestation of turners faulty habit of local exaggeration deserves no such preeminence he always painted not the place itself but his impression of it and this on steady principle leaving to inferior artists the task of topographical detail and he was right in this principle as i have shown elsewhere when the impression was a genuine one but in the present case it is not so he has lost the real character of dover cliffs by making the town at their feet three times lower in proportionate height than it really is nor is he to be justified in giving the barracks which appear on the left hand more the air of a hospice on the top of an alpine precipice than of an establishment which out of snargate street can be reached without drawing breath by a winding stair of some 170 steps making the slope beside them more like the side of skiddaw than what it really is the earthwork of an unimportant battery  this design is also remarkable as an instance of that restlessness which was above noticed even in turners least stormy seas there is nothing tremendous here in scale of wave but the whole surface is fretted and disquieted by torturing wind an effect which was always increased during the progress of the subjects by turners habit of scratching out small sparkling lights in order to make the plate bright or livelyq in a general way the engravers used to like this and as far as they were able would tempt turner farther into the practice which was precisely equivalent to that of supplying the place of healthy and heartwhole cheerfulness by dramdrinking      q see the farther explanation of this practice in the notice of     the subject of portsmouth  the two seagulls in the front of the picture were additions of this kind and are very injurious confusing the organization and concealing the power of the sea the merits of the drawing are however still great as a piece of composition the lefthand side is most interesting and characteristic of turner no other artist would have put the round pier so exactly under the round cliff it is under it so accurately that if the nearly vertical falling line of that cliff be continued it strikes the seabase of the pier to a hairs breadth but turner knew better than any man the value of echo as well as of contrastof repetition as well as of opposition the round pier repeats the line of the main cliff and then the sail repeats the diagonal shadow which crosses it and emerges above it just as the embankment does above the cliff brow lower come the opposing curves in the two boats the whole forming one group of sequent lines up the whole side of the picture the rest of the composition is more commonplace than is usual with the great master but there are beautiful transitions of light and shade between the sails of the little fishingboat the brig behind her and the cliffs note how dexterously the two front sailsr of the brig are brought on the top of the white sail of the fishingboat to help to detach it from the white cliffs      r i think i shall be generally more intelligible by explaining     what i mean in this way and run less chance of making myself     ridiculous in the eyes of sensible people than by displaying the     very small nautical knowledge i possess my sailor friends will     perhaps be gracious enough to believe that i could call these     sails by their right names if i liked     iiramsgate  illustration ramsgate   this though less attractive at first sight than the former plate is a better example of the master and far truer and nobler as a piece of thought the lifting of the brig on the wave is very daring just one of the things which is seen in every gale but which no other painter than turner ever represented and the lurid transparency of the dark sky and wild expression of wind in the fluttering of the falling sails of the vessel running into the harbor are as fine as anything of the kind he has done there is great grace in the drawing of this latter vessel note the delicate switch forward of her upper mast  there is a very singular point connected with the composition of this drawing proving it as from internal evidence was most likely to be a record of a thing actually seen three years before the date of this engraving turner had made a drawing of ramsgate for the southern coast series that drawing represents the same day the same moment and the same ships from a different point of view it supposes the spectator placed in a boat some distance out at sea beyond the fishingboats on the left in the present plate and looking towards the town or into the harbor the brig which is near us here is then of course in the distance on the right the schooner entering the harbor and in both plates lowering her foretopsail is of course seen foreshortened the fishingboats only are a little different in position and set of sail the sky is precisely the same only a dark piece of it which is too far to the right to be included in this view enters into the wider distance of the other and the town of course becomes a more important object  the persistence in one conception furnishes evidence of the very highest imaginative power on a common mind what it has seen is so feebly impressed that it mixes other ideas with it immediately forgets itmodifies itadorns itdoes anything but keep hold of it but when turner had once seen that stormy hour at ramsgate harbormouth he never quitted his grasp of it he had seen the two vessels one go in the other out he could have only seen them at that one momentfrom one point but the impression on his imagination is so strong that he is able to handle it three years afterwards as if it were a real thing and turn it round on the table of his brain and look at it from the other corner he will see the brig near instead of far off set the whole sea and sky so many points round to the south and see how they look so i never traced power of this kind in any other man     iiiplymouth  illustration plymouth   the drawing for this plate is one of turners most remarkable though not most meritorious works it contains the brightest rainbow he ever painted to my knowledge not the best but the most dazzling it has been much modified in the plate it is very like one of turners pieces of caprice to introduce a rainbow at all as a principal feature in such a scene for it is not through the colors of the iris that we generally expect to be shown eighteenpounder batteries and ninetygun ships  whether he meant the dark cloud intensely dark blue in the original drawing with the sunshine pursuing it back into distance and the rainbow with its base set on a ship of battle to be together types of war and peace and of the one as the foundation of the other i leave it to the reader to decide my own impression is that although turner might have some askance symbolism in his mind the present design is like the former one in many points a simple reminiscence of a seen facts      s i have discovered since this was written that the design was     made from a vigorous and interesting sketch by mr s cousins in     which the rainbow and most of the ships are already in their places     turner was therefore in this case as i have found him in several     other instances realizing not a fact seen by himself but a fact     as he supposed it to have been seen by another  however whether reminiscent or symbolic the design is to my mind an exceedingly unsatisfactory one owing to its total want of principal subject the fort ceases to be of importance because of the bank and tower in front of it the ships necessarily for the effect but fatally for themselves are confused and incompletely drawn except the little sloop which looks paltry and like a toy and the foreground objects are for work of turner curiously ungraceful and uninteresting  it is possible however that to some minds the fresh and dewy space of darkness so animated with latent human power may give a sensation of great pleasure and at all events the design is worth study on account of its very strangeness     ivcatwater  illustration catwater   i have placed in the middle of the series those pictures which i think least interesting though the want of interest is owing more to the monotony of their character than to any real deficiency in their subjects if after contemplating paintings of arid deserts or glowing sunsets we had come suddenly upon this breezy entrance to the crowded cove of plymouth it would have gladdened our hearts to purpose but having already been at sea for some time there is little in this drawing to produce renewal of pleasurable impression only one useful thought may be gathered from the very feeling of monotony at the time when turner executed these drawings his portfolios were full of the most magnificent subjectscoast and inlandgathered from all the noblest scenery of france and italy he was ready to realize these sketches for any one who would have asked it of him but no consistent effort was ever made to call forth his powers and the only means by which it was thought that the public patronage could be secured for a work of this kind was by keeping familiar names before the eye and awakening the socalled patriotic but in reality narrow and selfish associations belonging to wellknown towns or wateringplaces it is to be hoped that when a great landscape painter appears among us again we may know better how to employ him and set him to paint for us things which are less easily seen and which are somewhat better worth seeing than the mists of the catwater or terraces of margate     vsheerness  illustration sheerness   i look upon this as one of the noblest seapieces which turner ever produced it has not his usual fault of overcrowding or overglitter the objects in it are few and noble and the space infinite the sky is quite one of his best not violently black but full of gloom and power the complicated roundings of its volumes behind the sloops mast and downwards to the left have been rendered by the engraver with notable success and the dim light entering along the horizon full of rain behind the ship of war is true and grand in the highest degree by comparing it with the extreme darkness of the skies in the plymouth dover and ramsgate the reader will see how much more majesty there is in moderation than in extravagance and how much more darkness as far as sky is concerned there is in gray than in black it is not that the plymouth and dover skies are falsesuch impenetrable forms of thundercloud are amongst the commonest phenomena of storm but they have more of spent flash and past shower in them than the less passionate but more truly stormy and threatening volumes of the sky here the plymouth storm will very thoroughly wet the sails and wash the decks of the ships at anchor but will send nothing to the bottom for these pale and lurid masses there is no saying what evil they may have in their thoughts or what they may have to answer for before night the ship of war in the distance is one of many instances of turners dislike to draw complete rigging and this not only because he chose to give an idea of his ships having seen rough service and being crippled but also because in menofwar he liked the mass of the hull to be increased in apparent weight and size by want of upper spars all artists of any rank share this last feeling stanfield never makes a careful study of a hull without shaking some or all of its masts out of it first if possible see in the coast scenery portsmouth harbor falmouth hamoaze and rye old harbors and compare among turners works the near hulls in the devonport saltash and castle upnor and distance of gosport the fact is partly that the precision of line in the complete spars of a manofwar is too formal to come well into pictorial arrangements and partly that the chief glory of a ship of the line is in its aspect of being one that hath had losses  the subtle varieties of curve in the drawing of the sails of the near sloop are altogether exquisite as well as the contrast of her black and glistering side with those sails and with the sea examine the wayward and delicate play of the dancing waves along her flank and between her and the brig in ballast plunging slowly before the wind i have not often seen anything so perfect in fancy or in execution of engraving  the heaving and black buoy in the near sea is one of turners echoes repeating with slight change the head of the sloop with its flash of luster the chief aim of this buoy is however to give comparative lightness to the shadowed part of the sea which is indeed somewhat overcharged in darkness and would have been felt to be so but for this contrasting mass hide it with the hand and this will be immediately felt there is only one other of turners works which in its way can be matched with this drawing namely the mouth of the humber in the river scenery the latter is on the whole the finer picture but this by much the more interesting in the shipping     vimargate  illustration margate   this plate is not at first sight one of the most striking of the series but it is very beautiful and highly characteristic of turnert first in its choice of subjects for it seems very notably capricious in a painter eminently capable of rendering scenes of sublimity and mystery to devote himself to the delineation of one of the most prosaic of english wateringplacesnot once or twice but in a series of elaborate drawings of which this is the fourth the first appeared in the southern coast series and was followed by an elaborate drawing on a large scale with a beautiful sunrise then came another careful and very beautiful drawing in the england and wales series and finally this which is a sort of poetical abstract of the first now if we enumerate the english ports one by one from berwick to whitehaven round the island there will hardly be found another so utterly devoid of all picturesque or romantic interest as margate nearly all have some steep eminence of down or cliff some pretty retiring dingle some roughness of old harbor or straggling fisherhamlet some fragment of castle or abbey on the heights above capable of becoming a leading point in a picture but margate is simply a mass of modern parades and streets with a little bit of chalk cliff an orderly pier and some bathingmachines turner never conceives it as anything else and yet for the sake of this simple vision again and again he quits all higher thoughts the beautiful bays of northern devon and cornwall he never painted but once and that very imperfectly the finest subjects of the southern coast seriesthe minehead clovelly ilfracombe watchet east and west looe tintagel boscastlehe never touched again but he repeated ramsgate deal dover and margate i know not how often      t it was left unfinished at his death and i would not allow it to     be touched afterwards desiring that the series should remain as far     as possible in an authentic state  whether his desire for popularity which in spite of his occasional rough defiances of public opinion was always great led him to the selection of those subjects which he thought might meet with most acceptance from a large class of the london public or whether he had himself more pleasurable associations connected with these places than with others i know not but the fact of the choice itself is a very mournful one considered with respect to the future interests of art there is only this one point to be remembered as tending to lessen our regret that it is possible turner might have felt the necessity of compelling himself sometimes to dwell on the most familiar and prosaic scenery in order to prevent his becoming so much accustomed to that of a higher class as to diminish his enthusiasm in its presence into this probability i shall have occasion to examine at greater length hereafter  the plate of margate now before us is nearly as complete a duplicate of the southern coast view as the previous plate is of that of ramsgate with this difference that the position of the spectator is here the same but the class of ship is altered though the ship remains precisely in the same spot a piece of old wreck which was rather an important object to the left of the other drawing is here removed the figures are employed in the same manner in both designs  the details of the houses of the town are executed in the original drawing with a precision which adds almost painfully to their natural formality it is certainly provoking to find the great painter who often only deigns to bestow on some rhenish fortress or french city crested with gothic towers a few misty and indistinguishable touches of his brush setting himself to indicate with unerring toil every separate square window in the parades hotels and circulating libraries of an english bathingplace  the whole of the drawing is well executed and free from fault or affectation except perhaps in the somewhat confused curlings of the near sea i had much rather have seen it breaking in the usual straightforward way the brilliant white of the piece of chalk cliff is evidently one of the principal aims of the composition in the drawing the sea is throughout of a dark fresh blue the sky grayish blue and the grass on the top of the cliffs a little sunburnt the cliffs themselves being left in the almost untouched white of the paper     viiportsmouth  illustration portsmouth   this beautiful drawing is a third recurrence by turner to his earliest impression of portsmouth given in the southern coast series the buildings introduced differ only by a slight turn of the spectator towards the right the buoy is in the same spot the manofwars boat nearly so the sloop exactly so but on a different tack and the manofwar which is far off to the left at anchor in the southern coast view is here nearer and getting up her anchor  the idea had previously passed through one phase of greater change in his drawing of gosport for the england in which while the sky of the southern coast view was almost cloud for cloud retained the interest of the distant ships of the line had been divided with a collier brig and a fastsailing boat in the present view he returns to his early thought dwelling however now with chief insistence on the ship of the line which is certainly the most majestic of all that he has introduced in his drawings  it is also a very curious instance of that habit of turners before referred to p 27 of never painting a ship quite in good order on showing this plate the other day to a naval officer he complained of it first that the jibu would not be wanted with the wind blowing out of harbor and secondly that a manofwar would never have her foretopgallant sail set and her main and mizzen topgallants furledall the men would be on the yards at once      u the sail seen edge on like a white sword at the head of the     ship  i believe this criticism to be perfectly just though it has happened to me very singularly whenever i have had the opportunity of making complete inquiry into any technical matter of this kind respecting which some professional person had blamed turner that i have always found in the end turner was right and the professional critic wrong owing to some want of allowance for possible accidents and for necessary modes of pictorial representation still this cannot be the case in every instance and supposing my sailor informant to be perfectly right in the present one the disorderliness of the way in which this ship is represented as setting her sails gives us farther proof of the imperative instinct in the artists mind refusing to contemplate a ship even in her proudest moments but as in some way overmastered by the strengths of chance and storm  the wave on the left hand beneath the buoy presents a most interesting example of the way in which turner used to spoil his work by retouching all his truly fine drawings are either done quickly or at all events straight forward without alteration he never as far as i have examined his works hitherto altered but to destroy when he saw a plate look somewhat dead or heavy as compared with the drawing it was almost sure at first to do he used to scratch out little lights all over it and make it sparkling a process in which the engravers almost unanimously delightedv and over the impossibility of which they now mourn declaring it to be hopeless to engrave after turner since he cannot now scratch their plates for them it is quite true that these small lights were always placed beautifully and though the plate after its touching generally looked as if ingeniously salted out of her dredgingbox by an artistical cook the salting was done with a spirit which no one else can now imitate but the original power of the work was forever destroyed if the reader will look carefully beneath the white touches on the left in this sea he will discern dimly the form of a round nodding hollow breaker this in the early state of the plate is a gaunt dark angry wave rising at the shoal indicated by the buoymr lupton has facsimiled with so singular skill the scratches of the penknife by which turner afterwards disguised this breaker and spoiled his picture that the plate in its present state is almost as interesting as the touched proof itself interesting however only as a warning to all artists never to lose hold of their first conception they may tire even of what is exquisitely right as they work it out and their only safety is in the selfdenial of calm completion      v not let me say with all due honor to him the careful and     skillful engraver of these plates who has been much more tormented     than helped by turners alterations     viiifalmouth  illustration falmouth   this is one of the most beautiful and bestfinished plates of the series and turner has taken great pains with the drawing but it is sadly open to the same charges which were brought against the dover of an attempt to reach a false sublimity by magnifying things in themselves insignificant the fact is that turner when he prepared these drawings had been newly inspired by the scenery of the continent and with his mind entirely occupied by the ruined towers of the rhine he found himself called upon to return to the formal embrasures and unappalling elevations of english forts and hills but it was impossible for him to recover the simplicity and narrowness of conception in which he had executed the drawing of the southern coast or to regain the innocence of delight with which he had once assisted gravely at the drying of clothes over the limekiln at comb martin or penciled the woodland outlines of the banks of dartmouth cove in certain fits of prosaic humorism he would as we have seen condemn himself to delineation of the parades of a wateringplace but the moment he permitted himself to be enthusiastic vaster imaginations crowded in upon him to modify his old conception in the least was to exaggerate it the mount of pendennis is lifted into rivalship with ehrenbreitstein and hardworked falmouth glitters along the distant bay like the gay magnificence of resina or sorrento  this effort at sublimity is all the more to be regretted because it never succeeds completely shade or magnify or mystify as he may even turner cannot make the minute neatness of the english fort appeal to us as forcibly as the remnants of gothic wall and tower that crown the continental crags and invest them as he may with smoke or sunbeam the details of our little mounded hills will not take the rank of cliffs of alp or promontories of apennine and we lose the english simplicity without gaining the continental nobleness  i have also a prejudice against this picture for being disagreeably noisy wherever there is something serious to be done as in a battle piece the noise becomes an element of the sublimity but to have great guns going off in every direction beneath ones feet on the right and all round the other side of the castle and from the deck of the ship of the line and from the battery far down the cove and from the fort on the top of the hill and all for nothing is to my mind eminently troublesome  the drawing of the different wreaths and depths of smoke and the explosive look of the flash on the right are however very wonderful and peculiarly turneresque the sky is also beautiful in form and the foreground in which we find his old regard for washerwomen has not quite deserted him singularly skillful it is curious how formal the whole picture becomes if this figure and the gray stones beside it are hidden with the hand     ixsidmouth  illustration sidmouth   this drawing has always been interesting to me among turners sea pieces on account of the noble gathering together of the great wave on the leftthe back of a breaker just heaving itself up and provoking itself into passion before its leap and roar against the beach but the enjoyment of these designs is much interfered with by their monotony it is seriously to be regretted that in all but one the view is taken from the sea for the spectator is necessarily tired by the perpetual rush and sparkle of water and ceases to be impressed by it it would be felt if this plate were seen alone that there are few marine paintings in which the weight and heaping of the sea are given so faithfully  for the rest it is perhaps more to be regretted that we are kept to our sealevel at sidmouth than at any other of the localities illustrated what claim the pretty little village has to be considered as a port of england i know not but if it was to be so ranked a far more interesting study of it might have been made from the heights above the town whence the ranges of darkred sandstone cliffs stretching to the southwest are singularly bold and varied the detached fragment of sandstone which forms the principal object in turners view has long ago fallen and even while it stood could hardly have been worth the honor of so careful illustration     xwhitby  illustration whitby   as an expression of the general spirit of english coast scenery this plate must be considered the principal one of the series like all the rest it is a little too grand for its subject but the exaggerations of space and size are more allowable here than in the others as partly necessary to convey the feeling of danger conquered by activity and commerce which characterizes all our northerly eastern coast there are cliffs more terrible and winds more wild on other shores but nowhere else do so many white sails lean against the bleak wind and glide across the cliff shadows nor do i know many other memorials of monastic life so striking as the abbey on that dark headland we are apt in our journeys through lowland england to watch with some secret contempt the general pleasantness of the vales in which our abbeys were founded without taking any pains to inquire into the particular circumstances which directed or compelled the choice of the monks and without reflecting that if the choice were a selfish one the selfishness is that of the english lowlander turning monk not that of monachism since if we examine the sites of the swiss monasteries and convents we shall always find the snow lying round them in july and it must have been cold meditating in these cloisters of st hildas when the winter wind set from the east it is long since i was at whitby and i am not sure whether turner is right in giving so monotonous and severe verticality to the cliff above which the abbey stands but i believe it must have some steep places about it since the tradition which in nearly all parts of the island where fossil ammonites are found is sure to be current respecting them takes quite an original form at whitby owing to the steepness of this rock in general the saint of the locality has simply turned all the serpents to stone but at whitby st hilda drove them over the cliff and the serpents before being petrified had all their heads broken off by the fall     xideal  illustration deal   i have had occasionw elsewhere to consider at some length the peculiar love of the english for neatness and minuteness but i have only considered without accounting for or coming to any conclusion about it and the more i think of it the more it puzzles me to understand what there can be in our great national mind which delights to such an extent in brass plates red bricks square curbstones and fresh green paint all on the tiniest possible scale the other day i was dining in a respectable english inn and postinghouse not ten miles from london and measuring the room after dinner i found it exactly twice and a quarter the height of my umbrella it was a highly comfortable room and associated in the proper english manner with outdoor sports and pastimes by a portrait of jack hall fisherman of eton and of mr c davis on his favorite mare but why all this hunting and fishing enthusiasm should like to reduce itself at home into twice and a quarter the height of an umbrella i could not in any wise then nor have i at any other time been able to ascertain      w modern painters vol iv chap 1  perhaps the town of deal involves as much of this question in its aspect and reputation as any other place in her majestys dominions or at least it seemed so to me coming to it as i did after having been accustomed to the boatlife at venice where the heavy craft massy in build and massy in sail and disorderly in aquatic economy reach with their mastvanes only to the first stories of the huge marble palaces they anchor among it was very strange to me after this knowing that whatever was brave and strong in the english sailor was concentrated in our deal boatmen to walk along that trim strip of conventional beach which the sea itself seems to wash in a methodical manner one shinglestep at a time and by its thin toylike boats each with its head to sea at regular intervals looking like things that one would give a clever boy to play with in a pond when first he got past petticoats and the row of lath cots behind all tidiness and telegraph looking as if the whole business of the human race on earth was to know what oclock it was and when it would be high wateronly some slight weakness in favor of grog being indicated here and there by a hospitablelooking open door a gay bowwindow and a sign intimating that it is a sailors duty to be not only accurate but jolly  turner was always fond of this neat courageous benevolent merry methodical deal he painted it very early in the southern coast series insisting on one of the tavern windows as the principal subject with a flash of forked lightning streaming beyond it out at sea like a narrow flag he has the same association in his mind in the present plate disorder and distress among the ships on the left with the boat going out to help them and the precision of the little town stretching in sunshine along the beach     xiiscarborough  illustration scarborough   i have put this plate last in the series thinking that the reader will be glad to rest in its morning quietness after so much tossing among the troubled foam i said in the course of the introduction that nothing is so perfectly calm as turners calmness and i know very few better examples of this calmness than the plate before us uniting as it does the glittering of the morning clouds and trembling of the sea with an infinitude of peace in both there are one or two points of interest in the artifices by which the intense effect of calm is produced much is owing in the first place to the amount of absolute gloom obtained by the local blackness of the boats on the beach like a piece of the midnight left unbroken by the dawn but more is owing to the treatment of the distant harbor mouth in general throughout nature reflection and repetition are peaceful things that is to say the image of any object seen in calm water gives us an impression of quietness not merely because we know the water must be quiet in order to be reflective but because the fact of the repetition of this form is lulling to us in its monotony and associated more or less with an idea of quiet succession or reproduction in events or things throughout naturethat one day should be like another day one town the image of another town or one history the repetition of another history being more or less results of quietness while dissimilarity and nonsuccession are also more or less results of interference and disquietude and thus though an echo actually increases the quantity of sound heard its repetition of the notes or syllables of sound gives an idea of calmness attainable in no other way hence the feeling of calm given to a landscape by the notes of the cuckoo understanding this observe the anxious doubling of every object by a visible echo or shadow throughout this picture the grandest feature of it is the steep distant cliff and therefore the dualism is more marked here than elsewhere the two promontories or cliffs and two piers below them being arranged so that the one looks almost like the shadow of the other cast irregularly on mist in all probability the more distant pier would in reality unless it is very greatly higher than the near one have been lowered by perspective so as not to continue in the same longitudinal line at the topbut turner will not have it so he reduces them to exactly the same level so that the one looks like the phantom of the other and so of the cliffs above  then observe each pier has just below the head of it in a vertical line another important object one a buoy and the other a stooping figure these carry on the double group in the calmest way obeying the general law of vertical reflection and throw down two long shadows on the near beach the intenseness of the parallelism would catch the eye in a moment but for the lighthouse which breaks the group and prevents the artifice from being too open next come the two heads of boats with their two bowsprits and the two masts of the one farthest off all monotonously double but for the diagonal mast of the nearer one which again hides the artifice next put your finger over the white central figure and follow the minor incidents round the beach first under the lighthouse a stick with its echo below a little to the right above a black stone and its echo to the right under the white figure another stick with its echo to the left then a starfishx and a white spot its echo to the left then a dog and a basket to double its light above a fisherman and his wife for an echo above them two lines of curved shingle above them two small black figures above them two unfinished ships and two forked masts above the forked masts a house with two gables and its echo exactly over it in two gables more next to the right two fishingboats with sails down farther on two fishingboats with sails up each with its little white reflection below then two larger ships which lest his trick should be found out turner puts a dim third between then below two fat colliers leaning away from each other and two thinner colliers leaning towards each other and now at last having doubled everything all round the beach he gives one strong single stroke to gather all together places his solitary central white figure and the calm is complete      x i have mentioned elsewhere that turner was fond of this subject     of scarborough and that there are four drawings of it by him if     not more under different effects having this much common to the     four that there is always a starfish on the beach  it is also to be noticed that not only the definite repetition has a power of expressing serenity but even the slight sense of confusion induced by the continual doubling is useful it makes us feel not well awake drowsy and as if we were out too early and had to rub our eyes yet a little before we could make out whether there were really two boats or one  i do not mean that every means which we may possibly take to enable ourselves to see things double will be always the most likely to insure the ultimate tranquillity of the scene neither that any such artifice as this would be of avail without the tender and loving drawing of the things themselves and of the light that bathes them nevertheless the highest art is full of these little cunnings and it is only by the help of them that it can succeed in at all equaling the force of the natural impression  one great monotony that of the successive sigh and vanishing of the slow waves upon the sand no art can render to us perhaps the silence of early light even on the field dew consecrate of the grass itself is not so tender as the lisp of the sweet belled lips of the clear waves in their following patience we will leave the shore as their silver fringes fade upon it desiring thus as far as may be to remember the sea we have regarded it perhaps too often as an enemy to be subdued let us at least this once accept from it and from the soft light beyond the cliffs above the image of the state of a perfect human spirit      the memory like a cloudless air     the conscience like a sea at rest
