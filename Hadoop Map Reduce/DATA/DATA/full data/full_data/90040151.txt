90040151	at last  a christmas in the west indies     to his excellency the hon sir arthur gordon governor of mauritius     my dear sir arthur gordon  to whom should i dedicate this book but to you to whom i owe my  visit to the west indies  i regret that i could not consult you  about certain matters in chapters xiv and xv but you are away again  over sea and i can only send the book after you such as it is  with the expression of my hearty belief that you will be to the  people of mauritius what you have been to the people of trinidad  i could say much more  but it is wisest often to be most silent on  the very points on which one longs most to speak  ever yours  c kingsley    chapter i  outward bound    at last we too were crossing the atlantic  at last the dream of  forty years please god would be fulfilled and i should see and  happily not alone the west indies and the spanish main  from  childhood i had studied their natural history their charts their  romances and alas their tragedies and now at last i was about  to compare books with facts and judge for myself of the reported  wonders of the earthly paradise  we could scarce believe the  evidence of our own senses when they told us that we were surely on  board a west indian steamer and could by no possibility get off it  again save into the ocean or on the farther side of the ocean and  it was not till the morning of the second day the 3d of december  that we began to be thoroughly aware that we were on the old route  of westwardho and far out in the high seas while the old world  lay behind us like a dream  like dreams seemed now the last farewells over the taffrel beneath  the chill low december sun and the shining calm of southampton  water and the pleasant and wellbeloved old shores and woods and  houses sliding by and the fisherboats at anchor off calshot their  brown and olive sails reflected in the dun water with dun clouds  overhead tipt with dull red from off the setting suna study for  vandevelde or backhuysen in the tenderest moods  like a dream  seemed the twin lights of hurst castle and the needles glaring out  of the gloom behind us as if old england were watching us to the  last with careful eyes and bidding us good speed upon our way   then had comestill like a dreama day of pouring rain of  lounging on the maindeck watching the engines and watching too  for it was calm at night the water from the sponson behind the  paddleboxes as the live flamebeads leaped and ran amid the  swirling snow while some fifteen feet beyond the untouched oily  black of the deep sea spread away into the endless dark  it took a couple of days to arrange our little cabin penates to  discover who was on board and a couple of days too to become  aware in spite of sudden starts of anxiety that there was no post  and could be none that one could not be wanted or if one was  wanted found and caught and it was not till the fourth morning  that the glorious sense of freedom dawned on the mind as through  the cabin port the sunrise shone in yellow and wild through flying  showers and great northeastern waves raced past us their heads  torn off in spray their broad backs laced with ripples and each  as it passed gave us a friendly onward lift away into the roaring  forties as the sailors call the stormy seas between 50 and 40  degrees of latitude  these roaring forties seem all strangely devoid of animal lifeat  least in a december northeast gale not a whale did we seeonly a  pair of porpoises not a seabird save a lonely little kittiwake or  two who swung round our stern in quest of food  but the seeming  want of life was only owing to our want of eyes each night the wake  teemed more bright with flameatomies  one kind were little  brilliant sparks hurled helpless to and fro on the surface  probably noctilucae the others what they may be we could not guess  at first showed patches of soft diffused light paler than the  sparks yet of the same yellowwhite hue which floated quietly  past seeming a foot or two below the foam  and at the bottom far  beneath deeper under our feet than the summit of the peak of  teneriffe was above our headsfor we were now in more than two  thousand fathoms waterwhat exquisite forms might there not be  myriads on myriads generations on generations people the eternal  darkness seen only by him to whom the darkness is as light as day   and to be seen hereafter a few of thembut how fewwhen future  men of science shall do for this midatlantic seafloor what dr  carpenter and dr wyville thomson have done for the north atlantic  and open one more page of that book which has to us creatures of a  day though not to him who wrote it as the timepattern of his  timeless mind neither beginning nor end  so for want of animal life to study we were driven to study the  human life around us pent up there in our little iron world  but  to talk too much of fellowpassengers is though usual enough just  now neither altogether fair nor kind  we see in travel but the  outside of people and as we know nothing of their inner history  and little usually of their antecedents the pictures which we  might sketch of them would be probably as untruthfully as rashly  drawn  crushed together too perforce against each other people  are apt on board ship to make little hasty confidences to show  unawares little weaknesses which should be forgotten all round the  moment they step on shore and return to something like a normal  state of society  the wisest and most humane rule for a traveller  toward his companion is to   be to their faults a little blind be to their virtues very kind   and to consider all that is said and done on board like what passes  among the members of the same club as on the whole private and  confidential  so let it suffice that there were on board the good  steamship shannon as was to be expected plenty of kind courteous  generous intelligent people officials travellersone happy man  away to discover new birds on the yet unexplored rio magdalena in  new grenada planters merchants what not all ready when once at  st thomass to spread themselves over the islands and the spanish  main and the isthmus of panama and after that some of them down  the pacific shore to callao and valparaiso  the very names of their  different destinations and the imagination of the wonders they  would see though we were going to a spot as full of wonders as  any raised something like envy in our breasts all the more  because most of them persisted in tantalising us in the hospitable  fashion of all west indians by fruitless invitations to islands and  ports which to have seen were a joy for ever  but almost the most interesting group of all was one of cornish  miners from the wellknown old redruth and camborne county and the  old sacred hill of carnbrea who were going to seek their fortunes  awhile in silver mines among the andes leaving wives and children  at home and hoping if it please god to do some good out there  and send their earnings home  stout bearded highcheekboned men  they were dressed in the thick coats and rough caps and of  course in the indispensable black cloth trousers which make a  miners full dress and their faces lighted up at the old password  of downalong for whosoever knows downalong and the speech  thereof is at once a friend and a brother  we had many a pleasant  talk with them ere we parted at st thomass  and on to st thomass we were hurrying and thanks to the north east wind as straight as a beeline  on the third day we ran two  hundred and fiftyfour miles on the fourth two hundred and sixty  and on the next day at noon where should we be  nearing the  azores and by midnight running past them and away on the track of  columbus towards the sargasso sea  we stayed up late on the night of december 7 in hopes of seeing as  we passed terceira even the loom of the land  but the moon was  down and a glimpse of the pico at dawn next morning was our only  chance of seeing at least for this voyage those wondrous isles of  the blestisles of the blest of old and why not still  they too  are said to be earthly paradises in soil climate productions and  yet no english care to settle there nor even to go thither for  health though the voyage from lisbon is but a short one and our  own mail steamers were it made worth their while could as easily  touch at terceira now as they did a few years since  and as we looked out into the darkness we could not but recollect  with a flush of pride that yonder on the starboard beam lay flores  and the scene of that great fight off the azores on august 30  1591 made ever memorable by the pen of walter raleighand of late  by mr froude in which the revenge with sir richard grenville for  her captain endured for twelve hours before she struck the attack  of eight great spanish armadas of which two three times her own  burden sank at her side and after all her masts were gone and she  had been three times boarded without success defied to the last the  whole fleet of fiftyone sail which lay around her waiting like  dogs around the dying forestking for the englishman to strike or  sink  yonder away it was that wounded again and again and shot  through body and through head sir richard grenville was taken on  board the spanish admirals ship to die and gave up his gallant  ghost with those oncefamous words  here die i richard grenville  with a joyful and quiet mind for that i have ended my life as a  true soldier ought fighting for his country queen religion and  honour my soul willingly departing from this body leaving behind  the lasting fame of having behaved as every valiant soldier is in  his duty bound to do  yes we were on the track of the old seaheroes of drake and  hawkins carlile and cavendish cumberland and raleigh preston and  sommers frobisher and duddeley keymis and whiddon which last in  that same flores fight stood by sir richard grenville all alone  and in a small ship called the pilgrim hovered all night to see  the successe  but in the morning bearing with the revenge was  hunted like a hare amongst many ravenous houndes but escaped 4 to learn in after years in company with hapless keymis only too  much about that trinidad and gulf of paria whither we were bound  yes  there were heroes in england in those days  are we their  descendants degenerate from them  i for one believe not but they  were taughtwhat we take pride in refusing to be taughtnamely to  obey  the morning dawned  but pico some fifty miles away was taking his  morning bath among the clouds and gave no glimpse of his eleven  thousand feet crater cone now capped they said with winter snow   yet neither last nights outlook nor that mornings was without  result  for as the steamer stopped last night to pack her engines  and slipped along under sail at some three knots an hour we made  out clearly that the larger diffused patches of phosphorescence were  medusae slowly opening and shutting and rolling over and over now  and then giving out their light as they rolled seemingly from the  thin limb alone and not from the crown of their bell  and as we  watched a fellowpassenger told how between ceylon and singapore  he had once witnessed that most rare and unexplained phenomenon of a  milky sea of which dr collingwood writes without if i remember  right having seen it himself in his charming book a naturalists  rambles in the china seas  our friend described the appearance as  that of a sea of shining snow rather than of milk heaving gently  beneath a starlit but moonless sky  a bucket of water when taken  up was filled with the same halfluminous whiteness which stuck to  its sides when the water was drained off  the captain of the  indiaman was well enough aware of the rarity of the sight to call  all the passengers on deck to see what they would never see again  and on asking our captain he assured us that he had not only never  seen but never heard of the appearance in the west indies  one  curious fact then was verified that night  the next morning gave us unmistakable tokens that we were nearing  the home of the summer and the sun  a northeast wind which would  in england keep the air at least at freezing in the shade gave here  a temperature just over 60 degrees and gave clouds too which made  us fancy for a moment that we were looking at an april thunder sky  soft fantastic barred and feathered bright white where they  ballooned out above into cumuli rich purple in their massive  shadows and dropping from their under edges long sheets of inky  rain  thanks to the brave northeaster we had gained in five days  thirty degrees of heat and had slipped out of december into may   the northeaster too was transforming itself more and more into  the likeness of a southwest wind say rather renewing its own  youth and becoming once more what it was when it started on its  long journey from the tropics towards the pole  as it rushes back  across the ocean thrilled and expanded by the heat it opens its  dry and thirsty lips to suck in the damp from below till saturated  once more with steam it will reach the tropic as a gray rainladen  sky of northeast trade  so we slipped on day after day in a delicious repose which yet was  not monotonous  those indeed who complain of the monotony of a  voyage must have either very few resources in their own minds or  much worse company than we had on board the shannon  here every  hour brought or might bring to those who wished not merely  agreeable conversation about the old world behind us but fresh  valuable information about the new world before us  one morning  for instance i stumbled on a merchant returning to surinam who had  fifty things to tell of his own special businessof the woods the  drugs the barks the vegetable oils which he was going back to  procurea whole new world of yet unknown wealth and use  most  cheering too and somewhat unexpected were the facts we heard of  the improving state of our west india colonies in which the tide of  fortune seems to have turned at last and the gallant race of  planters and merchants in spite of obstacle on obstacle some of  them unjust and undeserved are winning their way back in their own  opinion to a prosperity more sound and lasting than that which  collapsed so suddenly at the end of the great french war  all spoke  of the emancipation of the slaves in cuba an event certain to come  to pass ere long as the only condition which they required to put  them on an equal footing with any producers whatsoever in the new  world  however pleasant though the conversation might be the smallest  change in external circumstances the least break in the perpetual   quocumque adspicias nil est nisi pontus et aer   even a passing bird if one would pass which none would do save  once or twice a stately tropicbird wheeling round aloft like an  eagle was hailed as an event in the day and on the 9th of  december the appearance of the first fragments of gulfweed caused  quite a little excitement and set an enthusiastic pair of  naturalistsa midland hunting squire and a travelled scientific  doctor who had been twelve years in the eastern archipelagofishing  eagerly over the bows with an extemporised grapple of wire for  gulfweed a specimen of which they did not catch  however more  and more still would come in a day or two perhaps whole acres even  whole leagues and then so we hoped but hoped in vain we should  have our feast of zoophytes crustacea and what not  meanwhile it must be remembered that this gulfweed has not as  some of the uninitiated fancy from its name anything to do with the  gulf stream along the southern edge of which we were steaming   thrust away to the south by that great oceanriver it lies in a  vast eddy or central pool of the atlantic between the gulf stream  and the equatorial current unmoved save by surfacedrifts of wind  as floating weeds collect and range slowly round and round in the  still corners of a tumblingbay or salmon pool  one glance at a bit  of the weed as it floats past showed that it is like no fucus of  our shores or anything we ever saw before  the difference of look  is undefinable in words but clear enough  one sees in a moment  that the sargassos of which there are several species on tropical  shores are a genus of themselves and by themselves and a certain  awe may if the beholder be at once scientific and poetical come  over him at the first sight of this famous and unique variety  thereof which has lost ages since the habit of growing on rock or  seabottom but propagates itself for ever floating and feeds among  its branches a whole family of fish crabs cuttlefish zoophytes  mollusks which like the plant which shelters them are found  nowhere else in the world  and that awe springing from the  scientific use of the imagination would be increased if he  recollected the theorynot altogether impossiblethat this  sargasso and possibly some of the animals which cling to it marks  the site of an atlantic continent sunk long ages since and that  transformed by the necessities of life from a rooting to a floating  plant   still it remembers its august abodes   and wanders round and round as if in search of the rocks where it  once grew  we looked eagerly day by day for more and more gulf weed hoping that   slimy things would crawl with legs    upon that slimy sea   and thought of the memorable day when columbuss ship first plunged  her bows into the tangled ocean meadow and the sailors naturally  enough were ready to mutiny fearing hidden shoals ignorant that  they had four miles of blue water beneath their keel and half  recollecting old greek and phoenician legends of a weedy sea off the  coast of africa where the vegetation stopped the ships and kept  them entangled till all on board were starved  day after day we passed more and more of it often in long  processions ranged in the direction of the wind while a few feet  below the surface here and there floated large fronds of a lettuce like weed seemingly an ulva the bright green of which as well as  the rich orange hue of the sargasso brought out by contrast the  intense blue of the water  very remarkable meanwhile and unexpected was the opacity and  seeming solidity of the ocean when looked down on from the bows   whether sapphire under the sunlight or all but black under the  clouds or laced and streaked with beads of foam rising out of the  nether darkness it looks as if it could resist the hand as if one  might almost walk on it so unlike any liquid as seen near shore or  inland is this leaping heaving plain reminding one by its  innumerable conchoidal curves not of water not even of ice but  rather of obsidian  after all we got little of the sargasso  only in a sailing ship  and in calms or light breezes can its treasures be explored   twelve knots an hour is a pace sufficient to tear off the weed as  it is hauled alongside all living things which are not rooted to  it  we got therefore no crustacea neither did we get a single  specimen of the calamaries 8 which may be described as cuttlefish  carrying hooks on their arms as well as suckers the lingering  descendants of a most ancient form which existed at least as far  back as the era of the shallow oolitic seas x or y thousand years  ago  a tiny curled spirorbis a lepraria with its thousandfold  cells and a tiny polype belonging to the campanularias with a  creeping stem which sends up here and there a yellowstalked bell  were all the parasites we saw  but the sargasso itself is a curious  instance of the fashion in which one form so often mimics another of  a quite different family  when fresh out of the water it resembles  not a seaweed so much as a sprig of some willowleaved shrub  burdened with yellow berries large and small for every broken bit  of it seems growing and throwing out ever new berries and leaves or what for want of a better word must be called leaves in a sea weed  for it must be remembered that the frond of a seaweed is not  merely leaf but root also that it not only breathes air but feeds  on water and that even the socalled root by which a seaweed holds  to the rock is really only an anchor holding mechanically to the  stone but not deriving as the root of a landplant would any  nourishment from it  therefore it is that to grow while uprooted  and floating though impossible to most land plants is easy enough  to many seaweeds and especially to the sargasso  the flyingfish now began to be a source of continual amusement as  they scuttled away from under the bows of the ship mistaking her  probably for some huge devouring whale  so strange are they when  first seen though long read of and long looked for that it is  difficult to recollect that they are actually fish  the first  little one was mistaken for a dragonfly the first big one for a  gray plover  the flight is almost exactly like that of a quail or  partridgeflight i must say for in spite of all that has been  learnedly written to the contrary it was too difficult as yet for  the english sportsmen on board to believe that their motion was not  a true flight aided by the vibration of the wings and not a mere  impulse given as in the leap of the salmon by a rush under water   that they can change their course at will is plain to one who looks  down on them from the lofty deck and still more from the paddle box  the length of the flight seems too great to be attributed to a  few strokes of the tail while the plain fact that they renew their  flight after touching and only touching the surface would seem to  show that it was not due only to the original impetus for that  would be retarded instead of being quickened every time they  touched  such were our first impressions  and they were confirmed  by what we saw on the voyage home  the nights as yet we will not say disappointed usfor to see new  stars like canopus and fomalhaut shining in the far south even to  see sirius in his everchanging blaze of red and blue riding high  in a december heaven is interesting enough but the brilliance of  the stars is not at least at this season equal to that of a frosty  sky in england  nevertheless to make up for the deficiency the  clouds were glorious so glorious that i longed again and again as  i did afterwards in the west indies that mr ruskin were by my  side to see and to describe as none but he can do  the evening  skies are fit weeds for widowed eos weeping over the dying sun  thin formless rentin carelessness not in rage and of all the  hues of early autumn leaves purple and brown with green and  primrose lakes of air between  but all hues weakened mingled  chastened into loneliness tenderness regretfulness through which  still shines in endless vistas of clear western light the hope of  the returning day  more and more faint the pageant fades below  towards the white haze of the horizon where in sharpest contrast  leaps and welters against it the black jagged sea and richer and  richer it glows upwards till it cuts the azure overhead  until  only too soon   the suns rim dips the stars rush out    at one stride comes the dark   to be succeeded after the long balmy night by a sunrise which  repeats the colours of the sunset but this time gaudy dazzling  triumphant as befits the season of faith and hope  such imagery  it may be said is hackneyed now and trite even to impertinence   it might be so at home but here in presence of the magnificent  pageant of tropic sunlight it is natural almost inevitable and  the old myth of the daily birth and death of helios and the bridal  joys and widowed tears of eos reinvents itself in the human mind  as soon as it asserts its powerit may be its sacred rightto  translate nature into the language of the feelings  and meanwhile may we not askhave we not a rightfounded on that  common sense of the heart which often is the deepest reasonto ask  if we gross and purblind mortals can perceive and sympathise with  so much beauty in the universe then how much must not he perceive  with how much must not he sympathise for whose pleasure all things  are and were created  who that believes and rightly the sense of  beauty to be among the noblest faculties of man will deny that  faculty to god who conceived man and all besides  wednesday the 15th was a really tropic day blazing heat in the  forenoon with the thermometer at 82 degrees in the shade and in  the afternoon stifling clouds from the southwest where a dark band  of rain showed according to the planters dictum showers over the  islands which we were nearing fast  at noon we were only two  hundred and ten miles from sombrero the spanish hat a lonely  island which is here the first outlier of the new world  we ought  to have passed it by sunrise on the 16th and by the afternoon  reached st thomass where our pleasant party would burst like a  shell in all directions and scatter its fragments about all coasts  and islesfrom demerara to panama from mexico to the bahamas  so  that day was to the crew a day of hard hot workof lifting and  sorting goods on the maindeck in readiness for the arrival at st  thomass and of moving forwards two huge empty boilers which had  graced our spardeck filled with barrels of onions and potatoes  all the way from southampton  but in the soft hot evening hours  time was found for the usual dance on the quarterdeck with the  band under the awning and lamps throwing fantastic shadows and  waltzing couples and the crew clustering aft to see while we old  folks looked on with our ludite dum lubet pueri till the  captain bade the sergeantatarms leave the lights burning for an  extra half hour and sir roger de coverley was danced out to the  great amusement of the foreigners at actually halfpast eleven   after which unexampled dissipation all went off to rest promising  to themselves and their partners that they would get up at sunrise  to sight sombrero  but as it befell mornings waking brought only darkness the heavy  pattering of a tropic shower and the absence of the everlasting  roll of the paddlewheels  we were crawling slowly along in thick  haze and heavy rain having passed sombrero unseen and were away in  a gray shoreless world of waters looking out for virgin gorda the  first of those numberless isles which columbus so goes the tale  discovered on st ursulas day and named them after the saint and  her eleven thousand mythical virgins  unfortunately english  buccaneers have since then given to most of them less poetic names   the dutchmans cap broken jerusalem the dead mans chest rum  island and so forth mark a time and a race more prosaic but still  more terrible though not one whit more wicked and brutal than the  spanish conquistadores whose descendants in the seventeenth  century they smote hip and thigh with great destruction  the farthest of these virgin islands is st thomass  and there  ended the first and longer part of a voyage unmarred by the least  discomfort discourtesy or dulness and full of enjoyment for  which thanks are due alike to captain officers crew and  passengers and also to our muchmaligned friend the northeast  wind who caught us up in the chops of the channel helped us  graciously on nearly to the tropic of cancer giving us a more  prosperous passage than the oldest hands recollect at this season  and then left us for a while to the delicious calms of the edge of  the tropic to catch us up again as the northeast trade  truly this voyage had already given us much for which to thank god   if safety and returning health in an atmosphere in which the mere  act of breathing is a pleasure be things for which to be thankful  then we had reason to say in our hearts that which is sometimes best  unsaid on paper  our first day in a tropic harbour was spent in what might be taken  at moments for a dream did not shells and flowers remain to bear  witness to its reality  it was on friday morning december 17th  that we first sighted the new world a rounded hill some fifteen  hundred feet high which was the end of virgin gorda  that resolved  itself as we ran on into a cluster of long low islands st  johns appearing next on the horizon then tortola and last of all  st thomass all pink and purple in the sun and warmgray in the  shadow which again became as we neared them one after the other  richest green of scrub and down with bright yellow and rusty  rocks plainly lava in low cliffs along the shore  the upper  outline of the hills reminded me with its multitudinous little  coves and dry gullies of the vivarais or auvergne hills and still  more of the sketches of the chinese teamountains in fortunes book   their waterline has been exposed evidently for many ages to the  gnawing of the sea at the present level  everywhere the lava cliffs  are freshly broken toppling down in dust and boulders and leaving  detached stacks and skerries like that called the indians from  its supposed likeness to a group of redbrown savages afloat in a  canoe  but as far as i could see there has been no upheaval since  the land took its present shape  there is no trace of raised  beaches or of the terraces which would have inevitably been formed  by upheaval on the soft sides of the lava hills  the numberless  deep channels which part the isles and islets would rather mark  depression still going on  most beautiful meanwhile are the winding  channels of blue water like landlocked lakes which part the  virgins from each other and beautiful the white triangular sails of  the canoerigged craft which beat up and down them through strong  currents and cockling seas  the clear air the still soft outlines  the rich and yet delicate colouring stir up a sense of purity and  freshness and peace and cheerfulness such as is stirred up by  certain views of the mediterranean and its shores only broken by  one ghastly sightthe lonely mast of the illfated rhone standing  up still where she sank with all her crew in the hurricane of 1867  at length in the afternoon we neared the last point and turning  inside an isolated and crumbling hummock the dutchmans cap saw  before us at the head of a little narrow harbour the scarlet and  purple roofs of st thomass piled up among orangetrees at the  foot of a green corrie or rather couple of corries some eight  hundred feet high  there it was as veritable a dutchoven for  cooking fever in with as veritable a drippingpan for the poison  when concocted in the tideless basin below the town as man ever  invented  and we were not sorry when the superintendent coming on  board bade us steam back again out of the port and round a certain  waterisland at the back of which is a second and healthier  harbour the grigri channel  in the port close to the town we  could discern another token of the late famous hurricane the  funnels and masts of the hapless columbia which lies still on the  top of the sunken floating clock immovable as yet by the art of  man  but some hundred yards on our right was a low cliff which was even  more interesting to some of us than either the town or the wreck  for it was covered with the first tropic vegetation which we had  ever seen  already on a sandy beach outside we had caught sight of  unmistakable coconut trees some of them however dying dead even  snapped short off either by the force of the hurricane or by the  ravages of the beetle which seems minded of late years to  exterminate the coconut throughout the west indies belonging we  are told to the elatersfirefly or skipjack beetles  his grub  like that of his cousin our english wireworm and his nearer  cousin the great wireworm of the sugarcane eats into the pith  and marrow of growing shoots and as the palm being an endogen  increases from within by one bud and therefore by one shoot only  when that is eaten out nothing remains for the tree but to die  and  so it happens that almost every coconut grove which we have seen has  a sad and shabby look as if it existed which it really does merely  on sufferance  but on this cliff we could see even with the naked eye tall aloes  grayblue cerei like huge branching candelabra and bushes the  foliage of which was utterly unlike anything in northern europe  while above the bright deep green of a patch of guineagrass marked  cultivation and a few fruit trees round a cottage told by their  dark baylike foliage of fruits whose names alone were known to us  round waterisland we went into a narrow channel between steep  green hills covered to their tops as late as 1845 with sugar cane but now only with scrub among which the ruins of mills and  buildings stood sad and lonely  but nature in this land of  perpetual summer hides with a kind of eagerness every scar which man  in his clumsiness leaves on the earths surface and all though  relapsing into primeval wildness was green soft luxuriant as if  the hoe had never torn the ground contrasting strangely with the  waterscene with the black steamers snorting in their sleep the  wrecks and condemned hulks in process of breaking up strewing the  shores with their timbers the boatfuls of negroes gliding to and  fro and all the signs of our hasty irreverent wasteful semi barbarous mercantile system which we call for the time being only  it is to be hoped civilisation  the engine had hardly stopped  when we were boarded from a fleet of negro boats and huge bunches  of plantains yams green oranges junks of sugarcane were  displayed upon the deck and more than one of the ladies went  through the ceremony of initiation into west indian ways which  consisted in sucking sugarcane first pared for the sake of their  teeth  the negros stronger incisors tear it without paring  two  amusing figures meanwhile had taken up their station close to the  companion  evidently privileged personages they felt themselves on  their own ground and looked round patronisingly on the passengers  as ignorant foreigners who were too certain to be tempted by the  treasures which they displayed to need any solicitations  one went  by the name of jamaica joe a negro blacker than the night in smart  white coat and smart black trousers a tall courtly gentleman with  the organ of selfinterest to judge from his physiognomy very  highly developed  but he was thrown into the shade by a stately  brown lady who was still very handsomebeautiful if you willand  knew it and had put on her gorgeous turban with grace and plaited  her short locks under it with care and ignored the very existence  of a mere negro like jamaica joe as she sat by her cigars and  slowmatch and eaudecologne at four times the right price and  mats necklaces bracelets made of mimosaseeds white negro hats  nests of curacoa baskets and so forth  they drove a thriving trade  among all newcomers  but were somewhat disgusted to find that we  though new to the west indies were by no means new to west indian  wares and therefore not of the same mind as a gentleman and lady  who came fresh from the town next day with nearly a bushel of white  branching madrepores which they were going to carry as coals to  newcastle six hundred miles down the islands  poor joe tried to  sell us a nest of curacoa baskets for seven shillings retired after  a firm refusal came up again to r after a couple of hours  and said in a melancholy and reproachful voice da take dem for  four shillings and sixpence  i give dem you  but now  would we go on shore  to the town  not we who came to  see nature not towns  some went off on honest business some on  such pleasure as can be found in baking streets hotel bars and  billiardrooms  but the one place on which our eyes were set was a  little cove a quarter of a mile off under the steep hill where a  white line of sand shone between blue water and green wood  a few  yards broad of sand and then impenetrable jungle among which we  could see below the curved yellow stems of the coconuts and  higher up the straight gray stems and broad fanleaves of carat  palms which i regret to say we did not reach  oh for a boat to get  into that paradise  there was threequarters of an hour left  between dinner and dark and in threequarters of an hour what might  not be seen in a world where all was new  the kind chief officer  bidding us not trust negro boats on such a trip lent us one of the  ships with four honest fellows thankful enough to escape from  heat and smoke and away we went with two select companionsthe  sportsman and our scientific friendto land for the first time in  the new world  as we leaped on shore on that white sand what feelings passed  through the heart of at least one of us who found the dream of  forty years translated into fact at last are best perhaps left  untold here  but it must be confessed that ere we had stood for two  minutes staring at the green wall opposite us astonishment soon  swallowed up for the time all other emotions  astonishment not  at the vast size of anything for the scrub was not thirty feet  high nor at the gorgeous colours for very few plants or trees were  in flower but at the wonderful wealth of life  the massiveness  the strangeness the variety the very length of the young and still  growing shoots was a wonder  we tried at first in vain to fix our  eyes on some one dominant or typical form while every form was  clamouring as it were to be looked at and a fresh dryad gazed out  of every bush and with wooing eyes asked to be wooed again  the  first two plants perhaps we looked steadily at were the ipomoea  pes caprae lying along the sand in straight shoots thirty feet  long and growing longer we fancied while we looked at it with  large bilobed green leaves at every joint and here and there a  great purple convolvulus flower and next what we knew at once for  the shoregrape 15a  we had fancied it and correctly to be a  mere low bushy tree with roundish leaves  but what a bush with  drooping boughs arched over and through each other shoots already  six feet long leaves as big as the hand shining like dark velvet a  crimson midrib down each and tiled over each otherimbricated  as the botanists would say in that fashion which gives its  peculiar solidity and richness of light and shade to the foliage of  an old sycamore and among these noble shoots and noble leaves  pendent everywhere long tapering spires of green grapes  this  shoregrape which the west indians esteem as we might a bramble we  found to be without exception the most beautiful broadleafed  plant which we had ever seen  then we admired the frangipani 15b  a tall and almost leafless shrub with thick fleshy shoots bearing  in this species white flowers which have the fragrance peculiar to  certain white blossoms to the jessamine the tuberose the orange  the gardenia the nightflowering cereus then the cacti and aloes  then the first coconut with its last years leaves pale yellow its  new leaves deep green and its trunk ringing when struck like  metal then the sensitive plants then creeping lianes of a dozen  different kinds  then we shrank back from our first glimpse of a  little swamp of foul brown water backed up by the sandbrush with  trees in every stage of decay fallen and tangled into a doleful  thicket through which the spiderlegged mangroves rose on stilted  roots  we turned in wholesome dread to the white beach outside  and picked upand alas wreck everywhere wreckshellsold  friends in the cabinets at homeas earnests to ourselves that all  was not a dream  delicate prickly pinnae noahsarks in  abundance great strombi their lips and outer shell broken away  disclosing the rosy cameo within and looking on the rough beach  pitifully tender and fleshlike lumps and fragments of coral  innumerable reminding us by their worn and rounded shapes of those  which abound in so many secondary strata and then hastened on board  the boat for the sun had already fallen the purple night set in  and from the woods on shore a chorus of frogs had commenced  chattering quacking squealing whistling not to cease till  sunrise  so ended our first trip in the new world and we got back to the  ship but not to sleep  already a coalbarge lay on either side of  her and over the coals we scrambled through a scene which we would  fain forget  black women on one side were doing mens work with  heavy coalbaskets on their heads amid screaming chattering and  language of which happily we understood little or nothing  on the  other a gang of men and boys who as the night fell worked many  of them altogether naked their glossy bronze figures gleaming in  the red lamplight and both men and women singing over their work in  wild choruses which when the screaming cracked voices of the women  were silent and the really rich tenors of the men had it to  themselves were not unpleasant  a lad seeming the poet of the  gang stood on the sponson and in the momentary intervals of work  improvised some story while the men below took up and finished each  verse with a refrain piercing sad running up and down large and  easy intervals  the tunes were many and seemingly familiar all  barbaric often ending in the minor key and reminding us much  perhaps too much of the old gregorian tones  the words were all  but unintelligible  in one song we caught new york again and  again and then captain he heard it he was troubled in him mind  yahehoohufollowed the chorus  captain he go to him cabin he drink him wine and whisky  yahe etc  you go to america  you as well go to heaven  yahe etc  these were all the scraps of negro poetry which we could overhear  while on deck the band was playing quadrilles and waltzes setting  the negro shoveller dancing in the black water at the bargebottom  shovel in hand and pleasant white folks danced under the awning  till the contrast between the refinement within and the brutality  without became very painful  for brutality it was not merely in  the eyes of the sentimentalist but in those of the moralist still  more in the eyes of those who try to believe that all gods human  children may be somewhen somewhere somehow reformed into his  likeness  we were shocked to hear that at another island the evils  of coaling are still worse and that the white authorities have  tried in vain to keep them down  the coaling system is no doubt  demoralising in itself as it enables negroes of the lowest class to  earn enough in one day to keep them in idleness even in luxury for  a week or more till the arrival of the next steamer  but what we  saw proceeded rather from the mere excitability and coarseness of  halfcivilised creatures than from any deliberate depravity and we  were told that in the island just mentioned the negroes when  forced to coal on sunday or on christmas day always abstain from  noise or foul language and if they sing sing nothing but hymns   it is easy to sneer at such a fashion as formalism  it would be  wiser to consider whether the first step in religious training must  not be obedience to some such external positive law whether the  savage must not be taught that there are certain things which he  ought never to do by being taught that there is one day at least on  which he shall not do them  how else is man to learn that the laws  of right and wrong like the laws of the physical world are  entirely independent of him his likes or dislikes knowledge or  ignorance of them that by law he is environed from his cradle to  his grave and that it is at his own peril that he disobeys the law   a higher religion may and ought to follow one in which the law  becomes a law of liberty and a gospel because it is loved and  obeyed for its own sake but even he who has attained to that must  be reminded again and again alas that the law which he loves does  not depend for its sanction on his love of it on his passing frames  or feelings but is as awfully independent of him as it is of the  veriest heathen  and that lesson the sabbath does teach as few or  no other institutions can  the man who says and says rightly that  to the christian all days ought to be sabbaths may be answered and  answered rightly all the more reason for keeping one day which  shall be a sabbath whether you are in a sabbatical mood or not   all the more reason for keeping one day holy as a pattern of what  all days should be  so we will be glad if the negro has got thus  far as an earnest that he may some day get farther still  that night however he kept no sabbath and we got no sleep and  were glad enough before sunrise to escape once more to the cove we  had visited the evening before not that it was prettier or more  curious than others but simply because it is better for those who  wish to learn accurately to see one thing twice than many things  once  a lesson is never learnt till it is learnt over many times  and a spot is best understood by staying in it and mastering it  in  natural history the old scholars saw of cave hominem unius libri  may be paraphrased by he is a thoroughly good naturalist who knows  one parish thoroughly  so back to our little beach we went and walked it all over again  finding of course many things which had escaped us the night  before  we saw our first melocactus and our first nightblowing  cereus creeping over the rocks  we found our first tropic orchid  with white lilac and purple flowers on a stalk three feet high   we saw our first wild pines tillandsias etc clinging parasitic  on the boughs of strange trees or nestling among the angular limb like shoots of the columnar cereus  we learnt to distinguish the  poisonous manchineel and were thankful in serious earnest that we  had happily plucked none the night before when we were snatching at  every new leaf for its milky juice by mere dropping on the skin  burns like the poisoned tunic of nessus and will even when the  head is injured by it cause blindness and death  we gathered a  nosegay of the loveliest flowers under a burning sun within ten  days of christmas and then wandered off the shore up a little path  in the red lava toward a farm where we expected to see fresh  curiosities and not in vain  on one side of the path a hedge of  pinguin bromeliathe plants like huge pineapple plants without  the fruitwas but three feet high but from its prickles utterly  impenetrable to man or beast and inside the hedge a tree like a  straggling pear with huge green calabashes growing out of its bark here was actually crescentia cujetethe plaything of ones  childhoodalive and growing  the other side was low scrubprickly  shrubs like acacias and mimosas covered with a creeping vine with  brilliant yellow hair we had seen it already from the ship gilding  large patches of the slopes most like european dodder  among it  rose the tall calotropis procera with its fleshy gray stems and  leaves and its azure of lovely lilac flowers with curious columns  of stamens in eachan asclepiad introduced from the old world  where it ranges from tropical africa to afghanistan and so on and  so on up to a little farmyard very like a highland one in most  things want of neatness included save that huge spotted trochi  were scattered before the door instead of buckies or periwinkles  and in the midst of the yard grew side by side the common  accompaniment of a west india kitchen door the magic trees whose  leaves rubbed on the toughest meat make it tender on the spot and  whose fruit makes the best of sauce or pickle to be eaten therewith namely a male and female papaw carica papaya their stems some  fifteen feet high with a flat crown of mallowlike leaves just  beneath which in the male grew clusters of fragrant flowerets in  the female clusters of unripe fruit  on through the farmyard  picking fresh flowers at every step and down to a shady cove for  the sun even at eight oclock in december was becoming  uncomfortably fierce and again into the shoregrape wood  we had  already discovered to our pain that almost everything in the bush  had prickles of all imaginable shapes and sizes and now touching  a low tree one of our party was seized as by a briar through  clothes and into skin and in escaping found on the tree  guilandina bonducella rounded prickly pods which being opened  proved to contain the gray horsenickerbeads of our childhood  up and down the white sand we wandered collecting shells as did  the sailors gladly enough and then rowed back over a bottom of  white sand bedded here and there with the short manatigrass  thalassia testudinum one of the few flowering plants which like  our zostera or grasswrack grows at the bottom of the sea  but  wherever the bottom was stony we could see huge prickly sea urchins huger brainstone corals round and gray and branching  corals likewise such as when cleaned may be seen in any curiosity  shop  these and a flock of brown and gray pelicans sailing over  our head were fresh tokens to us of where we were  as we were displaying our nosegay on deck on our return to some  who had stayed stifling on board and who were inclined as west  indians are at once to envy and to poohpooh the superfluous energy  of newcome europeans r drew out a large and lovely flower  pale yellow with a tiny green apple or two and leaves like those  of an oleander  the brown lady who was again at her post on deck  walked up to her in silence uninvited and with a commanding air  waved the thing away  dat manchineel  dat poison  throw dat  overboard  r who knew it was not manchineel whispered to a  bystander ce nest pas vrai  but the brown lady was a linguist   ah mais cest vrai cried she with flashing teeth and retired  muttering her contempt of english ignorance and impertinence  and as it befell she was if not quite right at least not quite  wrong  for when we went into the cabin we and our unlucky yellow  flower were flown at by another brown lady in another gorgeous  turban who had become on the voyage a friend and an intimate for  she was the nurse of the baby who had been the light of the eyes of  the whole quarterdeck ever since we left southamptongod bless it  and its mother and beautiful mon nid where she dwells beneath the  rock as exquisite as one of her own hummingbirds  we were so  scolded about this poor little green apple that we set to work to  find put what it was after promising at least not to eat it  and  it proved to be thevetia neriifolia and a very deadly poison  this was the first though by no means the last warning which we  got not to meddle rashly with poisonbush lest that should befall  us which befell a scientific west indian of old  for hearing much  of the edible properties of certain european toadstools he resolved  to try a few experiments in his own person on west indian ones  during the course of which he found himself one evening after a  good toadstool dinner raving mad  the doctor was sent for and  brought him round a humbled man  but a heavier humiliation awaited  him when his negro butler who had long looked down on him for his  botanical studies entered with his morning cup of coffee  now  massa said he in a tone of triumphant pity i think you no go  out any more cut bush and eat him  if we had wanted any further proof that we were in the tropics we  might have had it in the fearful heat of the next few hours when  the shannon lay with a steamer on each side one destined for the  gulf the other for the islands and not a breath of air was to  be got till late in the afternoon when amid shaking of hands and  waving of handkerchiefs as hearty as if we the islandbound and  they the gulfbound and the officers of the shannon had known  each other fourteen years instead of fourteen days we steamed out  past the little saba rock which was said but it seems incorrectly  to have burst into smoke and flame during the earthquake and then  away to the south and east for the islands  having had our first  taste but thank god not our last of the joys of the earthly  paradise    chapter ii  down the islands    i had heard and read much from boyhood about these lesser  antilles  i had pictured them to myself a thousand times  but i  was altogether unprepared for their beauty and grandeur  for  hundreds of miles day after day the steamer carried us past a  shifting diorama of scenery which may be likened to vesuvius and  the bay of naples repeated again and again with every possible  variation of the same type of delicate loveliness  under a cloudless sky upon a sea lively yet not unpleasantly  rough we thrashed and leaped along  ahead of us one after  another rose high on the southern horizon banks of gray cloud from  under each of which as we neared it descended the shoulder of a  mighty mountain dim and gray  nearer still the gray changed to  purple lowlands rose out of the sea sloping upwards with those  grand and simple concave curves which betoken almost always  volcanic land  nearer still the purple changed to green  tall  palmtrees and enginehouses stood out against the sky the surf  gleamed white around the base of isolated rocks  a little nearer  and we were under the lee or western side of the island  the sea  grew smooth as glass we entered the shade of the islandcloud and  slid along in still unfathomable blue water close under the shore  of what should have been one of the islands of the blest  it was easy in presence of such scenery to conceive the exaltation  which possessed the souls of the first discoverers of the west  indies  what wonder if they seemed to themselves to have burst into  fairylandto be at the gates of the earthly paradise  with such a  climate such a soil such vegetation such fruits what luxury must  not have seemed possible to the dwellers along those shores  what  riches too of gold and jewels might not be hidden among those  forestshrouded glens and peaks  and beyond and beyond again ever  new islands new continents perhaps an inexhaustible wealth of yet  undiscovered worlds  no wonder that the men rose above themselves for good and for evil  that having as it seemed to them found infinitely they hoped  infinitely and dared infinitely  they were a dumb generation and  an unlettered those old conquistadores  they did not as we do  now analyse and describe their own impressions  but they felt them  nevertheless and felt them it may be all the more intensely  because they could not utter them and so went half intoxicated by  day and night with the beauty and the wonder round them till the  excitement overpowered alike their reason and their conscience and  frenzied with superstition and greed with contempt and hatred of  the heathen indians and often with mere drink and sunshine they  did deeds which like all wicked deeds avenge themselves and are  avenging themselves from mexico to chili unto this very day  i said that these islands resembled vesuvius and the bay of naples   like causes have produced like effects and each island is little  but the peak of a volcano down whose shoulders lava and ash have  slidden toward the sea  some carry several crater cones  complicating at once the structure and scenery of the island but  the majority carry but a single cone like that little island or  rather rock of saba which is the first of the antilles under the  lee of which the steamer passes  santa cruz which is left to  leeward is a long low ragged island of the same form as st  thomass and the virgins and belonging i should suppose to the  same formation  but saba rises sheer out of the sea some 1500 feet  or more without flat ground or even harbour  from a little  landingplace to leeward a stair runs up 800 feet into the bosom of  the old volcano and in that hollow live some 1200 honest dutch and  some 800 negroes who were till of late years their slaves at  least in law  but in saba it is said the whites were really the  slaves and the negroes the masters  for they went off whither and  when they liked earned money about the islands and brought it  home expected their masters to keep them when out of work  and not  in vain  the island was happily for it too poor for sugargrowing  and the grande culture the dutch were never tempted to increase  the number of their slaves looked upon the few they had as friends  and children and when emancipation came no change whatsoever  ensued it is said in the semifeudal relation between the black  men and the white  so these good dutch live peacefully aloft in  their volcano which it is to be hoped will not explode again  they  grow garden crops among which i understand are several products  of the temperate zone the air being at that height pleasantly  cool  they sell their produce about the islands  they build boats  up in the craterthe best boats in all the west indiesand lower  them down the cliff to the sea  they hire themselves out too not  having lost their forefathers seagoing instincts as sailors about  all those seas and are like their boats the best in those parts   they all speak english and though they are nominally lutherans are  glad of the services of the excellent bishop of antigua who pays  them periodical visits  he described them as virtuous shrewd  simple healthy folk retaining in spite of the tropic sun the  same clear white and red complexions which their ancestors brought  from holland two hundred years agoa proof among many that the  white man need not degenerate in these isles  saba has like most of these islands its somma like that of  vesuvius an outer ring of lava the product of older eruptions  surrounding a central cone the product of some newer one  but even  this latter as far as i could judge by the glass is very ancient   little more than the core of the central cone is left  the rest has  been long since destroyed by rains and winds  a white cliff at the  south end of the island should be examined by geologists  it  belongs probably to that formation of tertiary calcareous marl so  often seen in the west indies especially at barbadoes  but if so  it must to judge from the scar which it makes seaward have been  upheaved long ago and like the whole islandand indeed all the  islandsbetokens an immense antiquity  much more recentin appearance at leastis the little isle of st  eustatius or at least the cratercone with its lip broken down at  one spot which makes up fivesixths of the island  st eustatius  may have been in eruption though there is no record of it during  historic times and looks more unrepentant and capable of  misbehaving itself again than does any other cratercone in the  antilles far more so than the souffriere in st vincent which  exploded in 1812  but these two are mere rocks  it is not till the traveller arrives  at st kitts that he sees what a west indian island is  the mother of the antilles as she is called is worthy of her  name  everywhere from the shore the land sweeps up slowly at  first then rapidly toward the central mass the rugged peak  whereof goes by the name of mount misery  only once and then but  for a moment did we succeed in getting a sight of the actual  summit so pertinaciously did the clouds crawl round it  3700 feet  aloft a pyramid of black lava rises above the broken walls of an  older crater and is to judge from its knifeedge flat top and  concave eastern side the last remnant of an inner cone which has  been washed or more probably blasted away  beneath it according  to the report of an islander to dr davy and what i heard was to  the same effect is a deep hollow longer than it is wide without  an outlet walled in by precipices and steep declivities from  fissures in which steam and the fumes of sulphur are emitted   sulphur in crystals abounds encrusting the rocks and loose stones  and a stagnant pool of rainwater occupies the bottom of the  souffriere  a dangerous neighbourbut as long as he keeps his  temper as he has done for three hundred years at least a most  beneficent oneis this great hill which took in columbuss  imagination the form of the giant st christopher bearing on his  shoulder the infant christ and so gave a name to the whole island  from the lava and ash ejected from this focus the whole soils of  the island have been formed soils of still unexhausted fertility  save whenas must needs be in a volcanic regionpatches of mere  rapilli and scoriae occur  the mountain has hurled these out and  everywhere as a glance of the eye shows the tropic rains are  carrying them yearly down to the lowland exposing fresh surfaces to  the action of the air and by continual denudation and degradation  remanuring the soil  everywhere too are gullies sawn in the  slopes which terminate above in deep and narrow glens giving  especially when alternated with long lavastreams a ridgeand furrow look to this and most other of the antilles  dr davy with  his usual acuteness of eye and soundness of judgment attributes  them rather to water acting on loose volcanic ashes than to rents  and fissures the result of sudden and violent force  doubtless he  is in the right  thus and thus only has been formed the greater  part of the most beautiful scenery in the west indies and i longed  again and again as i looked at it for the company of my friend and  teacher colonel george greenwood that i might show him on island  after island such manifold corroborations of his theories in rain  and rivers  but our eyes were drawn off at almost the second glance from  mountainpeaks and glens to the slopes of cultivated lowland  sheeted with bright green cane and guineagrass and pigeon pea  and that not for their own sakes but for the sake of objects so  utterly unlike anything which we had ever seen that it was not  easy at first to discover what they were  gray pillars which  seemed taller than the tallest poplars smooth and cylindrical as  those of a doric temple each carrying a flat head of darkest green  were ranged along roadsides and round fields or stood in groups or  singly near engineworks or towered above rich shrubberies which  shrouded comfortable countryhouses  it was not easy as i have  said to believe that these strange and noble things were trees   but such they were  at last we beheld with wonder and delight the  pride of the west indies the cabbage palmspalmistes of the french  settlerswhich botanists have well named oreodoxa the glory of  the mountains  we saw them afterwards a hundred times in their own  native forests and when they rose through tangled masses of richest  vegetation mixed with other and smaller species of palms their  form fantastic though it was harmonised well with hundreds of  forms equally fantastic  but here they seemed at first sight out  of place incongruous and artificial standing amid no kindred  forms and towering over a cultivation and civilisation which might  have been mistaken seen from the sea for wealthy farms along some  english shore  gladly would we have gone on shore were it but to  have stood awhile under those palmistes and an invitation was not  wanting to a pretty treeshrouded house on a low cliff a mile off  where doubtless every courtesy and many a luxury would have awaited  us  but it could not be  we watched kind folk rowed to shore  without us and then turned to watch the black flotilla under our  quarter  the first thing that caught our eye on board the negro boats which  were alongside was of course the baskets of fruits and vegetables  of which one of us at least had been hearing all his life  at st  thomass we had been introduced to bananas figs as they are  miscalled in the west indies to the great green oranges thick skinned and fragrant to those junks of sugarcane some two feet  long which cuffy and cuffys ladies delight to gnaw walking  sitting and standing increasing thereby the size of their lips  and breaking out often enough their upper front teeth  we had  seen and eaten too the sweet sop 25aa passable fruit or  rather congeries of fruits looking like a green and purple  strawberry of the bigness of an orange  it is the cousin of the  prickly soursop 25b of the really delicious but to me unknown  chirimoya 25c and of the custard apple 25d containing a pulp  which as those who remember the delectable pages of tom cringle  know bears a startling likeness to brains  bunches of grapes at  st kitts lay among these  and at st lucia we saw with them for  the first time avocado or alligator pears alias midshipmans  butter 26a large round brown fruits to be eaten with pepper and  salt by those who list  with these in open baskets lay bright  scarlet capsicums green coconuts tinged with orange great roots of  yam 26b and cushcush 26c with strange pulse of various kinds  and hues  the contents of these vegetable baskets were often as  gaycoloured as the gaudy gowns and still gaudier turbans of the  women who offered them for sale  screaming and jabbering the negroes and negresses thrust each  others boats about scramble from one to the other with gestures of  wrath and defiance and seemed at every moment about to fall to  fisticuffs and to upset themselves among the sharks  but they did  neither  their excitement evaporated in noise  to their ladies  to do them justice the men were always civil while the said  ladies bullied them and ordered them about without mercy  the  negro women are without doubt on a more thorough footing of  equality with the men than the women of any white race  the causes  i believe are two  in the first place there is less difference  between the sexes in mere physical strength and courage and  watching the average negresses one can well believe the stories of  those terrible amazonian guards of the king of dahomey whose boast  is that they are no longer women but men  there is no doubt that  in case of a rebellion the black women of the west indies would be  as formidable cutlass in hand as the men  the other cause is the  exceeding ease with which not merely food but gay clothes and  ornaments can be procured by light labour  the negro woman has no  need to marry and make herself the slave of a man in order to get a  home and subsistence  independent she is for good and evil and  independent she takes care to remain and no schemes for civilising  the negro will have any deep or permanent good effect which do not  take note of and legislate for this singular fact  meanwhile it was a comfort to one fresh from the cities of the old  world and the short and stunted figures the mesquin and scrofulous  visages which crowd our alleys and back wynds to see everywhere  health strength and goodly stature especially among women   nowhere in the west indies are to be seen those haggard downtrodden  mothers grown old before their time too common in england and  commoner still in france  health rude in every sense of the  word is the mark of the negro woman and of the negro man likewise   their faces shine with fatness they seem to enjoy they do enjoy  the mere act of living like the lizard on the wall  it may be  saidit must be saidthat if they be human beings as they are  they are meant for something more than mere enjoyment of life  well  and good  but are they not meant for enjoyment likewise  let us  take the beam out of our own eye before we take the mote out of  theirs let us before we complain of them for being too healthy and  comfortable remember that we have at home here tens of thousands of  paupers rogues whatnot who are not a whit more civilised  intellectual virtuous or spiritual than the negro and are  meanwhile neither healthy nor comfortable  the negro may have the  corpus sanum without the mens sana  but what of those whose souls  and bodies are alike unsound  away south along the low spit at the south end of the island where  are saltpans which i suspect lie in now extinguished craters and  past little nevis the conical ruin as it were of a volcanic  island  it was probably joined to the low end of st kitts not many  years ago  it is separated from it now only by a channel called the  narrows some four to six miles across and very shallow there  being not more than four fathoms in many places and infested with  reefs whether of true coral or of volcanic rock i should be glad to  know  a single peak with its souffriere rises to some 2000 feet  right and left of it are two lower hills fragments apparently of  a somma or older and larger crater  the lava and ash slide in  concave slopes of fertile soil down to the sea forming an island  some four miles by three which was in the seventeenth century a  little paradise containing 4000 white citizens who had dwindled  down in 1805 under the baneful influences of slavery to 1300 in  1832 the period of emancipation to 500 and in 1854 to only 170  27a  a happy place however it is said still to be with a  population of more than 10000 who as there is happily no crown  land in the island cannot squat and so return to their original  savagery but are wellordered and peaceable industrious and well taught and need it is said not only no soldiers but no police  one spot on the little island we should have liked much to have  seen  the house where nelson after his marriage with mrs nisbet  a lady of nevis dwelt awhile in peace and purity  happier for him  perhaps though not for england had he never left that quiet nest  and now on the leeward bow another gray mountain island rose and  on the windward another lower and longer  the former was  montserrat which i should have gladly visited as i had been  invited to do  for little montserrat is just now the scene of a  very hopeful and important experiment 27b  the messrs sturge  have established there a large plantation of limes and a  manufactory of limejuice which promises to be able to supply in  good time vast quantities of that most useful of all seamedicines  their connection with the society of friends and indeed the very  name of sturge is a guarantee that such a work will be carried on  for the benefit not merely of the capitalists but of the coloured  people who are employed  already i am assured a marked  improvement has taken place among them and i for one heartily bid  godspeed to the enterprise  to any enterprise indeed which tends  to divert labour and capital from that exclusive sugargrowing which  has been most injurious i verily believe the bane of the west  indies  on that subject i may have to say more in a future chapter   i ask the reader meanwhile to follow as the ships head goes  round to windward toward antigua  antigua is lower longer and flatter than the other islands  it  carries no central peak  but its wildness of ragged uplands forms  it is said a natural fortress which ought to be impregnable and  its loyal and industrious people boast that were every other west  indian island lost the english might make a stand in antigua long  enough to enable them to reconquer the whole  i should have feared  from the look of the island that no large force could hold out long  in a country so destitute of water as those volcanic hills rusty  ragged treeless almost sad and desolateif any land could be sad  and desolate with such a blue sea leaping around and such a blue sky  blazing above  those who wish to know the agricultural capabilities  of antigua and to know too the good sense and courage the  justice and humanity which have enabled the antiguans to struggle  on and upward through all their difficulties in spite of drought  hurricane and earthquake till permanent prosperity seems now  become certain should read dr davys excellent book which i  cannot too often recommend  for us we could only give a hasty look  at its southern volcanic cliffs while we regretted that we could  not inspect the marine strata of the eastern parts of the island  with their calcareous marls and limestones hardened clays and  cherts and famous silicified trees which offer important problems  to the geologist as yet not worked out 28  we could well believe as the steamer ran into english harbour that  antigua was still subject to earthquakes and had been shaken with  great loss of property though not of life in the guadaloupe  earthquake of 1843 when 5000 lives were lost in the town of point apitre alone  the only wellmarked effect which dr davy could  hear of apart from damage to artificial structures was the partial  sinking of a causeway leading to rat island in the harbour of st  john  no wonder  if st johns harbour beas from its shape on  the map it probably issimply an extinct crater or group of  craters like english harbour  a more picturesque or more uncanny  little hole than that latter we had never yet seen  but there are  many such harbours about these islands which nature for the time  being at least has handed over from the dominion of fire to that of  water  past low cliffs of ash and volcanic boulder sloping  westward to the sea which is eating them fast away the steamer  runs in through a deep crack a pistolshot in width  on the east  side a strange section of gray lava and ash is gnawn into caves  on  the right a bluff rock of black lava dips sheer into water several  fathoms deep and you anchor at once inside an irregular group of  craters having passed through a gap in one of their sides which  has probably been torn out by a lava flow  whether the land at the  time of the flow was higher or lower than at present who can tell   this is certain that the first basin is for half of its  circumference circular and walled with ash beds which seem to  slope outward from it  to the left it leads away into a long creek  up which somewhat to our surprise we saw neat governmenthouses  and quays and between them and us a noble ironclad and other ships  of war at anchor close against lava and ash cliffs  but right  ahead the dusty sides of the crater are covered with strange  bushes its glaring shingle spotted with bright green manchineels  while on the cliffs around aloes innumerable seemingly the  imported american agave send up their groups of huge fat pointed  leaves from crannies so arid that one would fancy a moss would  wither in them  a strange place it is and strangely hot likewise  and one could not but fear a dayit is to be hoped long distant when it will be hotter still  out of english harbour after taking on board fruit and bargaining  for beads for which antigua is famous we passed the lonely rock of  redonda toward a mighty mountain which lay under a sheet of clouds  of corresponding vastness  that was guadaloupe  the dark  undersides of the rolling clouds mingled with the dark peaks and  ridges till we could not see where earth ended and vapour began  and the clouds from far to the eastward up the wind massed  themselves on the island and then ceased suddenly to leeward  leaving the sky clear and the sea brilliant  i should be glad to know the cause of this phenomenon which we saw  several times among the islands but never in greater perfection  than on nearing nevis from the south on our return  in that case  however the cloud continued to leeward  it came up from the east  for full ten miles an advancing column of tall ghostly cumuli  leaden above a leaden sea and slid toward the island whose lines  seemed to leap up once to meet them fail then in a second leap  to plunge the craterpeak high into the mist and then to sink down  again into the western sea so gently that the line of shore and sea  was indistinguishable  but above the cloudprocession passed on  shattered by its contact with the mountain and transfigured as it  neared the setting sun into long upward streaming lines of rack  purple and primrose against a saffron sky while venus lingered low  between cloud and sea a spark of fire glittering through dull red  haze  and now the steamer ran due south across the vast basin which is  ringed round by antigua montserrat and guadaloupe with st kitts  and nevis showing like tall gray ghosts to the northwest  higher  and higher ahead rose the great mountain mass of guadaloupe its  head in its own canopy of cloud  the island falls into the sea  sharply to leeward  but it stretches out to windward in a long line  of flat land edged with low cliff and studded with large farms and  enginehouses  it might be a bit of the isle of thanet or of the  lothians were it not for those umbrellalike palmistes a hundred  feet high which stand out everywhere against the sky  at its  northern end a furious surf was beating on a sandy beach and  beyond that dim and distant loomed up the low flat farther island  known by the name of grande terre  guadaloupe as some of my readers may know consists properly  speaking of two islands divided by a swamp and a narrow saltwater  river  the eastward half or grande terre which is composed of  marine strata is hardly seen in the island voyage and then only at  a distance first behind the westward basse terre and then behind  other little islands the saintes and mariegalante  but the  westward island rising in one lofty volcanic mass which hides the  eastern island from view is perhaps for mere grandeur the  grandest in the archipelago  the mountainsamong which are it is  said fourteen extinct cratersrange upward higher and higher  toward the southern end with corries and glens which must be when  seen near hanging gardens of stupendous size  the forests seem to  be as magnificent as they were in the days of pere labat  tiny  knots on distant clifftops when looked at through the glass are  found to be single trees of enormous height and breadth  gullies  hundreds of feet in depth rushing downwards toward the sea  represent the rush of the torrents which have helped through  thousands of rainy seasons to scoop them out and down  but all this grandeur and richness culminates toward the southern  end in one great craterpeak 5000 feet in height at the foot of  which lies the port of basse terre or bourg st francois  we never were so fortunate as to see the souffriere entirely free  from cloud  the lower wider and more ancient crater was generally  clear  but out of the midst of it rose a second cone buried in  darkness and mist  once only we caught sight of part of its lip  and the sight was one not to be forgotten  the sun was rising behind the hills  the purple mountain was backed  by clear blue sky  high above it hung sheets of orange cloud  lighted from underneath lower down and close upon the hilltops  curved sheets of bright white mist   stooped from heaven and took the shape with fold on fold of mountain and of cape   and under them again the crater seethed with gray mist among  which at one moment we could discern portions of its lip not  smooth like that of vesuvius but broken into awful peaks and  chasms hundreds of feet in height  as the sun rose level lights of  golden green streamed round the peak right and left over the downs   but only for a while  as the skyclouds vanished in his blazing  rays earthclouds rolled up below from the valleys behind wreathed  and weltered about the great black teeth of the crater and then  sinking among them and below them shrouded the whole cone in  purple darkness for the day while in the foreground blazed in the  sunshine broad slopes of canefield  below them again the town  with handsome houses and oldfashioned churches and convents dating  possibly from the seventeenth century embowered in mangoes  tamarinds and palmistes and along the beach a market beneath a row  of trees with canoes drawn up to be unladen and gay dresses of  every hue  the surf whispered softly on the beach  the cheerful  murmur of voices came off the shore and above it the tinkling of  some little bell calling good folks to early mass  a cheery  brilliant picture as man could wish to see  but marred by two ugly  elements  a mile away on the low northern cliff marked with many a  cross was the lonely cholera cemetery a remembrance of the fearful  pestilence which a few years since swept away thousands of the  people  and above frowned that black giant now asleep but for how  long  in 1797 an eruption hurled out pumice ashes and sulphureous  vapours  in the great crisis of 1812 indeed the volcano was  quiet leaving the souffriere of st vincent to do the work but  since then he has shown an ugly and uncertain humour  smoke by day  and flame by nightor probably that light reflected from below  which is often mistaken for flame in volcanic eruptionshave been  seen again and again above the crater and the awful earthquake of  1843 proves that his capacity for mischief is unabated  the whole  island indeed is somewhat unsafe for the hapless town of pointa pitre destroyed by that earthquake stands not on the volcanic  basse terre but on the edge of the marine grande terre near the  southern mouth of the saltwater river  heaven grant these good  people of guadaloupe a long respite for they are said to deserve  it as far as human industry and enterprise goes  they have as  well i understand as the gentlemen of martinique discovered the  worth of the division of labour  throughout the west indies the  planter is usually not merely a sugargrower but a sugarmaker  also  he requires therefore two capitals and two intellects  likewise one for his canefields the other for his ingenio  enginehouse or sugarworks  but he does not gain thereby two  profits  having two things to do neither usually is done well   the canefarming is bad the sugarmaking bad and the sugar when  made disposed of through merchants by a cumbrous antiquated and  expensive system  these shrewd frenchmen and i am told even  small proprietors among the negroes not being crippled happily for  them by those absurd sugarduties which till mr lowes budget  put a premium on the making of bad sugar are confining themselves  to growing the canes and sell them raw to usines centrales at  which they are manufactured into sugar  they thus devote their own  capital and intellect to increasing the yield of their estates  while the central factories it is said pay dividends ranging from  twenty to forty per cent  i regretted much that i was unable to  visit in croptime one of these factories and see the working of a  system which seems to contain one of the best elements of the co operative principle  but and this is at present a serious inconvenience to a traveller  in the antilles the steamer passes each island only once a  fortnight so that to land in an island is equivalent to staying  there at least that time unless one chooses to take the chances of  a coasting schooner and bad food bugs cockroaches and a bunk  whichbut i will not describe  non ragionam di lor ma guarda  down the companion e passa  i must therefore content myself with describing as honestly as i  can what little we saw from the sea of islands at each of which we  would gladly have stayed several days  as the traveller nears each of themguadaloupe dominica  martinique of which two last we had only one passing glance st  vincent st lucia and grenadahe will be impressed not only by  the peculiarity of their form but by the richness of their colour  all of them do not like st kitts guadaloupe and st vincent  slope up to one central peak  in martinique for instance there  are three separate peaks or groups of peaksthe mont pelee the  pitons du carbet and the piton du vauclain  but all have that  peculiar jagged outline which is noticed first at the virgin  islands  flat vans or hogbacked hills and broad sweeps of moorland so  common in scotland are as rare as are steep walls of cliff so  common in the alps  pyramid is piled on pyramid the sides of each  at a slope of about 45 degrees till the whole range is a congeries  of multitudinous peaks and peaklets round the base of which spreads  out with a sudden sweep the smooth lowland of volcanic ash and  lava  this extreme raggedness of outline is easily explained  the  mountains have never been as in scotland planed smooth by ice   they have been gouged out in every direction by the furious tropic  rains and tropic raintorrents  had the rocks been stratified and  tolerably horizontal these rains would have cut them out into  tablelands divided by deep gullies such as may be seen in  abyssinia and in certain parts of the western united states  but  these rocks are altogether amorphous and unstratified and have been  poured or spouted out as lumps dykes and sheets of lava of every  degree of hardness so that the rain in degrading them has worn  them not into tables and ranges but into innumerable cones  and  the process of degradation is still going on rapidly  though a  cliff or sheet of bare rock is hardly visible among the glens yet  here and there a bright brown patch tells of a recent landslip and  the masses of debris and banks of shingle backed by a pestilential  little swamp at the mouth of each torrent show how furious must be  the downpour and downroll before the force of a sudden flood along  so headlong an incline  but in strange contrast with the ragged outline and with the wild  devastation of the rainy season is the richness of the verdure  which clothes the islands up to their highest peaks in what seems  a coat of green fur but when looked at through the glasses proves  to be in most cases gigantic timber  not a rock is seen  if  there be a cliff here and there it is as green as an english lawn   steep slopes are gray with groogroo palms 33 or yellow with  unknown flowering trees  high against the skyline tiny knots and  lumps are found to be gigantic trees  each glen has buried its  streamlet a hundred feet in vegetation above which here and there  the gray stem and dark crown of some palmiste towers up like the  mast of some great admiral  the eye and the fancy strain vainly  into the green abysses and wander up and down over the wealth of  depths and heights compared with which european parks and woodlands  are but paltry scrub and shaugh  no books are needed to tell that   the eye discovers it for itself even before it has learnt to judge  of the great size of the vegetation from the endless variety of  form and colour  for the islands though green intensely are not  of one but of every conceivable green or rather of hues ranging  from pale yellow through all greens into cobalt blue and as the  wind stirs the leaves and sweeps the lights and shadows over hill  and glen all is everchanging iridescent like a peacocks neck  till the whole island from peak to shore seems some glorious  jewelan emerald with tints of sapphire and topaz hanging between  blue sea and white surf below and blue sky and white cloud above  if the reader fancies that i exaggerate let him go and see  let  him lie for one hour off the rosseau at dominica  let him sail down  the leeward side of guadaloupe down the leeward side of what island  he will and judge for himself how poor and yet how tawdry my  words are compared with the luscious yet magnificent colouring of  the antilles  the traveller at least so i think would remark also with some  surprise the seeming smallness of these islands  the basse terre  of guadaloupe for instance is forty miles in length  as you lie  off it it does not look half or even a quarter of that length  and that not merely because the distances north and south are  foreshortened or shut in by nearer headlands  the causes i  believe are more subtle and more complex  first the novel  clearness of the air which makes the traveller fresh from misty  england fancy every object far nearer and therefore far smaller  than it actually is  next the simplicity of form  each outer line  trends upward so surely toward a single focus each whole is so  sharply defined between its baseline of sea and its background of  sky that like a statue each island is compact and complete in  itself an isolated and selfdependent organism and therefore like  every beautiful statue it looks much smaller than it is  so  perfect this isolation seems that one fancies at moments that the  island does not rise out of the sea but floats upon it that it is  held in place not by the roots of the mountains and deep miles of  lavawall below but by the cloud which has caught it by the top  and will not let it go  let that cloud but rise and vanish and  the whole beautiful thing will be cast adrift ready to fetch way  before the wind and as it will seem often enough to do when viewed  through a cabinport to slide silently past you while you are  sliding past it  and yet to him who knows the past a dark shadow hangs over all  this beauty and the aireven in clearest blaze of sunshineis  full of ghosts  i do not speak of the shadow of negro slavery nor  of the shadow which though abolished it has left behind not to be  cleared off for generations to come  i speak of the shadow of war  and the ghosts of gallant soldiers and sailors  truly here   the spirits of our fathers    might start from every wave for the deck it was their field of fame    and ocean was their grave   and ask us  what have you done with these islands which we won for  you with precious blood  what could we answer  we have misused  them neglected them till now ashamed of the slavery of the past  and too ignorant and helpless to govern them now slavery is gone we  are halfminded to throw them away again or to allow them to annex  themselves in sheer weariness at our imbecility to the americans  who far too wise to throw them away in their turn will accept them  gladly as an instalment of that great development of their empire  when the stars and stripes shall float upon cape horn  but was it for this that these islands were taken and retaken till  every gully held the skeleton of an englishman  was it for this  that these seas were reddened with blood year after year till the  sharks learnt to gather to a seafight as eagle kite and wolf  gathered of old to fights on land  did all those gallant souls go  down to hades in vain and leave nothing for the englishman but the  sad and proud memory of their useless valour  that at least they  have left  however we may deplore those old wars as unnecessary however much  we may hate war in itself as perhaps the worst of all the  superfluous curses with which man continues to deface himself and  this fair earth of god yet one must be less than englishman less  it may be than man if one does not feel a thrill of pride at  entering waters where one says to oneselfhere rodney on the  glorious 12th of april 1782 broke count de grasses line teaching  thereby nelson to do the same in like case took and destroyed  seven french ships of the line and scattered the rest preventing  the french fleet from joining the spaniards at hispaniola thus  saving jamaica and the whole west indies and brought about by that  single tremendous blow the honourable peace of 1783  on what a  scene of crippled and sinking shattered and triumphant ships in  what a sea must the conquerors have looked round from the  formidables poop with de grasse at luncheon with rodney in the  cabin below and not as he had boastfully promised on board his  own fills de paris  truly though cynically wrote sir gilbert  blane if superior beings make a sport of the quarrels of mortals  they could not have chosen a better theatre for this magnificent  exhibition nor could they ever have better entertainment than this  day afforded  yon lovely roadstead of dominicathere it was that rodney first  caught up the french on the 9th of april three days before and  would have beaten them there and then had not a great part of his  fleet lain becalmed under these very highlands past which we are  steaming through water smooth as glass  you glance again running  down the coast of martinique into a deep bay ringed round with gay  houses embowered in mango and coconut with the piton du vauclain  rising into the clouds behind it  that is the culdesac royal for  years the rendezvous and stronghold of the french fleets  from it  count de grasse sailed out on the fatal 8th of april and there  beyond it opens an isolated rock of the shape but double the  size of one of the great pyramids which was once the british sloop  of war diamond rock  for in the end of 1803 sir samuel hood saw that french ships  passing to fort royal harbour in martinique escaped him by running  through the deep channel between pointe du diamante and this same  rock which rises sheer out of the water 600 feet and is about a  mile round and only accessible at a point to the leeward and even  then only when there is no surf  he who lands it is said has then  to creep through crannies and dangerous steeps round to the  windward side where the eye is suddenly relieved by a sloping grove  of wild figtrees clinging by innumerable airroots to the cracks  of the stone  so hood with that inspiration of genius so common then among  sailors laid his seventyfour the centaur close alongside the  diamond made a hawser with a traveller on it fast to the ship and  to the top of the rock and in january 1804 got three long 24s and  two 18s hauled up far above his masthead by sailors who as they  hung like clusters appeared like mice hauling a little sausage   scarcely could we hear the governor on the top directing them with  his trumpet the centaur lying close under like a cocoanut shell  to which the hawsers are affixed 36  in this strange fortress  lieutenant james wilkie maurice let his name be recollected as one  of englands forgotten worthies was established with 120 men and  boys and ammunition provisions and water for four months and  the rock was borne on the books of the admiralty as his majestys  ship diamond rock and swept the seas with her guns till the 1st of  june 1805 when she had to surrender for want of powder to a  french squadron of two 74s a frigate a corvette a schooner and  eleven gunboats after killing and wounding some seventy men on the  rock alone and destroying three gunboats with a loss to herself of  two men killed and one wounded  remembering which story who will  blame the traveller if he takes off his hat to his majestys quondam  corvette as he sees for the first time its pink and yellow sides  shining in the sun above the sparkling seas over which it  domineered of old  you run onwards toward st lucia  across that  channel rodneys line of frigates watched for the expected  reinforcement of the french fleet  the first bay in st lucia is  gros islet and there is the gros islet itselfpigeon rock as the  english call itbehind which rodneys fleet lay waiting at anchor  while he himself sat on the top of the rock day after day spy glass in hand watching for the signals from his frigates that the  french fleet was on the move  and those glens and forests of st luciaover them and through them  sir john moore and sir ralph abercrombie fought week after week  month after month not merely against french soldiers but against  worse enemies brigands as the poor fellows were called negroes  liberated by the revolution of 1792  with their heads full and who  can blame them of the rights of man and the democratic teachings  of that valiant and able friend of robespierre victor hugues they  had destroyed their masters man woman and child horribly enough  and then helped to drive out of the island the invading english who  were already half destroyed not with fighting but with fever  and  now st lucia the faithful as the convention had named her was  swarming with fresh english and the remaining french and the  drilled negroes made a desperate stand in the earthworks of yonder  morne fortunee above the harbour and had to surrender with 100  guns and all their stores and then the poor black fellows who only  knew that they were free and intended to remain free took to the  bush and fed on the wild cushcush roots and the plunder of the  plantations manhunting murdering french and english alike and  being put to death in return whenever caught  gentle abercrombie  could not coax them into peace  stern moore could not shoot and  hang them into it and the brigand war dragged hideously on till  moorewho was nearly caught by them in a sixoared boat off the  pitons and had to row for his life to st vincent so saving  himself for the glory of corunnawas all but dead of fever and  colonel james drummond had to carry on the miserable work till the  whole armee francaise dans les bois laid down their rusty muskets  on the one condition that free they had been and free they should  remain  so they were formed into an english regiment and sent to  fight on the coast of africa and in more senses than one went to  their own place  then st lucia was ours till the peace of 1802  then french again under the good and wise nogues to be retaken by  us in 1803 once and for all  i tell this little story at some length as an instance of what  these islands have cost us in blood and treasure  i have heard it  regretted that we restored martinique to the french and kept st  lucia instead  but in so doing the british government acted at  least on the advice which rodney had given as early as the year  1778  st lucia he held would render martinique and the other  islands of little use in war owing to its windward situation and  its good harbours for from st lucia every other british island  might receive speedy succour  he advised that the little carenage  should be made a permanent naval station with dockyard and  fortifications and a town built there by government which would  in his opinion have become a metropolis for the other islands  and  indeed nature had done her part to make such a project easy of  accomplishment  but rodneys advice was not takenany more than  his advice to people the island by having a considerable quantity  of land in each parish allotted to tenacre men ie white yeomen  under penalty of forfeiting it to the crown should it be ever  converted to any other use than provision ground ie thrown into  sugar estates  this advice shows that rodneys genius though  with the prejudices of his time he supported not only slavery but  the slavetrade itself had perceived one of the most fatal  weaknesses of the slaveholding and sugargrowing system  and well  it would have been for st lucia if his advice had been taken  but  neither tenacre men nor dockyards were ever established in st  lucia  the mailsteamers if they need to go into dock have i am  ashamed to say to go to martinique where the french manage matters  better  the admirable carenage harbour is empty castries remains a  little town small dirty dilapidated and unwholesome and st  lucia itself is hardly to be called a colony but rather the nucleus  of a colony which may become hereafter by energy and good  government a rich and thicklypeopled garden up to the very  mountaintops  we went up 800 feet of steep hill to pay a visit on that morne  fortunee which moore and abercrombie took with terrible loss of  life in may 1796 and wondered at the courage and the tenacity of  purpose which could have contrived to invest and much more to  assault such a stronghold dragging the guns across ravines and up  the acclivities of the mountains and rocks and then attacking the  works only along one narrow neck of down which must be fat to this  day with english blood  all was peaceful enough now  the forts were crumbling the barracks  empty and the neat cottages smiling flower gardens smooth grass plats and gravelwalks which were once the pride of the citadel  replaced for the most part with guavascrub and sensitive plants   but nothing can destroy the beauty of the panorama  to the north  and east a wilderness of mountain peaks to the west the grand cul desac and the carenage mapped out in sheets of blue between high  promontories and beyond all the open sea  what a land  and in  what a climate  and all lying wellnigh as it has been since the  making of the world waiting for man to come and take possession   but there as elsewhere matters are mending steadily and in  another hundred years st lucia may be an honour to the english  race  we were of course anxious to obtain at st lucia specimens of that  abominable reptile the ferdelance or rattailed snake 38  which is the pest of this island as well as of the neighbouring  island of martinique and in pere labats time of lesser  martinique in the grenadines from which according to davy it  seems to have disappeared  it occurs also in guadaloupe  in great  martiniqueso the french sayit is dangerous to travel through  certain woodlands on account of the ferdelance who lies along a  bough and strikes without provocation at horse or man  i suspect  this statement however to be an exaggeration  i was assured that  this was not the case in st lucia that the snake attacks no  oftener than other venomous snakesthat is when trodden on or  when his retreat is cut off  at all events it seems easy enough to  kill him  so easy that i hope yet it may be possible to catch him  alive and that the zoological gardens may at last possesswhat  they have long coveted in vainhideous attraction of a live ferde lance  the specimens which we brought home are curious enough even  from this aesthetic point of view  why are these poisonous snakes  so repulsive in appearance some of them at least and that not in  proportion to their dangerous properties  for no one who puts the  mere dread out of his mind will call the cobras ugly even anything  but beautiful nor again the deadly coral snake of trinidad whose  beauty tempts children and even grown people to play with it or  make a necklace of it sometimes to their own destruction  but who  will call the puff adder of the cape or this very ferdelance  anything but ugly and horrible  not only from the brutality  signified to us at least by the flat triangular head and the heavy  jaw but by the look of malevolence and craft signified to us at  least by the eye and the lip  to us at least i say  for it is  an open question and will be one as long as the nominalist and the  realist schools of thought keep up their controversywhich they  will do to the worlds endwhether this seeming hideousness be a  real fact  whether we do not attribute to the snake the same  passions which we should expect to findand to abhorin a human  countenance of somewhat the same shape and then justify our  assumption to ourselves by the creatures bites which are actually  no more the result of craft and malevolence than the bite of a  frightened mouse or squirrel  i should be glad to believe that the  latter theory were the true one that nothing is created really  ugly that the ferdelance looks an hideous fiend the ocelot a  beautiful fiend merely because the outlines of the ocelot approach  more nearly to those which we consider beautiful in a human being   but i confess myself not yet convinced  there is a great deal of  human nature in man said the wise yankee and ones human nature  perhaps ones commonsense also will persist in considering beauty  and ugliness as absolute realities in spite of ones efforts to be  fair to the weighty arguments on the other side  these ferdelances be that as it may are a great pest in st  lucia  dr davy says that he was told by the lieutenantgovernor  that as many as thirty rattailed snakes were killed in clearing a  piece of land of no great extent near government house  i can  well believe this for about the same number were killed only two  years ago in clearing probably the same piece of ground which is  infested with that creeping pest of the west indies the wild guava bush from which guavajelly is made  the present lieutenant governor has offered a small reward for the head of every ferde lance killed  and the number brought in in the first month was so  large that i do not like to quote it merely from memory  certainly  it was high time to make a crusade against these unwelcome denizens   dr davy judging from a government report says that nineteen  persons were killed by them in one small parish in the year 1849  and the death though by no means certain is when it befalls a  hideous death enough  if any one wishes to know what it is like  let him read the tragedy which sir richard schomburgk tellswith  his usual brilliance and pathos for he is a poet as well as a man  of sciencein his travels in british guiana vol ii p 255how  the craspedocephalus coiled on a stone in the ford let fourteen  people walk over him without stirring or allowing himself to be  seen  and at last rose and missing schomburgk himself struck the  beautiful indian bride the liebling der ganzen gesellschaft and  how she died in her bridegrooms arms with horrors which i do not  record  strangely enough this snake so fatal to man has no power against  another west indian snake almost equally common namely the cribo  40  this brave animal closely connected with our common water snake is perfectly harmless and a welcome guest in west indian  houses because he clears them of rats  he is some six or eight  feet long black with more or less bright yellow about the tail and  under the stomach  he not only faces the ferdelance who is often  as big as he but kills and eats him  it was but last year i  think that the population of carenage turned out to see a fight in  a tree between a cribo and a ferdelance of about equal size  which after a two hours struggle ended in the cribo swallowing  the ferdelance head foremost  but when he had got his adversary  about onethird down the creolesjust as so many englishmen would  have doneseeing that all the sport was over rewarded the brave  cribo by killing both and preserving them as a curiosity in  spirits  how the ferdelance came into the antilles is a puzzle   the black american scorpionwhose bite is more dreaded by the  negroes than even the snakesmay have been easily brought by ship  in luggage or in cargo  but the ferdelance whose nearest home is  in guiana is not likely to have come on board ship  it is  difficult to believe that he travelled northward by land at the  epochif such a one there ever waswhen these islands were joined  to south america  for if so he would surely be found in st  vincent in grenada and most surely of all in trinidad  so far  from that being the case he will not live it is said in st  vincent  for so goes the story during the carib war of 179596  the savages imported ferdelances from st lucia or martinique and  turned them loose in hopes of their destroying the white men  but  they did not breed dwindled away and were soon extinct  it is  possible that they or their eggs came in floating timber from the  orinoco  but if so how is it that they have never been stranded on  the east coast of trinidad whither timber without end drifts from  that river  in a word i have no explanation whatsoever to give as  i am not minded to fall back on the medieval one that the devil  must have brought them thither to plague the inhabitants for their  sins  among all these beautiful islands st lucia is i think the most  beautiful not indeed on account of the size or form of its central  mass which is surpassed by that of several others but on account  of those two extraordinary mountains at its southwestern end  which while all conical hills in the french islands are called  pitons bear the name of the pitons par excellence  from most  elevated points in the island their twin peaks may be seen jutting  up over the other hills like according to irreverent english  sailors the tips of a donkeys ears  but as the steamer runs  southward along the shore these two peaks open out and you find  yourself in deep water close to the base of two obelisks rather  than mountains which rise sheer out of the sea one to the height  of 2710 the other to that of 2680 feet about a mile from each  other  between them is the loveliest little bay and behind them  green wooded slopes rise toward the rearward mountain of the  souffriere  the whole glitters clear and keen in blazing sunshine   but behind black depths of cloud and gray sheets of rain shroud all  the central highlands in mystery and sadness  beyond them without  a shore spreads open sea  but the fantastic grandeur of the place  cannot be described in words  the pencil of the artist must be  trusted  i can vouch that he has not in the least exaggerated the  slenderness and steepness of the rockmasses  one of them it is  said has never been climbed unless a myth which hangs about it is  true  certain english sailors probably of rodneys menand  numbering according to the pleasure of the narrator three hundred  thirty or threeare said to have warped themselves up it by lianes  and scrub but they found the rockledges garrisoned by an enemy  more terrible than any french  beneath the bites of the ferde lances and it may be beneath the blaze of the sun man after man  dropped and lay or rolled down the cliffs  a single survivor was  seen to reach the summit to wave the union jack in triumph over his  head and then to fall a corpse  so runs the tale which if not  true has yet its value as a token of what in those old days  english sailors were believed capable of daring and of doing  at the back of these two pitons is the souffriere probably the  remains of the old crater now fallen in and only 1000 feet above  the sea  a golden egg to the islanders were it but used in case  of war and any difficulty occurring in obtaining sulphur from  sicily a supply of the article to almost any amount might be  obtained from this and the other like solfaterras of the british  antilles they being so long as the natural distillation of the  substance continues active as at present inexhaustible  but to  work them profitably will require a little more commonsense than  the good folks of st lucia have as yet shown  in 1836 two  gentlemen of antigua 43a mr bennett and mr wood set up sulphur  works at the souffriere of st lucia and began prosperously enough  exporting 540 tons the first year  but in 1840 says mr breen  the sugargrowers took the alarm fearing it is to be presumed  that labour would be diverted from the caneestates and at their  instigation the legislative council imposed a tax of 16s sterling  on every ton of purified sulphur exported from the colony  the  consequence was that messrs bennett and wood after incurring a  heavy loss of time and treasure had to break up their establishment  and retire from the colony  one has heard of the man who killed  the goose to get the golden egg  in this case the goose to avoid  the trouble of laying seems to have killed the man  the next link in the chain as the steamer runs southward is st  vincent a single volcano peak like st kitts or the basse terre  of guadaloupe  very grand are the vast sheets probably of lava  covered with ash which pour down from between two rounded mountains  just above the town  rich with green canes they contrast strongly  with the brown ragged cliffs right and left of them and still more  with the awful depths beyond and above where underneath a canopy  of bright white clouds scowls a purple darkness of cliffs and  glens among which lies unseen the souffriere  in vain both going and coming by sunlight and again by moonlight  when the canefields gleamed white below and the hills were pitch black above did we try to catch a sight of this craterpeak  one  fact alone we ascertained that like all as far as i have seen of  the west indian volcanoes it does not terminate in an ashcone but  in ragged cliffs of blasted rock  the explosion of april 27 1812  must have been too violent and too short to allow of any  accumulation round the crater  and no wonder for that single  explosion relieved an interior pressure upon the crust of the earth  which had agitated sea and land from the azores to the west indian  islands the coasts of venezuela the cordillera of new grenada and  the valleys of the mississippi and ohio  for nearly two years the  earthquakes had continued when they culminated in one great  tragedy which should be read at length in the pages of humboldt  43b  on march 26 1812 when the people of caraccas were assembled  in the churches beneath a still and blazing sky one minute of  earthquake sufficed to bury amid the ruins of churches and houses  nearly 10000 souls  the same earthquake wrought terrible  destruction along the whole line of the northern cordilleras and  was felt even at santa fe de bogota and honda 180 leagues from  caraccas  but the end was not yet  while the wretched survivors of  caraccas were dying of fever and starvation and wandering inland to  escape from everrenewed earthquake shocks among villages and  farms which ruined like their own city could give them no  shelter the almost forgotten volcano of st vincent was muttering  in suppressed wrath  it had thrown out no lava since 1718 if at  least the eruption spoken of by moreau de jonnes took place in the  souffriere  according to him with a terrific earthquake clouds of  ashes were driven into the air with violent detonations from a  mountain situated at the eastern end of the island  when the  eruption had ceased it was found that the whole mountain had  disappeared  now there is no eastern end to st vincent nor any  mountain on the east coast  and the souffriere is at the northern  end  it is impossible meanwhile that the wreck of such a mountain  should not have left traces visible and notorious to this day  may  not the truth be that the souffriere had once a lofty cone which  was blasted away in 1718 leaving the present craterring of cliffs  and peaks and that thus may be explained the discrepancies in the  accounts of its height which mr scrope gives as 4940 feet and  humboldt and dr davy at 3000 a measurement which seems to me to be  more probably correct  the mountain is said to have been slightly  active in 1785  in 1812 its old crater had been for some years and  is now a deep blue lake with walls of rock around 800 feet in  height reminding one traveller of the lake of albano 44  but for  twelve months it had given warning by frequent earthquake shocks  that it had its part to play in the great subterranean battle  between rock and steam and on the 27th of april 1812 the battle  began  a negro boyhe is said to be still alive in st vincentwas  herding cattle on the mountainside  a stone fell near him and  then another  he fancied that other boys were pelting him from the  cliffs above and began throwing stones in return  but the stones  fell thicker  and among them one and then another too large to  have been thrown by human hand  and the poor little fellow woke up  to the fact that not a boy but the mountain was throwing stones at  him and that the column of black cloud which was rising from the  crater above was not harmless vapour but dust and ash and stone   he turned and ran for his life leaving the cattle to their fate  while the steam mitrailleuse of the titansto which all mans  engines of destruction are but popgunsroared on for three days  and nights covering the greater part of the island in ashes  burying crops breaking branches off the trees and spreading ruin  from which several estates never recovered and so the 30th of april  dawned in darkness which might be felt  meanwhile on that same day to change the scene of the campaign two  hundred and ten leagues a distance as humboldt says equal to  that between vesuvius and paris the inhabitants not only of  caraccas but of calabozo situate in the midst of the llanos over  a space of four thousand square leagues were terrified by a  subterranean noise which resembled frequent discharges of the  loudest cannon  it was accompanied by no shock  and what is very  remarkable was as loud on the coast as at eighty leagues distance  inland and at caraccas as well as at calabozo preparations were  made to put the place in defence against an enemy who seemed to be  advancing with heavy artillery  they might as well have copied the  st vincent herdboy and thrown their stones too at the titans  for the noise was there can be no doubt nothing else than the  final explosion in st vincent far away  the same explosion was  heard in venezuela the same at martinique and guadaloupe  but  there too there were no earthquake shocks  the volcanoes of the  two french islands lay quiet and left their english brother to do  the work  on the same day a stream of lava rushed down from the  mountain reached the sea in four hours and then all was over  the  earthquakes which had shaken for two years a sheet of the earths  surface larger than half europe were stilled by the eruption of this  single vent  no wonder if with such facts on my memory since my childhood i  looked up at that souffriere with awe as at a giant obedient  though clumsy beneficent though terrible reposing aloft among the  clouds when his appointed work was done  the strangest fact about this eruption was that the mountain did  not make use of its old crater  the original vent must have become  so jammed and consolidated in the few years between 1785 and 1812  that it could not be reopened even by a steamforce the vastness of  which may be guessed at from the vastness of the area which it had  shaken for two years  so when the eruption was over it was found  that the old craterlake incredible as it may seem remained  undisturbed as far as has been ascertained  but close to it and  separated only by a knifeedge of rock some 700 feet in height and  so narrow that as i was assured by one who had seen it it is  dangerous to crawl along it a second crater nearly as large as the  first had been blasted out the bottom of which in like manner is  now filled with water  i regretted much that i could not visit it   three points i longed to ascertain carefullythe relative heights  of the water in the two craters the height and nature of the spot  where the lava stream issued and lastly if possible the actual  causes of the locally famous rabacca or dry river one of the  largest streams in the island which was swallowed up during the  eruption at a short distance from its source leaving its bed an  arid gully to this day  but it could not be and i owe what little  i know of the summit of the souffriere principally to a most  intelligent and gentlemanlike young wesleyan minister whose name  has escaped me  he described vividly as we stood together on the  deck looking up at the volcano the awful beauty of the twin lakes  and of the clouds which for months together whirl in and out of  the cups in fantastic shapes before the eddies of the tradewind  the day after the explosion black sunday gave a proof of though  no measure of the enormous force which had been exerted  eighty  miles to windward lies barbadoes  all saturday a heavy cannonading  had been heard to the eastward  the english and french fleets were  surely engaged  the soldiers were called out the batteries manned   but the cannonade died away and all went to bed in wonder  on the  1st of may the clocks struck six  but the sun did not as usual in  the tropics answer to the call  the darkness was still intense  and grew more intense as the morning wore on  a slow and silent  rain of impalpable dust was falling over the whole island  the  negroes rushed shrieking into the streets  surely the last day was  come  the white folk caught and little blame to them the panic  and some began to pray who had not prayed for years  the pious and  the educated and there were plenty of both in barbadoes were not  proof against the infection  old letters describe the scene in the  churches that morning as hideousprayers sobs and cries in  stygian darkness from trembling crowds  and still the darkness  continued and the dust fell  i have a letter written by one long since dead who had at least  powers of description of no common order telling how when he tried  to go out of his house upon the east coast he could not find the  trees on his own lawn save by feeling for their stems  he stood  amazed not only in utter darkness but in utter silence  for the  tradewind had fallen dead the everlasting roar of the surf was  gone and the only noise was the crashing of branches snapped by  the weight of the clammy dust  he went in again and waited  about  one oclock the veil began to lift a lurid sunlight stared in from  the horizon  but all was black overhead  gradually the dustcloud  drifted away the island saw the sun once more and saw itself  inches deep in black and in this case fertilising dust  the  tradewind blew suddenly once more out of the clear east and the  surf roared again along the shore  meanwhile a heavy earthquakewave had struck part at least of the  shores of barbadoes  the gentleman on the east coast going out  found traces of the sea and boats and logs washed up some 10 to 20  feet above hightide mark  a convulsion which seems to have gone  unmarked during the general dismay  one man at least an old friend of john hunter sir joseph banks and  others their compeers was above the dismay and the superstitious  panic which accompanied it  finding it still dark when he rose to  dress he opened so the story used to run his window found it  stick and felt upon the sill a coat of soft powder  the volcano  in st vincent has broken out at last said the wise man and this  is the dust of it  so he quieted his household and his negroes  lighted his candles and went to his scientific books in that  delight mingled with an awe not the less deep because it is  rational and selfpossessed with which he like other men of  science looked at the wonders of this wondrous world  those who will recollect that barbadoes is eighty miles to windward  of st vincent and that a strong breeze from ene is usually  blowing from the former island to the latter will be able to  imagine not to measure the force of an explosion which must have  blown this dust several miles into the air above the region of the  tradewind whether into a totally calm stratum or into that still  higher one in which the heated southwest wind is hurrying  continually from the tropics toward the pole  as for the cessation  of the tradewind itself during the fall of the dust i leave the  fact to be explained by more learned men  the authority whom i have  quoted leaves no doubt in my mind as to the fact  on leaving st vincent the track lies past the grenadines  for  sixty miles long low islands of quaint forms and euphonious names becquia mustique canonau carriacou isle de rhonerise a few  hundred feet out of the unfathomable sea bare of wood edged with  cliffs and streaks of red and gray rock resembling says dr davy  the cyclades of the grecian archipelago  their number is counted at  three hundred  the largest of them all is not 8000 acres in extent  the smallest about 600  a quiet prosperous race of little yeomen  beside a few planters dwell there the latter feeding and exporting  much stock the former much provisions and both troubling  themselves less than of yore with sugar and cotton  they build  coasting vessels and trade with them to the larger islands and  they might be it is said if they chose much richer than they  areif that be any good to them  the steamer does not stop at any of these little seahermitages so  that we could only watch their shores  and they were worth  watching  they had been plainly seagnawn for countless ages and  may at some remote time have been all joined in one long ragged  chine of hills the highest about 1000 feet  they seem to be for  the most part made up of marls and limestones with trapdykes and  other igneous matters here and there  and one could not help  entertaining the fancy that they were a specimen of what the other  islands were once or at least would have been now had not each of  them had its volcanic vents to pile up hard lavas thousands of feet  aloft above the marine strata and so consolidate each ragged chine  of submerged mountain into one solid conical island like st  vincent at their northern end and at their southern end that  beautiful grenada to which we were fast approaching and which we  reached on our outward voyage at nightfall running in toward a  narrow gap of moonlit cliffs beyond which we could discern the  lights of a town  we did not enter the harbour  but lay close off  its gateway in safe deep water fired our gun and waited for the  swarm of negro boats which began to splash out to us through the  darkness the jabbering of their crews heard long before the flash  of their oars was seen  most weird and fantastic are these nightly visits to west indian  harbours  above the black mountaindepths with their canopy of  cloud bright white against the purple night hung with keen stars   the moon it may be on her back in the west sinking like a golden  goblet behind some rockfort half shrouded in black trees  below  a line of bright mist over a swamp with the cocopalms standing up  through it dark and yet glistering in the moon  a light here and  there in a house  another here and there in a vessel unseen in the  dark  the echo of the gun from hill to hill  wild voices from  shore and sea  the snorting of the steamer the rattling of the  chain through the hawsehole and on deck and under the quarter  strange gleams of red light amid pitchy darkness from engines  galley fires lanthorns and black folk and white folk flitting  restlessly across them  the strangest show  like a thing in a play says every one when  they see it for the first time  and when at the gunfire one  tumbles out of ones berth and up on deck to see the new island  one has need to rub ones eyes and pinch oneselfas i was minded  to do again and again during the next few weeksto make sure that  it is not all a dream  it is always worth the trouble meanwhile  to tumble up on deck not merely for the show but for the episodes  of west indian life and manners which quaint enough by day are  sure to be even more quaint at night in the confusion and bustle of  the darkness  one such i witnessed in that same harbour of grenada  not easily to be forgotten  a tall and very handsome middleaged brown woman in a limp print  gown and a gorgeous turban stood at the gangway in a glare of  light which made her look like some splendid witch by a walpurgis  nightfire  tell your boatman to go round to the other side  quoth the officer in charge  fanqua  francois  you go round oder side of de ship  fanqua who seemed to be her son being sleepy tipsy stupid or  lazy did not stir  fanqua  you hear what de officer say  you go round  no move  fanqua  you not ashamed of youself  you not hear de officer say  he turn a steampipe over you  no move  fanqua authoritative  fanqua indignant  fanqua argumentative  fanqua astonished  fanqua majestic  fanqua confidentially alluring  fanqua regretful  and so on through every conceivable tone of  expression  but fanqua did not move and the officer and bystanders laughed  she summoned all her talents and uttered one last fanqua which  was a triumph of art  shame and surprise were blended in her voice with tenderness and  pity and they again with meek despair  to have been betrayed  disgraced and so unexpectedly by one whom she loved and must love  still in spite of this his fearful fall  it was more than heart could bear  breathing his name but that once  more she stood a moment like a queen of tragedy one long arm  drawing her garments round her the other outstretched as if to  cast offhad she the heart to do itthe rebel and then stalked  away into the darkness of the paddleboxesfor ever and a day to  brood speechless over her great sorrow  not in the least  to begin  chattering away to her acquaintances as if no fanqua existed in the  world  it was a piece of admirable playacting and was meant to be  she  had been conscious all the while that she was an object of  attentionpossibly of admirationto a group of men and she knew  what was right to be done and said under the circumstances and did  it perfectly even to the smallest change of voice  she was  doubtless quite sincere the whole time and felt everything which  her voice expressed  but she felt it because it was proper to feel  it and deceived herself probably more than she deceived any one  about her  a curious phase of human nature is that same playacting effect studying temperament which ends if indulged in too much in  hopeless selfdeception and the hypocrisy which as mr carlyle  says is honestly indignant that you should think it hypocritical   it is common enough among negresses and among coloured people too   but is it so very uncommon among whites  is it not the bane of too  many irish of too many modern french of certain english for that  matter whom i have known who probably had no drop of french or  irish blood in their veins  but it is all the more baneful the  higher the organisation is because the more brilliant the  intellect the more noble the instincts the more able its victim is  to saysee  i feel what i ought i say what i ought i do what i  ought  and what more would you have  why do you philistines  persist in regarding me with distrust and ridicule  what is this  common honesty and what is this single eye which you suspect me  of not possessing  very beautiful was that harbour of george town seen by day  in the  centre an entrance some two hundred yards across  on the right a  cliff of volcanic sand interspersed with large boulders hurled from  some volcano now silent where black women with baskets on their  heads were filling a barge with gravel  on the left rocks of hard  lava surmounted by a welllined old fort strong enough in the days  of 32pounders  beyond it still on the left the little city  scrambling up the hillside with its red roofs and church spires  among coconut and breadfruit trees looking just like a german toy  town  in front at the bottom of the harbour villa over villa  garden over garden up to the large and handsome government house  one of the most delectable spots of all this delectable land and  piled above it green hill upon green hill which the eye soon  discovers are the sommas of old craters one inside the other  towards the central peak of mount maitland 1700 feet high  on the  right bow low sharp cliffpoints of volcanic ash and on the right  again a circular lake a quarter of a mile across and 40 feet in  depth with a coral reef almost awash stretching from it to the  ashcliff on the south side of the harbour mouth  a glance shows  that this is none other than an old crater like that inside english  harbour in antigua probably that which has hurled out the boulders  and the ash and one whose temper is still uncertain and to be  watched anxiously in earthquake times  the etang du vieux bourg is  its name for so tradition tells in the beginning of the  seventeenth century the old french town stood where the white coral reef gleams under water in fact upon the northern lip of the  crater  one day however the enceladus below turned over in his  sleep and the whole town was swallowed up or washed away  the  sole survivor was a certain blacksmith who thereupon was madeor  as sole survivor made himselfgovernor of the island of grenada   so runs the tale and so it seemed likely to run again during the  late earthquake at st thomass  for on the very same day and  before any earthquakewave from st thomass had reached grenadaif  any ever reached it which i could not clearly ascertainthis etang  du vieux bourg boiled up suddenly hurling masses of water into the  lower part of the town washing away a stage and doing much damage   the people were and with good reason in much anxiety for some  hours after  but the little fit of illtemper went off having  vented itself as is well known in the sea between st thomass and  santa cruz many miles away  the bottom of the crater i was assured was not permanently  altered  but the same informantan eyewitness on whom i can fully  dependshared the popular opinion that it had opened sucked in  seawater and spouted it out again  if so the good folks of  george town are quite right in holding that they had a very narrow  escape of utter destruction  an animated and picturesque spot as the steamer runs alongside is  the wooden wharf where passengers are to land and the ship to coal   the coaling negroes and negresses dressed or undressed in their  dingiest rags contrast with the country negresses in gaudy prints  and gaudier turbans who carry on their heads baskets of fruit even  more gaudy than their dresses  both country and town negroes  meanwhile lookas they are said to becomfortable and prosperous  and i can well believe the story that beggars are unknown in the  island  the coalers indeed are only too well off for they earn  enough by one day of violent and degrading toil to live in  reckless shiftless comfort and i am assured something very like  debauchery till the next steamer comes in  no sooner is the plank down than a struggling line getting on board  meets a struggling line getting on shore and it is well if the  passenger on landing is not besmirched with coaldust after a  narrow escape of being shoved into the sea off the stage  but  after all civility pays in grenada as in the rest of the world  and the negro like the frenchman though surly and rude enough if  treated with the least haughtiness will generally like the  frenchman melt at once at a touch of the hat and an appeal to  laissez passer mademoiselle  on shore we got through becoaled  negroes men and women safe and not very much becoaled ourselves  and were driven up steep streets of black porous lava between lava  houses and walls and past lava gardens in which jutted up  everywhere amid the loveliest vegetation black knots and lumps  scorched by the nether fires  the situation of the housethe  principal one of the islandto which we drove is beautiful beyond  description  it stands on a knoll some 300 feet in height  commanded only by a slight rise to the north and the wind of the  eastern mountains sweeps fresh and cool through a wide hall and  lofty rooms  outside a pleasureground and garden with the same  flowers as we plant out in summer at home and behind tier on tier  of green wooded hill with cottages and farms in the hollows might  have made us fancy ourselves for a moment in some charming country house in wales  but opposite the drawingroom window rose a  candelabra cereus thirty feet high  on the lawn in front great  shrubs of red frangipani carried rosecoloured flowers which filled  the air with fragrance at the end of thick and all but leafless  branches  trees hung over them with smooth greasy stems of bright  copperwhich has gained them the name of indian skin at least in  trinidad where we often saw them wild another glance showed us  that every tree and shrub around was different from those at home   and we recollected where we were and recollected too as we looked  at the wealth of flower and fruit and verdure that it was sharp  winter at home  we admired this and that  especially a most lovely  convolvulusi know not whether we have it in our hothouses 52a with purple maroon flowers and an old hogplum 52bmombin of the  frencha huge tree which was striking not so much from its size  as from its shape  growing among blocks of lava it had assumed the  exact shape of an english oak in a poor soil and exposed situation  globularheaded gnarled stunted and most unlike to its giant  brethren of the primeval woods which range upward 60 or 80 feet  without a branch  we walked up to see the old fort commanding the  harbour from a height of 800 feet  we sat and rested by the  roadside under a great cottonwood tree and looked down on gorges  of richest green on negro gardens and groogroo palms and here  and there a cabbagepalm or a huge tree at whose name we could not  guess then turned through an arch cut in the rock into the interior  of the fort which now holds neither guns nor soldiers to see at  our feet the triple harbour the steep town and a very paradise of  garden and orchard and then down again with the regretful thought  which haunted me throughout the islandswhat might the west indies  not have been by now had it not been for slavery rum and sugar  we got down to the steamer again just in time happily not to see  a great fight in the water between two negroes to watch which all  the women had stopped their work and cheered the combatants with  savage shouts and laughter  at last the coaling and the cursing  were over and we steamed out again to sea  i have antedated this little episodedelightful for more reasons  than i set down herebecause i do not wish to trouble my readers  with two descriptions of the same islandand those mere passing  glimpses  there are two craters i should say in grenada beside the harbour   one the grand etang lies high in the central group of mountains  which rise to 3700 feet and is itself about 1740 feet above the  sea  dr davy describes it as a lake of great beauty surrounded by  bamboos and treeferns  the other craterlake lies on the north east coast and nearer to the sealevel  and i more than suspect  that more would be recognised up and down the island by the eye of  a practised geologist  the southern end of grenadaof whatsoever rock it may be composed shows evidence of the same wavedestruction as do the grenadines   arches and stacks and low horizontal strata laid bare along the  cliff in some places white with guano prove that the sea has been  at work for ages which must be many and long considering that the  surf on that leeward side of the island is little or none the  whole year round  with these low cliffs in strongest contrast to  the stately and precipitous southern point of st lucia the  southern point of grenada slides into the sea the last of the true  antilles  for tobago robinson crusoes island which lies away  unseen to windward is seemingly a fragment of south america like  the island of trinidad to which the steamer now ran dead south for  seventy miles  it was on the shortest day of the yearst thomass dayat seven  in the morning halfpast eleven of english time just as the old  women at eversley would have been going round the parish for their  goodying that we became aware of the blue mountains of north  trinidad ahead of us to the west of them the island of the dragons  mouth and westward again a cloud among the clouds the last spur  of the cordilleras of the spanish main  there was south america at  last and as a witness that this too was no dream the blue water  of the windward islands changed suddenly into foul bottlegreen   the waters of the orinoco waters from the peaks of the andes far  away were staining the sea around us  with thoughts full of three  great names connected as long as civilised man shall remain with  those waterscolumbus raleigh humboldtwe steamed on to see  hills not standing out like those of the isles which we had  passed in intense clearness of green and yellow purple and blue  but all shrouded in haze like those of the hebrides or the west of  ireland  onward through a narrow channel in the mountainwall not  a rifleshot across which goes by the name of the apes mouth  banked by high cliffs of dark silurian rocknot bare though as in  britain but furred with timber festooned with lianes down to the  very spray of the gnawing surf  one little stack of rocks not  thirty feet high and as many broad stood almost in the midst of  the channel and in the very northern mouth of it exposed to the  full cut of surf and tradewind  but the plants on it even seen  through the glasses told us where we were  one huge low tree  covered the top with shining foliage like that of a portugal  laurel all around it upright cerei reared their gray candelabra  and below them hanging down the rock to the very surf deep green  nightblowing cereus twined and waved looking just like a curtain  of gigantic stagshorn moss  we ran through the channel then amid  more low wooded islands it may be for a mile before a strong back  current rushing in from the sea and then saw before us a vast plain  of muddy water  no shore was visible to the westward to the  eastward the northern hills of trinidad forest clad sank to the  water to the south lay a long line of coast generally level with  the waters edge and green with mangroves or dotted with coco palms  that was the gulf of paria and trinidad beyond  shipping at anchor and buildings along the flat shore marked port  of spain destined hereafter to stand not on the seaside but like  lynn in norfolk and other fenland towns in the midst of some of  the richest reclaimed alluvial in the world  as the steamer stopped at last her screw whirled up from the bottom  clouds of yellow mud the mingled deposits of the caroni and the  orinoco  in half an hour more we were on shore amid negroes  coolies chinese french spaniards shortlegged guaraon dogs and  black vultures    chapter iii  trinidad    it may be worth while to spend a few pages in telling something of  the history of this lovely island since the 31st of july 1499 when  columbus on his third voyage sighted the three hills in the south eastern part  he had determined it is said to name the first land  which he should see after the blessed trinity the triple peaks  seemed to him a heavensent confirmation of his intent and he named  the island trinidad but the indians called it iere  he ran from punta galera at the northeastern extremityso named  from the likeness of a certain rock to a galley under sailalong  the east and south of the island turned eastward at punta galeota  and then northward round punta icacque through the boca sierpe or  serpents mouth into the gulf of paria which he named golfo de  balena the gulf of the whale and golfo triste the sad gulf  and went out by the northern passage of the boca drago  the names  which he gave to the island and its surroundings remain with few  alterations to this day  he was surprised says washington irving at the verdure and  fertility of the country having expected to find it more parched  and sterile as he approached the equator whereas he beheld groves  of palmtrees and luxuriant forests sweeping down to the seaside  with fountains and running streams beneath the shade  the shore was  low and uninhabited  but the country rose in the interior and was  cultivated in many places and enlivened by hamlets and scattered  habitations  in a word the softness and purity of the climate and  the verdure freshness and sweetness of the country appeared to  equal the delights of early spring in the beautiful province of  valencia in spain  he found the island peopled by a race of indians with fairer  complexions than any he had hitherto seen people all of good  stature well made and of very graceful bearing with much and  smooth hair  they wore the chiefs at least tunics of coloured  cotton and on their heads beautiful worked handkerchiefs which  looked in the distance as if they were made of silk  the women  meanwhile according to the report of columbuss son seem some of  them at least to have gone utterly without clothing  they carried square bucklers the first columbus had seen in the new  world and bows and arrows with which they made feeble efforts to  drive off the spaniards who landed at punta arenal near icacque  and who finding no streams sank holes in the sand and so filled  their casks with fresh water as may be done it is said at the  same spot even now  and therethe source of endless misery to these happy harmless  creaturesa certain cacique so goes the tale took off columbuss  cap of crimson velvet and replaced it with a circle of gold which  he wore  alas for them  that fatal present of gold brought down on them  enemies far more ruthless than the caribs of the northern islands  who had a habit of coming down in their canoes and carrying off the  gentle arrawaks to eat them at their leisure after the fashion  which defoe always accurate has immortalised in robinson crusoe   crusoes island is almost certainly meant for tobago man friday  had been stolen in trinidad  columbus came no more to trinidad  but the spaniards had got into  their wicked heads that there must be gold somewhere in the island  and they came again and again  gold they could not get for it does  not exist in trinidad  but slaves they could get and the history  of the indians of trinidad for the next century is the same as that  of the rest of the west indies  a history of mere rapine and  cruelty  the arrawaks to do them justice defended themselves more  valiantly than the still gentler people of hayti cuba jamaica  porto rico and the lucayas  but not so valiantly as the fierce  cannibal caribs of the lesser antilles whom the spaniards were  never able to subdue  it was in 1595 nearly a century after columbus discovered the  island that sir robert duddeley in the bear with captain munck  in the beares whelpe with two small pinnesses called the frisking  and the earwig ran across from cape blanco in africa straight for  trinidad and anchored in cedros bay which he calls curiapan  inside punta icacque and los gallosa bay which was then as now  very full of pelicans  the existence of the island was known to  the english  but i am not aware that any englishman had explored  it  two years before an english ship whose exploits are written  in hakluyt by one henry may had run in probably to san fernando  to get refreshing but could not by reason the spaniards had taken  it  so that for want of victuals the company would have forsaken  the ship  how different might have been the history of trinidad  if at that early period while the indians were still powerful a  little colony of english had joined them and intermarried with  them  but it was not to be  the ship got away through the boca  drago  the year after seemingly captain whiddon raleighs  faithful follower lost eight men in the island in a spanish ambush   but duddeley was the first englishman as far as i am aware who  marched for his experience and pleasure four long marches through  the island the last fifty miles going and coming through a most  monstrous thicke wood for so is most part of the island and  lodging myself in indian townes  poor sir robertlarding the  lean earth as he stalked alongin ruff and trunk hose possibly  too in burning steel breastplate most probably along the old indian  path from san fernando past savannah grande and down the ortoire to  mayaro on the east coast  how hot he must have been  how often we  will hope he must have bathed on the journey in those crystal  brooks beneath the balisiers and the bamboos  he found a fine shaped and a gentle people all naked and painted red with  roucou their commanders wearing crowns of feathers and a  country fertile and full of fruits strange beasts and fowls  whereof munkeis babions and parats were in great abundance  his  munkeis were of course the little sapajous his babions no  true baboons for america disdains that degraded and doglike form  but the great red howlers  he was much delighted with the island  and inskonced himselfie built a fort  but he found the  spanish governor berreo not well pleased at his presence and no  gold in the island save marcasite iron pyrites considered that  berreo and his three hundred spaniards were both poore and strong  and so he had no reason to assault them  he had but fifty men  himself and moreover was tired of waiting in vain for sir walter  raleigh  so he sailed away northward on the 12th of march to  plunder spanish ships with his brains full of stories of el dorado  and the wonders of the orinocoamong them four golden halfmoons  weighing a noble each and two bracelets of silver which a boats  crew of his had picked up from the indians on the other side of the  gulf of paria  he left somewhat too soon  for on the 22d of march raleigh sailed  into cedros bay and then went up to la brea and the pitch lake   there he noted as columbus had done before him oysters growing on  the mangrove roots and noted too that abundance of stone pitch  that all the ships of the world might be therewith laden from  thence and we made trial of it in trimming our shippes to be most  excellent good and melteth not with the sun as the pitch of  norway  from thence he ran up the west coast to the mountain of  annaparima st fernando hill and passing the mouth of the  caroni anchored at what was then the village of port of spain  there some spaniards boarded him to buy linen and other things all  which he entertained kindly and feasted after our manner by means  whereof i learned as much of the estate of guiana as i could or as  they knew for those poore souldiers having been many years without  wine a few draughts made them merrie in which mood they vaunted of  guiana and the riches thereofmuch which it had been better for  raleigh had he never heard  meanwhile the indians came to him every night with lamentable  complaints of berreos cruelty  he had divided the island and  given to every soldier a part  he made the ancient caciques that  were lords of the court to be their slaves  he kept them in  chains he dropped their naked bodies with burning bacon and such  other torments which continues raleigh i found afterward to be  true  for in the city san josef when i entered it there were  five lords or little kings in one chain almost dead of famine  and wasted with torments  considering which considering berreos  treachery to whiddons men and considering also that as berreo  himself like raleigh was just about to cross the gulf to guiana in  search of el dorado and expected supplies from spain to leave a  garrison in my back interested in the same enterprise i should  have savoured very much of the asse  so raleigh fell upon the  corps du guard in the evening put them to the sword sent captain  caulfield with sixty soldiers onward following himself with forty  more up the caroni river which was then navigable by boats and  took the little town of san josef  it is not clear whether the corps du guard which he attacked was at  port of spain itself or at the little mud fort at the confluence of  the caroni and san josef rivers which was to be seen with some old  pieces of artillery in it in the memory of old men now living  but  that he came up past that fort through the then primeval forest  tradition reports and tells too how the prickly climbing palm  58 the crocchien or hookdog pest of the forests got its  present name upon that memorable day  for as the spanish soldiers  ran from the english one of them was caught in the innumerable  hooks of the crocchien and never looking behind him in his terror  began shouting suelta mi ingles  let me go englishmanor  as others have it valga mi ingles  take ransom for me  englishmanwhich name the palm bears unto this day  so raleigh having as one historian of trinidad says acted like a  tiger lest he should savour of the ass went his way to find el  dorado and be filled with the fruit of his own devices  and may  god have mercy on him and on all who like him spoil the noblest  instincts and the noblest plans for want of the single eye  but before he went he called all the caciques who were enemies to  the spaniard for there were some that berreo had brought out of  other countreys and planted there to eat out and waste those that  were natural of the place and by his indian interpreter that he  had brought out of england made them understand that he was the  servant of a queene who was the great cacique of the north and a  virgin and had more caciques under her than there were trees in  that island and that she was an enemy to the castellani in respect  of their tyranny and oppression and that she delivered all such  nations about her as were by them oppressed and having freed all  the northern world from their servitude had sent me to free them  also and withal to defend the country of guiana from their invasion  and conquest  i showed them her majestys picture doubtless in  ruff farthingale and stomacher laden with jewels which they so  admired and honoured as it had been easy to make them idolatrous  thereof  and so raleigh with berreo as prisoner hasted away toward his  proposed discovery leaving the poor indians of trinidad to be  eaten up by fresh inroads of the spaniards  there were in his time he says five nations of indians in the  islandjaios arwacas salvayos salivas nepoios and  round san josef carinepagotes and there were others he  confesses which he does not name  evil times were come upon them   two years after the indians at punta galera the northeast point  of the island told poor keymis that they intended to escape to  tobago when they could no longer keep trinidad though the caribs of  dominica were such evil neighbours to it that it was quite  uninhabited  their only fear was lest the spaniards worse  neighbours than even the caribs should follow them thither  but as raleigh and such as he went their way berreo and such as he  seem to have gone their way also  the conquistadores the  offscourings not only of spain but of south germany and indeed of  every roman catholic country in europe met the same fate as befell  if monk chroniclers are to be trusted the great majority of the  normans who fought at hastings  the bloodthirsty and deceitful men  did not live out half their days  by their own passions and by no  miraculous nemesis they civilised themselves off the face of the  earth and to them succeeded as to the conquerors at hastings a  nobler and gentler type of invaders  during the first half of the  seventeenth century spaniards of ancient blood and high  civilisation came to trinidad and resettled the island   especially the family of farfanfarfan de los godos once famous  in mediaeval chivalryif they will allow me the pleasure of for  once breaking a rule of mine and mentioning a namewho seem to  have inherited for some centuries the old blessings of psalm  xxxvii  put thou thy trust in the lord and be doing good dwell in the  land and verily thou shalt be fed  the lord knoweth the days of the godly  and their inheritance  shall endure for ever  they shall not be confounded in perilous times and in the days of  dearth they shall have enough  toward the end of the seventeenth century the indians summoned up  courage to revolt after a foolish ineffectual fashion  according  to tradition and an old romance muy doloroso which might have  been heard sung within the last hundred years the governor the  cabildo and the clergy went to witness an annual feast of the  indians at arena a sandy spot as its name signifies near the  central mountain of tamana  in the middle of one of their warlike  dances the indians at a given signal discharged a flight of  arrows which killed the governor all the priests and almost all  the rest of the whites  only a farfan escaped not without  suspicion of forewarning by the rebels  he may have been a merciful  man and just while considering the gentle nature of the indians it  is possible that some at least of their victims deserved their fate  and that the poor savages had wrongs to avenge which had become  intolerable  as for the murder of the priests we must remember  always that the inquisition was then in strength throughout spanish  america and could be if it chose aggressive and ruthless enough  by the end of the seventeenth century there were but fifteen  pueblos or indian towns in the island and the smallpox had made  fearful ravages among them  though they were not forced to work as  slaves a heavy capitation tax amounting over most of the island  to two dollars a head was laid on them almost to the end of the  last century  there seems to have been no reason in the nature of  things why they should not have kept up their numbers for the  island was still nineteentwentieths of it rich primeval forest   it may have been that they could not endure the confined life in the  pueblos or villages to which they were restricted by law  but  from some cause or other they died out and that before far  inferior numbers of invaders  in 1783 when the numbers of the  whites were only 126 of the free coloured 295 and of the slaves  310 the indians numbered only 2032  in 1798 after the great  immigration from the french west indies there were but 1082 indians  in the island  it is true that the white population had increased  meanwhile to 2151 the free coloured to 4476 and the slaves to  10000  but there was still room in plenty for 2000 indians   probably many of them had been absorbed by intermarriage with the  invaders  at present there is hardly an indian of certainly pure  blood in the island and that only in the northern mountains  trinidad ought to have been at least for those who were not  indians a happy place from the seventeenth almost to the nineteenth  century if it be true that happy is the people who have no history   certain dutchmen whether men of war or pirates is not known  attacked it some time toward the end of the seventeenth century  and trying to imitate raleigh were well beaten in the jungles  between the caroni and san josef  the indians it is said joined  the spaniards in the battle and the little town of san josef was  rewarded for its valour by being raised to the rank of a city by the  king of spain  the next important event which i find recorded is after the treaty  of 27th august 1701 between his most christian and his most  catholic majesty by which the royal company of guinea established  in france was allowed to supply the spanish colonies with 4800  negroes per annum for ten years of whom trinidad took some share  and used them in planting cacao  so much the worse for it  next captain teach better known as blackboard made his  appearance about 1716 off port of spain plundered and burnt a brig  laden with cacao and when a spanish frigate came in and cautiously  cannonaded him at a distance sailed leisurely out of the boca  grande  little would any spanish guarda costa trouble the soul of  the valiant captain teach with his six pistols slung in bandoliers  down his breast lighted matches stuck underneath the brim of his  hat and his famous black beard the terror of all merchant captains  from trinidad to guinea river twisted into tails and tied up with  ribbons behind his ears  how he behaved himself for some years as a  ferocious human pig like ignatius loyola before his conversion  with the one virtue of courage how he would blow out the candle in  the cabin and fire at random into his crew on the ground that if  he did not kill one of them now and then they would forget who he  was how he would shut down the hatches and fill the ship with the  smoke of brimstone and what not to see how long he and his could  endure a certain placeto which they are some of them but too  probably gone how he has buried his money or said that he had  where none but he and satan could find it and the longest liver  should take all how out of some such tradition edgar poe built  up the wonderful tale of the gold bug how the planters of certain  southern states and even the governor of north carolina paid him  blackmail and received blackmail from him likewise and lastly how  he met a man as brave as he but with a clear conscience and a clear  sense of duty in the person of mr robert maynard first lieutenant  of the pearl who found him after endless difficulties and fought  him handtohand in oberecock river in virginia the lieutenant  and twelve men against blackbeard and fourteen till the sea was  tinctured with blood around the vessel and how maynard sailed into  bathtown with the gory head black beard and all hung at his  jibboom end all this is writtenin the books in which it is  written which need not be read now however sensational by the  british public  the next important event which i find recorded in the annals of  trinidad is that in 1725 the cacao crop failed  some perhaps would  have attributed the phenomenon to a comet like that sir william  beeston who writing in 1664 saysabout this time appeared first  the comet which was the forerunner of the blasting of the cacao trees when they generally failed in jamaica cuba and hispaniola   but no comet seems to have appeared in 1725 whereon to lay the  blame and therefore father gumilla the jesuit may have been  excused for saying that the failure of the trees was owing to the  planters not paying their tithes and for fortifying his statement  by the fact that one planter alone named rabelo who paid his  tithes duly saved his trees and his crop  the wicked according to dauxion lavaysse a frenchman inoculated  somewhat with scientific and revolutionary notions who wrote a very  clever book unfortunately very rare now said that the trinidad  cacao was then as now very excellent that therefore it was sold  before it was gathered and that thus the planters were able to  evade the payment of tithes  but senor rabelo had planted another  variety called forestero from the brazils which was at once of  hardier habit inferior quality and slower ripening  hence his  trees withstood the blight  but en revanche hence also merchants  would not buy his crop before it was picked  thus his duty became  his necessity and he could not help paying his tithes  be that as it may the good folk of trinidad and to judge from  their descendants there must have been good folk among them grew  from the failure of the cacao plantations exceeding poor so that  in 1733 they had to call a meeting at san josef in order to tax the  inhabitants according to their means toward thatching the cabildo  hall with palmleaves  nay so poor did they become that in 1740  the year after the smallpox had again devastated the island and the  very monkeys had died of itas the hapless creatures died of  cholera in hundreds a few years since and of yellow fever the year  before last sensibly diminishing their numbers near the townslet  the conceit of human nature wince under the fact as it will it  cannot wince from under the factin 1740 i say the war between  spain and englandthat about jenkinss earforced them to send a  curious petition to his majesty of spain and to askwould he be  pleased to commiserate their situation  the failure of the cacao  had reduced them to such a state of destitution that they could not  go to mass save once a year to fulfil their annual precepts when  they appeared in clothes borrowed from each other  nay it is said by those who should know best that in those days  the whole august body of the cabildo had but one pair of small clothes which did duty among all the members  let no one be shocked  the smallclothes desiderated would have  been of black satin probably embroidered and fit though somewhat  threadbare for the thigh of a magistrate and gentleman of spain   but he would not have gone on ordinary days in a sansculottic state   he would have worn that most comfortable of loose nether garments  which may be seen on sailors in prints of the great war and which  came in again a while among the cunningest highland sportsmen  namely slops  let no one laugh either at least in contempt as  the average british philistine will think himself bound to do at  the fact that these men had not only no balance at their bankers  but no bankers with whom to have a balance  no men are more capable  of supporting poverty with content and dignity than the spaniards of  the old school  for none are more perfect gentlemen or more free  from the base modern belief that money makes the man and i doubt  not that a member of the old cabildo of san josef in slops was far  better company than an average british philistine in trousers  so slumbered on only awakening to an occasional gentle revolt  against their priests or the governor sent to them from the spanish  court the good spaniards of trinidad till the peace of 1783 woke  them up and they found themselves suddenly in a new and an  unpleasantly lively world  rodneys victories had crippled spain utterly and crippled too  the french west indian islands though not france itself  but the  shrewd eye of a m rome de st laurent had already seen in trinidad  a mine of wealth which might set up again not the spanish west  indians merely but those of the french west indians who had  exhausted as they fancied by bad cultivation the soils of  guadaloupe martinique and st lucia  he laid before the intendant  at caraccas on whom trinidad then depended a scheme of  colonisation which was accepted and carried out in 1783 by a man  who as far as i can discover possessed in a preeminent degree  that instinct of ruling justly wisely gently and firmly which is  just as rare in this age as it was under the ancien regime  don  josef maria chacon was his namea man it would seem like poor  kaiser joseph of austria born before his time  among his many  honourable deeds let this one at least be remembered that he  turned out of trinidad the last inquisitor who ever entered it  foreigners who must be roman catholics though on this point chacon  was as liberal as public opinion allowed him to be were invited to  settle on grants of crown land  each white person of either sex was  to have some thirtytwo acres and half that quantity for every  slave that he should bring  free people of colour were to have half  the quantity and a long list of conditions was annexed which  considering that they were tainted with the original sin of slave holding seem wise and just enough  two articles especially  prevented as far as possible absenteeism  settlers who retired  from the island might take away their property but they must pay  ten per cent on all which they had accumulated and their lands  reverted to the crown  similarly if the heirs of a deceased  settler should not reside in the colony fifteen per cent was to be  levied on the inheritance  well had it been for every west indian  island british or other if similar laws had been in force in them  for the last hundred years  so into trinidad poured for good and evil a mixed population  principally french to the number of some 12000 till within a year  or two the island was spanish only in name  the old spaniards who  held many of them large sheets of the forests which they had never  cleared had to give them up with grumblings and heartburnings to  the newcomers  the boundaries of these lands were uncertain  the  island had never been surveyed  and no wonder  the survey has been  only completed during the last few years and it is a mystery to  the nonscientific eye how it has ever got done  one can well  believe the story of the northern engineer who when brought over to  plan out a railroad shook his head at the first sight of the high  woods  at home quoth he one works outside ones work  here  one works inside it  considering the density of the forests one  may as easily take a general sketch of a room from underneath the  carpet as of trinidad from the ground  however thanks to the  energy of a few gentlemen who found occasional holes in the carpet  through which they could peep the survey of trinidad is now about  complete  but in those days ignorance of the island as well as the battle  between old and new interests brought lawsuits and all but civil  war  many of the french settlers were no better than they should  be many had debts in other islands many of the negroes had been  sent thither because they were too great ruffians to be allowed at  home and what was worse the premium of sixteen acres of land for  every slave imported called up a system of stealing slaves and  sometimes even free coloured people from other islands especially  from grenada by means of artful negroes and mulatto slaves who  were sent over as crimps  i shall not record the words in which  certain old spaniards describe the new population of trinidad ninety  years ago  they of course saw everything in the blackest light  and the colony has long since weeded and settled itself under a  course of good government  but poor don josef maria chacon must  have had a hard time of it while he tried to break into something  like order such a motley crew  he never broke them in poor man  for just as matters were  beginning to right themselves the french revolution broke out and  every french west indian island burst into flamephysical alas  as well as moral  then hurried into trinidad to make confusion  worse confounded french royalist families escaping from the  horrors in hayti and brought with them it is said many still  faithful houseslaves born on their estates  but the republican  french being nearly ten to one were practical masters of the  island and don chacon whenever he did anything unpopular had to  submit to manifestations with tricolour flag marseillaise and  ca ira about the streets of port of spain and to be privately  informed by admiral artizabal that a guillotine was getting ready to  cut off the heads of all loyal spaniards french and british  this  may have been an exaggeration  but wild deeds were possible enough  in those wild days  artizabal the story goes threatened to hang a  certain ringleader name not given at his yardarm  chacon begged  the mans life and the fellow was spared to become the persecutor  of his preserver even to banishment and death from a broken  heart 65  at last the explosion came  the english sloop zebra was sent down  into the gulf of paria to clear it of french privateers manned by  the defeated maroons and brigands of the french islands who were  paying respect to no flag but pirating indiscriminately  chacon  confessed himself glad enough to have them exterminated  he himself  could not protect his own trade  but the neutrality of the island  must be respected  skinner the zebras captain sailed away  towards the boca and found to his grim delight that the  privateers had mistaken him for a certain english merchantman whom  they had blockaded in port of spain and were giving him chase  he  let them come up and try to board and what followed may be easily  guessed  in threequarters of an hour they were all burnt sunk or  driven on shore the remnant of their crews escaped to port of  spain to join the french republicans and vow vengeance  then in a hapless hour captain vaughan came into port of spain in  the alarm frigate  his intention was of course to protect the  british and spanish  they received him with open arms  but the  privateers men attacked a boats crew of the alarm were beaten  raised a riot and attacked a welsh ladys house where english  officers were at a party after which with pistol shots and  climbing over back walls the english by help of a few spanish  gentlemen escaped leaving behind them their surgeon severely  wounded  next morning at sunrise almost the whole of the frigates crew  landed in port of spain fully armed with captain vaughan at their  head the hot welsh blood boiling in him  he unfurled the british  flag and marched into the town to take vengeance on the mob  a  spanish officer with two or three men came forward  what did a  british captain mean by violating the law of nations  vaughan would  chastise the rascally french who had attacked his men  then he must  either kill the spaniard or take him prisoner  and the officer  tendered his sword  i will not accept the arms of a brave man who is doing his duty  quoth poor overvaliant vaughan and put him aside  the hot welsh  blood was nevertheless the blood of a gentleman  they struck up  britons strike home and marched on  the british and spanish  came out to entreat him  if a fight began they would be all  massacred  still he marched on  the french with three or four  thousand slaves armed and mounting the tricolour cockade were  awaiting them seemingly on the savannah north of the town  chacon  was at his wits end  he had but eighty soldiers who said openly  they would not fire on the english but on the french  but the  english were but 240 and the french twelve times that number  by  deft cutting through cross streets chacon got between the two bodies  of madmen and pleaded the indignity to spain and the violation of  neutral ground  the english must fight him before they fought the  french  they would beat him  but as soon as the first shot was  fired the french would attack them likewise and both parties alike  would be massacred in the streets  the hot welsh blood cooled down before reason and courage  vaughan  saluted chacon and marched back hooted by the republicans who  nevertheless kept at a safe distance  the french hunted every  english and irish person out of the town some escaping barely with  their lives  only one man however was killed and he poor  faithful slave was an english negro  vaughan saw that he had done wrong that he had possibly provoked a  war and made for his error the most terrible reparation which man  can make  his fears were not without foundation  his conduct formed the  principal count in the list of petty complaints against england on  the strength of which five months after in october 1796 spain  declared war against england and in conjunction with france and  holland determined once more to dispute the empire of the seas  the moment was well chosen  england looked to those who did not  know her pluck to have sunk very low  franco was rising fast and  buonaparte had just begun his italian victories  so the spanish  courtor at least godoy prince of peacesought to make profit  out of the french republic  about the first profit which it made  was the battle of st vincent about the second the loss of  trinidad  on february 14 while jervis and nelson were fighting off cape st  vincent harvey and abercrombie came into carriacou in the  grenadines with a gallant armada seven ships of the line thirteen  other menofwar and nigh 8000 men including 1500 german jagers  on board  on the 16th they were struggling with currents of the bocas piloted  by a mandingo negro alfred sharper who died in 1836 105 years of  age  the lineofbattle ships anchored in the magnificent land locked harbour of chaguaramas just inside the boca de monos  the  frigates and transports went up within five miles of port of spain  poor chacon had to oppose this great armament 5000 spanish troops  300 of them just recovering from yellow fever a few old spanish  militia who loved the english better than the french and what  republican volunteers he could get together  they of course  clamoured for arms and demanded to be led against the enemy as to  this day forgetting as to this day that all the fiery valour of  frenchmen is of no avail without officers and without respect for  those officers  beside them there lay under a little fort on  gaspar grande island in chaguaramas harbourah what a paradise to  be denied by warfour spanish lineofbattle ships and a frigate   their admiral apodaca was a foolish old devotee  their crews  numbered 1600 men 400 of whom were in hospital with yellow fever  and many only convalescent  the terrible victor hugues it is said  offered a band of republican sympathisers from guadaloupe  but  chacon had no mind to take that trojan horse within his fortress   we have too many lawless republicans here already  should the king  send me aid i will do my duty to preserve his colony for the crown   if not it must fall into the hands of the english whom i believe  to be generous enemies and more to be trusted than treacherous  friends  what was to be done  perhaps only that which was done  apodaca set  fire to his ships either in honest despair or by orders from the  prince of peace  at least he would not let them fall into english  hands  at three in the morning port of spain woke up all aglare  with the blaze six miles away to the northwest  negroes ran and  shrieked carrying this and that up and down upon their heads   spaniards looked out aghast  frenchmen cried aux armes and  sang the marseillaise  and still over the five islands rose the  glare  but the night was calm the ships burnt slowly and the san  damaso was saved by english sailors  so goes the tale which if it  be as i believe correct ought to be known to those adventurous  yankees who have talked more than once of setting up a company to  recover the spanish ships and treasure sunk in chaguaramas  for the  ships burned before they sunk and apodaca being a prudent man  landed or is said to have landed all the treasure on the spanish  main opposite  he met chacon in port of spain at daybreak  the good governor they  say wept but did not reproach  the admiral crossed himself and  when chacon said all is lost answered or did not answer for the  story like most good stories is said not to be quite true not  all i saved the image of st jago de compostella my patron and my  ships  his ships patron however says m joseph was st  vincent  why tell the rest of the story  it may well be guessed   the english landed in force  the french republicans how does  history repeat itself broke open the arsenal overpowering the  spanish guard seized some 3000 to 5000 stand of arms and then  never used them but retired into the woods  they had many of  them fought like tigers in other islands some it may be under  victor hugues himself  but here they had no leaders  the spanish  overpowered by numbers fell back across the dry river to the east  of the town and got on a height  the german jagers climbed the  beautiful laventille hills and commanded the spanish and the two  paltry mud forts on the slopes  and all was over happily with  almost no loss of life  chacon was received by abercrombie and harvey with every courtesy a  capitulation was signed which secured the honours of war to the  military and law and safety to the civil inhabitants and chacon  was sent home to spain to be tried by a courtmartial honourably  acquitted and then by french republican intrigues calumniated  memorialised against subscribed against and hunted buonaparte  having with his usual meanness a hand in the persecution into  exile and penury in portugal  at last his case was heard a second  time and tardy justice done not by popular clamour but by fair  and deliberate law  his nephew set out to bring the good man home  in triumph  he found him dying in a wretched portuguese inn   chacon heard that his honour was cleared at last and so gave up the  ghost  thus endedas earths best men have too often endedthe good don  alonzo chacon  his only monument in the island is one after all  aere perennius namely that most beautiful flowering shrub which  bears his name warsewiczia some call it others calycophyllum   but the botanists of the island continue loyally the name of  chaconia to those blazing crimson spikes which every christmastide  renew throughout the wild forests of which he would have made a  civilised garden the memory of the last and best of the spanish  governors  so trinidad became english and picton ruled it for a while with a  rod of iron  i shall not be foolish enough to enter here into the merits or  demerits of the picton case which once made such a noise in  england  his enemies side of the story will be found in mcallums  travels in trinidad his friends side in robinsons life of picton  two books each of which will seem i think to him who will read  them alternately rather less wise than the other  but those who  may choose to read the two books must remember that questions of  this sort have not two sides merely but more being not  superficies but solids and that the most important side is that on  which the question stands namely its bottom which is just the  side which neither party liked to be turned up because under it at  least in the west indies all the beetles and cockroaches  centipedes and scorpions are nestled away out of sight  and there  as long since decayed they or their exuviae and dead bodies may  remain  the good people of trinidad have long since agreed to let  bygones be bygones and it speaks well for the commonsense and good  feeling of the islanders as well as for the mildness and justice of  british rule that in two generations such a community as that of  modern trinidad should have formed itself out of materials so  discordant  that british rule has been a solid blessing to  trinidad all honest folk know well  even in pictons time the  population increased in six years from 17700 to 28400 in 1851  it was 69600 and it is now far larger  but trinidad has gained by becoming english more than mere  numbers  had it continued spanish it would probably be like cuba  a slaveholding and slavetrading island now wealthy luxurious  profligate and port of spain would be such another wen upon the  face of gods earth as that magnificent abomination the city of  havanna  or as an almost more ugly alternative it might have  played its part in that great triumph of bliss by act of parliament  which set mankind to rights for ever when mr canning did the  universe the honour of calling the new world into existence to  redress the balance of the old  it might have beenprobably would  have beenconquered by a band of sympathisers from the  neighbouring republic of venezuela and have been called into  existence by the massacre of the respectable folk the expulsion of  capital and the establishment with a pronunciamento and a  revolution every few years of a republic such as those of spanish  america combining every vice of civilisation with every vice of  savagery  from that fate as every honest man in trinidad knows  well england has saved the island and therefore every honest man  in trinidad is loyal with occasional grumblings of course as is  the right of freeborn britons at home and abroad to the british  flag    chapter iv  port of spain    the first thing notable on landing in port of spain at the low quay  which has been just reclaimed from the mud of the gulf is the  multitude of people who are doing nothing  it is not that they have  taken an hours holiday to see the packet come in  you will find  them or their brown duplicates in the same places tomorrow and  next day  they stand idle in the marketplace not because they have  not been hired but because they do not want to be hired being able  to live like the lazzaroni of naples on midshipmans halfpay nothing a day and find yourself  you are told that there are 8000  human beings in port of spain alone without visible means of  subsistence and you congratulate port of spain on being such an  elysium that people can live therenot without eating for every  child and most women you pass are eating something or other all day  longbut without working  the fact is that though they will eat  as much and more than a european if they can get it they can do  well without food and feed as do the lazzaroni on mere heat and  light  the best substitute for a dinner is a sleep under a south  wall in the blazing sun and there are plenty of south walls in port  of spain  in the french islands i am told such lazzaroni are  caught up and set to government work as strong rogues and  masterless men after the ancient english fashion  but is such a  course fair  if a poor man neither steals begs nor rebels and  these people do not do the two latter has he not as much right to  be idle as a rich man  to say that neither has a right to be idle  is of course sheer socialism and a heresy not to be tolerated  next the stranger will remark here as at grenada that every one  he passes looks strong healthy and wellfed  one meets few or  none of those figures and faces small scrofulous squinny and  haggard which disgrace the socalled civilisation of a british  city  nowhere in port of spain will you see such human beings as in  certain streets of london liverpool or glasgow  every one  plainly can live and thrive if they choose and very pleasant it is  to know that  the road leads on past the customhouse and past i am sorry to  say evil smells which are too common still in port of spain  though fresh water is laid on from the mountains  i have no wish to  complain especially on first landing of these kind and hospitable  citizens  but as long as port of spainthe suburbs especially smells as it does after sundown every evening so long will an  occasional outbreak of cholera or yellow fever hint that there are  laws of cleanliness and decency which are both able and ready to  avenge themselves  you cross the pretty marine square with its  fountain and flowering trees and beyond them on the right the roman  catholic cathedral a stately building with palmistes standing as  tall sentries round soon you go up a straight street with a  glimpse of a large english church which must have been still more  handsome than now before its tall steeple was shaken down by an  earthquake  the then authorities i have been told applied to the  colonial office for money to rebuild it  but the request was  refused on the ground it may be presumed that whatever ills  downing street might have inflicted on the west indies it had not  as yet gone so far as to play the part of poseidon ennosigaeus  next comes a glimpse too of largeeven too largegovernment  buildings brickbuilt pretentious without beauty of form  but  however ugly in itself a building may be in trinidad it is certain  at least after a few years to look beautiful because embowered  among noble flowering timber trees like those that fill brunswick  square and surround the great church on its south side  under cool porticoes and through tall doorways are seen dark  stores filled with all manner of good things from britain or from  the united states  these olderfashioned houses built i presume  on the spanish model are not without a certain stateliness from  the depth and breadth of their chiaroscuro  their doors and windows  reach almost to the ceiling and ought to be plain proofs in the  eyes of certain discoverers of the giant cities of bashan that  the old spanish and french colonists were nine or ten feet high  apiece  on the doorsteps sit negresses in gaudy print dresses with  stiff turbans which are according to this years fashion of  chocolate and yellow silk plaid painted with thick yellow paint  and cost in all some four dollars all aiding in the general work  of doing nothing  save where here and there a hugely fat negress  possibly with her head tied across in a white turban sign of  mourning sells or tries to sell abominable sweetmeats strange  fruits and junks of sugarcane to be gnawed by the dawdlers in  midstreet while they carry on their heads everything and anything  from half a barrowload of yams to a saucer or a beerbottle  we  never however saw as tom cringle did a negro carrying a burden  on his chin  i fear that a stranger would feel a shockand that not a slight  oneat the first sight of the average negro women of port of spain  especially the younger  their masculine figures their ungainly  gestures their loud and sudden laughter even when walking alone  and their general coarseness shocks and must shock  it must be  remembered that this is a seaport town and one in which the licence  usual in such places on both sides of the atlantic is aggravated by  the superabundant animal vigour and the perfect independence of the  younger women  it is a painful subject  i shall touch it in these  pages as seldom and as lightly as i can  there is i verily  believe a large class of negresses in port of spain and in the  country both catholic and protestant who try their best to be  respectable after their standard  but unfortunately here as  elsewhere over the world the scum rises naturally to the top and  intrudes itself on the eye  the men are civil fellows enough if  you will as in duty bound be civil to them  if you are not ugly  capacities will flash out fast enough and too fast  if any one  says of the negro as of the russian he is but a savage polished  over  you have only to scratch him and the barbarian shows  underneath the only answer to be made isthen do not scratch him   it will be better for you and for him  when you have ceased lookingeven staringat the black women and  their ways you become aware of the strange variety of races which  people the city  here passes an old coolie hindoo with nothing on  but his lungee round his loins and a scarf over his head a white bearded delicatefeatured old gentleman with probably some caste mark of red paint on his forehead his thin limbs and small hands  and feet contrasting strangely with the brawny negroes round   there comes a brighteyed young lady probably his daughterinlaw  hung all over with bangles in a white muslin petticoat crimson  cottonvelvet jacket and green gauze veil with her naked brown  baby astride on her hip  a clever smiling delicate little woman  who is quite aware of the brightness of her own eyes  and who are  these three boys in dark blue coatees and trousers one of whom  carries hanging at one end of a long bamboo a couple of sweet  potatoes at the other possibly a pebble to balance them  as they  approach their doleful visage betrays them  chinese they are  without a doubt  but whether old or young men or women you cannot  tell till the initiated point out that the women have chignons and  no hats the men hats with their pigtails coiled up under them   beyond this distinction i know none visible  certainly none in  those sad visagesoffas non facies as old ammianus marcellinus  has it  but why do chinese never smile  why do they look as if some one had  sat upon their noses as soon as they were born and they had been  weeping bitterly over the calamity ever since  they too must have  their moments of relaxation  but when  once and once only in  port of spain we saw a chinese woman nursing her baby burst into  an audible laugh  and we looked at each other as much astonished  as if our horses had begun to talk  there again is a group of coloured men of all ranks talking  eagerly business or even politics some of them as well dressed as  if they were fresh from europe some of them too six feet high  and broad in proportion as fine a race physically as one would  wish to look upon and with no want of shrewdness either or  determination in their faces  a race who ought if they will be  wise and virtuous to have before them a great future  here come  home from the convent school two coloured young ladies probably  pretty possibly lovely certainly gentle modest and welldressed  according to the fashions of paris or new york and here comes the  unmistakable englishman tall fair closeshaven arminarm with  another man whose more delicate features more sallow complexion  and little moustache mark him as some frenchman or spaniard of old  family  both are dressed as if they were going to walk up pall mall  or the rue de rivoli for gotomeeting clothes are somewhat too  much de rigueur here a shootingjacket and wideawake betrays the  newlylanded englishman  both take off their hats with a grand air  to a lady in a carriage for they are very fine gentlemen indeed  and intend to remain such  and well that is for the civilisation of  the island for it is from such men as these and from their  families that the good manners for which west indians are or ought  to be famous have permeated down slowly but surely through all  classes of society save the very lowest  the straight and level street swarming with dogs vultures  chickens and goats passes now out of the old into the newer part  of the city and the type of the houses changes at once  some are  mere wooden sheds of one or two rooms comfortable enough in that  climate where a sleepingplace is all that is neededif the  occupiers would but keep them clean  other houses wooden too  belong to welltodo folk  over high walls you catch sight of  jalousies and verandahs inside which must be most delightful  darkness and coolness  indeed one cannot fancy more pleasant nests  than some of the little gailypainted wooden houses standing on  stilts to let the air under the floors and all embowered in trees  and flowers which line the roads in the suburbs and which are  inhabited we are told by people engaged in business  but what wouldor at least ought tostrike the newcomers eye with  most pleasurable surprise and make him realise into what a new  world he has been suddenly translatedeven more than the negroes  and the black vultures sitting on roofridges or stalking about in  midstreetare the flowers which show over the walls on each side  of the street  in that little garden not thirty feet broad what  treasures there are  a tall palmwhether palmiste or oilpalmhas  its smooth trunk hung all over with orchids tied on with wire   close to it stands a purple dracaena such as are put on english  dinnertables in pots  but this one is twenty feet high and next  to it is that strange tree the clavija of which the creoles are  justly fond  a single straight stem fifteen feet high carries  huge oblongleaves atop and beneath them growing out of the stem  itself delicate panicles of little white flowers fragrant  exceedingly  a double blue pea 74 and a purple bignonia are  scrambling over shrubs and walls  and what is this which hangs over  into the road some fifteen feet in heightlong bare curving  sticks carrying each at its end a flat blaze of scarlet  what but  the poinsettia paltry scions of which like the dracaena adorn our  hothouses and dinnertables  the street is on fire with it all the  way up now in midwinter while at the street end opens out a green  park fringed with noble trees all in full leaf underneath them  more pleasant little suburban villas and behind all again a  background of steep wooded mountain a thousand feet in height  that  is the savannah the public park and raceground such as neither  london nor paris can boast  one may be allowed to regret that the exuberant loyalty of the  citizens of port of spain has somewhat defaced one end at least of  their savannah for in expectation of a visit from the duke of  edinburgh they erected for his reception a pile of brick of which  the best that can be said is that it holds a really large and  stately ballroom and the best that can be hoped is that the  authorities will hide it as quickly as possible with a ring of  palmistes casuarinas sandboxes and every quickgrowing tree   meanwhile as his royal highness did not come the citizens wisely  thought that they might as well enjoy their new building themselves   so there on set high days the governor and the lady of the  governor hold their court  there when the squadron comes in  officers in uniform dance at desperate sailors pace with delicate  creoles some of them coloured as well as white so beautiful in  face and figure that one could almost pardon the jolly tars if they  enacted a second mutiny of the bounty and refused one and all to  leave the island and the fair dames thereof  and all the while the  warm night wind rushes in through the high open windows and the  fireflies flicker up and down in and out and you slip away on to  the balcony to enjoyfor after all it is very hotthe purple star spangled night and see aloft the saw of the mountain ridges against  the blackblue sky and belowwhat a contrastthe crowd of white  eyeballs and white teethnegroes coolies chineseall grinning  and peeping upward against the railing in the hope of seeing through the wallsthe buccra quality enjoy themselves  an even pleasanter sight we saw once in that large room a sort of  agricultural and horticultural show which augured well for the  future of the colony  the flowers were not remarkable save for the  taste shown in their arrangement till one recollected that they  were not brought from hothouses but grown in midwinter in the open  air  the roses of which west indians are very fond as they are of  all home ie european flowers were not as good as those of  europe  the rose in trinidad though it flowers three times a year  yet from the great heat and moisture runs too much to wood  but  the roots especially the different varieties of yam were very  curious and their size proved the wonderful foodproducing powers  of the land when properly cultivated  the poultry too were worthy  of an english show  indeed the fowl seems to take to tropical  america as the horse has to australia as to a second nativeland  and trinidad alone might send an endless supply to the fowlmarket  of the northern states even if that should not be quite true which  some one said that you might turn an old cock loose in the bush  and he without further help would lay more eggs and bring up more  chickens than you could either eat or sell  but the most interesting element of that exhibition was the coconut  fibre products of messrs uhrich and gerold of which more in  another place  in them lies a source of further wealth to the  colony which may stand her in good stead when port of spain  becomes as it must become one of the great emporiums of the west  since our visit the great ballroom has seeneven now is seeing strange vicissitudes  for the new royal college having as yet no  buildings of its own now keeps school it is said thereinalas  for the inkstains on that beautiful floor  and by last advices a  troupe of artistes from martinique there being no theatre in port  of spain have been doing their playacting in it and terpsichore  and thalia melpomene i fear haunts not the stage of martinique  have been hustling all the other muses downstairs at sunset and  joining their jinglings to the chorus of tomtoms and chacchacs  which resounds across the savannah at least till 10 pm from all  the suburbs  the roadand all the roads round port of spain thanks to sir ralph  woodford are as good as english roadsruns between the savannah  and the mountain spurs and past the botanic gardens which are a  credit in more senses than one to the governors of the island   for in them amid trees from every quarter of the globe and gardens  kept up in the english fashion with fountains too so necessary in  this tropical clime stood a large government house  this house  was some years ago destroyed and the then governor took refuge in a  cottage just outside the garden  a sum of money was voted to  rebuild the big house  but the governors to their honour have  preferred living in the cottage adding to it from time to time what  was necessary for mere comfort and have given the old gardens to  the city as a public pleasureground kept up at government  expense  this paradisefor such it isis somewhat too far from the city  and one passes in it few people save an occasional brown nurse   but when port of spain becomes as it surely will a great  commercial city and the slopes of laventille belmont and st  anns just above the gardens are studded as they surely will be  with the villas of rich merchants then will the generous gift of  english governors be appreciated and used and the botanic gardens  will become a tropic garden of the tuileries alive at five oclock  every evening with human flowers of every hue with human    chapter v  a letter from a west indian cottage ornee    30th december 1869  my dear we are actually settled in a west indian country house amid a multitude of sights and sounds so utterly new and  strange that the mind is stupefied by the continual effort to take  in or to confess the truth to gorge without hope of digestion  food of every conceivable variety  the whole day long new objects  and their new names have jostled each other in the brain in dreams  as well as in waking thoughts  amid such a confusion to describe  this place as a whole is as yet impossible  it must suffice if you  find in this letter a sketch or twonot worthy to be called a  studyof particular spots which seem typical beginning with my  bathroom window as the scene which first proved to me at least  that we were verily in the tropics  you look outwould that you did look in factover the low sill   the gravel outside at least is an old friend it consists of  broken bits of gray silurian rock and white quartz among it and  one touch of siluria makes the whole world kin  but there the  kindred ends  a few green weeds looking just like english ones  peep up through the gravel  weeds all over the world are mostly  like each other poor thin pale in leaf small and meagre in stem  and flower  meaner forms which fill up for good and sometimes  too for harm the gaps left by natures aristocracy of grander and  in these tropics more tyrannous and destroying forms  so like home  weeds they look  but pick one and you find it unlike anything at  home  that one happens to be as you may see by its little green  mousetails a pepperweed 77 first cousin to the great black  pepperbush in the gardens near by with the berries of which you  may burn your mouth gratis  so it is you would find with every weed in the little cleared  dell some fifteen feet deep beyond the gravel  you could noti  certainly cannotguess at the name seldom at the family of a  single plant  but i am going on too fast  what are those sticks of  wood which keep the gravel bank up  veritable bamboos and a  bamboopipe too is carrying the trickling cool water into the bath  close by  surely we are in the tropics  you hear a sudden rattle  as of boards and brown paper overhead and find that it is the  clashing of the huge leaves of a young fan palm 78a growing not  ten feet from the window  it has no stem as yet and the lower  leaves have to be trimmed off or they would close up the path so  that only the great forked green butts of them are left bound to  each other by natural matting  but overhead they range out nobly in  leafstalks ten feet long and fans full twelve feet broad and this  is but a baby a three years old thing  surely again we are in  the tropics  ten feet farther thrust all awry by the huge palm  leaves grows a young tree unknown to me looking like a walnut   next to it an orange covered with long prickles and small green  fruit its roots propped up by a semicylindrical balk of timber  furry inside which would puzzle a hampshire woodsman for it is  plainly a groogroo or a cocopalm split down the middle  surely  again we are in the tropics  beyond it again blaze great orange  and yellow flowers with long stamens and pistil curving upwards  out of them  they belong to a twining scrambling bush with  finelypinnated mimosa leaves  that is the flowerfence 78b so  often heard of in past years and round it hurries to and fro a  great orange butterfly larger seemingly than any english kind   next to it is a row of hibiscus shrubs with broad crimson flowers  then a row of young screwpines 78c from the east indian islands  like spiral pineapple plants twenty feet high standing on stilts   yes  surely we are in the tropics  over the low roof for the  cottage is all of one storey of purple and brown and white  shingles baking in the sun rises a tall tree which looks as so  many do here like a walnut but is not one  it is the poui of  the indians 78d and will be covered shortly with brilliant  saffron flowers  i turn my chair and look into the weedy dell  the ground on the  opposite slope slopes are you must remember here as steep as  houseroofs the last spurs of true mountains is covered with a  grass like tall ryegrass but growing in tufts  that is the famous  guineagrass 78e which introduced from africa has spread over  the whole west indies  dark lithe coolie prisoners one a gentle  young fellow with soft beseeching eyes and felon printed on the  back of his shirt are cutting it for the horses under the guard of  a mulatto turnkey a tall steadfast dignified man and between us  and them are growing along the edge of the gutter veritable pine apples in the open air and a low green tree just like an apple  which is a guava and a tall stick thirty feet high with a flat  top of gigantic curly horsechestnut leaves which is a trumpet tree 79a  there are hundreds of them in the mountains round  but  most of them dead from the intense drought and fires of last year   beyond it again is a roundheaded tree looking like a huge  portugal laurel covered with racemes of purple buds  that is an  angelim 79b when fullgrown one of the finest timbers in the  world  and what are those at the top of the brow rising out of the  rich green scrub  verily again we are in the tropics  they are  palms doubtless some thirty feet high each with here and there a  young one springing up like a gigantic crown of malefern  the old  ones have straight gray stems often prickly enough and thickened  in the middle gray last years leaves hanging down and feathering  round the top a circular plume of pale green leaves like those of  a coconut  but these are not cocos  the last years leaves of the  coco are rich yellow and its stem is curved  these are groogroos  79c they stand as fresh proofs that we are indeed in the tropics  and as a thing of beauty and a joy for ever  for it is a joy for ever a sight never to be forgotten to have  once seen palms breaking through and as it were defying the soft  rounded forms of the broadleaved vegetation by the stern grace of  their simple lines the immovable pillarstem looking the more  immovable beneath the toss and lash and flicker of the long leaves  as they awake out of their sunlit sleep and rage impatiently for a  while before the mountain gusts and fall asleep again  like a  greek statue in a luxurious drawingroom sharp cut cold virginal  shaming by the grandeur of mere form the voluptuousness of mere  colour however rich and harmonious so stands the palm in the  forest to be worshipped rather than to be loved  look at the  drawings of the oreodoxaavenue at rio in m agassizs charming  book  would that you could see actually such avenues even from the  sea as we have seen them in st vincent and guadaloupe  but look  at the mere pictures of them in that book and you will sympathise  surely with our new palmworship  and lastly what is that giant tree which almost fills the centre of  the glen towering with upright but branching limbs and huge crown  thinly leaved double the height of all the trees around  an ash   something like an ash in growth but when you look at it through the  glasses indispensable in the tropic forest you see that the  foliage is more like that of the yellow horsechestnut  and no  british ash not even the altyre giants ever reached to half that  bulk  it is a silkcotton tree a ceiba 79dsay rather the  ceiba of the glen for these glens have a habit of holding each one  great ceiba which has taken its stand at the upper end just where  the mountainspurs run together in an amphitheatre and being  favoured it may be supposed by the special richness of the down washed soil at that spot grows to one of those vast airgardens of  creepers and parasites of which we have so often read and dreamed   such a one is this  but we will not go up to it now  this sketch  shall be completed by the background of green and gray fading aloft  into tender cobalt  the background of mountain ribbed and gullied  into sharpest slopes by the tropic rains yet showing even where  steepest never a face of rock or a crag peeping through the trees   up to the skyline a thousand feet aloft all is green and that  instead of being as in europe stone or moor is jagged and  feathered with gigantic trees  how rich you would say  yet these  west indians only mourn over its desolation and disfigurement and  point to the sheets of gray stems which hang like mist along the  upper slopes  they look to us on this 30th of december only as  april signs that the woodlands have not quite burst into full leaf   but to the inhabitants they are tokens of those fearful fires which  raged over the island during the long drought of this summer when  the forests were burning for a whole month and this house scarcely  saved when whole canefields mills dwellinghouses went up as  tinder and flame in a moment and the smoky haze from the burning  island spread far out to sea  and yet where the fire passed six  months ago all is now a fresh impenetrable undergrowth of green  creepers covering the land climbing up and shrouding the charred  stumps young palms like prince of waless feathers breaking up  six or eight feet high among a wilderness of sensitive plants  scarletflowered dwarf balisiers 81a climbing fern 81b  convolvuluses of every hue and an endless variety of outlandish  leaves over which flutter troops of butterflies  how the seeds of  the plants and the eggs of the insects have been preserved who can  tell  but there their children are in myriads and ere a  generation has passed every dead gray stem will have disappeared  before the ants and beetles and great woodboring bees who rumble  round in blueblack armour the young plants will have grown into  great trees beneath the immeasurable vital force which pours all the  year round from the blazing sun above and all be as it was once  more  in verity we are in the tropics where the socalled powers  of nature are in perpetual health and strength and as much  stronger and swifter for good and evil than in our chilly clime  as is the young man in the heat of youth compared with the old man  shivering to his grave  think over that last simile  if you think  of it in the light which physiology gives you will find that it is  not merely a simile but a true analogy another manifestation of a  great physical law  thus much for the view at the backa chance scene without the  least pretensions to what average people would call beauty of  landscape  but oh that we could show you the view in front  the  lawn with its flowering shrubs tiny specimens of which we admire in  hothouses at home the grass as green for it is now the end of the  rainy season as that of england in may winding away into the cool  shade of strange evergreens the yellow coconut palms on the nearest  spur of hill throwing back the tenderblue of the higher mountains  the huge central group of treessaman 81c sandbox 81d and  fig with the bright ostrich plumes of a climbing palm towering  through the mimosalike foliage of the saman and erythrinas 81e  bois immortelles as they call them here their all but leafless  boughs now blazing against the blue sky with vermilion flowers  trees of red coral sixty feet in height  ah that we could show you  the avenue on the right composed of palms from every quarter of the  tropicspalms with smooth stems or with prickly ones with fan  leaves feather leaves leaves as in the winepalm 82a like  venuss hair fern some again like the cocorite 82b almost  stemless rising in a huge ostrich plume which tosses in the land  breeze till the long stiff leaflets seem to whirl like the spokes  of a green glass wheel  ah that we could wander with you through  the botanic garden beyond amid fruits and flowers brought together  from all the lands of the perpetual summer or even give you  through the great arches of the bamboo clumps as they creak and  rattle sadly in the wind and the bauhinias like tall and ancient  whitethorns which shade the road one glance of the flat green  savannah with its herds of kine beyond which lies buried in  flowering trees and backed by mountain woods the city of port of  spain  one glance too under the boughs of the great cottontree  at the gate at the still sleeping sea with one tall coolie ship at  anchor seen above green canefields and coolie gardens gay with  yellow croton and purple dracaena and crimson poinsettia and the  grand leaves of the grandest of all plants the banana food of  paradise  or again far away to the extreme right between the  flat tops of the great samanavenue at the barracks and the wooded  mountainspurs which rush down into the sea the islands of the  bocas floating in the shining water and beyond them a cloud among  the clouds the peak of a mighty mountain with one white tuft of  mist upon its top  ah that we could show you but that and tell you  that you were looking at the spanish main at south america  itself at the last point of the venezuelan cordillera and the  hills where jaguars lie  if you could but see what we see daily if  you could see with us the strange combination of rich and luscious  beauty with vastness and repose you would understand and excuse  the tendency to somewhat grandiose language which tempts perpetually  those who try to describe the tropics and know well that they can  only fail  in presence of such forms and such colouring as this one becomes  painfully sensible of the poverty of words and the futility  therefore of all wordpainting of the inability too of the  senses to discern and define objects of such vast variety of our  aesthetic barbarism in fact which has no choice of epithets save  between such as great and vast and gigantic between such as  beautiful and lovely and exquisite and so forth which are  after all intellectually only one stage higher than the halfbrute  wah wah with which the savage grunts his astonishmentcall it not  admiration epithets which are not perhaps intellectually as high  as the god is great of the mussulman who is wise enough not to  attempt any analysis either of nature or of his feelings about her  and wise enough also not having the fear of spinoza before his  eyes to in omni ignoto confugere ad deumin presence of the  unknown to take refuge in god  to describe to you therefore the botanic garden in which the  cottage stands would take a weeks work of words which would  convey no images to your mind  let it be enough to say that our  favourite haunt in all the gardens is a little dry valley beneath  the loftiest group of trees  at its entrance rises a great  tamarind and a still greater saman both have leaves like a mimosa as the engraving shows  up its trunk a cereus has reared itself  for some thirty feet at least a climbing seguine 83a twines up it  with leaves like lords and ladies but the glory of the tree is  that climbing palm the feathers of which we saw crowning it from a  distance  up into the highest branches and down again and up again  into the lower branches and rolling along the ground in curves as  that of a boa bedecked with huge ferns and prickly spikes six feet  and more long each the rattan 83b hangs in midair one hardly  sees how beautiful and wonderful beyond what clumsy words can  tell  beneath the great trees for here great trees grow freely  beneath greater trees and beneath greater trees again delighting  in the shade is a group of young mangosteens 83c looking to  describe the unknown by the known like walnuts with leaflets eight  inches long their boughs clustered with yellow and green sour  fruit and beyond them stretches up the lawn a dense grove of  nutmegs like portugal laurels hung about with oliveyellow apples   here and there a nutmegapple has split and shows within the  delicate crimson caul of mace or the nutmegs the mace still  clinging round them lie scattered on the grass  under the  perpetual shade of the evergreens haunt heliconias and other  delicate butterflies who seem to dread the blaze outside and  flutter gently from leaf to leaf their colouringwhich is usually  black with markings of orange crimson or bluecoming into  strongest contrast with the uniform green of leaf and grass  this  is our favourite spot for entomologising when the sun outside  altogether forbids the least exertion  turn with usalas only in  fancyout of the grove into a neighbouring path between tea shrubs looking like privets with large myrtle flowers and young  clovetrees covered with the groups of green buds which are the  cloves of commerce and among fruittrees from every part of the  tropics with the names of which i will not burden you  glance at  that beautiful and most poisonous shrub which we found wild at st  thomass 84  glance toobut again why burden you with names  which you will not recollect much more with descriptions which do  not describe  look though down that allspice avenue at the clear  warm light which is reflected off the smooth yellow everpeeling  stems and then if you can fix your eye steadily on any object  where all are equally new and strange look at this stately tree  a  bough has been broken off high up and from the wounded spot two  plants are already contending  one is a parasitic orchis the other  a parasite of a more dangerous family  it looks like a straggling  magnolia some two feet high  in fifty years it will be a stately  tree  look at the single long straight airroot which it is letting  down by the side of the tree bole  that root if left will be the  destroyer of the whole tree  it will touch the earth take root  below send out sidefibres above call down younger roots to help  it till the whole bole clasped and stifled in their embraces dies  and rots out and the matapalo or scotch attorney 85a as it is  rudely called here stands alone on stilted roots and board walls  of young wood slowly coalescing into one great trunk master of the  soil once owned by the patron on whose vitals he has fed  a  treacherous tyrant and yet like many another treacherous tyrant  beautiful to see with his shining evergreen foliage and grand  labyrinth of smooth roots standing high in air or dangling from  the boughs in search of soil below and last but not least his  magnolialike flowers rosy or snowywhite and green eggshaped  fruits  now turn homewards past the rosa del monte 85b bush bushes you  must recollect are twenty feet high here covered with crimson  roses full of long silky crimson stamens  and then tryas we do  daily in vainto recollect and arrange onetenth of the things  which you have seen  one look round at the smaller wild animals and flowers  butterflies  swarm round us of every hue  beetles you may remark are few  they do not run in swarms about these arid paths as they do at home   but the wasps and bees black and brown are innumerable  that huge  bee in steelblue armour booming straight at youwhom some one  compared to the lord mayors man in armour turned into a cherub and  broken looseget out of his way for he is absorbed in business is probably a woodborer 85c of whose work you may read in mr  woods homes without hands  that long black wasp commonly called a  jack spaniard builds pensile paper nests under every roof and shed   watch now this more delicate brown wasp probably one of the  pelopoei of whom we have read in mr gosses naturalist in jamaica  and mr batess travels on the amazons  she has made under a shelf  a mud nest of three long cells and filled them one by one with  small spiders and the precious egg which when hatched is to feed  on them  one hundred and eight spiders we have counted in a single  nest like this and the wasp much of the same shape as the jack  spaniard but smaller works unlike him alone or at least only  with her husbands help  the long mud nest is built upright often  in the angle of a doorpost or panel and always added to and  entered from below  with a joyful hum she flies back to it all day  long with her pellets of mud and spreads them out with her mouth  into pointed arches one laid on the other making one side of the  arch out of each pellet and singing low but cheerily over her work   as she works downward she parts off the tube of the nest with  horizontal floors of a finer and harder mud and inside each storey  places some five spiders and among them the precious egg or eggs  which is to feed on them when hatched  if we open the uppermost  chamber we shall find every vestige of the spiders gone and the  cavity filled and strange to say exactly filled by a brown coated wasppupa enveloped in a fine silken shroud  in the chamber  below perhaps we shall find the grub fullgrown and finishing his  last spicier and so on down six or eight storeys till the lowest  holds nothing but spiders packed close but not yet sealed up   these spiders be it remembered are not dead  by some strange  craft the wasp knows exactly where to pierce them with her sting  so as to stupefy but not to kill just as the sandwasps of our  banks at home stupefy the large weevils which they store in their  burrows as food for their grubs  there are wasps too here who make pretty little jarshaped nests  round with a neatly lined round lip  papernests too more like  those of our treewasps at home hang from the trees in the woods   ants nests too hang sometimes from the stronger boughs looking  like huge hard lumps of clay  and once at least we have found  silken nests of butterflies or moths containing many chrysalids  each  meanwhile dismiss from your mind the stories of insect  plagues  if good care is taken to close the mosquito curtains at  night the flies about the house are not nearly as troublesome as we  have often found the midges in scotland  as for snakes we have  seen none centipedes are certainly apt to get into the bath but  can be fished out dead and thrown to the chickens  the wasps and  bees do not sting or in any wise interfere with our comfort save  by building on the books  the only ants who come into the house are  the minute harmless and most useful crazy ants who run up and  down wildly all day till they find some eatable thing an atom of  bread or a disabled cockroach of which last by the by we have  seen hardly any here  they then prove themselves in their sound  senses by uniting to carry off their prey some pulling some  pushing with a steady combination of effort which puts to shame an  average negro crew  and these are all we have to fear unless it be  now and then a huge spider which it is not the fashion here to  kill as they feed on flies  so comfort yourself with the thought  that as regards insect pests we are quite as comfortable as in an  countryhouse and infinitely more comfortable than in english  countryhouse and infinitely more comfortable than in a scotch  shooting lodge let alone an alpine chalet  lizards run about the walks in plenty about the same size is the  green lizard of the south of europe but of more sober colours  the  parasol antsof whom i could tell you much save that you will read  far more than i can tell you in half a dozen books at homewalk in  triumphal processions each with a bit of green leaf borne over its  head and probably when you look closely with a little ant or two  riding on it and getting a lift home after work on their stronger  sisters backand these are all the monsters which you are likely  to meet  would that there were more birds to be seen and heard  but of late  years the free negro like the french peasant during the first half  of this century has held it to be one of the indefeasible rights of  a free man to carry a rusty gun and to shoot every winged thing   he has been tempted too by orders from london shops for gaudy  birdshummingbirds especially  and when a single house it is  said advertises for 20000 birdskins at a time no wonder if birds  grow scarce and no wonder too if the wholesale destruction of  these insectkillers should avenge itself by a plague of vermin  caterpillars and grubs innumerable  already the turf of the  savannah or public park close by is being destroyed by hordes of  molecrickets strange to say almost exactly like those of our old  english meadows and unless something is done to save the birds the  cane and other crops will surely suffer in their turn  a gun licence would be it seems both unpopular and easily evaded in a  wild forest country  a heavy export tax on birdskins has been  proposed  may it soon be laid on and the vegetable wealth of the  island saved at the expense of a little less useless finery in  young ladies hats  so we shall see and hear but few birds round port of spain save the  black vultures 87acorbeaux as they call them here and the  black tick birds 87b a little larger than our english  blackbird with a long tail and a thickhooked bill who perform for  the cattle here the same friendly office as is performed by  starlings at home  privileged creatures they cluster about on  rails and shrubs within ten feet of the passer while overhead in  the treetops the quest ce quil dit 87c a brown and yellow  bird who seems almost equally privileged and insolent inquires  perpetually what you say  besides these swallows of various kinds  little wrens 87d almost exactly like our english ones and night hawking goatsuckers few birds are seen  but unseen in the  depths of every wood a songster breaks out ever and anon in notes  equal for purity and liveliness to those of our english thrush and  belies the vulgar calumny that tropic birds lest they should grow  too proud of their gay feathers are denied the gift of song  one look lastly at the animals which live either in cages or at  liberty about the house  the queen of all the pets is a black and  gray spider monkey 88 from guianaconsisting of a tail which has  developed at one end a body about twice as big as a hares four  arms call them not legs of which the front ones have no thumbs  nor rudiments of thumbs and a head of black hair brushed forward  over the foolish kindly greedy sad face with its wide  suspicious beseeching eyes and mouth which as in all these  american monkeys as far as we have seen can have no expression  not even that of sensuality because it has no lips  others have  described the spider monkey as four legs and a tail tied in a knot  in the middle  but the tail is without doubt the most important  of the five limbs  wherever the monkey goes whatever she does the  tail is the standingpoint or rather hangingpoint  it takes one  turn at least round something or other provisionally and in case  it should be wanted often as she swings every other limb hangs in  the most ridiculous repose and the tail alone supports  sometimes  it carries by way of ornament a bunch of flowers or a live kitten   sometimes it is curled round the neck or carried over the head in  the hands out of harms way or when she comes silently up behind  you puts her cold hand in yours and walks by your side like a  child she steadies herself by taking a halfturn of her tail round  your wrist  her relative jack of whom hereafter walks about  carrying his chain to ease his neck in a loop of his tail  the  spider monkeys easiest attitude in walking and in running also  is strangely upright like a human being  but as for her antics  nothing could represent them to you save a series of photographs  and those instantaneous ones for they change every moment not by  starts but with a deliberate ease which would be grace in anything  less horribly ugly into postures such as callot or breughel never  fancied for the ugliest imps who ever tormented st anthony  all  absurd efforts of agility which you ever saw at a seance of the  hylobates lar club at cambridge are quiet and clumsy compared to the  ropedancing which goes on in the boughs of the poui tree or to  their great detriment of the bougainvillea and the gardenia on the  lawn  but with all this spider is the gentlest most obedient and  most domestic of beasts  her creed is that yellow bananas are the  summum bonum and that she must not come into the diningroom or  even into the verandah whither nevertheless she slips in fear  and trembling every morning to steal the little green parrots  breakfast out of his cage or the babys milk or fruit off the  sideboard in which case she makes her appearance suddenly and  silently sitting on the threshold like a distorted fiend and  begins scratching herself looking at everything except the fruit  and pretending total absence of mind till the proper moment comes  for unwinding her lengthy ugliness and making a snatch at the  table  poor weakheaded thing full of foolish cunning always  doing wrong and knowing that it is wrong but quite unable to  resist temptation and then profuse in futile explanations  gesticulations mouthings of an ohohoh so pitiably human  that you can only punish her by laughing at her which she does not  at all like  one cannot resist the fancy while watching her  either that she was once a human being or that she is trying to  become one  but at present she has more than one habit to learn  or to recollect ere she become as fit for human society as the dog  or the cat 89  her friends are every human being who will take  notice of her and a beautiful little guazupita or native deer a  little larger than a roe with great black melting eyes and a heart  as soft as its eyes who comes to lick ones hand believes in  bananas as firmly as the monkey and when she can get no hand to  lick licks the hairy monkey for mere loves sake and lets it ride  on her back and kicks it off and lets it get on again and take a  halfturn of its tail round her neck and throttle her with its  arms and pull her nose out of the way when a banana is coming  and  all out of pure love for the two have never been introduced to each  other by man and the intimacy between them like that famous one  between the horse and the hen is of natures own making up  very different from the spider monkey in temper is her cousin jack  who sits sullen and unrepentant at the end of a long chain having  an ugly liking for the calves of passersby and ugly teeth to  employ on them  sad at heart he is and testifies his sadness  sometimes by standing bolt upright with his long arms in postures  oratorio almost prophetic or when duly pitied and moaned to  lying down on his side covering his hairy eyes with one hairy arm  and weeping and sobbing bitterly  he seems speaking  scientifically to be some sort of mycetes or howler from the flat  globular throat which indicates the great development of the hyoid  bone but happily for the sleep of the neighbourhood he never  utters in captivity any sound beyond a chuckle and he is supposed  by some here from his burly thickset figure vast breadth between  the ears short neck and general cast of countenance to have been  in a prior state of existence a man and a brotherand that by no  means of negro bloodwho has gained in this his purgatorial stage  of existence nothing save a wellearned tail  at all events more  than one of us was impressed at the first sight with the  conviction that we had seen him before  poor jack and it is come to this  and all from the indulgence of  his five senses plus the sixth sense of vanity  his only  recreation save eating is being led about by the mulatto turnkey  the one human being with whom he dimly understanding what is fit  for him will at all consort and having wild pines thrown down to  him from the poui tree above by the spider monkey whose gambols he  watches with pardonable envy  like the great mr barry lyndon the  acutest sketch of human nature dear thackeray ever made he cannot  understand why the world is so unjust and foolish as to have taken a  prejudice against him  after all he is nothing but a strong nasty  brute and his only reason for being here is that he is a new and  undescribed species never seen before and it is to be hoped  never to be seen again  in a cage near by for there is quite a little menagerie here are  three small sapajous 90 two of which belong to the island as  abject and selfish as monkeys usually are and as uninteresting  save for the plain signs which they give of being actuated by more  than instinctby a reasoning power exactly like in kind though  not equal in degree to that of man  if as people are now too much  induced to believe the brain makes the man and not some higher  reason connected intimately with the moral sense which will endure  after the brain has turned to dust if to foresee consequences from  experience and to adapt means to ends be the highest efforts of  the intellect  then who can deny that the sapajou proves himself a  man and a brother plus a tail when he puts out a lighted cigarend  before he chews it by dipping it into the waterpan and that he  may therefore by long and steady calculations about the  conveniences of virtue and inconveniences of vice gradually cure  himself and his children of those evil passions which are defined as  the works of the flesh and rise to the supremest heights of  justice benevolence and purity  we who have been brought up in  an older and as we were taught to think a more rational creed may  not be able yet to allow our imaginations so daringly hopeful a  range  but the world travels fast and seems travelling on into  some such theory just now leaving behind as antiquated bigots  those who dare still to believe in the eternal and immutable essence  of goodness and in the divine origin of man created in the  likeness of god that he might be perfect even as his father in  heaven is perfect  but to return to the animals  the cage next to the monkeys holds a  more pleasant beast a toucan out of the primeval forest as  gorgeous in colour as he is ridiculous in shape  his general  plumage is black set off by a snowwhite gorget fringed with  crimson crimson and green tail coverts and a crimson and green  beak with blue cere about his face and throat  his enormous and  weak bill seems made for the purpose of swallowing bananas whole  how he feeds himself with it in the forest it is difficult to guess   and when he hops up and down on his great clattering feettwo toes  turned forward and two backtwisting head and beak right and left  for he cannot see well straight before him to see whence the  bananas are coming or when again after gorging a couple he sits  gulping and winking digesting them in serene satisfaction he is as  good a specimen as can be seen of the ludicrousdare i say the  intentionally ludicrouselement in nature  next to him is a kinkajou 91a a beautiful little furry bearor  racoonwho has found it necessary for his welfare in this world of  trees to grow a long prehensile tail as the monkeys of the new  world have done  he sleeps by day save when woke up to eat a  banana or to scoop the inside out of an egg with his long lithe  tongue  but by night he remembers his forestlife and performs  strange dances by the hour together availing himself not only of  his tail which he uses just as the spider monkey does but of his  hind feet which he can turn completely round at will till the  claws point forward like those of a bat  but with him too the  tail is the sheetanchor by which he can hold on and bring all his  four feet to bear on his food  so it is with the little anteater  91b who must needs climb here to feed on the tree ants  so it is  too with the tree porcupine 91c or coendou who in strange  contrast to the wellknown classic porcupine of the rocks of  southern europe climbs trees after leaves and swings about like  the monkeys  for the life of animals in the primeval forest is as  one glance would show you principally arboreal  the flowers the  birds the insects are all a hundred feet over your head as you  walk along in the all but lifeless shade and half an hour therein  would make you feel how true was mr wallaces similethat a walk  in the tropic forest was like one in an empty cathedral while the  service was being celebrated upon the roof  in the next two cages however are animals who need no prehensile  tails for they are cats furnished with those far more useful and  potent engines retractile claws a form of beast at which the  thoughtful man will never look without wonder so unique so  strange and yet as perfect that it suits every circumstance of  every clime as does that equally unique form the dragonfly  we  found the dragonflies here to our surprise exactly similar to  and as abundant as the dragonflies at home and remembering that  there were dragonflies of exactly the same type ages and ages ago  in the days of the oeningen and solenhofen slates saidhere is  indeed a perfect work of god which as far as man can see has  needed no improvement if such an expression be allowable  throughout epochs in which the whole shape of continents and seas  and the whole climate of the planet has changed again and again   the cats are  an ocelot a beautiful spotted and striped fiend who  hisses like a snake a young jaguar a clumsy happy kitten about  as big as a pug dog with a puny kittens tail who plays with the  spider monkey and only shows by the fastincreasing bulk of his  square lumbering head that in six months he will be ready to eat  the monkey and in twelve to eat the keeper  there are strange birds too  one whom you may see in the  zoological gardens like a plover with a straight beak and bitterns  plumage from the main whose business is to walk about the table  at meals uttering sad metallic noises and catching flies  his name  is sunbird 93a sunfowlo of the surinam negroes according to  dear old stedman because when it extends its wings which it  often does there appears on the interior part of each wing a most  beautiful representation of the sun  this bird he continues very  truly might be styled the perpetual motion its body making a  continual movement and its tail keeping time like the pendulum of a  clock 93b  a gamebird olive with a bare red throat also from  the main called a chacaracha 93c who is impudently brave and  considers the house his own and a great black curassow 93d also  from the main who patronises the turkeys and guineafowl stalks in  dignity before them and when they do not obey enforces his  authority by pecking them to death  there is thus plenty of  amusement here and instruction too for those to whom the ways of  dumb animals during life are more interesting than their stuffed  skins after death  but there is the signalgun announcing the arrival of the mail from  home  and till it departs again there will be no time to add to  this hasty but not unfaithful sketch of first impressions in a  tropic island    chapter vi  monos    early in january i started with my host and his little suite on an  expedition to the islands of the bocas  our object was twofold  to  see tropical coast scenery and to get if possible some guacharo  birds pronounced huacharo of whom more hereafter  our chance of  getting them depended on the sea being calm outside the bocas as  well as inside  the calm inside was no proof of the calm out  port  of spain is under the lee of the mountains and the surf might be  thundering along the northern shore tearing out stone after stone  from the soft cliffs and shrouding all the distant points in salt  haze though the gulf along which we were rowing was perfectly  smooth and the shipping and the mangrove scrub and the cocopalms  hung double reflected as in a mirror not of glass but of mud and  on the swamps of the caroni the malarious fog hung motionless in  long straight lines waiting for the first blaze of sunrise to  sublime it and its invisible poisons into the upper air where it  would be swept off harmless by the tradewind which rushed along  half a mile above our heads  so away we rowed or rather were rowed by four stalwart negroes  along the northern shore of the gulf while the sun leapt up  straight astern and made the awning or rather the curtains of the  awning needful enough  for the perpendicular rays of the sun in  the tropics are not so much dreaded as the horizontal ones which  strike on the forehead or still more dangerous on the back of the  head and in the west indies as in the united states the early  morning and the latter part of the afternoon are the times for  sunstrokes  some sort of shade for the back of the head is  necessary for an european unless which is not altogether to be  recommended he adopts the la platan fashion of wearing the natural  and therefore surest sunshade of his own hair hanging down to his  shoulders after the manner of our old cavaliers  the first islands which we madethe five islands as they are  calledare curious enough  isolated remnants of limestone the  biggest perhaps one hundred yards long by one hundred feet high  channelled and honeycombed into strange shapes by rain and waves  they are coveredthat at least on which we landedalmost  exclusively by matapalos which seem to have stranded the original  trees and established themselves in every cranny of the rocks  sending out arms legs fingers ropes pillars and what not of  live holdfasts over every rock and over each other till little but  the ubiquitous seguine 95a and pinguins 95b find room or  sustenance among them  the island on which we landed is used from  time to time as a depot for coolie immigrants when first landed   there they remain to rest after the voyage till they can be  apportioned by the government officers to the estates which need  them  of this admirable system of satisfying the great need of the  west indies free labourers i may be allowed to say a little here  immigrants are brought over from hindostan at the expense of the  colony  the indian government jealously watches the emigration and  through agents of its own rigidly tests the bonafide voluntary  character of the engagement  that they are well treated on the  voyage is sufficiently proved that on 2264 souls imported last year  the deathrate during the voyage was only 27 per cent although  cholera attacked the crew of one of the ships before it left the  hooghly  during the last three years ships with over 300 emigrants  have arrived several times in trinidad without a single death  on  their arrival in trinidad those who are sick are sent at once to  the hospital those unfit for immediate labour are sent to the  depot  the healthy are indenturedin plain english apprenticed for five years and distributed among the estates which have  applied for them  husbands and wives are not allowed to be  separated nor are children under fifteen parted from their parents  or natural protectors  they are expected by the law to work for 280  days in the year nine hours a day and receive the same wages as  the free labourers  but for this system taskwork is by consent  universally substituted and as in the case of an english  apprentice the law by various provisions at once punishes them  for wilful idleness and protects them from tyranny or fraud on the  part of their employers  till the last two years the newcomers  received their wages entirely in money  but it was found better to  give them for the first year and now for the two first years part  payment in daily rations  a pound of rice four ounces of dholl a  kind of pea an ounce of coconut oil or ghee and two ounces of  sugar to each adult and half the same to each child between five  and ten years old  this plan has been found necessary in order to protect the coolies  both from themselves and from each other  they themselves prefer  receiving the whole of their wages in cash  with that fondness for  mere hard money which marks a halfeducated oriental they will as  a rule hoard their wages and stint themselves of food injuring  their powers of work and even endangering their own lives as is  proved by the broad fact that the deathrate among them has much  decreased especially during the first year of residence since the  plan of giving them rations has been at work  the newcomers need  too protection from their own countrymen  old coolies who have  served their time and saved money find it convenient to turn rice sellers or moneylenders  they have powerful connections on many  estates they first advance money or luxuries to a newcomer and  when he is once entrapped they sell him the necessaries of life at  famine prices  thus the practical effect of rations has been to  lessen the number of those little roadside shops which were a curse  to trinidad and are still a curse to the english workman   moreoverfor all men are not perfect even in trinidadthe coolie  required protection in certain cases against a covetous and short sighted employer who might fancy it to be his interest to let the  man idle during his first year while weak and so save up an arrear  of lost days to be added at the end of the five years when he was  a strong skilled labourer  an employer will have of course far  less temptation to do this while as now he is bound to feed the  coolie for the first two years  meanwhile be it remembered the  very fact that such a policy was tempting goes to prove that the  average coolie grew during his five years apprenticeship a  stronger and not a weaker man  there is thorough provisionas far as the law can providefor the  coolies in case of sickness  no estate is allowed to employ  indentured coolies which has not a duly certified hospital  capable of holding onetenth at least of the coolies on the estate  with an allowance of 800 cubic feet to each person and these  hospitals are under the care of district medical visitors appointed  by the governor and under the inspection as are the labourbooks  indeed every document and arrangement connected with the coolies of  the agentgeneral of immigrants or his deputies  one of these  officers the inspector is always on the move and daily visits  without warning one or more estates reporting every week to the  agentgeneral  the governor may at any time without assigning any  cause cancel the indenture of any immigrant or remove any part or  the whole of the indentured immigrant labourers from any estate and  this has been done ere now  i know but too well that whether in europe or in the indies no  mere laws however wisely devised will fully protect the employed  from the employer or again the employer from the employed  what  is needed is a moral bond between them a bond above or rather  beneath that of mere wages however fairly paid for work however  fairly done  the patriarchal system had such a bond so had the  feudal  but they are both dead and gone having done i presume  all that it was in them to do and done it like all human  institutions not over well  and meanwhile that nobler bond after  which socialists socalled have sought and after which i trust they  will go on seeking stilla bond which shall combine all that was  best in patriarchism and feudalism with that freedom of the  employed which those forms of society failed to givehas not been  found is yet and for a generation or two to come cashpayment  seems likely to be the only nexus between man and man  because  that is the meanest and weakest of all bonds it must be watched  jealously and severely by any government worthy of the name for to  leave it to be taken care of by the mere brute tendencies of supply  and demand and the socalled necessities of the labour market is  simply to leave the poor man who cannot wait to be blockaded and  starved out by the rich who can  therefore all colonial governments  are but doing their plain duty in keeping a clear eye and a strong  hand on this whole immigration movement and in fencing it round as  in trinidad with such regulations as shall make it most difficult  for a coolie to be seriously or permanently wronged without direct  infraction of the law and connivance of government officers which  last supposition is in the case of trinidad absurd as long as dr  mitchell whom i am proud to call my friend holds a post for which  he is equally fitted by his talents and his virtues  i am well aware that some benevolent persons to whom humanity owes  much regard coolie immigration to the west indies with some  jealousy fearing and not unnaturally that it may degenerate into  a sort of slavetrade  i think that if they will study the last  immigration ordinance enacted by the governor of trinidad june 24  1870 and the report of the agentgeneral of immigrants for the year  ending september 30 1869 their fears will be set at rest as far as  this colony is concerned  of other colonies i say nothing simply  because i know nothing  save that if there are defects and abuses  elsewhere the remedy is simple  namely to adopt the system of  trinidad and work it as it is worked there  after he has served his five years apprenticeship the coolie has  two courses before him  either he can reindenture himself to an  employer for not more than twelve months which as a rule he does  or he can seek employment where he likes  at the end of a  continuous residence of ten years in all and at any period after  that he is entitled to a free passage back to hindostan or he may  exchange his right to a free passage for a government grant of ten  acres of land  he has meanwhile if he has been thrifty grown  rich  his wife walks about at least on highdays bedizened with  jewels  nay you may see her even on workdays hoeing in the  canepiece with heavy silver bangles hanging down over her little  brown feet  and what wealth she does not carry on her arms ankles  neck and nostril her husband has in the savings bank  the ship  arima as an instance  took back 320 coolies last year of whom  seven died on the voyage  these people carried with them 65585  dollars and one man heerah handed over 6000 dollars for  transmission through the treasury and was known to have about him  4000 more  this man originally allotted to an estate had after  serving out his industrial contract resided in the neighbouring  village of savannah grande as a shopkeeper and moneylender for the  last ten years  most of this money doubtless had been squeezed  out of other coolies by means not unknown to europeans as well as  to hindoos  but it must have been there to be squeezed out  and  the new feeding ordinance will it is to be hoped pare the claws  of hindoo and chinese usurers  the newly offered grant of government land has as yet been  accepted only in a few cases  it was not to be expected says the  report that the indian whose habits have been fixed in special  grooves for tens of centuries should hurriedly embrace an offer  which must strike at all his prejudices of country and creed and  kin  still about sixty had settled in 1869 near the estates in  savonetta where i saw them and at point a pierre other  settlements have been made since of which more hereafter  and as  a significant fact many coolies who have returned to india are now  coming back a second time to trinidad bringing their kinsfolk and  fellowvillagers with them to a land where violence is unknown and  famine impossible  moreover numerous coolies from the french  islands are now immigrating and buying land  these are chiefly  madrassees who are it is said stronger and healthier than the  calcutta coolies  in any case there seems good hope that a race of  hindoo peasantproprietors will spring up in the colony whose  voluntary labour will be available at croptime and who will teach  the negro thrift and industry not only by their example but by  competing against him in the till lately understocked labourmarket  very interesting was the first glimpse of hindoos and still more of  hindoos in the west indiesthe surplus of one of the oldest  civilisations of the old world come hither to replenish the new  novel was the sight of the dusky limbs swarming up and down among  the rocks beneath the matapalo shade the group in the water as we  landed bathing and dressing themselves at the same time after the  modest and graceful hindoo fashion the visit to the wooden  barracks where a row of men was ranged on one side of the room  with their women and children on the other having their name  caste native village and so forth taken down before they were  sent off to the estates to which they were indentured  three things  were noteworthy first the healthy cheerful look of all speaking  well for the care and good feeding which they had had on board ship  next the great variety in their faces and complexions  almost all  of them were lowcaste people  indeed few highcaste hindoos  except some sepoys who found it prudent to emigrate after the  rebellion have condescended or dared to cross the dark water  and only a very few of those who come west are mussulmans  but  among the multitude of inferior castes who do come there is a  greater variety of feature and shape of skull than in an average  multitude as far as i have seen of any european nation  caste  the physiognomist soon sees began in a natural fact  it meant  difference not of rank but of tribe and language and india is  not as we are apt to fancy a nation  it is a world  one must  therefore regard this emigration of the coolies like anything else  which tends to break down caste as a probable step forward in their  civilisation  for it must tend to undermine in them and still more  in their children the petty superstitions of old tribal  distinctions and must force them to take their stand on wider and  sounder ground and see that a mans a man for a that  the third thing noteworthy in the crowd which cooked chatted  lounged sauntered idly to and fro under the matapalosthe pillared  airroots of which must have put them in mind of their own banyans  at homewas their good manners  one saw in a moment that one was  among gentlemen and ladies  the dress of many of the men was nought  but a scarf wrapped round the loins that of most of the women  nought but the longer scarf which the hindoo woman contrives to  arrange in a most graceful as well as a perfectly modest covering  even for her feet and head  these garments and perhaps a brass  pot were probably all the worldly goods of most of them just then   but every attitude gesture tone was full of grace of ease  courtesy selfrestraint dignityof that sweetness and light at  least in externals which mr matthew arnold desiderates  i am well  aware that these people are not perfect that like most heathen  folk and some christian their morals are by no means spotless  their passions by no means trampled out  but they have acquired let hindoo scholars tell how and wherea civilisation which shows  in them all day long which draws the european to them and them to  the european whenever the latter is worthy of the name of a  civilised man instinctively and by the mere interchange of  glances a civilisation which must make it easy for the englishman  if he will but do his duty not only to make use of these people  but to purify and ennoble them  another thing was noteworthy about the coolies at the very first  glance and all we saw afterwards proved that that first glance was  correct i mean their fondness for children  if you took notice of  a child not only the mother smiled thanks and delight but the men  around likewise as if a compliment had been paid to their whole  company  we saw afterwards almost daily proofs of the coolie mens  fondness for their children of their fondness alsoan excellent  sign that the morale is not destroyed at the rootfor dumb animals   a coolie cow or donkey is petted led about tenderly tempted with  titbits  pet animals where they can be got are the coolies  delight as they are the delight of the wild indian  i wish i could  say the same of the negro  his treatment of his children and of his  beasts of burden is but too often as exactly opposed to that of  the coolie as are his manners  no wonder that the two races do not  and it is to be feared never will amalgamate that the coolie  shocked by the unfortunate awkwardness of gesture and vulgarity of  manners of the average negro and still more of the negress looks  on them as savages while the negro in his turn hates the coolie as  a hardworking interloper and despises him as a heathen or that  heavy fights between the two races arise now and then in which the  coolie in spite of his slender limbs has generally the advantage  over the burly negro by dint of his greater courage and the  terrible quickness with which he wields his beloved weapon the long  hardwood quarterstaff  but to return  we rowed away with a hundred confused but most  pleasant new impressions amid innumerable salaams to the governor  by these kindly courteous people and then passed between the larger  limestone islands into the roadstead of chaguaramas which ought to  be and some day may be the harbour for the british west india  fleet and for the shipping too of that commerce which as  humboldt prophesied must some day spring up between europe and the  boundless wealth of the upper orinoco as yet lying waste  already  gold discoveries in the sierra de parima of which more hereafter  are indicating the honesty of poor murdered raleigh  already the  good president of ciudad bolivar angostura has disbanded the  ruffian army which is the usual curse of a spanish american  republic and has inaugurated it is to be hoped a reign of peace  and commerce  already an american line of steamers runs as far as  nutrias some eight hundred miles up the orinoco and apure while a  second will soon run up the meta almost to santa fe de bogota and  bring down the orinoco the wealth not only of southern venezuela  but of central new grenada and then a day may come when the  admirable harbour of chaguaramas may be one of the entrepots of the  world if a certain swamp to windward which now makes the place  pestilential could but be drained  the usual method of so doing  now is to lay the swamp as dry as possible by open ditches and then  plant it with coconuts whose roots have some mysterious power both  of drying and purifying the soil but were chaguaramas ever needed  as an entrepot it would not be worth while to wait for coconuts to  grow  a dyke across the mouth and a steampump on it as in the  fens of norfolk and of guiana to throw the landwater over into the  sea would probably expel the evil spirit of malaria at once and for  ever  we rowed on past the boca de monos by which we had entered the gulf  at first and looked out eagerly enough for sharks which are said  to swarm at chaguaramas  but no warning fin appeared above the  ripple only more than once close to the stern of the boat a  heavy fish broke water with a sharp splash and swirl which was said  to be a barracouta following us up in mere bold curiosity but  perfectly ready to have attacked any one who fell overboard  these  barracoutassphyraenas as the learned or pike as the sailors  call them though they are no kin to our pike at homeare when  large nearly as dangerous as a shark  in some parts of the west  indies folk dare not bathe for fear of them for they lie close  inshore amid the heaviest surf and woe to any living thing which  they come across  moreover they have this somewhat mean advantage  over you that while if they eat you you will agree with them  perfectly you cannot eat them at least at certain or uncertain  seasons of the year without their disagreeing with you without  sickness trembling pains in all joints falling off of nails and  hair for years to come and possible death  those who may wish to  know more of the poisonous fishes of the west indies may profitably  consult a paper in the proceedings of the scientific association of  trinidad by that admirable naturalist andlet me say of him  though i have not the honour of knowing him what has long been  said by all who have that honouradmirable man the hon richard  hill of jamaica  he mentions some thirteen species which are more  or less poisonous at all events at times  but on the cause of  their unwholesomeness he throws little light and still less on the  extraordinary but undoubted fact that the same species may be  poisonous in one island and harmless in another and that of two  species so close as to be often considered as the same one may be  poisonous the other harmless  the yellowbilled sprat 102 for  instance is usually so poisonous that death has occurred from  eating it in many cases immediately and in some recorded instances  even before the fish was swallowed  yet a species caught with  this and only differing from it if indeed it be distinct by  having a yellow spot instead of a black one on the gillcover is  harmless  mr hill attributes the poisonous quality in many cases  to the foul food which the fish get from coral reefs such as the  formigas bank midway between cuba hayti and jamaica where as  you approach it from the east you find the cheering blandness of  the seabreeze suddenly changing to the nauseating smell of a fish market  there as off similar reefs in the bahamas and round  anegada as well as at one end of st kitts the fish are said to  be all poisonous  if this theory be correct the absence of coral  reefs round trinidad may help to account for the fact stated by mr  joseph that poisonous fish are unknown in that island  the  statement however is somewhat too broadly made for the chouf chouf 103a a prickly fish which blows itself out like a bladder  and which may be seen hanging in many a sailors cottage in england  is as evildisposed in trinidad as elsewhere  the very vultures  will not eat it and while i was in the island a family of coolies  in spite of warning contrived to kill themselves with the nasty  vermin  the only one who had wit enough to refuse it being an idiot  boy  these islands of the bocas three in number are some two miles long  each and some eight hundred to one thousand feet in height at  least so say the surveyors  to the eye as is usual in the  tropics they look much lower  one is inclined here to estimate  hills at half or less than half their actual height and that from  causes simple enough  not only does the intense clearness of the  atmosphere make the summits appear much nearer than in england but  the trees on the summit increase the deception  the mind from home  association supposes them to be of the same height as average  english trees on a hilltopsay fifty feetand estimates rapidly  and unconsciously the height of the mountain by that standard  the  trees are actually nearer a hundred and fifty than fifty feet high  and the mountain is two or three times as big as it looks  but it is not their height nor the beauty of their outline nor the  size of the trunks which still linger on them here and there which  gives these islands their special charm  it is their exquisite  little landlocked southern covesplaces to live and die in   the world forgetting by the world forgot   take as an example that into which we rowed that day in monos as  the old spaniards named it from monkeys long since extinct a  curved shingle beach some fifty yards across shut in right and left  by steep rocks wooded down almost to the sea and worn into black  caves and crannies festooned with the nightblowing cereus which  crawls about with hairy green legs like a tangle of giant spiders   among it in the cracks upright cerei like candelabra twenty and  thirty feet high thrust themselves aloft into the brushwood  an  aroid 103b rides parasitic on roots and stems sending downward  long airroots and upward brown rattails of flower and broad  leaves four feet by two which wither into whitybrown paper and  are used being tough and fibrous to wrap round the rowlocks of the  oars  tufts of karatas top spread their long prickly leaves among  the bush of rastrajo or second growth after the primeval forest  has been cleared which dips suddenly right and left to the beach   it and the little strip of flat ground behind it hold a three roomed cottageof course on stilts a shed which serves as a  kitchen a third ruined building which is tenanted mostly by  lizards and creeping flowers some twenty or thirty coconut trees  and on the very edge of the sea an almondtree its roots built up  to seaward with great stones its trunk hung with fishing lines and  around it scattered on the shingle strange shells bits of coral  coconuts and their fragments almonds from the tree the round scaly  fruit of the mauritia palm which has probably floated across the  gulf from the forests of the orinoco or the caroni and the long  seeds of the mangrove in shape like a roachfishers float and  already germinating their leaves showing at the upper end a tiny  root at the lower  in that shingle they will not take root  but  they are quite ready to go to sea again next tide and wander on for  weeks and for hundreds of miles till they run ashore at last on a  congenial bed of mud throw out spider legs right and left and hide  the foul mire with their gay green leaves  the almondtree 104 with its flat stages of large smooth leaves  and oily eatable seeds in an almondlike husk is not an almond at  all or any kin thereto  it has been named as so many west indian  plants have after some known plant to which it bore a likeness and  introduced hither and indeed to all shores from cuba to guiana  from the east indies through arabia and tropical africa having  begun its westward journey probably in the pocket of some  portuguese follower of vasco de gama  we beached the boat close to the almondtree and were welcomed on  shore by the lord of the cove a gallant redbearded scotsman with  a head and a heart a handsome creole wife and lovely brownish  children with no more clothes on than they could help  an old  sailor and muchwandering ulysses he is now coastguardman water bailiff policeman practical warden and indeed practical viceroy  of the island and an easy life of it he must have  the sea gives him fish enough for his family and for a brawny brown  servant  his coconut palms yield him a little revenue he has  poultry kids and goats milk more than he needs his patch of  provisionground in the place gives him corn and roots sweet  potatoes yam tania cassava and fruit too all the year round   he needs nothing owes nothing fears nothing  news and politics  are to him like the distant murmur of the surf at the back of the  island a noise which is nought to him  his bible his almanac and  three or four old books on a shelf are his whole library  he has  all that man needs more than man deserves and is far too wise to  wish to better himself  i sat down on the beach beneath the amber shade of the palms and  watched my white friends rushing into the clear sea and disporting  themselves there like so many otters while the policemans little  boy launched a log canoe not much longer than himself and paddled  out into the midst of them and then jumped upright in it a little  naked brown cupidon whereon he and his canoe were of course upset  and pushed under water and scrambled over and the whole cove rang  with shouts and splashing enough to scare away the boldest shark  had one been on watch off the point  i looked at the natural beauty  and repose at the human vigour and happiness  and i said to  myself and said it often afterwards in the west indies  why do not  other people copy this wise scot  why should not many a young  couple who have education refinement resources in themselves but  are happily or unhappily for them unable to keep a brougham and go  to london balls retreat to some such paradise as this and there  are hundreds like it to be found in the west indies leaving behind  them false civilisation and vain desires and useless show and  there live in simplicity and content the gentle life  it is not  true that the climate is too enervating  it is not true that nature  is here too strong for man  i have seen enough in trinidad i saw  enough even in little monos to be able to deny that and to say  that in the west indies as elsewhere a young man can be pure  able highminded industrious athletic  and i see no reason why a  woman should not be likewise all that she need be  a cultivated man and wife with a few hundreds a yearjust enough  in fact to enable them to keep a coolie servant or two might be  really wealthy in all which constitutes true wealth and might be  useful also in their place for each such couple would be a little  centre of civilisation for the negro the coolie and it may be for  certain young adventurers who coming out merely to make money and  return as soon as possible are but too apt to lose under the  double temptations of gain and of drink what elements of the  gentle life they have gained from their mothers at home  the following morning early we rowed away again full of longing  but not of hope of reaching one or other of the guacharo caves   keeping along under the lee of the island we crossed the umbrella  mouth between it and huevos or egg island  on our right were the  islands on our left the shoreless gulf and ahead the great  mountain of the mainland with a wreath of white fleece near its  summit and the shadows of clouds moving in dark patches up its  sides  as we crossed the tumbling swell which came in from the  outer sea and the columns of white spray which rose right and left  against the two doorposts of that mighty gateway augured ill for  our chances of entering a cave  but on we went with a warning not  to be upset if we could avoid it in the shape of a sharks back fin  above the oily swell and under huevos and round into a lonely  cove with high crumbling cliffs bedecked with cereus and aloes in  flower their tall spikes of green flowers standing out against the  sky twenty or thirty feet in height and beds of short wild pine apples 106 like amberyellow fur and here and there hanging  leaves trailing down to the water and on into a nook the sight of  which made us give up all hopes of the cave but which in itself was  worth coming from europe to see  the work of ages of tradesurf had  cut the island clean through with a rocky gully between soft rocks  some hundred feet in width  it was just passable at high tide and  through it we were to have rowed and turned to the left to the cave  in the windward cliffs  but ere we reached it the war outside said  no in a voice which would take no denial and when we beached the  boat behind a high rock and scrambled up to look out we saw a  sight one half of which was not unworthy of the cliffs of hartland  or bude  on the farther side of the knife edge of rock crumbling  fast into the sea a waste of breakers rolled through the chasm  though there was scarcely any wind to drive them leaping spouting  crashing hammering down the soft cliffs which seemed to crumble  and did doubtless crumble at every blow and beyond that the open  blue sea without a rock or a sail hazy in spite of the blazing  sunlight beneath the clouds of spray  but there ceased the  likeness to a rock scene on the cornish coast for at the other foot  of the rock not twenty yards from that wild uproar the landlocked  cove up which we had come lay still as glass and the rocks were  richer with foliage than an english orchard  everywhere down into  the very sea the matapalos held and hung their airroots dangled  into the very water many of them had fallen into it but grew on  still and blossomed with great white fragrant flowers somewhat  like those of a magnolia each with a shining cake of amber wax as  big as a shilling in the centre and over the matapalos tree on  tree liane on liane up to a negro garden with its strange huge leaved vegetables and glossy fruittrees and its black owner  standing on the cliff and peering down out of his little nest with  grinning teeth and white wondering eyes at the white men who were  gathering off a few yards of beach among the great fallen leaves  of the matapalos such shells as delighted our childhood in the west  india cabinet at home  we lingered long filling our eyes with beauty  and then rowed  away  what more was to be done  through that very chasm we were to  have passed out to the cave  and yet the sight of this delicious  nook repaid usso more than one of the party thoughtfor our  disappointment  there was another guacharo cave in the monos  channel more under the lee  we would try that tomorrow  as the sun sank that evening we sat ourselves upon the eastern  rocks and gazed away into the pale sad boundless west while  venus hung high not a point as here but a broad disc of light  throwing a long gleam over the sea  fish skipped over the clear  calm water and above pelicansthe younger brown the older gray wheeled round and round in lordly flight paused gave a sudden  halfturn then fell into the water with widespread wings and after  a splash rose with another skipjack in their pouch  as it grew  dark dark things came trooping over the sea by twos and threes  then twenty at a time all past us toward a cave near by  birds we  fancied them at first of the colour and size of starlings but they  proved to be bats and bats too which have the reputation of  catching fish  so goes the tale believed by some who see them  continually and have a keen eye for nature and who say that the  bat sweeps the fish up off the top of the water with the scooplike  membrane of his hindlegs and tail  for this last fact i will not  vouch  but i am assured that fish scales were found after i left  the island in the stomachs of these bats and that of the fact of  their picking up small fish there can be no doubt  you could not  says a friend be out at night in a boat and hear their continual  swish swish in the water without believing it  if so the habit  is a quaint change of nature in them for they belong i am assured  by my friend professor newton not to the insecteating but to the  fruiteating family of bats who in the west as in the east indies  may be seen at night hovering round the mangotrees and destroying  much more fruit than they eat  so we sat watching the little dark things flit by like the  gibbering ghosts of the suitors in the odyssey into the darkness of  the cave and then turned to long talk of things concerning which it  is best nowadays not to write till it was time to feel our way  indoors by such light as venus gave over the slippery rocks and  then cautiously enough past the manchineel 107 bush a broken  sprig of which would have raised an instant blister on the face or  hand  our night as often happens in the tropics was not altogether  undisturbed for shortly after i had become unconscious of the  chorus of toads and cicadas my hammock came down by the head  then  i was woke by a sudden bark close outside exactly like that of a  clicketting fox but as the dogs did not reply or give chase i  presumed it to be the cry of a bird possibly a little owl  next  there rushed down the mountain a storm of wind and rain which made  the cocoleaves flap and creak and rattle against the gable of the  house and set every door and window banging till they were caught  and brought to reason  and between the howls of the wind i became  aware of a strange noise from seawarda booming or rather humming  most like that which a locomotive sometimes makes when blowing off  steam  it was faint and distant but deep and strong enough to set  one guessing its cause  the sea beating into caves seemed at  first the simplest answer  but the water was so still on our side  of the island that i could barely hear the lap of the ripple on the  shingle twenty yards off and the nearest surf was a mile or two  away over a mountain a thousand feet high  so puzzling vainly i  fell asleep to awake in the gray dawn to the prettiest idyllic  picture through the halfopen door of two kids dancing on a stone  at the foot of a coconut tree with a background of sea and dark  rocks  as we went to bathe we heard again in perfect calm the same  mysterious booming sound and were assured by those who ought to  have known that it came from under the water and was most probably  made by none other than the famous musical or drum fish of whom one  had heard and hardly believed much in past years  mr joseph author of the history of trinidad from which i have so  often quoted reports that the first time he heard this singular  fish was on board a schooner at anchor off chaguaramas  immediately under the vessel i heard a deep and not unpleasant  sound similar to those one might imagine to proceed from a thousand  aeolian harps this ceased and deep twanging notes succeeded these  gradually swelled into an uninterrupted stream of singular sounds  like the booming of a number of chinese gongs under the water to  these succeeded notes that had a faint resemblance to a wild chorus  of a hundred human voices singing out of tune in deep bass  in whites voyage to cochin china adds mr joseph there is as  good a description of this or a similar submarine concert as mere  words can convey  this the voyager heard in the eastern seas  he  was told the singers were a flat kind of fish he however did not  see them  might not this fish he asks or one resembling it in vocal  qualities have given rise to the fable of the sirens  it might certainly if the fact be true  moreover mr joseph does  not seem to be aware that the old spanish conquistadores had a myth  that music was to be heard in this very gulf of paria and that at  certain seasons the nymphs and tritons assembled therein and with  ravishing strains sang their watery loves  the story of the music  has been usually treated as a sailors fable and the sirens and  tritons supposed to be mere stupid manatis or seacows coming in  as they do still now and then to browse on mangrove shoots and  turtlegrass  110 but if the story of the music be true the myth  may have had a double root  meanwhile i see hardwickes science gossip for march gives an  extract from a letter of m o de thoron communicated by him to the  academie des sciences december 1861 which confirms mr josephs  story  he asserts that in the bay of pailon in esmeraldos  ecuador ie on the pacific coast and also up more than one of the  rivers he has heard a similar sound attributed by the natives to a  fish which they call the siren or musico  at first he says  he thought it was produced by a fly or hornet of extraordinary  size but afterwards having advanced a little farther he heard a  multitude of different voices which harmonised together imitating  a church organ to great perfection  the good people of trinidad  believe that the fish which makes this noise is the trumpetfish or  fistulariaa beast strange enough in shape to be credited with  strange actions  but ichthyologists say positively no  that the  noise at least along the coast of the united states is made by a  pogonias a fish somewhat like a great bearded perch and cousin of  the maigre of the mediterranean which is accused of making a  similar purring or grunting noise which can be heard from a depth  of one hundred and twenty feet and guides the fishermen to their  whereabouts  how the noise is made is a question  cuvier was of opinion that it  was made by the airbladder though he could not explain how  but  the truth if truth it be seems stranger still  these fish it  seems have strong bony palates and throatteeth for crushing shells  and crabs and make this wonderful noise simply by grinding their  teeth together  i vouch for nothing save that i heard this strange humming more  than once  as for the cause of it i can only say as was said of  yore that i hold it for rashness to determine aught amid such  fertility of natures wonders  one afternoon we made an attempt on the other guacharo cave which  lies in the cliff on the landward side of the monos boca  but  alas the wind had chopped a little to the northward a swell was  rolling in through the boca and when we got within twenty yards of  the lowbrowed arch our crew lay on their oars and held a  consultation of which there could but be one result  they being  white gentlemen and not negroes could trust themselves and each  other and were ready as i know well to dare all that became a  man  but every now and then a swell rolled in high enough to have  cracked our sculls against the top and out again deep enough to  have staved the boat against the rocks  if we went to wreck the  current was setting strongly out to sea and the boca was haunted by  sharks and according to the late colonel hamilton smith by a  worse monster still namely the giant ray 111a which goes by the  name of devilfish on the carolina shores  he saw he says one of  these monsters rise in this very boca at a sailor who had fallen  overboard cover him with one of his broad wings and sweep him down  into the depths  and on the whole if guacharos are precious so  is life  so like gyges of old we elected to survive and rowed  away with wistful eyes determining to get guacharosa  determination which was never carried outfrom one of the limestone  caverns of the northern mountains  and now it may be asked and reasonably enough what guacharos  111b are and why five english gentlemen and a canny scots  coastguardman should think it worth while to imperil their lives to  obtain them  i cannot answer better than by giving humboldts account of the cave  of caripe on the spanish main hard by where he discovered them or  rather described them to civilised europe for the first time  the cueva del guacharo is pierced in the vertical profile of a  rock  the entrance is towards the south and forms a vault eighty  feet broad and seventytwo feet high  this elevation is but a fifth  less than the colonnade of the louvre  the rock that surmounts the  grotto is covered with trees of gigantic height  the mammeetree  and the genipa with large and shining leaves raise their branches  vertically towards the sky while those of the courbaril and the  erythrina form as they extend themselves a thick vault of verdure   plants of the family of pothos with succulent stems oxalises and  orchideae of a singular construction rise in the driest clefts of  the rocks while creeping plants waving in the winds are interwoven  in festoons before the opening of the cavern  we distinguished in  these festoons a bignonia of a violet blue the purple dolichos  and for the first time that magnificent solandra the orange  flower of which has a fleshy tube more than four inches long  the  entrances of grottoes like the view of cascades derive their  principal charm from the situation more or less majestic in which  they are placed and which in some sort determines the character of  the landscape  what a contrast between the cueva of caripe and  those caverns of the north crowned with oaks and gloomy larchtrees  but this luxury of vegetation embellishes not only the outside of  the vault it appears even in the vestibule of the grotto  we saw  with astonishment plantainleaved heliconias eighteen feet high  the praga palmtrees and arborescent arums follow the banks of the  river even to those subterranean places  the vegetation continues  in the cave of caripe as in the deep crevices of the andes half  excluded from the light of day and does not disappear till  advancing in the interior we reach thirty or forty paces from the  entrance     the guacharo quits the cavern at nightfall especially when the  moon shines  it is almost the only frugivorous nocturnal bird that  is yet known the conformation of its feet sufficiently shows that  it does not hunt like our owls  it feeds on very hard fruits as  the nutcracker and the pyrrhocorax  the latter nestles also in  clefts of rocks and is known under the name of nightcrow  the  indians assured us that the guacharo does not pursue either the  lamellicorn insects or those phalaenae which serve as food to the  goatsuckers  it is sufficient to compare the beaks of the guacharo  and goatsucker to conjecture how much their manners must differ   it is difficult to form an idea of the horrible noise occasioned by  thousands of these birds in the dark part of the cavern and which  can only be compared to the croaking of our crows which in the pine  forests of the north live in society and construct their nests upon  trees the tops of which touch each other  the shrill and piercing  cries of the guacharos strike upon the vaults of the rocks and are  repeated by the echo in the depth of the cavern  the indians showed  us the nests of these birds by fixing torches to the end of a long  pole  these nests were fifty or sixty feet high above our heads in  holes in the shape of funnels with which the roof of the grotto is  pierced like a sieve  the noise increased as we advanced and the  birds were affrighted by the light of the torches of copal  when  this noise ceased a few minutes around us we heard at a distance the  plaintive cries of the birds roosting in other ramifications of the  cavern  it seemed as if these bands answered each other  alternately  the indians enter into the cueva del guacharo once a year near  midsummer armed with poles by means of which they destroy the  greater part of the nests  at this season several thousands of  birds are killed and the old ones as if to defend their brood  hover over the heads of the indians uttering terrible cries  the  young which fall to the ground are opened on the spot  their  peritoneum is extremely loaded with fat and a layer of fat reaches  from the abdomen to the anus forming a kind of cushion between the  legs of the bird  this quantity of fat in frugivorous animals not  exposed to the light and exerting very little muscular motion  reminds us of what has been long since observed in the fattening of  geese and oxen  it is well known how favourable darkness and repose  are to this process  the nocturnal birds of europe are lean  because instead of feeding on fruits like the guacharo they live  on the scanty produce of their prey  at the period which is  commonly called at caripe the oil harvest the indians build huts  with palmleaves near the entrance and even in the porch of the  cavern  of these we still saw some remains  there with a fire of  brushwood they melt in pots of clay the fat of the young birds just  killed  this fat is known by the name of butter or oil manteca or  aceite of the guacharo  it is half liquid transparent without  smell and so pure that it may be kept above a year without becoming  rancid  at the convent of caripe no other oil is used in the  kitchen of the monks but that of the cavern and we never observed  that it gave the aliments a disagreeable taste or smell  young guacharos have been sent to the port or cumana and lived  there several days without taking any nourishment the seeds offered  to them not suiting their taste  when the crops and gizzards of the  young birds are opened in the cavern they are found to contain all  sorts of hard and dry fruits which furnish under the singular name  of guacharo seed semilla del guacharo a very celebrated remedy  against intermittent fevers  the old birds carry these seeds to  their young  they are carefully collected and sent to the sick at  cariaco and other places of the low regions where fevers are  prevalent     the natives connect mystic ideas with this cave inhabited by  nocturnal birds they believe that the souls of their ancestors  sojourn in the deep recesses of the cavern  man say they  should avoid places which are enlightened neither by the sun zis  nor by the moon nuna  to go and join the guacharos is to rejoin  their fathers is to die  the magicians piaches and the poisoners  imorons perform their nocturnal tricks at the entrance of the  cavern to conjure the chief of the evil spirits ivorokiamo  thus  in every climate the first fictions of nations resemble each other  those especially which relate to two principles governing the world  the abode of souls after death the happiness of the virtuous and  the punishment of the guilty  the most different and barbarous  languages present a certain number of images which are the same  because they have their source in the nature of our intellect and  our sensations  darkness is everywhere connected with the idea of  death  the grotto of caripe is the tartarus of the greeks and the  guacharos which hover over the rivulet uttering plaintive cries  remind us of the stygian birds     the missionaries with all their authority could not prevail on  the indians to penetrate farther into the cavern  as the vault grew  lower the cries of the guacharos became more shrill  we were  obliged to yield to the pusillanimity of our guides and trace back  our steps  the appearance of the cavern was indeed very uniform   we find that a bishop of st thomas of guiana had gone farther than  ourselves  he had measured nearly two thousand five hundred feet  from the mouth to the spot where he stopped though the cavern  reached farther  the remembrance or this fact was preserved in the  convent of caripe without the exact period being noted  the bishop  had provided himself with great torches of white wax of castille   we had torches composed only of the bark of trees and native resin   the thick smoke which issues from these torches in a narrow  subterranean passage hurts the eyes and obstructs the respiration  we followed the course of the torrent to go out of the cavern   before our eyes were dazzled by the light of day we saw without  the grotto the water of the river sparkling amid the foliage of the  trees that concealed it  it was like a picture placed in the  distance and to which the mouth of the cavern served as a frame   having at length reached the entrance and seated ourselves on the  banks of the rivulet we rested after our fatigue  we were glad to  be beyond the hoarse cries of the birds and to leave a place where  darkness does not offer even the charm of silence and tranquillity   we could scarcely persuade ourselves that the name of the grotto of  caripe had hitherto remained unknown in europe  the guacharos alone  would have been sufficient to render it celebrated  these nocturnal  birds have been nowhere yet discovered except in the mountains of  caripe and cumanacoa  so much from the great master who was not aware never having  visited trinidad that the guacharo was well known there under the  name of diablotin  but his account of caripe was fully corroborated  by my host who had gone there last year and by the help of the  magnesium light had penetrated farther into the cave than either  the bishop or humboldt  he had brought home also several guacharos  from the trinidad caves all of which died on the passage for want  seemingly of the oily nuts on which they feed  a live guacharo  has as yet never been seen in europe and to get one safe to the  zoological gardens as well as to get one or two corpses for the  cambridge museum was our hopea hope still alas unfulfilled  a  nest however of the guacharo has been brought to england by my  host since my departure a round lump of mud of the size and shape  of a large cheese with a shallow depression on the top in which  the eggs are laid  a list of the seeds found in the stomachs of  guacharos by my friend mr prestoe of the botanical gardens port of  spain will be found in an appendix  we rowed away toward our island paradise  but instead of going  straight home we turned into a deep cove called ance mauriceall  coves in the french islands are called anceswhere was something to  be seen and not to be forgotten again  we grated in over a  shallow bottom of pebbles interspersed with gray lumps of coral  pulp and of botrylli azure crimson and all the hues of the  flowergarden and landed on the bank of a mangrove swamp bored  everywhere with the holes of landcrabs  one glance showed how  these swamps are formed  by that want of tide which is the curse of  the west indies  at every valley mouth the beating of the waves tends all the year  round to throw up a bank of sand and shingle damming the landwater  back to form a lagoon  this might indeed empty itself during the  floods of the rainy season but during the dry season it must remain  a stagnant pond filling gradually with festering vegetable matter  from the hills beercoloured and as hideous to look at as it is to  smell  were there a tide as in england of from ten to twenty  feet that swamp would be drained twice a day to nearly that depth  and healthy vegetation as in england establish itself down to the  very beach  a tide of a foot or eighteen inches only as is too  common in the west indies will only drain the swamp to that depth  and probably if there be any strong pebblebearing surf outside  not at all  so there it all lies festering in the sun and cooking  poison day and night while the mangroves and graceful white roseaux  115a tall canes kindly do their best to lessen the mischief by  rooting in the slush and absorbing the poison with their leaves  a  white man sleeping one night on the edge of that pestilential  little triangle half an acre in size would be in danger of  catching a fever and ague which would make a weaker man of him for  the rest of his life  and yet so thoroughly fitted for the climate  is the negro that not ten yards from the edge of the mud stood a  comfortable negrohouse with stout healthy folk therein evidently  well to do in the world to judge from the poultry and the fruit trees and provisionground which stretched up the glen  through the provisionground we struggled up among weeds as high as  our shoulders so that it was difficult as usual to distinguish  garden from forest  but no matter to the black owner  the weeds  were probably of only six weeks growth and when they got so high  that he actually could not find his tanias 115b among them he  would take cutlass and hoe and make a lazy raid upon them or  rather upon a quarter of them certain of two facts that in six  weeks more they would be all as high as ever and that if they were  it did not matter for so fertile is the soil so genial the  climate that he would get in spite of them more crop off the ground  than he needed  pity the poor weeds  is there not room enough in  the world for them and for us seems the negros motto  but he  knows his own business well enough and can exert himself when he  really needs to do so and if the weeds harmed him seriously he  would make short work with them  still this soil and this climate  put a premium on bad farming as they do on much else that is bad  up we pushed along the narrow path past curious spiral flags 115c  just throwing out their heads of delicate white or purple flower  and under the shade of great balisiers or wild plantains 115d  with leaves six or eight feet long and many another curious plant  unknown to me and then through a little copse of which we had to  beware for it was all black roseau 115ea sort of dwarf palm  some fifteen feet high whose stems are covered with black steel  needles which on being touched run right through your finger or  your hand if you press hard enough and then break off on which  you cut them out if you can  if you cannot they are apt like  needles to make voyages about among the muscles and reappear at  some unexpected spot causing serious harm  of all the vegetable  pests of the forest none not even the crocchien is so ugly a  neighbour as certain varieties of black roseau  all this whilei fear i may be prolix  but one must write as one  walked stopping every moment to seize something new and longing  for as many pairs of eyes as a spiderall this while i say we  heard the roar of the tradesurf growing louder and louder in front  and pushing cautiously through the roseau found ourselves on a  cliff thirty feet high and on the other side of the island  now it was plain how the bocas had been made for here was one  making  before us seethed a shallow horseshoe bay almost a lake some two  hundred yards across inside but far narrower at the mouth  into  it between two lofty points of hard rock worn into caves and  pillars and natural arches the tradesurf came raging in from the  north hurling columns of foam right and left and then whirling  round and round beneath us upon a narrow shore of black sand with  such fury that one seemed to see the land torn away by each wave   the cliffs some thirty feet high where we stood rose to some  hundred at the mouth in intense black and copper and olive shadows  with one bright green tree in front of a caves mouth on which it  seemed the sun had never shone while a thousand feet overhead were  glimpses of the wooded mountaintops with tender slanting lights  for the sun was growing low through bluegray mist on copse and  lawn high above  a huge darkheaded balata 116a like a storm torn scotch pine crowned the lefthand cliff two or three young  fanpalms 116b just ready to topple headlong the righthand one  and beyond all through the great gateway gleamed as elsewhere the  foamflecked hazy blue of the caribbean sea  we stood spellbound for a minute at the sudden change of scene and  of feeling  from the still choking blazing steam of the leeward  glen we had stepped in a moment into coolness and darkness  pervaded by the delicious rush of the northeastern wind into a  hidden sanctuary of nature where one would have liked to build and  live and die  had not a second glance warned us that to die was the  easiest of the three  for the whole cliff was falling daily into  the sea and it was hardly safe to venture to the beach for fear of  falling stones and earth  down however we went by a natural ladder of matapalo roots and  saw at once how the cove was being formed  the rocks are probably  silurian and if so of quite immeasurable antiquity  but instead  of being hard as silurian rocks are wont to be they are mere loose  beds of dark sand and shale yellow with sulphur or black with  carbonaceous matter amid which strange flakes and nodules of white  quartz lie loose ready to drop out at the blow of every wave  the  strata too sloped upward and outward toward the sea which is  therefore able to undermine them perpetually and thus the searching  surge having once formed an entrance in the cliff face between  what are now the two outer points has had nought to do but to gnaw  inward and will gnaw till the isle of monos is cut sheer in two  and the ance biscayen as the wonderful little bay is called will  join itself to the ance maurice and the gulf of paria  in two or  three generations hence the little palmwood will have fallen into  the sea  in two or three more the negro house and garden and the  mangrove swamp will be gone likewise  and in their place the trade surf will be battering into the gulf of paria from the northern sea  through just such a mountain chasm as we saw at huevos and a new  boca will have been opened  but not understand a deep and navigable one as long as the land  retains its present level  to make that there must be a general  subsidence of the land and sea bottom around  for surf when eating  into land gnaws to little deeper than lowwater mark  no deeper  probably than the bottoms of the troughs between the waves  its  tendency isas one may see along the ramsgate cliffsto pare the  land away into a flat plain just covered by a shallow sea  no surf  or currents could nave carved out the smaller bocas to a depth of  between twenty and eighty fathoms much less the great boca of the  dragons mouth between chacachacarra and the spanish main to a  depth of more than seventy fathoms  they are sunken mountain  passes whose sides have been since carved into upright cliffs by  the gnawing of the sea and as mr wall well observes 117 the  situation of the bocas is in a depression of the range perhaps of  the highest antiquity  we wandered along the beach looking up at a cliff clothed wherever  it was not actually falling away with richest verdure down to the  waters edge but in general utterly bare falling away too fast to  give roothold to any plant  we lay down on the black sand and  gazed and gazed and picked up quartz crystals fallen from above  and wondered how the cove had got its name  had some old biscayan  whaler from biarritz or st jean de luz wandered into these seas  in search of fish when in the beginning of the seventeenth  century he and his fellows had killed out all the right whales of  the bay of biscay  and had he missing the bocas been wrecked and  perished as he may well have done against those awful walls  at  last we turned to reascendfor the tide was risingafter our  leader had congratulated us on being perhaps the only white men  who had ever seen ance biscayena congratulation which was  premature for as we went to climb up the matapaloroot ladder we  were stopped by several pairs of legs coming down it which  belonged it seemed to a bathing party of pleasant french people  marooning as picnicking is called here on the island and after  them descended the yellow frock of a dominican monk who when  landed was discovered to be an old friend now working hard among  the roman catholic negroes of port of spain  on the way back to our island paradise we found along the shore two  plants worth noticeone a low tree with leaves somewhat like box  but obovate larger at the tip than at the stalk and racemes of  little white flowers of a delicious honeyscent 118a  it ought to  be if it be not yet introduced into england as a charming  addition to the winter hothouse  as for the other plant would that  it could be introduced likewise or rather that if introduced it  would flower in a house for it is a glorious climber second only  to that which poor dr krueger calls the wonderful norantea which  shall be described in its place  you see a tree blazing with dark  gold passing into orange and that to red and on nearing it find  it tiled all over with the flowers of a creeper 118b arranged in  flat rows of spreading brushes some foot or two long and holding  each hundreds of flowers growing on one side only of the twig and  turning their multitudinous golden and orange stamens upright to the  sun  therei cannot describe it  it must be seen first afar off  and then close to understand the vagaries of splendour in which  nature indulges here  and yet the norantea common in the high  woods is even more splendid and in a botanists eyes a stranger  vagary still  on past the whaling quay  it was deserted for the whales had not  yet come in and there was no chance of seeing a night scene which  is described as horribly beautifulthe sharks around a whale while  flensing is going on each monster bathed in phosphorescent light  which makes his whole outline and every fin even his evil eyes and  teeth visible far under water as the glittering fiend comes up  from below snaps his lump out of the whales side and is  shouldered out of the way by his fellows  we were unlucky indeed  in the matter of sharks for with the exception of a problematical  backfin or two we saw none in the west indies though they were  swarming round us  the next day the boats head was turned homewards  and what had  been learnt at the little bay of alice biscayen suggested as we  went on a fresh geological question  how the outer islands of the  bocas had been formed or were being formed was clear enough  but  what about the inner islands  gaspar grande and diego and the  five islands and the peninsulaor islandof punta grande  how  were these isolated lumps of limestone hewn out into high points  with steep cliffs not to the windward but to the leeward  what  made the steep cliff at the south end of punta grande on which a  mangrove swamp now abuts  no tradesurf no current capable of  doing that work has disturbed the dull waters of the golfo  triste as the spaniards named the gulf of paria since the land  was of anything like its present shape  and gradually we began to  dream of a time when the bocas did not exist when the spanish main  was joined to the northern mountains of the island by dry land now  submerged or eaten away by the tradesurf when the northern  currents of the orinoco instead of escaping through the bocas as  now were turned eastward past these very islands and along the  foot of the northern mountains over what is now the great lowland  of trinidad depositing those rich semi alluvial strata which have  been since upheaved and sawing down along the southern slope of the  mountains those vast beds of shingle and quartz boulders which now  form as it were a gigantic ancient seabeach right across the  island  a dream it may be  but one which seemed reasonable enough  to more than one in the boat and which subsequent observations  tended to verify    chapter vii  the high woods    i have seen them at last  i have been at last in the high woods as  the primeval forest is called here and they are not less but more  wonderful than i had imagined them  but they must wait awhile for  in reaching them though they were only ten miles off i passed  through scenes so various and so characteristic of the tropics  that i cannot do better than sketch them one by one  i drove out in the darkness of the dawn under the bamboos and  bauhinias and palms which shade the road between the botanic  gardens and the savannah toward port of spain  the frogs and  cicalas had nearly finished their nightly music  the fireflies had  been in bed since midnight  the air was heavy with the fragrance of  the bauhinias and after i passed the great australian bluegum  which overhangs the road and the wallabatree 120a with its thin  curved pods dangling from innumerable bootlaces six feet long  almost too heavy with the fragrance of the white ixora 120b  a  flush of rose was rising above the eastern mountains and it was  just light enough to see overhead the great flowers of the bois  chataigne 120c among its horsechestnutlike leaves red flowers  as big as a childs two hands with petals as long as its fingers   children of mylitta the moon goddess they cannot abide the day and  will fall brown and shrivelled before the sun grows high after  one night of beauty and life and probably of enjoyment  even more  swiftly fades an even more delicate child of the moon the ipomoea  bonanox whose snowwhite patines as broad as the hand open at  nightfall on every hedge and shrivel up with the first rays of  dawn  on through the long silent street of port of spain where the air  was heavy with everything but the fragrance of ixoras and the dogs  and vultures sat about the streets and were all but driven over  every few yards till i picked up a guidewill he let me say a  friendan aberdeenshire scot who hurried out fresh from his bath  his trusty cutlass on his hip and in heavy shootingboots and  gaiters for no clothing be it remembered is too strong for the  bush and those who enter it in the white calico garments in which  westindia planters figure on the stage are like to leave in it  not only their clothes but their skin besides  in five minutes more we were on board the gig and rowing away south  over the muddy mirror and in ten minutes more the sun was up and  blazing so fiercely that we were glad to cool ourselves in fancy by  talking over salmonfishings in scotland and new brunswick and  wadings in icy streams beneath the black pinewoods  behind us were the blue mountains streaked with broad lights and  shades by the level sun  on our left the interminable low line of  bright green mangrove danced and quivered in the mirage and loomed  up in front miles away till single trees seemed to hang in air far  out at sea  on our right hot mists wandered over the water  blotting out the horizon till the coasting craft with distorted  sails and masts seemed afloat in smoke  one might have fancied  oneself in the wash off sandringham on a burning summers noon  soon logs and stumps standing out of the water marked the mouth of  the caroni and we had to take a sweep out seaward to avoid its mud banks  over that very spot now unnavigable raleigh and his men  sailed in to conquer trinidad  on one log a huge black and white heron moped all alone looking in  the mist as tall as a man and would not move for all our shouts   schools of fish dimpled the water and brown pelicans fell upon  them dashing up fountains of silver  the tradebreeze as it rose  brought off the swamps a sickly smell suggestive of the need of  coffee quinine angostura bitters or some other febrifuge  in  spite of the glorious sunshine the whole scene was sad desolate  almost depressing from its monotony vastness silence and we were  glad when we neared the high tree which marks the entrance of the  chaguanas creek and turned at last into a recess in the mangrove  bushes a desolate pool round which the mangrove roots formed an  impenetrable net  as far as the eye could pierce into the tangled  thicket the roots interlaced with each other and arched down into  the water in innumerable curves by no means devoid of grace but  hideous just because they were impenetrable  who could get over  those roots or through the scrub which stood stilted on them  letting down at every yard or two fresh airroots from off its  boughs to add fresh tangle as they struck into the mud to the  horrible imbroglio  if one had got in among them i fancied one  would never have got out again  struggling over and under endless  trapwork without footing on it or on the mud below one must have  sunk exhausted in an hour or two to die of fatigue and heat or  chill and fever  let the mangrove foliage be as gay and green as it mayand it is  gay and greena mangrove swamp is a sad ugly evil place and so i  felt that one to be that day  the only moving things were some large fish who were leaping high  out of water close to the bushes glittering in the sun  they  stopped as we came up  and then all was still till a slateblue  heron 122a rose lazily off a dead bough flapped fifty yards up  the creek and then sat down again  the only sound beside the  rattle of our oars was the metallic note of a pigeon in the high  tree which i mistook then and afterwards for the sound of a horn  on we rowed looking out sharply right and left for an alligator  basking on the mud among the mangrove roots  but none appeared  though more than one probably was watching us with nothing of him  above water but his horny eyes  the heron flapped on ahead and  settled once more as if leading us on up the ugly creek which grew  narrower and fouler till the oars touched the bank on each side  and drove out of the water shoals of foureyed fish ridiculous  little things about as long as your hand who instead of diving to  the bottom like reasonable fish seemed possessed with the fancy  that they could succeed better in the air or on land and  accordingly jumped over each others backs scrambled out upon the  mud swam about with their goggleeyes projecting above the surface  of the water and in fact did anything but behave like fish  this little creature stargazer 122b as some call him is you  must understand one of the curiosities of trinidad and of the  guiana coast  he looks on the whole like a gray mullet with a  large blunt head out of which stand almost like horns the eyes  from which he takes his name  you may see in woods illustrated  natural history a drawing of him which isi am sorry to sayone  of the very few bad ones in the book and read how at a first  glance the fish appears to possess four distinct eyes each of  these organs being divided across the middle and apparently  separated into two distinct portions  in fact an opaque band runs  transversely across the corner of the eye and the iris or coloured  portion sends out two processes which meet each other under the  transverse band of the cornea so that the fish appears to possess  even a double pupil  still on closer investigation the  connection between the divisions of the pupil are apparent and can  readily be seen in the young fish  the lens is shaped something  like a jargonelle pear and so arranged that its broad extremity is  placed under the large segment of the cornea  these strangely specialised eyesso folks believe herethe fish  uses by halves  with the lower halves he sees through the water  with the upper halves through the air and elevated by this quaint  privilege he aspires to be a terrestrial animal emulating i  presume the alligators around and tries to take his walks upon the  mud  you may see as you go down to bathe on the east coast a  group of black dots in pairs peering up out of the sand at the  very highest verge of the surfline  as you approach them they  leap up and prove themselves to belong to a party of foureyes who  runthere is no other worddown the beach dash into the roaring  surf and the moment they see you safe in the sea run back again on  the next wave and begin staring at the sky once more  he who sees  foureyes for the first time without laughing must be much wiser or  much stupider than any man has a right to be  suddenly the mangroves opened and the creek ended in a wharf with  barges alongside  baulks of strange timbers lay on shore  sheds  were full of empty sugarcasks ready for the approaching croptime   a truck was waiting for us on a tramway and we scrambled on shore  on a bed of rich black mud to be received of course in true west  indian fashion with all sorts of courtesies and kindnesses  and here let me say that those travellers who complain of  discourtesy in the west indies can have only themselves to thank for  it  the west indian has selfrespect and will not endure people  who give themselves airs  he has prudence too and will not endure  people whom he expects to betray his hospitality by insulting him  afterwards in print  but he delights in pleasing in giving in  showing his lovely islands to all who will come and see them  creole immigrant coloured or white man spaniard frenchman  englishman or scotchman each and all will prove themselves  thoughtful hosts and agreeable companions if they be only treated  as gentlemen usually expect to be treated elsewhere  on board a  certain steamer it was once proposed that the royal mail steam  packet company should issue cheap sixmonth season tickets to the  west indies available for those who wished to spend the winter in  wandering from island to island  the want of hotels was objected  naturally enough by an englishman present  but he was answered at  once that one or two good introductions to a single island would  ensure hospitality throughout the whole archipelago  a longlegged mule after gibbing enough to satisfy his own self respect condescended to trot off with us up the tramway which lay  along a green drove strangely like one in the cambridgeshire fens   but in the ditches grew a pea with large yellow flowerspikes which  reminded us that we were not in england and beyond the ditches rose  on either side not wheat and beans but sugarcane ten and twelve  feet high  and a noble grass it is with its stems as thick as  ones wrist tillering out below in bold curves over the wellhoed  dark soil and its broad bright leaves falling and folding above in  curves as bold as those of the stems  handsome enough thus but  more handsome still i am told when the arrow as the flower is  called spreads over the canepiece a purple haze which flickers in  long shining waves before the breeze  one only fault it has that  from the luxuriance of its growth no wind can pass through it and  that therefore the heat of a canefield trace is utterly stifling   here and there we passed a still uncultivated spot a desolate reedy  swamp with pools and stunted alderlike trees reminding us again  of the deep fens while the tall chimneys of the sugarworks and  the high woods beyond completed the illusion  one might have been  looking over holm fen toward caistor hanglands or over deeping  toward the remnants of the ancient bruneswald  soon however we had a broad hint that we were not in the fens but  in a tropic island  a window in heaven above was suddenly opened  out of it without the warning cry of gardyloowell known in  edinburgh of olda bucket of warm water happily clean was emptied  on each of our heads and the next moment all was bright again  a  thundershower without a warning thunderclap was to me a new  phenomenon which was repeated several times that day  the  suddenness and the heaviness of the tropic showers at this season is  as amusing as it is trying  the umbrella or the waterproof must be  always ready or you will get wet through  and getting wet here is  a much more serious matter than in a temperate climate where you  may ride or walk all day in wet clothes and take no harm for the  rapid radiation produced by the intense sunshine causes a chill  which may beget only too easily fever and ague not to be as easily  shaken off  the cause of these rapid and heavy showers is simple enough  the  tradewind at this season of the year is saturated with steam from  the ocean which it has crossed and the least disturbance in its  temperature from ascending hot air or descending cold precipitates  the steam in a sudden splash of water out of a cloud if there  happens to be one near if not out of the clear air  therefore it  is that these showers when they occur in the daytime are most  common about noon simply because then the streams of hot air rise  most frequently and rapidly to struggle with the cooler layers  aloft  there is thunder of course in the west indies continuous  and terrible  but it occurs after midsummer at the breaking up of  the dry season and coming on of the wet  at last the truck stopped at a managers house with a palmiste  124 or cabbagepalm on each side of the garden gate a pair of  columns which any prince would have longed for as ornaments for his  lawn  it is the fashion here and a good fashion it is to leave  the palmistes a few at least when the land is cleared or to plant  them near the house merely on account of their wonderful beauty   one palmiste was pointed out to me in a field near the road which  had been measured by its shadow at noon and found to be one hundred  and fiftythree feet in height  for more than a hundred feet the  stem rose straight smooth and gray  then three or four spathes of  flowers four or five feet long each jutted out and upward like  while from below them as usual one dead leaf twenty feet long or  more dangled head downwards in the breeze  above them rose as  always the green portion of the stem for some twenty feet and then  the flat crown of feathers as dark as yew spread out against the  blue sky looking small enough up there though forty feet at least  in breadth  no wonder if the man who possessed such a glorious  object dared not destroy it though he spared it for a different  reason from that for which the negroes spare whenever they can the  gigantic ceibas or silk cotton trees  these latter are useless as  timber and their roots are of course hurtful to the canes  but  the negro is shy of felling the ceiba  it is a magic tree haunted  by spirits  there are too much jumbies in him the negro says  and of those who dare to cut him down some one will die or come to  harm within the year  in jamaica says my friend mr gosse they  believe that if a person throws a stone at the trunk he will be  visited with sickness or other misfortune  when they intend to cut  one down they first pour rum at the root as a propitiatory  offering  the jamaica negro however fells them for canoes the  wood being soft and easily hollowed  but here as in demerara the  trees are left standing about in canepieces and pastures to decay  into awful and fantastic shapes with prickly spurs and boardwalls  of roots high enough to make a house among them simply by roofing  them in and a flat crown of boughs some seventy or eighty feet  above the ground each bough as big as an average english tree from  which dangles a whole world of lianes matapalos orchids wild  pines with long airroots or gray beards and last but not least  that strange and lovely parasite the rhipsalis cassytha which you  mistake first for a plume of green seaweed or a tress of mermaids  hair which has got up there by mischance and then for some delicate  kind of pendent mistletoe till you are told to your astonishment  that it is an abnormal form of cactusa family which it resembles  save in its tiny flowers and fruit no more than it resembles the  ceibatree on which it grows and told too that strangely enough  it has been discovered in angolathe only species of the cactus  tribe in the old world  and now we set ourselves to walk up to the depot where the  government timber was being felled and the real high woods to be  seen at last  our path lay along the halffinished tramway  through the first cacao plantation i had ever seen though i am  happy to say not the last by many a one  imagine an orchard of nuttrees with very large long leaves  each  tree is trained to a single stem  among them especially near the  path grow plants of the common hothouse datura its long white  flowers perfuming all the air  they have been planted as landmarks  to prevent the young cacaotrees being cut over when the weeds are  cleared  among them too at some twenty yards apart are the stems  of a tree looking much like an ash save that it is inclined to  throw out broad spurs like a ceiba  you look up and see that they  are bois immortelles 126 fifty or sixty feet high one blaze of  vermilion against the blue sky  those who have stood under a  lombardy poplar in early spring and looked up at its buds and  twigs showing like pink coral against the blue sky and have felt  the beauty of the sight can imagine faintlybut only faintlythe  beauty of these madres de cacao cacaomothers as they call them  here because their shade is supposed to shelter the cacaotrees  while the dew collected by their leaves keeps the ground below  always damp  i turned my dazzled eyes down again and looked into the delicious  darkness under the bushes  the ground was brown with fallen leaves  or green with ferns and here and there a slant ray of sunlight  pierced through the shade and flashed on the brown leaves and on a  gray stem and on a crimson jewel which hung on the stemand there  again on a bright orange one and as my eye became accustomed to  the darkness i saw that the stems and larger boughs far away into  the wood were dotted with pods crimson or yellow or green of the  size and shape of a small hand closed with the fingers straight out   they were the cacaopods full of what are called at home coconibs   and there lay a heap of them looking like a heap of gay flowers  and by them sat their brown owner picking them to pieces and laying  the seeds to dry on a cloth  i went up and told him that i came  from england and never saw cacao before though i had been eating  and drinking it all my life at which news he grinned amusement till  his white teeth and eyeballs made a light in that dark place and  offered me a fresh broken pod that i might taste the pink sour sweet pulp in which the rows of nibs lie packed a pulp which i  found very pleasant and refreshing  he dries his cacaonibs in the sun and if he be a welltodo and  careful man on a stage with wheels which can be run into a little  shed on the slightest shower of rain picks them over and over  separating the better quality from the worse and at last sends them  down on muleback to the sea to be sold in london as trinidad  cocoa or perhaps sold in paris to the chocolate makers who convert  them into chocolate menier or other by mixing them with sugar and  vanilla both possibly from this very island  this latter fact  once inspired an adventurous german with the thought that he could  make chocolate in trinidad just as well as in paris  and so goes  the story he succeeded  but the fair creoles would not buy it  it  could not be good it could not be the real article unless it had  crossed the atlantic twice to and from that centre of fashion  paris  so the manufacture which might have added greatly to the  wealth of trinidad was given up and the ladies of the island eat  nought but french chocolate costing it is said nearly four times  as much as home made chocolate need cost  as we walked on through the trace for the tramway here was still  unfinished one of my kind companions pointed out a little plant  which bears in the island the ominous name of the brinvilliers  127  it is one of those deadly poisons too common in the bush and  too well known to the negro obi men and obiwomen  and as i looked  at the insignificant weed i wondered how the name of that wretched  woman should have spread to this remote island and have become  famous enough to be applied to a plant  french negroes may have  brought the name with them  but then arose another wonder  how  were the terrible properties of the plant discovered  how eager and  ingenious must the human mind be about the devils work and what  long practiceconsidering its visual slowness and dulnessmust it  have had at the said work ever to have picked out this paltry thing  among the thousand weeds of the forest as a tool for its jealousy  and revenge  it may have taken ages to discover the brinvilliers  and ages more to make its poison generally known  why not  as the  spaniards say the devil knows many things because he is old   surely this is one of the many facts which point toward some  immensely ancient civilisation in the tropics and a civilisation  which may have had its ugly vices and have been destroyed thereby  now we left the cacao grove  and i was aware on each side of the  trace of a wall of green such as i had never seen before on earth  not even in my dreams strange colossal shapes towering up a  hundred feet and more in height which alas it was impossible to  reach for on either side of the trace were fifty yards of half cleared ground fallen logs withes huge stumps ten feet high  charred and crumbling and among them and over them a wilderness of  creepers and shrubs and all the luxuriant young growth of the  rastrajo which springs up at once whenever the primeval forest is  clearedall utterly impassable  these rastrajo forms of course  were all new to me  i might have spent weeks in botanising merely  at them  but all i could remark or cared to remark there as in  other places was the tendency in the rastrajo toward growing  enormous rounded leaves  how to get at the giants behind was the  only question to one who for forty years had been longing for one  peep at floras fairy palace and saw its portals open at last   there was a deep gully before us where a gang of convicts was  working at a wooden bridge for the tramway amid the usual abysmal  mud of the tropic wet season  and on the other side of it there was  no rastrajo right and left of the trace  i hurried down it like any  schoolboy dashing through mud and water hopping from log to log  regardless of warnings and offers of help from goodnatured negroes  who expected the respectable elderly buccra to come to grief  struggled perspiring up the other side of the gully and then dashed  away to the left and stopped short breathless with awe in the  primeval forest at last  in the primeval forest looking upon that upon which my teachers and  masters humboldt spix martius schomburgk waterton bates  wallace gosse and the rest had looked already with far wiser  eyes than mine comprehending somewhat at least of its wonders  while i could only stare in ignorance  there was actually then  such a sight to be seen on earth and it was not less but far more  wonderful than they had said  my first feeling on entering the high woods was helplessness  confusion awe all but terror  one is afraid at first to venture  in fifty yards  without a compass or the landmark of some opening  to or from which he can look a man must be lost in the first ten  minutes such a sameness is there in the infinite variety  that  sameness and variety make it impossible to give any general sketch  of a forest  once inside you cannot see the wood for the trees   you can only wander on as far as you dare letting each object  impress itself on your mind as it may and carrying away a confused  recollection of innumerable perpendicular lines all straining  upwards in fierce competition towards the lightfood far above  and next of a green cloud or rather mist which hovers round your  head and rises thickening and thickening to an unknown height   the upward lines are of every possible thickness and of almost  every possible hue what leaves they bear being for the most part  on the tips of the twigs give a scattered mistlike appearance to  the underfoliage  for the first moment therefore the forest  seems more open than an english wood  but try to walk through it  and ten steps undeceive you  around your knees are probably  mamures 129a with creeping stems and fanshaped leaves something  like those of a young coconut palm  you try to brush through them  and are caught up instantly by a string or wire belonging to some  other plant  you look up and round  and then you find that the air  is full of wiresthat you are hung up in a network of fine branches  belonging to half a dozen different sorts of young trees and  intertwined with as many different species of slender creepers  you  thought at your first glance among the treestems that you were  looking through open air you find that you are looking through a  labyrinth of wirerigging and must use the cutlass right and left  at every five steps  you push on into a bed of strong sedgelike  sclerias with cutting edges to their leaves  it is well for you if  they are only three and not six feet high  in the midst of them  you run against a horizontal stick triangular rounded smooth  green  you take a glance along it right and left and see no end to  it either way but gradually discover that it is the leafstalk of a  young cocorite palm 129b  the leaf is fiveandtwenty feet long  and springs from a huge ostrich plume which is sprawling out of the  ground and up above your head a few yards off  you cut the leaf stalk through right and left and walk on to be stopped suddenly  for you get so confused by the multitude of objects that you never  see anything till you run against it by a gray lichencovered bar  as thick as your ankle  you follow it up with your eye and find it  entwine itself with three or four other bars and roll over with  them in great knots and festoons and loops twenty feet high and  then go up with them into the green cloud over your head and  vanish as if a giant had thrown a ships cables into the treetops   one of them so grand that its form strikes even the negro and the  indian is a liantasse 129c  you see that at once by the form of  its cablesix or eight inches across in one direction and three or  four in another furbelowed all down the middle into regular knots  and looking like a chain cable between two flexible iron bars  at  another of the loops about as thick as your arm your companion if  you have a forester with you will spring joyfully  with a few  blows of his cutlass he will sever it as high up as he can reach  and again below some three feet down and while you are wondering  at this seemingly wanton destruction he lifts the bar on high  throws his head back and pours down his thirsty throat a pint or  more of pure cold water  this hidden treasure is strange as it may  seem the ascending sap or rather the ascending pure rainwater  which has been taken up by the roots and is hurrying aloft to be  elaborated into sap and leaf and flower and fruit and fresh  tissue for the very stem up which it originally climbed and  therefore it is that the woodman cuts the watervine through first  at the top of the piece which he wants and not at the bottom for  so rapid is the ascent of the sap that if he cut the stem below the  water would have all fled upwards before he could cut it off above   meanwhile the old story of jack and the beanstalk comes into your  mind  in such a forest was the old dames hut and up such a bean  stalk jack climbed to find a giant and a castle high above  why  not  what may not be up there  you look up into the green cloud  and long for a moment to be a monkey  there may be monkeys up there  over your head burly red howler 131a or tiny peevish sapajou  131b peering down at you but you cannot peer up at them  the  monkeys and the parrots and the humming birds and the flowers  and all the beauty are upstairsup above the green cloud  you are  in the empty nave of the cathedral and the service is being  celebrated aloft in the blazing roof  we will hope that as you look up you have not been careless enough  to walk on for if you have you will be tripped up at once  nor to  put your hand out incautiously to rest it against a tree or what  not for fear of sharp thorns ants and wasps nests  if you are  all safe your next steps probably as you struggle through the  bush between tree trunks of every possible size will bring you face  to face with huge upright walls of seeming boards whose rounded  edges slope upward till as your eye follows them you find them  enter an enormous stem perhaps round like one of the norman  pillars of durham nave and just as huge perhaps fluted like one  of william of wykehams columns at winchester  there is the stem   but where is the tree  above the green cloud  you struggle up to  it between two of the board walls but find it not so easy to  reach  between you and it are half a dozen tough strings which you  had not noticed at firstthe eye cannot focus itself rapidly enough  in this confusion of distanceswhich have to be cut through ere you  can pass  some of them are rooted in the ground straight and  tense some of them dangle and wave in the wind at every height   what are they  air roots of wild pines 131c or of matapalos or  of figs or of seguines 131d or of some other parasite   probably  but you cannot see  all you can see is as you put your  chin close against the trunk of the tree and look up as if you were  looking up against the side of a great ship set on end that some  sixty or eighty feet up in the green cloud arms as big as english  forest trees branch off and that out of their forks a whole green  garden of vegetation has tumbled down twenty or thirty feet and  half climbed up again  you scramble round the tree to find whence  this aerial garden has sprung  you cannot tell  the treetrunk is  smooth and free from climbers and that mass of verdure may belong  possibly to the very cables which you met ascending into the green  cloud twenty or thirty yards back or to that impenetrable tangle a  dozen yards on which has climbed a small tree and then a taller  one again and then a taller still till it has climbed out of sight  and possibly into the lower branches of the big tree  and what are  their species what are their families  who knows  not even the  most experienced woodman or botanist can tell you the names of  plants of which he only sees the stems  the leaves the flowers  the fruit can only be examined by felling the tree and not even  always then for sometimes the tree when cut refuses to fall linked  as it is by chains of liane to all the trees around  even that  wonderful watervine which we cut through just now may be one of  three or even four different plants 132  soon you will be struck by the variety of the vegetation and will  recollect what you have often heard that social plants are rare in  the tropic forests  certainly they are rare in trinidad where the  only instances of social trees are the moras which i have never  seen growing wild and the moriche palms  in europe a forest is  usually made up of one dominant plantof firs or of pines of oaks  or of beeches of birch or of heather  here no two plants seem  alike  there are more species on an acre here than in all the new  forest savernake or sherwood  stems rough smooth prickly  round fluted stilted upright sloping branched arched jointed  oppositeleaved alternateleaved leaflets or covered with leaves  of every conceivable pattern are jumbled together till the eye and  brain are tired of continually asking what next  the stems are of  every colourcopper pink gray green brown black as if burnt  marbled with lichens many of them silvery white gleaming afar in  the bush furred with mosses and delicate creeping filmferns or  laced with the airroots of some parasite aloft  up this stem  scrambles a climbing seguine 133a with entire leaves up the next  another quite different with deeplycut leaves 133b up the next  the ceriman 133c spreads its huge leaves latticed and forked  again and again  so fast do they grow that they have not time to  fill up the spaces between their nerves and are consequently full  of oval holes and so fast does its spadix of flowers expand that  as indeed do some other aroids an actual genial heat and fire of  passion which may be tested by the thermometer or even by the  hand is given off during fructification  beware of breaking it or  the seguines  they will probably give off an evil smell and as  probably a blistering milk  look on at the next stem  up it and  down again a climbing fern 133d which is often seen in hothouses  has tangled its finelycut fronds  up the next a quite different  fern is crawling by pressing tightly to the rough bark its creeping  rootstalks furred like a hares leg  up the next the prim little  griffechatte 133e plant has walked by numberless clusters of  small catsclaws which lay hold of the bark  and what is this  delicious scent about the air  vanille  of course it is and up  that stem zigzags the green fleshy chain of the vanille orchis  the  scented pod is far above out of your reach but not out of the  reach of the next parrot or monkey or negro hunter who winds the  treasure  and the stems themselves  to what trees do they belong   it would be absurd for one to try to tell you who cannot tell one twentieth of them himself 133f  suffice it to say that over your  head are perhaps a dozen kinds of admirable timber which might be  turned to a hundred uses in europe were it possible to get them  thither  your guide who here will be a second hospitable and  cultivated scot will point with pride to one column after another  straight as those of a cathedral and sixty to eighty feet without  branch or knob  that he will say is fiddlewood 133g that a  carapo 133h that a cedar 133i that a roble 133j oak that  larger than all you have seen yet a locust 133k that a poui  133l that a guatecare 133m that an olivier 133n woods which  he will tell you are all but incorruptible defying weather and  insects  he will show you as curiosities the smaller but  intensely hard letter wood 133o lignum vitae 133p and purple  heart 134a  he will pass by as useless weeds ceibas 134b and  sandboxtrees 134c whose bulk appals you  he will look up with  something like a malediction at the matapalos which every fifty  yards have seized on mighty trees and are enjoying i presume  every different stage of the strangling art from the baby matapalo  who like the one which you saw in the botanic garden has let down  his first airroot along his victims stem to the old sinner whose  dark crown of leaves is supported eighty feet in air on  innumerable branching columns of every size crossclasped to each  other by transverse bars  the giant tree on which his seed first  fell has rotted away utterly and he stands in its place prospering  in his wickedness like certain folk whom david knew too well  your  guide walks on with a sneer  but he stops with a smile of  satisfaction as he sees lying on the ground dark green glossy  leaves which are fading into a bright crimson for overhead  somewhere there must be a balata 134d the king of the forest and  there close by is his stema madderbrown column whose head may  be a hundred and fifty feet or more aloft  the forester pats the  sides of his favourite tree as a breeder might that of his  favourite racehorse  he goes on to evince his affection in the  fashion of west indians by giving it a chop with his cutlass but  not in wantonness  he wishes to show you the hidden virtues of this  in his eyes noblest of treeshow there issues out swiftly from  the wound a flow of thick white milk which will congeal in an  hours time into a gum intermediate in its properties between  caoutchouc and guttapercha  he talks of a time when the english  guttapercha market shall be supplied from the balatas of the  northern hills which cannot be shipped away as timber  he tells  you how the tree is a tree of a generous virtuous and elaborate  racea tree of god which is full of sap as one said of old of  suchand what could he say better less or more  for it is a  sapota cousin to the sapodilla and other excellent fruittrees  itself most excellent even in its fruitbearing power for every  five years it is covered with such a crop of delicious plums that  the lazy negro thinks it worth his while to spend days of hard work  besides incurring the penalty of the law for the trees are  government property in cutting it down for the sake of its fruit   but this tree your guide will cut himself  there is no gully  between it and the government station and he can carry it away and  it is worth his while to do so for it will square he thinks into  a log more than three feet in diameter and eighty ninetyhe hopes  almost a hundredfeet in length of hard heavy wood incorruptible  save in salt water better than oak as good as teak and only  surpassed in this island by the poui  he will make a stage round  it some eight feet high and cut it above the spurs  it will take  his convict gang for convicts are turned to some real use in  trinidad several days to get it down and many more days to square  it with the axe  a trace must be made to it through the wood  clearing away vegetation for which an european millionaire could he  keep it in his park would gladly pay a hundred pounds a yard  the  cleared stems especially those of the palms must be cut into  rollers and the dragging of the huge log over them will be a work  of weeks especially in the wet season  but it can be done and it  shall be so he leaves a significant mark on his newfound treasure  and leads you on through the bush hewing his way with light strokes  right and left so carelessly that you are inclined to beg him to  hold his hand and not destroy in a moment things so beautiful so  curious things which would be invaluable in an english hothouse  and where are the famous orchids  they perch on every bough and  stem  but they are not with three or four exceptions in flower in  the winter and if they were i know nothing about themat least i  know enough to know how little i know  whosoever has read darwins  fertilisation of orchids and finds in his own reason that the book  is true had best say nothing about the beautiful monsters till he  has seen with his own eyes more than his master  and yet even the three or four that are in flower are worth going  many a mile to see  in the hothouse they seem almost artificial  from their strangeness  but to see them natural on natural  boughs gives a sense of their reality which no unnatural situation  can give  even to look up at them perched on bough and stem as one  rides by and to guess what exquisite and fantastic form may issue  in a few months or weeks out of those fleshy often unsightly  leaves is a strange pleasure a spur to the fancy which is surely  wholesome if we will but believe that all these things were  invented by a fancy which desires to call out in us by  contemplating them such small fancy as we possess and to make us  poets each according to his power by showing a world in which if  rightly looked at all is poetry  another fact will soon force itself on your attention unless you  wish to tumble down and get wet up to your knees  the soil is  furrowed everywhere by holes by graves some two or three feet wide  and deep and of uncertain length and shape often wandering about  for thirty or forty feet and running confusedly into each other   they are not the work of man nor of an animal for no earth seems  to have been thrown out of them  in the bottom of the dry graves  you sometimes see a decaying root  but most of them just now are  full of water and of tiny fish also who burrow in the mud and  sleep during the dry season to come out and swim during the wet   these graves are some of them plainly quite new  some again are  very old for trees of all sizes are growing in them and over them  what makes them  a question not easily answered  but the shrewdest  foresters say that they have held the roots of trees now dead   either the tree has fallen and torn its roots out of the ground or  the roots and stumps have rotted in their place and the soil above  them has fallen in  but they must decay very quickly these roots to leave their quite  fresh graves thus empty  andnow one thinks of ithow few fallen  trees or even dead sticks there are about  an english wood if  left to itself would be cumbered with fallen timber and one has  heard of forests in north america through which it is all but  impossible to make way so high are piled up among the still growing trees dead logs in every stage of decay  such a sight may  be seen in europe among the high silverfir forests of the  pyrenees  how is it not so here  how indeed  and how comes itif  you will look againthat there are few or no fallen leaves and  actually no leafmould  in an english wood there would be a foot perhaps two feetof black soil renewed by every autumn leaf fall   two feet  one has heard often enough of bisonhunting in himalayan  forests among deodaras one hundred and fifty feet high and scarlet  rhododendrons thirty feet high growing in fifteen or twenty feet of  leafandtimber mould  and here in a forest equally ancient every  plant is growing out of the bare yellow loam as it might in a well hoed garden bed  is it not strange  most strange till you remember where you arein one of natures  hottest and dampest laboratories  nearly eighty inches of yearly  rain and more than eighty degrees of perpetual heat make swift work  with vegetable fibre which in our cold and sluggard clime would  curdle into leafmould perhaps into peat  far to the north in  poor old ireland and far to the south in patagonia begin the  zones of peat where dead vegetable fibre its treasures of light  and heat locked up lies all but useless age after age  but this is  the zone of illimitable sunforce which destroys as swiftly as it  generates and generates again as swiftly as it destroys  here  when the forest giant falls as some tell me that they have heard  him fall on silent nights when the cracking of the roots below and  the lianes aloft rattles like musketry through the woods till the  great trunk comes down with a boom as of a heavy gun reechoing on  from mountainside to mountainside then   nothing in him that doth fade but doth suffer an airchange into something rich and strange   under the genial rain and genial heat the timber tree itself all  its tangled ruin of lianes and parasites and the boughs and leaves  snapped off not only by the blow but by the very wind of the  falling treeall melt away swiftly and peacefully in a few months say almost a few daysinto the water and carbonic acid and  sunlight out of which they were created at first to be absorbed  instantly by the green leaves around and transmuted into fresh  forms of beauty leave not a wrack behind  explained thusand this  i believe to be the true explanationthe absence of leafmould is  one of the grandest as it is one of the most startling phenomena  of the forest  look here at a fresh wonder  away in front of us a smooth gray  pillar glistens on high  you can see neither the top nor the bottom  of it  but its colour and its perfectly cylindrical shape tell  you what it isa glorious palmiste one of those queens of the  forest which you saw standing in the fields with its capital buried  in the green cloud and its base buried in that bank of green velvet  plumes which you must skirt carefully round for they are a prickly  dwarf palm called here black roseau 137a  close to it rises  another pillar as straight and smooth but onefourth of the  diametera giants walkingcane  its head too is in the green  cloud  but near are two or three younger ones only forty or fifty  feet high and you see their delicate feather heads and are told  that they are manacques 137b the slender nymphs which attend upon  the forest queen as beautiful though not as grand as she  the land slopes down fast now  you are tramping through stiff mud  and those roseaux are a sign of water  there is a stream or gully  near  and now for the first time you can see clear sunshine through  the stems and see too something of the bank of foliage on the  other side of the brook  you catch sight it may be of the head of  a tree aloft blazing with golden trumpet flowers which is a poui  and of another lower one covered with hoarfrost perhaps a croton  137c and of another a giant covered with purple tassels  that is  an angelim  another giant overtops even him  his dark glossy  leaves toss off sheets of silver light as they flicker in the  breeze for it blows hard aloft outside while you are in stifling  calm  that is a balata  and what is that on hightwenty or  thirty square yards of rich crimson a hundred feet above the ground   the flowers may belong to the tree itself  it may be a mountain mangrove 137d which i have never seen in flower  but take the  glasses and decide  no  the flowers belong to a liane  the  wonderful prince of waless feather 137e has taken possession of  the head of a huge mombin 137f and tiled it all over with crimson  combs which crawl out to the ends of the branches and dangle twenty  or thirty feet down waving and leaping in the breeze  and over all  blazes the cloudless blue  you gaze astounded  ten steps downward and the vision is gone   the green cloud has closed again over your head and you are  stumbling in the darkness of the bush half blinded by the sudden  change from the blaze to the shade  beware  take care of the  crocchien shouts your companion  and you are aware of not a  foot from your face a long green curved whip armed with pairs of  barbs some four inches apart and are aware also at the same  moment that another has seized you by the arm another by the  knees and that you must back out unless you are willing to part  with your clothes first and your flesh afterwards  you back out  and find that you have walked into the tipsluckily only into the  tipsof the fernlike fronds of a trailing and climbing palm such  as you see in the botanic gardens  that came from the east and  furnishes the rattancanes  this 138a furnishes the grigri canes and is rather worse to meet if possible than the rattan   your companion while he helps you to pick the barbs out calls the  palm laughingly by another name sueltamiingles and tells you  the old story of the spanish soldier at san josef  you are near the  water now for here is a thicket of balisiers 138b  push through  under their great plantainlike leaves  slip down the muddy bank to  that patch of gravel  see first though that it is not tenanted  already by a deadly mapepire or rattlesnake which has not the  grace as his cousin in north america has to use his rattle  the brooklet muddy with last nights rain is dammed and bridged by  winding roots in shape like the jointed wooden snakes which we used  to play with as children  they belong probably to a fig whose  trunk is somewhere up in the green cloud  sit down on one and  look around and aloft  from the soil to the sky which peeps  through here and there the air is packed with green leaves of every  imaginable hue and shape  round our feet are arums 138c with  snowwhite spadixes and hoods one instance among many here of  brilliant colour developing itself in deep shade  but is the  darkness of the forest actually as great as it seems  or are our  eyes accustomed to the blaze outside unable to expand rapidly  enough and so liable to mistake for darkness air really full of  light reflected downward again and again at every angle from the  glossy surfaces of a million leaves  at least we may be excused  for a bat has made the same mistake and flits past us at noonday   and there is anotherno as it turns a blaze of metallic azure off  the upper side of the wings proves this one to be no bat but a  morphoa moth as big as a bat  and what was that second larger  flash of golden green which dashed at the moth and back to yonder  branch not ten feet off  a jacamar 138dkingfisher as they  miscall her here sitting fearless of man with the moth in her long  beak  her throat is snowy white her underparts rich red brown   her breast and all her upper plumage and long tail glitter with  golden green  there is light enough in this darkness it seems   but now a look again at the plants  among the whiteflowered arums  are other arums stalked and spotted of which beware for they are  the poisonous seguinediable 139a the dumbcane of which evil  tales were told in the days of slavery  a few drops of its milk  put into the mouth of a refractory slave or again into the food of  a cruel master could cause swelling choking and burning agony for  many hours  over our heads bend the great arrow leaves and purple leafstalks of  the tanias 139b and mingled with them leaves often larger still   oval glossy bright ribbed reflecting from their underside a  silver light  they belong to arumas 139c and from their ribs are  woven the indian baskets and packs  above these again the  balisiers bend their long leaves eight or ten feet long apiece and  under the shade of the leaves their gay flowerspikes like double  rows of orange and black birds beaks upside down  above them and  among them rise stiff upright shrubs with pairs of pointed leaves  a foot long some of them pale green above and yellow or fawn coloured beneath  you may see by the three longitudinal nerves in  each leaf that they are melastomas of different kindsa sure token  they that you are in the tropicsa probable token that you are in  tropical america  and over them and among them what a strange variety of foliage   look at the contrast between the balisiers and that branch which has  thrust itself among them which you take for a dark coppercoloured  fern so finely divided are its glossy leaves  it is really a  mimosabois mulatre 139d as they call it here  what a contrast  again the huge feathery fronds of the cocorite palms which stretch  right away hither over our heads twenty and thirty feet in length   and what is that spot of crimson flame hanging in the darkest spot  of all from an underbough of that low weeping tree  a flowerhead  of the rosa del monte 139e  and what is that bright straw coloured foxs brush above it with a brown hood like that of an  arum brush and hood nigh three feet long each  lookfor you  require to look more than once sometimes more than twicehere up  the stem of that cocorite or as much of it as you can see in the  thicket  it is all jagged with the brown butts of its old fallen  leaves and among the butts perch broadleaved ferns and fleshy  orchids and above them just below the plume of mighty fronds the  yellow foxs brush which is its spathe of flower  what next  above the cocorites dangle amid a dozen different kinds  of leaves festoons of a liane or of two for one has purple  flowers the other yellowbignonias bauhiniaswhat not  and  through them a carat 140a palm has thrust its thin bending stem  and spread out its flat head of fanshaped leaves twenty feet long  each  while over it i verily believe hangs eighty feet aloft the  head of the very tree upon whose roots we are sitting  for amid the  green cloud you may see sprigs of leaf somewhat like that of a  weeping willow 140b and there probably is the trunk to which  they belong or rather what will be a trunk at last  at present it  is like a number of roundedged boards of every size set on end  and slowly coalescing at their edges  there is a slit down the  middle of the trunk twenty or thirty feet long  you may see the  green light of the forest shining through it  yes  that is  probably the fig or if not then something else  for who am i  that i should know the hundredth part of the forms on which we  lookand above all you catch a glimpse of that crimson mass of  norantea which we admired just now and black as yew against the  blue sky and white cloud the plumes of one palmiste who has  climbed toward the light it may be for centuries through the green  cloud and now weary and yet triumphant rests her dark head among  the bright foliage of a ceiba and feeds unhindered on the sun  there take your tired eyes down again and turn them right or  left or where you will to see the same scene and yet never the  same  new forms new combinations a wealth of creative geniuslet  us use the wise old word in its true senseincomprehensible by the  human intellect or the human eye even as he is who makes it all  whose garment or rather whose speech it is  the eye is not filled  with seeing or the ear with hearing and never would be did you  roam these forests for a hundred years  how many years would you  need merely to examine and discriminate the different species  and  when you had done that how many more to learn their action and  reaction on each other  how many more to learn their virtues  properties uses  how many more to answer the perhaps ever  unanswerable questionhow they exist and grow at all  by what  miracle they are compacted out of light air and water each after  its kind  how again those kinds began to be and what they were  like at first  whether those crowded struggling competing shapes  are stable or variable  whether or not they are varying still   whether even now as we sit here the great god may not be creating  slowly but surely new forms of beauty round us  why not  if he  chose to do it could he not do it  and even had you answered that  question which would require whole centuries of observation as  patient and accurate as that which mr darwin employed on orchids  and climbing plants how much nearer would you be to the deepest  question of alldo these things exist or only appear  are they  solid realities or a mere phantasmagoria orderly indeed and law ruled but a phantasmagoria still a picturebook by which god  speaks to rational essences created in his own likeness  and even  had you solved that old problem and decided for berkeley or against  him you would still have to learn from these forests a knowledge  which enters into man not through the head but through the heart  which let some modern philosophers say what they will defies all  analysis and can be no more defined or explained by words than a  mothers love  i mean the causes and the effects of their beauty  that aesthetic of plants of which schleiden has spoken so well in  that charming book of his the plant which all should read who wish  to know somewhat of the open secret  but when they read it let them read with open hearts  for that  same open secret is i suspect one of those which god may hide  from the wise and prudent and yet reveal to babes  at least so it seemed to me the first day that i went awe struck  into the high woods and so it seemed to me the last day that i  came even more awestruck out of them    chapter viii  la brea    we were of course desirous to visit that famous lake of pitch  which our old nursery literature described as one of the wonders of  the world  it is not that it is merely a very odd quaint  unexpected and only halfexplained phenomenon  but no wonder   that epithet should be kept for such matters as the growth of a  crystal the formation of a cell the germination of a seed the  coming true of a plant whether from a fruit or from a cutting  in  a word for any and all those hourly and momentary miracles which  were attributed of old to some vis formatrix of nature and are now  attributed to some other abstract formula as they will be to some  fresh one and to a dozen more before the century is out because  the more accurately and deeply they are investigated the more  inexplicable they will be found  so it is but the public are not inclined to believe that so it  is and will not see till their minds get somewhat of a truly  scientific training  if any average educated person were askedwhich seemed to him more  wonderful that a hens egg should always produce a chicken or that  it should now and then produce a sparrow or a ducklingcan it be  doubted what answer he would give or that it would be the wrong  answer  what answer again would he make to the questionwhich is  more wonderful that dwarfs and giants ie people under four feet  six or over six feet six should be exceedingly rare or that the  human race is not of all possible heights from three inches to  thirty feet  can it be doubted that in this case as in the last  the wrong answer would be given  he would defend himself probably  if he had a smattering of science by saying that experience teaches  us that nature works by invariable laws by which he would mean  usually unbroken customs and that he has therefore a right to be  astonished if they are broken  but he would be wrong  the just  cause of astonishment is that the laws are on the whole  invariable that the customs are so seldom broken that sun and  moon plants and animals grains of dust and vesicles of vapour are  not perpetually committing some vagary or other and making as great  fools of themselves as human beings are wont to do  happily for the  existence of the universe they do not  but how and still more  why things in general behave so respectably and loyally is a  wonder which is either utterly inexplicable or explicable i hold  only on the old theory that they obey some onewhom we obey to a  very limited extent indeed  not that this latter theory gets rid of  the perpetual and omnipresent element of wondrousness  if matter  alone exists it is a wonder and a mystery how it obeys itself  if  a spirit exists it is a wonder and a mystery how he makes matter  obey him  all that the scientific man can do is to confess the  presence of mystery all day long and to live in that wholesome and  calm attitude of wonder which we call awe and reverence that so he  may be delivered from the unwholesome and passionate fits of wonder  which we call astonishment the child of ignorance and fear and the  parent of rashness and superstition  so will he keep his mind in  the attitude most fit for seizing new facts whenever they are  presented to him  so he will be able when he doubts of a new fact  to examine himself whether he doubts it on just grounds whether his  doubt may not proceed from mere selfconceit because the fact does  not suit his preconceived theories whether it may not proceed from  an even lower passion which he shares being human with the most  uneducated namely from dread of the two great bogies novelty and  sizenovelty which makes it hard to convince the country fellow  that in the tropics great flowers grow on tall trees as they do  here on herbs size which makes it hard to convince him that in far  lands trees are often two and three hundred feet high simply  because he has never seen one here a hundred feet high  it is not  surprising but saddening to watch what power these two phantoms  have over the minds of those who would be angry if they were  supposed to be uneducated  how often has one heard the existence of  the seaserpent declared impossible and absurd on these very  grounds by people who thought they were arguing scientifically   the seaserpent could not exist firstly becausebecause it was so  odd strange new in a word and unlike anything that they had ever  seen or fancied and secondly because it was so big  the first  argument would apply to a thousand new facts which physical science  is daily proving to be true and the second when the reputed size  of the seaserpent is compared with the known size of the ocean  rather more silly than the assertion that a tenpound pike could not  live in a halfacre pond because it was too small to hold him  the  true arguments against the existence of a seaserpent namely that  no ophidian could live long under water and that therefore the sea serpent if he existed would be seen continually at the surface  and again that the appearance taken for a seaserpent has been  proved again and again to be merely a long line of rolling  porpoisesthese really sound arguments would be nothing to such  people or only be accepted as supplementing and corroborating their  dislike to believe in anything new or anything a little bigger than  usual  but so works the average ie the uneducated and barbaric  intellect afraid of the new and the big whether in space or in  time  how the fear of those two phantoms has hindered our knowledge  of this planet the geologist knows only too well  it was excusable therefore that this pitch lake should be counted  among the wonders of the world for it is certainly tolerably big   it covers ninetynine acres and contains millions of tons of so called pitch  its first discoverers of course were not bound to see that a pitch  lake of ninetynine acres was no more wonderful than any of the  little pitch wellsspues or galls as we should call them in  hampshirea yard across or any one of the tiny veins and lumps of  pitch which abound in the surrounding forests and no less wonderful  than if it had covered ninetynine thousand acres instead of ninety nine  moreover it was a novelty  people were not aware of the  vast quantity of similar deposits which exist up and down the hotter  regions of the globe  and being new and big too its genesis  demanded for the comfort of the barbaric intellect a cataclysm  and a convulsion and some sort of prodigious birth which was till  lately referred like many another strange object to volcanic  action  the explanation savoured somewhat of a bull for what a  volcano could do to pitch save to burn it up into coke and gases  it is difficult to see  it now turns out that the pitch lake like most other things owes  its appearance on the surface to no convulsion or vagary at all but  to a most slow orderly and respectable process of nature by which  buried vegetable matter which would have become peat and finally  brown coal in a temperate climate becomes under the hot tropic  soil asphalt and oil continually oozing up beneath the pressure of  the strata above it  such at least is the opinion of messrs wall  and sawkins the geological surveyors of trinidad and of several  chemists whom they quote and i am bound to say that all i saw at  the lake and elsewhere during two separate visits can be easily  explained on their hypothesis and that no other possible cause  suggests itself as yet  the same cause it may be has produced the  submarine spring of petroleum off the shore near point rouge where  men can at times skim the floating oil off the surface of the sea  the petroleum and asphalt of the windward islands and of cuba  especially the wellknown barbadoes tar and the petroleum springs  of the mainland described by humboldt at truxillo in the gulf of  cumana and the inexhaustible deposits of mineral pitch in the  provinces of merida and coro and above all in that of maracaybo   in the latter it is employed for caulking the ships which navigate  the lake 145  but the reader shall hear what the famous lake is  like and judge for himself  why not  he may not be scientific  but as professor huxley well says what is scientific thought but  common sense well regulated  running down then by steamer some thirtysix miles south from  port of spain along a flat mangrove shore broken only at one spot  by the conical hill of san fernando we arrived off a peninsula  whose flat top is somewhat higher than the lowland right and left   the uplands are rich with primeval forest and perhaps always have  been  the lower land right and left was i believe cultivated  for sugar till the disastrous epoch of 1846  but it is now furred  over with rastrajo woods  we ran on our first visit past the pitch point of la brea south westward to trois where an industrial farm for convicts had been  established by my host the governor  we were lifted on shore  through a tumbling surf and welcomed by an intelligent and  courteous german gentleman who showed us all that was to be seen  and what we saw was satisfactory enough  the estate was paying  though this was only its third year  an average number of 77  convicts had already cleared 195 acres of which 182 were under  cultivation  part of this had just been reclaimed from pestilential  swamp  a permanent benefit to the health of the island  in spite  of the exceptional drought of the year before and the subsequent  plague of caterpillars 83000 pounds of rice had been grown and  the success of the rice crop it must be remembered will become  more and more important to the island as the increase of coolie  labourers increases the demand for the grain  more than half the  plantains put in 22000 were growing and other vegetables in  abundance  but above all there were more than 7000 young coco palms doing well and promising a perpetual source of wealth for the  future  for as the trees grow and the crops raised between them  diminish the cocopalms will require little or no care but yield  fruit the whole year round without further expense and the  establishment can then be removed elsewhere to reclaim a fresh  sheet of land  altogether the place was a satisfactory specimen of what can be  effected in a tropical country by a government which will govern   since then another source of profitable employment for west indian  convicts has been suggested to me  bamboo it is now found will  supply an admirable material for paper and i have been assured by  papermakers that those who will plant the west indian wet lands  with bamboo for their use may realise enormous profits  we scrambled back into the boathad of course a heap of fruit  bananas oranges pineapples tossed in after usand ran back  again in the steamer to the famous la brea  as we neared the shore we perceived that the beach was black as  pitch and the breeze being off the land the asphalt smell not  unpleasant came off to welcome us  we rowed in and saw in front  of a little row of wooden houses a tall mulatto in blue policemans  dress gesticulating and shouting to us  he was the wardpoliceman  and i found him as i did all the coloured police able and  courteous shrewd and trusty  these police are excellent specimens  of what can be made of the negro or halfnegro if he be but first  drilled and then given a responsibility which calls out his self respect  he was warning our crew not to run aground on one or other  of the pitch reefs which here take the place of rocks  a large  one a hundred yards off on the left has been almost all dug away  and carried to new york or to paris to make asphalt pavement  the  boat was run ashore under his directions on a spit of sand between  the pitch and when she ceased bumping up and down in the muddy  surf we scrambled out into a world exactly the hue of its  inhabitantsof every shade from jetblack to copperbrown  the  pebbles on the shore were pitch  a tidepool close by was enclosed  in pitch  a foureyes was swimming about in it staring up at us  and when we hunted him tried to escape not by diving but by  jumping on shore on the pitch and scrambling off between our legs   while the policeman after profoundest courtesies was gone to get a  mule cart to take us up to the lake and planks to bridge its water channels we took a look round at this oddest of corners of the  earth  in front of us was the unit of civilisationthe policestation  wooden on wooden stilts as all wellbuilt houses are here to  ensure a draught of air beneath them  we were of course asked to  come in and sit down but preferred looking about under our  umbrellas for the heat was intense  the soil is half pitch half  brown earth among which the pitch sweals in and out as tallow  sweals from a candle  it is always in slow motion under the heat of  the tropic sun  and no wonder if some of the cottages have sunk  right and left in such a treacherous foundation  a stone or brick  house could not stand here  but wood and palmthatch are both light  and tough enough to be safe let the ground give way as it will  the soil however is very rich  the pitch certainly does not  injure vegetation though plants will not grow actually in it  the  first plants which caught our eyes were pineapples for which la  brea is famous  the heat of the soil as well as of the air brings  them to special perfection  they grow about anywhere unprotected  by hedge or fence for the negroes here seem honest enough at least  towards each other  and at the corner of the house was a bush worth  looking at for we had heard of it for many a year  it bore  prickly heartshaped pods an inch long filled with seeds coated  with a red waxy pulp  this was a famous plantbixa orellana roucou and that pulp was  the wellknown arnotta dye of commerce  in england and holland it  is used merely i believe to colour cheeses but in the spanish  main to colour human beings  the indian of the orinoco prefers  paint to clothes and when he has roucoued himself from head to  foot considers himself in full dress whether for war or dancing   doubtless he knows his own business best from long experience   indeed as we stood broiling on the shore we began somewhat to  regret that european manners and customs prevented our adopting the  guaraon and arawak fashion  the mulecart arrived the lady of the party was put into it on a  chair and slowly bumped and rattled past the corner of dundonald  streetso named after the old seahero who was in his lifetime  full of projects for utilising this same pitchand up a pitch road  with a pitch gutter on each side  the pitch in the road has been most of it laid down by hand and  is slowly working down the slight incline leaving pools and ruts  full of water often invisible because covered with a film of brown  pitchdust and so letting in the unwary walker over his shoes  the  pitch in the gutterbank is in its native place and as it spues  slowly out of the soil into the ditch in odd wreaths and lumps we  could watch in little the process which has produced the whole  depositprobably the whole lake itself  a bullockcart laden with pitch came jolting down past us and we  observed that the lumps when the fracture is fresh have all a  drawnout look that the very airbubbles in them which are often  very numerous are all drawn out likewise long and oval like the  airbubbles in some ductile lavas  on our left as we went on the bush was low all of yellow cassia  and white hibiscus and tangled with lovely convolvuluslike  creepers ipomoea and echites with white purple or yellow  flowers  on the right were negro huts and gardens fewer and fewer  as we went onall rich with fruittrees especially with oranges  hung with fruit of every hue and beneath them of course the pine apples of la brea  everywhere along the road grew seemingly wild  here that pretty low tree the cashew with rounded yellowveined  leaves and little green flowers followed by a quaint pink and red striped pear from which hangs at the larger and lower end a  kidneyshaped bean which bold folk eat when roasted  but woe to  those who try it when raw for the acrid oil blisters the lips and  even while the beans are roasting the fumes of the oil will blister  the cooks face if she holds it too near the fire  as we went onward up the gentle slope the rise is one hundred and  thirtyeight feet in rather more than a mile the ground became  more and more full of pitch and the vegetation poorer and more  rushy till it resembled on the whole that of an english fen  an  ipomoea or two and a scarletflowered dwarf heliconia kept up the  tropic type as does a stiff brittle fern about two feet high  148a  we picked the weeds which looked like english mint or  basil and found that most of them had three longitudinal nerves in  each leaf and were really melastomas though dwarfed into a far  meaner habit than that of the noble forms we saw at chaguanas and  again on the other side of the lake  on the right too in a  hollow was a whole wood of groogroo palms gray stemmed gray  leaved and here and there a patch of white or black roseau rose  gracefully eight or ten feet high among the reeds  the plateau of pitch now widened out and the whole ground looked  like an asphalt pavement half overgrown with marshloving weeds  whose roots feed in the sloppy water which overlies the pitch  but  as yet there was no sign of the lake  the incline though gentle  shuts off the view of what is beyond  this last lip of the lake has  surely overflowed and is overflowing still though very slowly   its furrows all curve downward and it is in fact as one of our  party said a black glacier  the pitch expanding under the  burning sun of day must needs expand most towards the line of least  resistance that is downhill and when it contracts again under the  coolness of night it contracts surely from the same cause more  downhill than it does uphill and so each particle never returns to  the spot whence it started but rather drags the particles above it  downward toward itself  at least so it seemed to us  thus may be  explained the common mistake which is noticed by messrs wall and  sawkins 148b in their admirable description of the lake  all previous descriptions refer the bituminous matter scattered  over the la brea district and especially that between the village  and the lake to streams which have issued at some former epoch from  the lake and extended into the sea  this supposition is totally  incorrect as solidification would have probably ensued before it  had proceeded onetenth of the distance and such of the asphalt as  has undoubtedly escaped from the lake has not advanced more than a  few yards and always presents the curved surfaces already  described and never appears as an extended sheet  agreeing with this statement as a whole i nevertheless cannot but  think it probable that a great deal of the asphalt whether it be in  large masses or in scattered veins may be moving very slowly  downhill from the lake to the sea by the process of expansion by  day and contraction by night and may be likened to a caterpillar  or rather caterpillars innumerable progressing by expanding and  contracting their rings having strength enough to crawl downhill  but not strength enough to back uphill again  at last we surmounted the last rise and before us lay the famous  lakenot at the bottom of a depression as we expected but at the  top of a rise whence the ground slopes away from it on two sides  and rises from it very slightly on the two others  the black pool  glared and glittered in the sun  a group of islands some twenty  yards wide were scattered about the middle of it  beyond it rose a  noble forest of moriche fanpalms 149 and to the right of them  high wood with giant mombins and undergrowth of cocoritea paradise  on the other side of the stygian pool  we walked with some misgivings on to the asphalt and found it  perfectly hard  in a few yards we were stopped by a channel of  clear water with tiny fish and waterbeetles in it and looking  round saw that the whole lake was intersected with channels so  unlike anything which can be seen elsewhere that it is not easy to  describe them  conceive a crowd of mushrooms of all shapes from ten to fifty feet  across close together side by side their tops being kept at  exactly the same level their rounded rims squeezed tight against  each other then conceive water poured on them so as to fill the  parting seams and in the wet season during which we visited it to  overflow the tops somewhat  thus would each mushroom represent  tolerably well one of the innumerable flat asphalt bosses which  seem to have sprung up each from a separate centre while the  parting seams would be of much the same shape as those in the  asphalt broad and shallow atop and rolling downward in a smooth  curve till they are at bottom mere cracks from two to ten feet  deep  whether these cracks actually close up below and the two  contiguous masses of pitch become one cannot be seen  as far as  the eye goes down they are two though pressed close to each other   messrs wall and sawkins explain the odd fact clearly and simply   the oil they say which the asphalt contains when it rises first  evaporates in the sun of course most on the outside of the heap  leaving a tough coat of asphalt which has generally no power to  unite with the corresponding coat of the next mass  meanwhile mr  manross an american gentleman who has written a very clever and  interesting account of the lake 150 seems to have been so far  deceived by the curved and squeezed edges of these masses that he  attributes to each of them a revolving motion and supposes that the  material is continually passing from the centre to the edges when  it rolls under and rises again in the middle  certainly the  strange stuff looks at the first glance as if it were behaving in  this way and certainly also his theory would explain the  appearance of sticks and logs in the pitch  but messrs wall and  sawkins say that they observed no such motion nor did we  and i  agree with them that it is not very obvious to what force or what  influence it could be attributable  we must therefore seek for  some other way of accounting for the stickswhich utterly puzzled  us and which mr manross well describes as numerous pieces of wood  which being involved in the pitch are constantly coming to the  surface  they are often several feet in length and five or six  inches in diameter  on caching the surface they generally assume an  upright position one end being detained in the pitch while the  other is elevated by the lifting of the middle  they may be seen at  frequent intervals over the lake standing up to the height of two  or even three feet  they look like stumps of trees protruding  through the pitch but their parvenu character is curiously betrayed  by a ragged cap of pitch which invariably covers the top and hangs  down like hounds ears on either side  whence do they come  have they been blown on to the lake or left  behind by man or are they fossil trees integral parts of the  vegetable stratum below which is continually rolling upward or are  they of both kinds  i do not know  only this is certain as  messrs wall and sawkins have pointed out that not only the purer  varieties of asphalt such as approach or are identical with asphalt  glance have been observed though not i think in the lake  itself in isolated masses where there was little doubt of their  proceeding from ligneous substances of larger dimensions such as  roots and pieces of trunks and branches but moreover that it is  also necessary to admit a species of conversion by contact since  pieces of wood included accidentally in the asphalt for example by  dropping from overhanging vegetation are often found partially  transformed into the material  this is a statement which we  verified again and again as we did the one which follows namely  that the hollow bubbles which abound on the surface of the pitch  generally contain traces of the lighter portions of vegetation  and are manifestly derived from leaves etc which are blown about  the lake by the wind and are covered with asphalt and as they  become asphalt themselves give off gases which form bubbles round  them  but how is it that those logs stand up out of the asphalt with  asphalt caps and hounds ears as mr manross well phrases it on  the tops of them  we pushed on across the lake over the planks which the negroes laid  down from island to island  some meanwhile preferred a steeple chase with waterjumps after the fashion of the midshipmen on a  certain second visit to the lake  how the negroes grinned delight  and surprise at the vagaries of english ladsa species of animal  altogether new to them  and how they grinned still more when  certain staid and portly dignitaries caught the infection and  proved by more than one good leap that they too had been english  schoolboysalas long long ago  so whether by bridging leaping or wading we arrived at last at  the little islands and found them covered with a thick low scrub  deep sedge and among them pinguins like huge pineapples without  the apple gray wild pinesparasites on matapalos which of course  have established themselves like robbers and vagrants as they are  everywhere a true holly with boxlike leaves and a rare cocoa plum 152 very like the holly in habit which seems to be all but  confined to these little patches of red earth afloat on the pitch   out of the scrub when we were there flew off two or three night jars very like our english species save that they had white in the  wings and on the second visit one of the midshipmen true to the  english boys birdsnesting instinct found one of their eggs  whitespotted in a grass nest  passing these little islands which are said i know not how truly  to change their places and number we came to the very fountains of  styx to that part of the lake where the asphalt is still oozing up  as the wind set toward us we soon became aware of an evil smell petroleum and sulphuretted hydrogen at oncewhich gave some of us a  headache  the pitch here is yellow and white with sulphur foam so  are the waterchannels and out of both water and pitch innumerable  bubbles of gas arise loathsome to the smell  we became aware also  that the pitch was soft under our feet  we left the impression of  our boots and if we had stood still awhile we should soon have  been ankledeep  no doubt there are spots where if a man stayed  long enough he would be slowly and horribly engulfed  but as  mr manross says truly in no place is it possible to form those  bowllike depressions round the observer described by former  travellers  what we did see is that the fresh pitch oozes out at  the lines of least resistance namely in the channels between the  older and more hardened masses usually at the upper ends of them  so that one may stand on pitch comparatively hard and put ones  hand into pitch quite liquid which is flowing softly out like some  ugly fungoid growth such as may be seen in old winecellars into  the water  one such pitchfungus had grown several yards in length  in the three weeks between our first and second visit and on  another some of our party performed exactly the same feat as mr  manross  in one of the starshaped pools of water some five feet deep a  column of pitch had been forced perpendicularly up from the bottom   on reaching the surface of the water it had formed a sort of centre  table about four feet in diameter but without touching the sides  of the pool  the stem was about a foot in diameter  i leaped out  on this table and found that it not only sustained my weight but  that the elasticity of the stem enabled me to rock it from side to  side  pieces torn from the edges of this table sank readily  showing that it had been raised by pressure and not by its  buoyancy  true though strange  but stranger still did it seem to us when we  did at last what the negroes asked us and dipped our hands into the  liquid pitch to find that it did not soil the fingers  the old  proverb that one cannot touch pitch without being defiled happily  does not stand true here or the place would be intolerably  loathsome  it can be scraped up moulded into any shape you will  wound in a string as was done by one of the midshipmen round a  stick and carried off  but nothing is left on the hand save clean  gray mud and water  it may be kneaded for an hour before the mud be  sufficiently driven out of it to make it sticky  this very  abundance of earthy matter it is which while it keeps the pitch  from soiling makes it far less valuable than it would be were it  pure  it is easy to understand whence this earthy matter twenty or thirty  per cent comes  throughout the neighbourhood the ground is full  to the depth of hundreds of feet of coaly and asphaltic matter   layers of sandstone or of shale containing this decayed vegetable  alternate with layers which contain none  and if as seems  probable the coaly matter is continually changing into asphalt and  oil and then working its way upward through every crack and pore  to escape from the enormous pressure of the superincumbent soil it  must needs carry up with it innumerable particles of the soils  through which it passes  in five minutes we had seen handled and smelt enough to satisfy us  with this very odd and very nasty vagary of tropic nature and as we  did not wish to become faint and ill between the sulphuretted  hydrogen and the blaze of the sun reflected off the hot black pitch  we hurried on over the waterfurrows and through the sedgebeds to  the farther shoreto find ourselves in a single step out of an  inferno into a paradiso  we looked back at the foul place and agreed that it is well for the  human mind that the pitch lake was still unknown when dante wrote  that hideous poem of histhe opprobrium as i hold of the middle  age  for if such were the dreams of its noblest and purest genius  what must have been the dreams of the ignoble and impure multitude   but had he seen this lake how easy how tempting too it would have  been to him to embody in imagery the surmise of a certain father  and heighten the torments of the lost beings sinking slowly into  that black bolge beneath the baking rays of the tropic sun by the  sight of the saved walking where we walked beneath cool fragrant  shade among the pillars of a temple to which the parthenon is mean  and small  sixty feet and more aloft the short smooth columns of the moriches  154 towered around us till as we looked through the pillared  shade the eye was lost in the green abysses of the forest   overhead their great fan leaves form a groined roof compared with  which that of st mary redcliff or even of kings college is as  clumsy as all mans works are beside the works of god and beyond  the moriche wood ostrich plumes packed close round madderbrown  stems formed a wall to our temple which bore such tracery  carving painting as would have stricken dumb with awe and delight  him who ornamented the loggie of the vatican  true all is still life here  no human forms hardly even that of a bird is mixed  with the vegetable arabesques  a higher state of civilisation ages  after we are dead may introduce them and complete the scene by  peopling it with a race worthy of it  but the creator at least  has done his part toward producing perfect beauty all the more  beautiful from its contrast with the ugliness outside  for the want  of human beings fit for all that beauty man is alone to blame and  when we saw approach us as the only priest of such a temple a wild  brown man who feeds his hogs on moriche fruit and mombin plums and  whose only object was to sell us an anteaters skin we thought to  ourselvesknowing the sad history of the west indieswhat might  this place have become during the three hundred and fifty years  which have elapsed since columbus first sailed round it had men calling themselves christian calling themselves civilised possessed any tincture of real christianity of real civilisation   what a race of mingled spaniard and indian might have grown up  throughout the west indies  what a life what a society what an  art what a science it might have developed ere now equalling even  surpassing that of ionia athens and sicily till the famed isles  and coasts of greece should have been almost forgotten in the new  fame of the isles and coasts of the caribbean sea  what might not have happened had men but tried to copy their father  in heaven  what has happened is but too well known since in july  1498 columbus coming hither fancied and not so wrongly that he  had come to the base of the earthly paradise  what might not have been made with something of justice and mercy  common sense and humanity of these gentle arawaks and guaraons   what was made of them almost ere columbus was dead may be judged  from this one story taken from las casas155  there was a certain man named juan bono who was employed by the  members of the audiencia of st domingo to go and obtain indians   he and his men to the number of fifty or sixty landed on the  island of trinidad  now the indians of trinidad were a mild  loving credulous race the enemies of the caribs who ate human  flesh  on juan bonos landing the indians armed with bows and  arrows went to meet the spaniards and to ask them who they were  and what they wanted  juan bono replied that his crew were good  and peaceful people who had come to live with the indians upon  which as the commencement of good fellowship the natives offered  to build houses for the spaniards  the spanish captain expressed a  wish to have one large house built  the accommodating indians set  about building it  it was to be in the form of a bell and to be  large enough for a hundred persons to live in  on any great  occasion it would hold many more  every day while this house was  being built the spaniards were fed with fish bread and fruit by  their goodnatured hosts  juan bono was very anxious to see the  roof on and the indians continued to work at the building with  alacrity  at last it was completed being two storeys high and so  constructed that those within could not see those without  upon a  certain day juan bono collected the indians togethermen women  and childrenin the building to see as he told them what was  to be done  whether they thought they were coming to some festival or that  they were to do something more for the great house does not appear   however there they all were four hundred of them looking with  much delight at their own handiwork  meanwhile juan bono brought  his men round the building with drawn swords in their hands then  having thoroughly entrapped his indian friends he entered with a  party of armed men and bade the indians keep still or he would kill  them  they did not listen to him but rushed to the door  a  horrible massacre ensued  some of the indians forced their way out  but many of them stupefied at what they saw and losing heart were  captured and bound  a hundred however escaped and snatching up  their arms assembled in one of their own houses and prepared to  defend themselves  juan bono summoned them to surrender  they  would not hear of it and then as las casas says he resolved to  pay them completely for the hospitality and kind treatment he had  received and so setting fire to the house the whole hundred men  together with some women and children were burnt alive  the  spanish captain and his men retired to the ships with their  captives and his vessel happening to touch at porto rico when the  jeronimite fathers were there gave occasion to las casas to  complain of this proceeding to the fathers who however did  nothing in the way of remedy or punishment  the reader will be  surprised to hear the clerigos authority for this deplorable  narrative  it is juan bono himself  from his own mouth i heard  that which i write  juan bono acknowledged that never in his life  had he met with the kindness of father or mother but in the island  of trinidad  well then man of perdition why did you reward them  with such ungrateful wickedness and crueltyon my faith padre  because they he meant the auditors gave me for destruction he  meant instruction to take them in peace if i could not by war  such was the fate of the poor gentle folk who for unknown ages had  swung their hammocks to the stems of these moriches spinning the  skin of the young leaves into twine and making sago from the pith  and thin wine from the sap and fruit while they warned their  children not to touch the nests of the hummingbirds which even  till lately swarmed around the lake  forso the indian story ran once on a time a tribe of chaymas built their palmleaf ajoupas upon  the very spot where the lake now lies and lived a merry life  the  sea swarmed with shellfish and turtle and the land with pine apples the springs were haunted by countless flocks of flamingoes  and horned screamers pajuis and blue ramiers and above all by  hummingbirds  but the foolish chaymas were blind to the mystery  and the beauty of the hummingbirds and would not understand how  they were no other than the souls of dead indians translated into  living jewels and so they killed them in wantonness and angered  the good spirit  but one morning when the guaraons came by the  chayma village had sunk deep into the earth and in its place had  risen this lake of pitch  so runs the tale told some forty years  since to m joseph author of a clever little history of trinidad  by an old halfcaste indian senor trinidada by name who was said  then to be nigh one hundred years of age  surely the people among whom such a myth could spring up were  worthy of a nobler fate  surely there were in them elements of  sweetness and light which might have been cultivated to some fine  fruit had there been anything like sweetness and light in their  first conquerorsthe offscourings not of spain and portugal only  but of germany italy and indeed almost every country in europe   the present spanish landowners of trinidad be it remembered always  do not derive from those old ruffians but from noble and ancient  families who settled in the island during the seventeenth century  bringing with them a spanish grace spanish simplicity and spanish  hospitality which their descendants have certainly not lost  were  it my habit to put people into books i would gladly tell in these  pages of charming days spent in the company of spanish ladies and  gentlemen  but i shall only hint here at the special affection and  respect with which theyand indeed the french creoles likewise are regarded by negro and by indian  for there are a few indians remaining in the northern mountains and  specially at arimasimple hamletfolk whom you can distinguish at  a glance from mulattoes or quadroons by the tawny complexion and  by a shape of eye and length between the eye and the mouth  difficult to draw impossible to describe but discerned instantly  by any one accustomed to observe human features  many of them  doubtless have some touch of negro blood and are the offspring of  cimaronsmaroons as they are still called in jamaica  these  cimarons were negroes who even in the latter half of the sixteenth  century as may be read in the tragical tale of john oxenham given  in hakluyts voyages had begun to flee from their cruel masters  into the forests both in the islands and in the main  there they  took to themselves indian wives who preferred them it is said to  men of their own race and lived a jolly hunters life slaying with  tortures every spaniard who fell into their hands  such doubtless  haunted the northern cerros of tocuche aripo and oropuche and  left some trace of themselves among the guaraons  spanish blood  too runs notoriously in the veins of some of the indians of the  island and the pure race here is all but vanished  but out of  these three elements has arisen a race of cacaogrowing mountaineers  as simple and gentle as loyal and peaceable as any in her  majestys dominions  dignified courteous hospitable according to  their little means they salute the white senor without defiance and  without servility and are delighted if he will sit in their clay  and palm ajoupas and eat oranges and malacca apples 157 from  their own trees on their own freehold land  they preserve too the old guaraon arts of weaving baskets and  other utensils pretty enough from the strips of the aruma leaves   from them the negro who will not or cannot equal them in  handicraft buys the pack in which wares are carried on the back  and the curious strainer in which the cassava is deprived of its  poisonous juice  so cleverly are the fibres twisted that when the  strainer is hung up with a stone weight at the lower end the  diameter of the strainer decreases as its length increases and the  juice is squeezed out through the pores to drip into a calabash  and nowadays to be thrown carefully away lest children or goats  should drink it  of old it was kept with care and dried down to a  gum and used to poison arrows as it is still used i believe on  the orinoco now its poisonous properties are expelled by boiling  it down into cassaripe which has a singular power of preserving  meat and is the foundation of the pepperpot of the colonists  and this is all that remains of the once beautiful deft and happy  indians of trinidad unless indeed some of them warned by the  fate of the indians of san josef and the northern mountains fled  from such tyrants as juan bono and berreo across the gulf of paria  and rejoining their kinsmen on the mainland gladly forgot the  sight of that cross which was to them the emblem not of salvation  but of destruction  for once a year till of latei know not whether the thing may be  seen stilla strange phantom used to appear at san fernando twenty  miles to the north  canoes of indians came mysteriously across the  gulf of paria from the vast swamps of the orinoco and the naked  folk landed and went up through the town after the naparima ladies  so runs the tale had sent down to the shore garments for the  women which were worn only through the streets and laid by again  as soon as they entered the forest  silent modest dejected the  gentle savages used to vanish into the woods by paths known to their  kinsfolk centuries agopaths which run wherever possible along  the vantageground of the topmost chines and ridges of the hills   the smoke of their fires rose out of lonely glens as they collected  the fruit of trees known only to themselves  in a few weeks their  wild harvest was over they came back through san fernando made  almost in silence their little purchases in the town and paddled  away across the gulf towards the unknown wildernesses from whence  they came  and nowas if sent to drive away sad thoughts and vain regrets before our feet lay a jest of natures almost as absurd as a four eyed fish or callingcrab  a rough stick of the size of your  little finger lay on the pitch  we watched it a moment and saw  that it was crawlingthat it was a huge caddis like those in  english ponds and streams though of a very different family  they  are the larvae of phryganeasthis of a true moth 158  the male  of this moth will come out as a moth should and fly about on four  handsome wings  the female will never develop her wings but remain  to her lifes end a crawling grub like the female of our own  vapourer moth and that of our english glowworm  but more she  will never at least in some species of this family leave her silk  and bark case but live and die an anchoritess in narrow cell  leaving behind her more than one puzzle for physiologists  the case  is fitted close to the body of the caterpillar save at the mouth  where it hangs loose in two ragged silken curtains  we all looked  at the creature and it looked at us with its last two or three  joints and its head thrust out of its house  suddenly disgusted at  our importunity it laid hold of its curtains with two hands right  and left like a human being folded them modestly over its head  held them tight together and so retired to bed amid the  inextinguishable laughter of the whole party  the noble moriche palm delights in wet at least in trinidad and on  the lower orinoco  but schomburgk describes forests of themif  indeed it be the same speciesas growing in the mountains of  guiana up to an altitude of four thousand feet  the soil in which  they grow here is half pitch pavement half loose brown earth and  over both shallow pools of water which will become much deeper in  the wet season and all about float or lie their pretty fruit the  size of an apple and scaled like a fircone  they are last years  empty and decayed  the ripe fruit contains first a rich pulpy nut  and at last a hard cone something like that of the vegetable ivory  palm 159 which grows in the mainland but not here  delicious  they are and precious to monkeys and parrots as well as to the  orinoco indians among whom the tamanacs according to humboldt  say that when a man and woman survived that great deluge which the  mexicans call the age of water they cast behind them over their  heads the fruits of the moriche palm as deucalion and pyrrha cast  stones and saw the seeds in them produce men and women who  repeopled the earth  no wonder indeed that certain tribes look on  this tree as sacred or that the missionaries should have named it  the tree of life  in the season of inundations these clumps of mauritia with their  leaves in the form of a fan have the appearance of a forest rising  from the bosom of the waters  the navigator in proceeding along the  channels of the delta of the oroonoco at night sees with surprise  the summit of the palmtrees illumined by large fires  these are  the habitations of the guaraons tivitivas and waraweties of  raleigh which are suspended from the trunks of the trees  these  tribes hang up mats in the air which they fill with earth and  kindle on a layer of moist clay the fire necessary for their  household wants  they have owed their liberty and their political  independence for ages to the quaking and swampy soil which they  pass over in the time of drought and on which they alone know how  to walk in security to their solitude in the delta of the oroonoco  to their abode on the trees where religious enthusiasm will  probably never lead any american stylites     the mauritia palm tree the tree of life of the missionaries not only affords the  guaraons a safe dwelling during the risings of the oroonoco but its  shelly fruit its farinaceous pith its juice abounding in  saccharine matter and the fibres of its petioles furnish them with  food wine and thread proper for making cords and weaving hammocks   these customs of the indians of the delta of the oroonoco were found  formerly in the gulf of darien uraba and in the greater part of  the inundated lands between the guerapiche and the mouths of the  amazon  it is curious to observe in the lowest degree of human  civilisation the existence of a whole tribe depending on one single  species of palmtree similar to those insects which feed on one and  the same flower or on one and the same part of a plant 160  in a hundred yards more we were on dry ground and the vegetation  changed at once  the mauritias stopped short at the edge of the  swamp and around us towered the smooth stems of giant mombins  which the english west indians call hogplums according to the  unfortunate habit of the early settlers of discarding the sonorous  and graceful indian and spanish names of plants and replacing them  by names english or corruptions of the original always ugly and  often silly and vulgar  so the english call yon noble tree a hog plum the botanist who must of course use his worldwide latin  designation spondias lutea i shall with the readers leave call  it a mombin by which name it is happily known here as it was in  the french west indies in the days of good pere labat  under the  mombins the undergrowth is for the most part huge fans of cocorite  palm thirty or forty feet high their short rugged trunks as  usual loaded with creepers orchids birdsnests and huge round  black lumps which are the nests of ants all lodged among the butts  of old leaves and the spathes of old flowers  here as at  chaguanas grand cerimans and seguines scrambled twenty feet up the  cocorite trunks delighting us by the luscious life in the fat stem  and fat leaves and the brilliant yet tender green which literally  shone in the darkness of the cocorite bower and all it may be the  growth of the last six months for as was plain from the charred  stems of many cocorites and moriches the fire had swept through the  wood last summer destroying all that would burn  and at the foot  of the cocorites weltering up among and over their roots was pitch  again and here and there along the side of the path were pitch  springs round bosses a yard or two across and a foot or two high  each with a crater atop a few inches across filled either with  water or with liquid and oozing pitch and yet not interfering as  far as could be seen with the health of the vegetation which  springs out of it  we followed the trace which led downhill to the shore of the  peninsula farthest from the village  as we proceeded we entered  forest still unburnt and a tangle of beauty such as we saw at  chaguanas  there rose once more the tall canelike manacque  palms which we christened the forest nymphs  the path was lined  as there with the great leaves of the melastomas throwing russet  and golden light down from their undersides  here as there mimosa  leaflets as fine as fern or seaweed shiver in the breeze  a  species of balisier which we did not see there carried crimson and  black parrot beaks with blue seedvessels a canne de riviere  161a with a stem eight feet high wreathed round with pale green  leaves in spiral twists unfolded hooded flowers of thinnest  transparent white wax with each a blush of pink inside  bunches of  bright yellow cassia blossoms dangled close to our heads white  ipomoeas scrambled over them again and broadleaved sedges five  feet high carrying on bright brown flowerheads like those of our  woodrush blue black and white shot for seeds 161b  overhead  sprawled and dangled the common vinebamboo 161c ugly and  unsatisfactory in form because it has not yet seemingly made up  its mind whether it will become an arborescent or a climbing grass  and meanwhile tries to stand upright on stems quite unable to  support it and tumbles helplessly into the neighbouring copsewood  taking every ones arm without asking leave  a few ages hence its  ablest descendants will probably have made their choice if they  have constitution enough to survive in the battle of lifewhich  from the commonness of the plant they seem likely to have  and  what their choice will be there is little doubt  there are trees  here of a truly noble nature whose ancestors have conquered ages  since it may be by selfish and questionable means  but their  descendants secure in their own power can afford to be generous  and allow a whole world of lesser plants to nestle in their  branches another world to fatten round their feet  there are  humble and modest plants too hereand those some of the  loveliestwhich have long since cast away all ambition and are  content to crouch or perch anywhere if only they may be allowed a  chance ray of light and a chance drop of water wherewith to perfect  their flowers and seed  but throughout the great republic of the  forest the motto of the majority isas it is and always has been  with human beingsevery one for himself and the devil take the  hindmost  selfish competition overreaching tyranny the temper  which fawns and clings as long as it is down and when it has risen  kicks over the stool by which it climbedthese and the other works  of the flesh are the works of the average plant as far as it can  practise them  so by the time the bamboovine makes up its mind it  will have discovered by the experience of many generations the  value of the proverb never do for yourself what you can get  another to do for you and will have developed into a true high  climber selfish and insolent choking and strangling like yonder  beautiful green pest of which beware namely a tangle of razor grass 162a  the brother in old times of that broadleaved sedge  which carries the shotseeds it has long since found it more  profitable to lean on others than to stand on its own legs and has  developed itself accordingly  it has climbed up the shrubs some  fifteen feet and is now tumbling down again in masses of the purest  deep green which are always softly rounded because each slender  leaf is sabreshaped and always curves inward and downward into the  mass presenting to the paper thousands of minute sawedges hard  enough and sharp enough to cut clothes skin and flesh to ribands  if it is brushed in the direction of the leaves  for shape and  colour few plants would look more lovely in a hothouse but it  would soon need to be confined in a den by itself like a jaguar or  an alligator  here too we saw a beautiful object which was seen again more than  once about the high woods a large flower 162b spreading its five  flat orangescarlet lobes round yellow bells  it grows in little  bunches in the axils of pairs of fleshy leaves on a climbing vine   when plucked a milky sap exudes from it  it is a cousin of our  periwinkles and cousin too of the thevetia which we saw at st  thomass and of the yellow allamandas which ornament hothouses at  home as this and others of its family especially the yellow  odontadenia surely ought to do  there are many species of the  family about and all beautiful  we passed too in the path an object curious enough if not  beautiful  up a smooth stem ran a little rib seemingly of earth  and dead wood almost straight and about half an inch across  leading to a great brown lump among the branches as big as a bushel  basket  we broke it open and found it a covered gallery swarming  with life  brown antlike creatures white maggotlike creatures  of several shapes and sizes were hurrying up and down as busy as  human beings in cheapside  they were termites white antsof  which of the many species i know notand the lump above was their  nest  but why they should find it wisest to perch their nest aloft  is as difficult to guess as to guess why they take the trouble to  build this gallery up to it instead of walking up the stem in the  open air  it may be that they are afraid of birds  it may be too  that they actually dislike the light  at all events the majority  of themthe workers and soldiers i believe without exceptionare  blind and do all their work by an intensely developed sense of  touch and it may be of smell and hearing also  be that as it may  we should have seen them had we had time to wait repair the breach  in their gallery with as much discipline and division of labour as  average human workers in a manufactory before the business of food getting was resumed  we hurried on along the trace which now sloped rapidly downhill   suddenly a loathsome smell defiled the air  was there a gashouse  in the wilderness  or had the pales of paradise been just smeared  with bad coaltar  not exactly  but across the path crept  festering in the sun a black runnel of petroleum and water and  twenty yards to our left stood under a fastcrumbling trunk what  was a year or two ago a little enginehouse  now roof beams  machinery were all tumbled and tangled in hideous and somewhat  dangerous ruin over a shaft in the midst of which a rusty pump cylinder gurgled and clicked and bubbled and spued with black  oil and nasty gas a foul ulcer in dame natures side which happily  was healing fast beneath the tropic rain and sun  the creepers were  climbing over it the earth crumbling into it and in a few years  more the whole would be engulfed in forest and the oilspring it  is to be hoped choked up with mud  this is the remnant of one of the many rash speculations connected  with the pitch lake  at a depth of some two hundred and fifty feet  oil was struck as the american saying is  but so we were told  it would not rise in the boring and had to be pumped up  it could  not therefore compete in price with the pennsylvanian oil which  when tapped springs out of the ground of itself to a height  sometimes of many feet under the pressure of the superincumbent  rocks yielding enormous profits and turning needy adventurers into  millionaires though full half of the oil is sometimes wasted for  the want of means to secure it  we passed the doleful spot with a double regretfor the nook of  paradise which had been defiled and for the good money which had  been wasted  but with a hearty hope too that whatever natural  beauty may be spoilt thereby the wealth of these asphalt deposits  may at last be utilised  whether it be good that a few dozen men  should make their fortunes thereby depends on what use the said  men make of the said fortunes and certainly it will not be good  for them if they believe as too many do that their dollars and  not their characters constitute their fortunes  but it is good  and must be that these treasures of heat and light should not  remain for ever locked up and idle in the wilderness and we wished  all success to the enterprising american who had just completed a  bargain with the government for a large supply of asphalt which he  hoped by his chemical knowledge to turn to some profitable use  another turn brought us into a fresh nook of paradise and this time  to one still undefiled  we hurried down a narrow grass path the  cannes de riviere and the balisiers brushing our heads as we passed  while round us danced brilliant butterflies bright orange sulphur yellow black and crimson black and lilac and half a dozen hues  more till we stopped surprised and delighted  for beneath us lay  the sea seen through a narrow gap of richest verdure  on the left low palms feathered over the path and over the cliff   on the rightwhen shall we see it againrose a young bois flot  164 of which boys make their fishing floats with long straight  upright shoots and huge crumpled rounded leaves pale rusty  underneatha noble rastrajo plant already in its six months  growth some twenty feet high  its broad pale sulphur flowers were  yet unopened but instead an ivyleaved ipomoea had climbed up it  and shrouded it from head to foot with hundreds of white  convolvulusflowers while underneath it grew a tuft of that  delicate silverbacked fern which is admired so much in hothouses  at home  between it and the palms we saw the still shining sea  muddy inshore and a few hundred yards out changing suddenly to  bright green and the point of the cove which seemed built up of  bright red brick fast crumbling into the sea with all its palms  and cactuses lianes and trees  red stacks and skerries stood  isolated and ready to fall at the end of the point showing that the  land has even lately extended far out to sea and that point  rouge like point courbaril and point galbaso named one from some  great locusttree the other from some great galbamust have once  stood there as landmarks  indeed all the points of the peninsula  are but remnants of a far larger sheet of land which has been  slowly eaten up by the surges of the gulf which has perhaps  actually sunk bodily beneath them even as the remnant i suspect  is sinking now  we scrambled twenty feet down to the beach and lay  down tired under a low cliff feathered with richest vegetation   the pebbles on which we sat were some of pitch some of hard  sandstone but most of them of brick pale dark yellow lavender  spotted clouded and half a dozen more delicate hues some coarse  some fine as samian ware the rocks themselves were composed of an  almost glassy substance strangely jumbled even intercalated now  and then with soft sand  this we were told is a bit of the  porcellanite formation of trinidad curious to geologists which  reappears at several points in erin trois and cedros in the  extreme southwestern horn of the island  how was it formed and when  that it was formed by the action of  fire any child would agree who had ever seen a brickkiln  it is  simply clay and sand baked and often almost vitrified into  porcelainjasper  the stratification is gone the porcellanite has  run together into irregular masses or fallen into them by the  burning away of strata beneath and the cracks in it are often lined  with bubbled slag  but whence carne the fire  we must be wary about calling in the  deus e machina of a volcano  there is no volcanic rock in the  neighbourhood nor anywhere in the island and the porcellanite  says mr wall is identically the same with the substances produced  immediately above or below seams of coal which have taken fire and  burnt for a length of time  there is lignite and other coaly  matter enough in the rocks to have burnt like coal if it had once  been ignited and the cause of ignition may be as mr wall  suggests the decomposition of pyrites of which also there is  enough around  that the heat did not come from below as volcanic  heat would have done is proved by the fact that the lignite beds  underneath the porcellanite are unburnt  we found asphalt under the  porcellanite  we found even one bit of red porcellanite with  unburnt asphalt included in it  may not this strange formation of natural brick and chinaware be of  immense agehumanly not geologically speaking  may it not be far  older than the pitch lake aboveolder possibly than the formation  of any asphalt at all  and may not the asphalt mingled with it have  been squeezed into it and round it as it is being squeezed into and  through the unburnt strata at so many points in guapo la brea  oropuche and san fernando  at least so it seemed to us as we sat  on the shore waiting for the boat to take us round to la brea and  drank in dreamily with our eyes the beauty of that strange lonely  place  the only living things save ourselves which were visible  were a few pelicans sleeping on a skerry and a shoal of dolphins  rolling silently in threeshusband wife and little childas they  fished their way along the tide mark between the yellow water and  the green  the sky blazed overhead the sea below the red rocks  and green forests blazed around and we sat enjoying the genial  silence not of darkness but of light not of death but of life  as the noble heat permeated every nerve and made us feel young and  strong and blithe once more    chapter ix  san josef    the road to the ancient capital of the island is pleasant enough  and characteristic of the west indies  not indeed as to its  breadth make and material for they contrary to the wont of west  india roads are as good as they would be in england but on account  of the quaint travellers along it and the quaint sights which are  to be seen over every hedge  you pass all the races of the island  going to and from town or fieldwork or washing clothes in some  clear brook beside which a solemn chinaman sits catching for his  dinner strange fishes known to my learned friend dr gunther and  perhaps to one or two other men in europe but certainly not to me   always somebody or something new and strange is to be seen for  eight most pleasant miles  the road runs at first along a low cliff foot with an ugly mangrove  swamp looking just like an alderbed at home between you and the  sea a swamp which it would be worth while to drain by a steampump  and then plant with coconuts or bamboos for its miasma makes the  southern corner of port of spain utterly pestilential  you cross a  railroad the only one in the island which goes to a limestone  quarry and so out along a wide straight road with negro cottages  right and left embowered in fruit and flowers  they grow fewer and  finer as you ride on and soon you are in open country principally  of large paddocks  these paddocks like all west indian ones are  apt to be ragged with weeds and scrub  but the coarse broadleaved  grasses seem to keep the mules in good condition enough at least in  the rainy season  most of these paddocks have i believe been  under cane cultivation at some time or other and have been thrown  into grass during the period of depression dating from 1845  it has  not been worth while as yet to break them up again though the  profits of sugarfarming are now or at least ought to be very  large  but the soil along this line is originally poor and sandy  and it is far more profitable to break up the rich vegas or low  alluvial lands even at the trouble of clearing them of forest  so  these paddocks are left often with noble trees standing about in  them putting one in mindif it were not for the palmistes and  bamboos and the crowd of black vultures over an occasional dead  animalof english parks  but few english parks have such backgrounds  to the right the vast  southern flat with its smoking enginehouse chimneys and bright  green canepieces and beyond all the black wall of the primeval  forest and to the left some half mile off the steep slopes of the  green northern mountains blazing in the sun and sending down every  two or three miles out of some charming glen a clear pebbly brook  each winding through its narrow strip of vega  the vega is usually  a highly cultivated canepiece where great lizards sit in the  mouths of their burrows and watch the passer by with intense  interest  coolies and negroes are at work in it  but only a few  for the strength of the hands is away at the enginehouse making  sugar day and night  there is a piece of cane in act of being cut   the men are hewing down the giant grass with cutlasses the women  stripping off the leaves and then piling the cane in carts drawn by  mules the leaders of which draw by rope traces two or three times  as long as themselves  you wonder why such a seeming waste of power  is allowed till you see one of the carts stick fast in a mudhole  and discover that even in the west indies there is a good reason for  everything and that the creoles know their own business best  for  the wheelers being in the slough with the cart are powerless but  the leaders who have scrambled through are safe on dry land at the  end of their long traces and haul out their brethren cart and all  amid the yells and i am sorry to say blows of the black gentlemen  in attendance  but cane cutting is altogether a busy happy scene   the heat is awful and all limbs rain perspiration  yet no one  seems to mind the heat all look fat and jolly and they have cause  to do so for all at every spare moment are sucking sugarcane  you pull up and take off your hat to the party  the negroes shout  marnin sa  the coolies salaam gracefully hand to forehead   you return the salaam hand to heart which is considered the  correct thing on the part of a superior in rank whereat the coolies  look exceedingly pleased and then the whole party without visible  reason burst into shouts of laughter  the manager rides up probably under an umbrella as you are and a  pleasant and instructive chat follows wound up usually if the  house be not far off by an invitation to come in and have a light  drink an invitation which considering the state of the  thermometer you will be tempted to accept especially as you know  that the claret and water will be excellent  and so you dawdle on  looking at this and that new and odd sight but most of all feasting  your eyes on the beauty of the northern mountains till you reach  the gentle rise on which stands eight miles from port of spain the  little city of san josef  we should call it here in england a  village  still it is not every village in england which has fought  the dutch and earned its right to be called a city by beating some  of the bravest sailors of the seventeenth century  true there is  not a single shop in it with plateglass windows  but what matters  that if its citizens have all that civilised people need and more  and will heap what they have on the stranger so hospitably that they  almost pain him by the trouble which they take  true no carriages  and pairs with powdered footmen roll about the streets and the  most splendid vehicles you are likely to meet are american buggies fourwheeled gigs with heads and aprons through which the reins can  be passed in wet weather  but what matters that as long as the  buggies keep out sun and rain effectually and as long as those who  sit in them be real gentlemen and those who wait for them at home  whether in the city or the estates around be real ladies  as for  the restpeace plenty perpetual summer time to think and read for there are no daily papers in san josefand what can man want  more on earth  so i thought more than once as i looked at san  josef nestling at the mouth of its noble glen and said to myself if the telegraph cable were but laid down the islands as it will be  in another year or two and one could hear a little more swiftly and  loudly the beating of the great mothers heart at home then would  san josef be about the most delectable spot which i have ever seen  for a cultivated and civilised man to live and work and think and  die in  san josef has had nevertheless its troubles and excitements more  than once since it defeated the dutch  even as late as 1837 it  was for a few hours in utter terror and danger from a mutiny of  free black recruits  no one in the island civil or military seems  to have been to blame for the mishap  it was altogether owing to  the unwisdom of military authorities at home who seem to have  fancied that they could transform by a magical spurt of the pen  heathen savages into british soldiers  the whole tragedyfor tragedy it wasis so curious and so  illustrative of the negro character and of the effects of the slave  trade that i shall give it at length as it stands in that clever  little history of trinidad by m thomas which i have quoted more  than once  donald stewart or rather daaga 170 was the adopted son of  madershee the old and childless king of the tribe called paupaus a  race that inhabit a tract of country bordering on that of the  yarrabas  these races are constantly at war with each other  daaga was just the man whom a savage warlike and depredatory  tribe would select for their chieftain as the african negroes  choose their leaders with reference to their personal prowess   daaga stood six feet six inches without shoes  although scarcely  muscular in proportion yet his frame indicated in a singular degree  the union of irresistible strength and activity  his head was  large his features had all the peculiar traits which distinguish  the negro in a remarkable degree his jaw was long eyes large and  protruded high cheekbones and flat nose his teeth were large and  regular  he had a singular cast in his eyes not quite amounting to  that obliquity of the visual organs denominated a squint but  sufficient to give his features a peculiarly forbidding appearance his forehead however although small in proportion to his enormous  head was remarkably compact and well formed  the whole head was  disproportioned having the greater part of the brain behind the  ears but the greatest peculiarity of this singular being was his  voice  in the course of my life i never heard such sounds uttered  by human organs as those formed by daaga  in ordinary conversation  he appeared to me to endeavour to soften his voiceit was a deep  tenor but when a little excited by any passion and this savage was  the child of passion his voice sounded like the low growl of a  lion but when much excited it could be compared to nothing so aptly  as the notes of a gigantic brazen trumpet  i repeatedly questioned this man respecting the religion of his  tribe  the result of his answers led me to infer that the paupaus  believed in the existence of a future state that they have a  confused notion of several powers good and evil but these are  ruled by one supreme being called holloloo  this account of the  religion of daaga was confirmed by the military chaplain who  attended him in his last moments  he also informed me that he  believed in predestinationat least he said that holloloo he  knew had ordained that he should come to white mans country and be  shot  daaga having made a successful predatory expedition into the  country of the yarrabas returned with a number of prisoners of that  nation  these he as usual took bound and guarded towards the  coast to sell to the portuguese  the interpreter his countryman  called these portuguese white gentlemen  the white gentlemen proved  themselves more than a match for the black gentlemen and the whole  transaction between the portuguese and paupaus does credit to all  concerned in this gentlemanly traffic in human flesh  daaga sold his prisoners and under pretence of paying him he and  his paupau guards were enticed on board a portuguese vesselthey  were treacherously overpowered by the christians who bound them  beside their late prisoners and the vessel sailed over the great  salt water  this transaction caused in the breast of the savage a deep hatred  against all white mena hatred so intense that he frequently  during and subsequent to the mutiny declared he would eat the first  white man he killed yet this cannibal was made to swear allegiance  to our sovereign on the holy evangelists and was then called a  british soldier  on the voyage the vessel on board which daaga had been entrapped  was captured by the british  he could not comprehend that his new  captors liberated him  he had been over reached and trepanned by  one set of white men and he naturally looked on his second captors  as more successful rivals in the human or rather inhuman guinea  trade therefore this event lessened not his hatred for white men in  the abstract  i was informed by several of the africans who came with him that  when during the voyage they upbraided daaga with being the cause  of their capture he pacified them by promising that when they  should arrive in white mans country he would repay their perfidy  by attacking them in the night  he further promised that if the  paupaus and the yarrabas would follow him he would fight his way  back to guinea  this account was fully corroborated by many of the  mutineers especially those who were shot with daaga  they all said  the revolt never would have happened but for donald stewart as he  was called by the officers but africans who were not of his tribe  called him longalonga on account of his height  such was this extraordinary man who led the mutiny i am about to  relate  a quantity of captured africans having been brought hither from the  islands of grenada and dominica they were most imprudently induced  to enlist as recruits in the 1st west india regiment  true it is  we have been told they did this voluntarily  but it may be asked  if they had any will in the matter how could they understand the  duties to be imposed on them by becoming soldiers or how comprehend  the nature of an oath of allegiance without which they could not  legally speaking be considered as soldiers  i attended the whole  of the trials of these men and well know how difficult it was to  make them comprehend any idea which was at all new to them by means  of the best interpreters procurable  it has been said that by making those captured negroes soldiers a  service was rendered them  this i doubt  formerly it was most true  that a soldier in a black regiment was better off than a slave but  certainly a free african in the west indies now is infinitely in a  better situation than a soldier not only in a pecuniary point of  view but in almost every other respect  to the african savage while being drilled into the duties of a  soldier many things seem absolute tyranny which would appear to a  civilised man a mere necessary restraint  to keep the restless body  of an african negro in a position to which he has not been  accustomedto cramp his splayfeet with his great toes standing  out into european shoes made for feet of a different formto place  a collar round his neck which is called a stock and which to him  is cruel tortureabove all to confine him every night to his  barracksare almost insupportable  one unacquainted with the  habits of the negro cannot conceive with what abhorrence he looks on  having his disposition to nocturnal rambles checked by barrack  regulations 172  formerly the kings man as the black soldier loved to call  himself looked not without reason contemptuously on the planters  slave although he himself was after all but a slave to the state   but these recruits were enlisted shortly after a number of their  recently imported countrymen were wandering freely over the country  working either as free labourers or settling to use an apt  american phrase as squatters and to assert that the recruit while  under military probation is better off than the free trinidad  labourer who goes where he lists and earns as much in one day as  will keep him for three days is an absurdity  accordingly we find  that lieutenantcolonel bush who commanded the 1st west india  regiment thought that the mutiny was mainly owing to the ill advice  of their civil or we should rather say unmilitary countrymen   this to a certain degree was the fact  but by the declaration of  daaga and many of his countrymen it is evident the seeds of mutiny  were sown on the passage from africa  it has been asserted that the recruits were driven to mutiny by  hard treatment of their commanding officers  there seems not the  slightest truth in this assertion they were treated with fully as  much kindness as their situation would admit of and their chief was  peculiarly a favourite of colonel bush and the officers  notwithstanding daagas violent and ferocious temper often caused  complaints to be brought against him  a correspondent of the naval and military gazette was under an  apprehension that the mutineers would be joined by the praedial  apprentices of the circumjacent estates  not the slightest  foundation existed for this apprehension  some months previous to  this daaga had planned a mutiny but this was interrupted by sending  a part of the paupau and yarraba recruits to st lucia  the object  of all those conspiracies was to get back to guinea which they  thought they could accomplish by marching to eastward  on the night of the 17th of june 1837 the people of san josef were  kept awake by the recruits about 280 in number singing the war song of the paupaus  this wild song consisted of a short air and  chorus  the tone was although wild not inharmonious and the  words rather euphonious  as near as our alphabet can convey them  they ran thus   dangkarree au fey oluu werrei au lay   which may be rendered almost literally by the following couplet   air by the chief  come to plunder come to slay chorus of followers  we are ready to obey   about three oclock in the morning their warsong highly  characteristic of a predatory tribe became very loud and they  commenced uttering their warcry  this is different from what we  conceive the indian warwhoop to be  it seems to be a kind of  imitation of the growl of wild beasts and has a most thrilling  effect  fire now was set to a quantity of huts built for the accommodation  of african soldiers to the northward of the barracks as well as to  the house of a poor black woman called dalrymple  these burnt  briskly throwing a dismal glare over the barracks and picturesque  town of san josef and overpowering the light of the full moon  which illumined a cloudless sky  the mutineers made a rush at the  barrackroom and seized on the muskets and fusees in the racks   their leader daaga and a daring yarraba named ogston instantly  charged their pieces the former of these had a quantity of ball cartridges loose powder and ounce and pistolballs in a kind of  gray worsted cap  he must have provided himself with these before  the mutiny  how he became possessed of them especially the pistol balls i never could learn probably he was supplied by his  unmilitary countrymen  pistolballs are never given to infantry   previous to this daaga and three others made a rush at the  regimental storeroom in which was deposited a quantity of powder   an old african soldier named charles dickson interfered to stop  them on which maurice ogston the yarraba chief who had armed  himself with a sergeants sword cut down the faithful african   when down daaga said in english ah you old soldier you knock  down  dixon was not daagas countryman hence he could not speak  to him in his own language  the paupau then levelled his musket and  shot the fallen soldier who groaned and died  the waryells or  rather growls of the paupaus and yarrabas now became awfully  thrilling as they helped themselves to cartridges  most of them  were fortunately blank or without ball  never was a premeditated  mutiny so wild and ill planned  their chief daaga and ogston  seemed to have had little command of the subordinates and the whole  acted more like a set of wild beasts who had broken their cages than  men resolved on war  at this period had a rush been made at the officers quarters by  one half they were more than 200 in number and the other half  surrounded the building not one could have escaped  instead of  this they continued to shout their warsong and howl their war notes they loaded their pieces with ballcartridge or blank  cartridge and small stones and commenced firing at the long range  of white buildings in which colonel bush and his officers slept   they wasted so much ammunition on this useless display of fury that  the buildings were completely riddled  a few of the old soldiers  opposed them and were wounded but it fortunately happened that  they were to an inconceivable degree ignorant of the right use of  firearmsholding their muskets in their hands when they discharged  them without allowing the buttend to rest against their shoulders  or any part of their bodies  this fact accounts for the  comparatively little mischief they did in proportion to the quantity  of ammunition thrown away  the officers and sergeantmajor escaped at the back of the  building while colonel bush and adjutant bentley came down a little  hill  the colonel commanded the mutineers to lay down their arms  and was answered by an irregular discharge of balls which rattled  amongst the leaves of a tree under which he and the adjutant were  standing  on this colonel bush desired mr bentley to make the best  of his way to st jamess barracks for all the disposable force of  the 89th regiment  the officers made good their retreat and the  adjutant got into the stable where his horse was  he saddled and  bridled the animal while the shots were coming into the stable  without either man or beast getting injured  the officer mounted  but had to make his way through the mutineers before he could get  into san josef the barracks standing on an eminence above the  little town  on seeing the adjutant mounted the mutineers set up a  thrilling howl and commenced firing at him  he discerned the  gigantic figure of daaga alias donald stewart with his musket at  the trail  he spurred his horse through the midst of them they  were grouped but not in line  on looking back he saw daaga aiming  at him he stooped his head beside his horses neck and effectually  sheltered himself from about fifty shots aimed at him  in this  position he rode furiously down a steep hill leading from the  barracks to the church and was out of danger  his escape appears  extraordinary  but he got safe to town and thence to st jamess  and in a short time considering it is eleven miles distant brought  out a strong detachment of european troops these however did not  arrive until the affair was over  in the meantime a part of the officers quarters was bravely  defended by two old african soldiers sergeant merry and corporal  plague  the latter stood in the gallery near the room in which  were the colours he was ineffectually fired at by some hundreds  yet he kept his post shot two of the mutineers and it is said  wounded a third  such is the difference between a man acquainted  with the use of firearms and those who handle them as mops are held  in the meantime colonel bush got to a policestation above the  barracks and got muskets and a few cartridges from a discharged  african soldier who was in the police establishment  being joined  by the policemen corporal craven 175 and ensign pogson they  concealed themselves on an eminence above and as the mutineers  about 100 in number approached the fire of muskets opened on them  from the little ambush  the little party fired separately loading  as fast as they discharged their pieces they succeeded in making  the mutineers change their route  it is wonderful what little courage the savages in general showed  against the colonel and his little party who absolutely beat them  although but a twentyfifth of their number and at their own  tactics ie bush fighting  a body of the mutineers now made towards the road to maraccas when  the colonel and his three assistants contrived to get behind a silk cotton tree and recommenced firing on them  the africans hesitated  and set forward when the little party continued to fire on them  they set up a yell and retreated down the hill  a part of the mutineers now concealed themselves in the bushes  about san josef barracks  these men after the affair was over  joined colonel bush and with a mixture of cunning and effrontery  smiled as though nothing had happened and as though they were glad  to see him although in general they each had several shirts and  pairs of trousers on preparatory for a start to guinea by way of  band de lest 176a  in the meantime the san josef militia were assembled to the number  of forty  major giuseppi and captain and adjutant rousseau of the  second division of militia forces took command of them  they were  in want of flints powder and ballsto obtain these they were  obliged to break open a merchants store however the adjutant so  judiciously distributed his little force as to hinder the mutineers  from entering the town or obtaining access to the militia arsenal  wherein there was a quantity of arms  major chadds and several old  african soldiers joined the militia and were by them supplied with  arms  a good deal of skirmishing occurred between the militia and  detached parties of the mutineers which uniformly ended in the  defeat of the latter  at length daaga appeared to the right of a  party of six at the entrance of the town they were challenged by  the militia and the mutineers fired on them but without effect   only two of the militia returned the fire when all but daaga fled   he was deliberately reloading his piece when a militiaman named  edmond luce leaped on the gigantic chief who would have easily  beat him off although the former was a strong young man of colour   but daaga would not let go his gun and in common with all the  mutineers he seemed to have no idea of the use of the bayonet   daaga was dragging the militiaman away when adjutant rousseau came  to his assistance and placed a sword to daagas breast  doctor  tardy and several others rushed on the tall negro who was soon by  the united efforts of several thrown down and secured  it was at  this period that he repeatedly exclaimed while he bit his own  shoulder the first white man i catch after this i will eat him  176b  meanwhile about sixteen of the mutineers led by the daring ogston  took the road to arima in order as they said to commence their  march to guinea  but fortunately the militia of that village  composed principally of spaniards indians and sambos assembled   a few of these met them and stopped their march  a kind of parley  if intercourse carried on by signs could be so called was carried  on between the parties  the mutineers made signs that they wished  to go forward while the few militiamen endeavoured to detain them  expecting a reinforcement momently  after a time the militia agreed  to allow them to approach the town as they were advancing they were  met by the commandant martin sorzano esq with sixteen more  militiamen  the commandant judged it imprudent to allow the  africans to enter the town with their muskets full cocked and poised  ready to fire  an interpreter was now procured and the mutineers  were told that if they would retire to their barracks the gentlemen  present would intercede for their pardon  the negroes refused to  accede to these terms and while the interpreter was addressing  some the rest tried to push forward  some of the militia opposed  them by holding their muskets in a horizontal position on which one  of the mutineers fired and the militia returned the fire  a melee  commenced in which fourteen mutineers were killed and wounded  the  fire of the africans produced little effect  they soon took to  flight amid the woods which flanked the road  twentyeight of them  were taken amongst whom was the yarraba chief ogston  six had  been killed and six committed suicide by strangling and hanging  themselves in the woods  only one man was wounded amongst the  militia and he but slightly from a small stone fired from a musket  of one of the yarrabas  the quantity of ammunition expended by the mutineers and the  comparatively little mischief done by them was truly astonishing   it shows how little they understood the use of firearms  dixon was  killed and several of the old african soldiers were wounded but  not one of the officers was in the slightest degree hurt  i have never been able to get a correct account of the number of  lives this wild mutiny cost but believe it was not less than forty  including those slain by the militia at arima those shot at san  josef those who died of their wounds and most of the wounded men  died the six who committed suicide the three that were shot by  sentence of the courtmartial and one who was shot while  endeavouring to escape satchell  a goodlooking young man named torrens was brought as prisoner to  the presence of colonel bush  the colonel wished to speak to him  and desired his guards to liberate him on which the young savage  shook his sleeve in which was concealed a razor made a rush at the  colonel and nearly succeeded in cutting his throat  he slashed the  razor in all directions until he made an opening  he rushed through  this and notwithstanding he was fired at and i believe wounded  he effected his escape was subsequently retaken and again made his  escape with satchell who after this was shot by a policeman  torrens was retaken tried and recommended to mercy  of this  mans fate i am unable to speak not knowing how far the  recommendation to mercy was attended to  in appearance he seemed  the mildest and bestlooking of the mutineers but his conduct was  the most ferocious of any  the whole of the mutineers were captured  within one week of the mutiny save this man who was taken a month  after  on the 19th of july donald stewart otherwise daaga was brought  to a courtmartial  on the 21st william satchell was tried  on the  22d a courtmartial was held on edward coffin and on the 24th one  was held on the yarraba chief maurice ogston whose country name  was i believe mawee  torrens was tried on the 29th  the sentences of these courtsmartial were unknown until the 14th  of august having been sent to barbadoes in order to be submitted to  the commanderinchief lieutenantgeneral whittingham who approved  of the decision of the courts which was that donald stewart  daaga maurice ogston and edward coffin should suffer death by  being shot and that william satchell should be transported beyond  seas during the term of his natural life  i am unacquainted with  the sentence of torrens  donald stewart maurice ogston and edward coffin were executed on  the 16th of august 1837 at san josef barracks  nothing seemed to  have been neglected which could render the execution solemn and  impressive the scenery and the weather gave additional awe to the  melancholy proceedings  fronting the little eminence where the  prisoners were shot was the scene where their illconcerted mutiny  commenced  to the right stood the long range of building on which  they had expended much of their ammunition for the purpose of  destroying their officers  the rest of the panorama was made up of  an immense view of forest below them and upright masses of  mountains above them  over those heavy bodies of mist were slowly  sailing giving a sombre appearance to the primeval woods which in  general covered both mountains and plains  the atmosphere  indicated an intertropical morning during the rainy season and the  sun shone resplendently between dense columns of clouds  at halfpast seven oclock the condemned men asked to be allowed to  eat a hearty meal as they said persons about to be executed in  guinea were always indulged with a good repast  it is remarkable  that these unhappy creatures ate most voraciously even while they  were being brought out of their cell for execution  a little before the mournful procession commenced the condemned  men were dressed from head to foot in white habiliments trimmed with  black their arms were bound with cords  this is not usual in  military executions but was deemed necessary on the present  occasion  an attempt to escape on the part of the condemned would  have been productive of much confusion and was properly guarded  against  the condemned men displayed no unmanly fear  on the contrary they  steadily kept step to the dead march which the band played yet the  certainty of death threw a cadaverous and ghastly hue over their  black features while their singular and appropriate costume and  the three coffins being borne before them altogether rendered it a  frightful picture  hence it was not to be wondered at that two of  the european soldiers fainted  the mutineers marched abreast  the tall form and horrid looks of  daaga were almost appalling  the looks of ogston were sullen calm  and determined those of coffin seemed to indicate resignation  at eight oclock they arrived at the spot where three graves were  dug here their coffins were deposited  the condemned men were made  to face to westward three sides of a hollow square were formed  flanked on one side by a detachment of the 89th regiment and a party  of artillery while the recruits many of whom shared the guilt of  the culprits were appropriately placed in the line opposite them   the firingparty were a little in advance of the recruits  the sentence of the courtsmartial and other necessary documents  having been read by the fort adjutant mr meehan the chaplain of  the forces read some prayers appropriated for these melancholy  occasions  the clergyman then shook hands with the three men about  to be sent into another state of existence  daaga and ogston coolly  gave their hands  coffin wrung the chaplains hand affectionately  saying in tolerable english i am now done with the world  the arms of the condemned men as has been before stated were  bound but in such a manner as to allow them to bring their hands to  their heads  their nightcaps were drawn over their eyes  coffin  allowed his to remain but ogston and daaga pushed theirs up again   the former did this calmly the latter showed great wrath seeming  to think himself insulted and his deep metallic voice sounded in  anger above that of the provostmarshal 179 as the latter gave  the words ready present  but at this instant his vociferous  daring forsook him  as the men levelled their muskets at him with  inconceivable rapidity he sprang bodily round still preserving his  squatting posture and received the fire from behind while the less  noisy but more brave ogston looked the firingparty full in the  face as they discharged their fatal volley  in one instant all three fell dead almost all the balls of the  firingparty having taken effect  the savage appearance and manner  of daaga excited awe  admiration was felt for the calm bravery of  ogston while edward coffins fate excited commiseration  there were many spectators of this dreadful scene and amongst  others a great concourse of negroes  most of these expressed their  hopes that after this terrible example the recruits would make good  soldiers  ah stupid savages  yes  but alsoah stupid civilised people    chapter x  naparima and montserrat    i had a few days of pleasant wandering in the centre of the island  about the districts which bear the names of naparima and montserrat  a country of such extraordinary fertility as well as beauty that  it must surely hereafter become the seat of a high civilisation   the soil seems inexhaustibly rich  i say inexhaustibly for as fast  as the upper layer is impoverished it will be swept over by the  tropic rains to mingle with the vegas or alluvial flats below and  thus enriched again while a fresh layer of virgin soil is exposed  above  i have seen cresting the highest ridges of montserrat ten  feet at least of fat earth falling clod by clod right and left upon  the gardens below  there are doubtless comparatively barren  tracts of gravel toward the northern mountains there are poor sandy  lands likewise at the southern part of the island which are said  nevertheless to be specially fitted for the growth of cotton  but  from san fernando on the west coast to manzanilla on the east  stretches a band of soil which seems to be capable of yielding any  conceivable return to labour and capital not omitting common sense  how long it has taken to prepare this natural garden for man is one  of those questions of geological time which have been well called of  late appalling  how long was it since the older parian rocks  said to belong to the neocomian or greensand era of point a  pierre were laid down at the bottom of the sea  how long since a  still unknown thickness of tertiary strata in the nariva district  laid down on them  how long since not less than six thousand feet  of still later tertiary strata laid down on them again  what vast  though probably slow processes changed that seabottom from one  salt enough to carry corals and limestones to one brackish enough  to carry abundant remains of plants deposited probably by the  orinoco or by some river which then did duty for it  three such  periods of disturbance have been distinguished the net result of  which is that the strata comparatively recent in geological time  have been fractured tilted even set upright on end over the whole  lowland  trinidad seems to have had its full share of those later  disturbances of the earthcrust which carried tertiary strata up  along the shoulders of the alps which upheaved the chalk of the  isle of wight setting the tertiary beds of alum bay upright against  it which even after the age of ice thrust up the isle of moen in  denmark and the isle of ely in cambridgeshire entangling the  boulder clay among the chalkhow long ago  long enough ago in  trinidad at least to allow waterprobably the estuary waters of  the orinocoto saw all the upheaved layers off at the top into one  flat seabottom once more leaving as projections certain harder  knots of rock such as the limestones of mount tamana and it may  be the curious knoll of hard clay rock under which nestles the town  of san fernando  long enough ago also to allow that whole sea bottom to be lifted up once more to the height in one spot of a  thousand feet as the lowland which occupies sixsevenths of the  isle of trinidad  long enough ago again to allow that lowland to  be sawn out into hills and valleys ridges and gulleys which are  due to the action of colonel george greenwoods geologic panacea  rain and rivers and to nothing else  long enough ago once more  for a period of subsidence as i suspect to follow the period of  upheaval a period at the commencement of which trinidad was perhaps  several times as large as it is now and has gradually been eaten  away by the surf as fresh pieces of the soft cliffs have been  brought by the sinking of the land face to face with its slow but  sure destroyer  and how long ago began the epochthe very latest which this globe  has seen which has been long enough for all this  the human  imagination can no more grasp that time than it can grasp the space  between us and the nearest star  such thoughts were forced upon me as the steamer stopped off san  fernando and i saw some quarter of a mile out at sea a single  stack of rock which is said to have been joined to the mainland in  the memory of the fathers of this generation and on shore  composed i am told of the same rock that hill of san fernando  which forms a beacon by sea and land for many a mile around  an  isolated boss of the older parian composed of hardened clay which  has escaped destruction it rises though not a mile long and a  third of a mile broad steeply to a height of nearly six hundred  feet carrying on its cliffs the remains of a once magnificent  vegetation  now its sides are quarried for the only roadstone met  with for miles around cultivated for pasture in which the round headed mangotrees grow about like oaks at home or terraced for  villas and gardens the charm of which cannot be told in words  all  round it rich sugar estates spread out with the noble palmistes  left standing here and there along the roads and terraces and  everywhere is activity and high cultivation under the  superintendence of gentlemen who are prospering because they  deserve to prosper  between the cliff and the shore nestles the gay and growing little  town which was when we took the island in 1795 only a group of  huts  in it i noted only one thing which looked unpleasant  the  negro houses however roomy and comfortable and however rich the  gardens which surrounded them were mostly patched together out of  the most heterogeneous and wretched scraps of wood and on inquiry i  found that the materials were in most cases stolen that when a  negro wanted to build a house instead of buying the materials he  pilfered a board here a stick there a nail somewhere else a lock  or a clamp in a fourth place about the sugarestates regardless of  the serious injury which he caused to working buildings and when he  had gathered a sufficient pile hidden safely away behind his  neighbours house the new hut rose as if by magic  this continual  pilfering i was assured was a serious tax on the cultivation of  the estates around  but i was told too frankly enough by the  very gentleman who complained that this habit was simply an  heirloom from the bad days of slavery when the pilfering of the  slaves from other estates was connived at by their own masters on  the ground that if as negroes robbed b bs negroes robbed c and  so all round the alphabet one more evil instance of the  demoralising effect of a state of things which wrong in itself was  sure to be the parent of a hundred other wrongs  being happily for me in the governors suite i had opportunities  of seeing the interior of the island which an average traveller  could not have and i looked forward with interest to visiting new  settlements in the forests of the interior which very few  inhabitants of the island and certainly no strangers had as yet  seen  our journey began by landing on a good new jetty and being  transferred at once to the tramway which adjoined it  a truck with  chairs on it as usual here carried us off at a good muletrot and  we ran in the fastfading light through a rolling hummocky country  very like the lowlands of aberdeenshire or the neighbourhood of  waterloo save that as night came on the fireflies flickered  everywhere among the canes and here and there the palms and ceibas  stood up black and gaunt against the sky  at last we escaped from  our truck and found horses waiting on which we floundered through  mud and moonlight to a certain hospitable house and found a hungry  party who had been long waiting for a dinner worth the waiting  it was not till next morning that i found into what a charming place  i had entered overnight  around were books pictures china vases  of flowers works of art and all appliances of european taste even  luxury but in a house utterly uneuropean  the living rooms all  on the first floor opened into each other by doorless doorways and  the walls were of cedar and other valuable woods which good taste  had left still unpapered  windowless bay windows like great port holes opened from each of them into a gallery which ran round the  house sheltered by broad sloping eaves  the deep shade of the  eaves contrasted brilliantly with the bright light outside and  contrasted too with the wooden pillars which held up the roof and  which seemed on their southern sides whitehot in the blazing  sunshine  what a field was there for native art for richest ornamentation of  these pillars and those beams  surely trinidad and the whole of  northern south america ought to become some day the paradise of  wood carvers who copying even a few of the numberless vegetable  and animal forms around may far surpass the old woodcarving  schools of burmah and hindostan  and i sat dreaming of the lianes  which might be made to wreathe the pillars the flowers fruits  birds butterflies monkeys kinkajous and what not which might  cluster about the capitals or swing along the beams  let men who  have such materials and such models proscribe all tawdry and poor  european artmost of it a bad imitation of bad greek or worse  renaissanceand trust to nature and the facts which lie nearest  them  but when will a time come for the west indies when there will  be wealth and civilisation enough to make such an art possible   soon if all the employers of labour were like the gentleman at  whose house we were that day and like some others in the same  island  and through the windows and between the pillars of the gallery what  a blaze of colour and light  the groundfloor was hedged in a few  feet from the walls with high shrubs which would have caused  unwholesome damp in england but were needed here for shade   foreign crotons dracaenas cereuses and a dozen more curious  shapesamong them a cuptree with concave leaves each of which  would hold water  it was said to come from the east and was  unknown to me  among them and over the door flowering creepers  tangled and tossed rich with flowers and beyond them a circular lawn rare in the west indies just like an english one save that  the shrubs and trees which bounded it were hothouse plants  a few  caratpalms 184 spread their huge fanleaves among the curious  flowering trees other foreign palms some of them very rare beside  them and on the lawn opposite my bedroom window stood a young  palmiste which had been planted barely eight years and was now  thirtyeight feet in height and more than six feet in girth at the  butt  over the roofs of the outhouses rose scarlet bois  immortelles and tall clumps of bamboo reflecting blue light from  their leaves even under a cloud and beyond them and below them to  the right a park just like an english one carried stately trees  scattered on the turf and a sheet of artificial water  coolies in  red or yellow waistcloths and coolie children too with nothing  save a string round their stomachs the smaller ones at least were  fishing in the shade  to the left again began at once the rich  cultivation of the rolling canefields among which the squire had  left standing somewhat against the public opinion of his less  tasteful neighbours tall carats carrying their heads of fanleaves  on smooth stalks from fifty to eighty feet high and ceibassome of  them the hugest i had ever seen  below in the valley were the  sugarworks and beyond this halfnatural halfartificial scene  rose some mile off the lowering wall of the yet untouched forest  it had taken only fifteen years but fifteen years of hard work to  create this paradise  and only the summer before all had been  wellnigh swept away again  during the great drought the fire had  raged about the woods  estate after estate around had been reduced  to ashes  and one day our hosts turn came  the fire burst out of  the woods at three different points  all worked with a will to stop  it by cutting traces  but the wind was wild burning masses from  the treetops were hurled far among the canes and all was lost   the canes burnt like shavings exploding with a perpetual crackle at  each joint  in a few hours the whole estateworks coolie  barracks negro hutswas black ash and the house only by extreme  exertion saved  but the ground had scarcely cooled when replanting  and rebuilding commenced and now the canes were from ten to twelve  feet high the works nearly ready for the coming croptime and no  sign of the fire was left save a few leafless trees which we  found on riding up to them to be charred at the base  and yet men say that the englishman loses his energy in a tropic  climate  we had a charming sunday there amid charming society down even to  the dogs and cats and not the least charming object among many was  little franky the coolie butlers child who ran in and out with  the dogs gay in his little cotton shirt and melonshaped cap and  silver bracelets and climbed on the squires knee and nestled in  his bosom and played with his seals and looked up trustingly into  our faces with great soft eyes like a little brown guazupita fawn  out of the forest  a happy child and in a happy place  then to church at savanna grande riding of course for the mud was  abysmal and it was often safer to ride in the ditch than on the  road  the village with a tramway through it stood high and  healthy  the best houses were those of the chinese  the poorer  chinese find peddling employments and trade about the villages  rather than hard work on the estates while they cultivate on  ridges with minute care their favourite sweet potato  round san  fernando a chinese will rent from a sugarplanter a bit of land  which seems hopelessly infested with weeds even of the worst of all  sortsthe creeping para grass 186which was introduced a  generation since with some trouble as food for cattle and was  supposed at first to be so great a boon that the gentleman who  brought it in received public thanks and a valuable testimonial   the chinaman will take the land for a single year at a rent i  believe as high as a pound an acre grow on it his sweet potato  crop and return it to the owner cleared for the time being of  every weed  the richer shopkeepers have each a store  but they  disdain to live at it  near by each you see a comfortable low  house with verandahs green jalousies and often pretty flowers in  pots and catch glimpses inside of papered walls prints and smart  moderatorlamps which seem to be fashionable among the celestials   but for one fashion of theirs i confess i was not prepared  we went to churcha large airy clean wooden onewhich ought to  have had a verandah round to keep off the intolerable sunlight and  which might too have had another pulpit  for in getting up to  preach in a sort of pillbox on a long stalk i found the said stalk  surging and nodding so under my weight that i had to assume an  attitude of most dignified repose and to beware of beating the  drum ecclesiastic or clanging the bible to shreds for fear of  toppling into the pews of the very smart and really very attentive  brown ladies below  a crowded congregation it was clean gay  respectable and respectful and spoke well both for the people and  for their clergyman  buthappily not till the end of the sermoni  became aware just in front of me of a row of smartest paris  bonnets netlace shawls brocades and satins fit for duchesses  and as the centre of each blaze of fineryoffam non faciem as  old ammianus marcellinus has itthe unmistakable visage of a  chinese woman  whether they understood one word what they thought  of it all whether they were there for any purpose save to see and  be seen were questions to which i tried in vain after service to  get an answer  all that could be told was that the richer chinese  take delight in thus bedizening their wives on high days and  holidays not with tawdry cheap finery but with things really  expensive and worth what they cost especially the silks and  brocades and then in sending them whether for fashion or for  loyaltys sake to an english church  be that as it may there they  were ladies from the ancient and incomprehensible mowery land like  fossil bones of an old world sticking out amid the vegetation of the  new and we will charitably hope that they were the better for being  there  after church we wandered about the estate to see huge trees  one  ceiba left standing in a canepiece was very grand from the  multitude and mass of its parasites and its huge tresses of lianes  and grand also from its form  the prickly boardwall spurs were at  least fifteen feet high some of them where they entered the trunk  and at the summit of the trunk which could not have been less than  seventy or eighty feet one enormous limb itself a tree stuck out  quite horizontally and gave a marvellous notion of strength  it  seemed as if its length must have snapped it off years since where  it joined the trunk or as if the leverage of its weight must have  toppled the whole tree over  but the great vegetable had known its  own business best and had built itself up right cannily and stood  and will stand for many a year perhaps for many a century if the  matapalos do not squeeze out its life  i found by the by in  groping my way to that tree through canes twelve feet high that one  must be careful at least with some varieties of cane not to get  cut  the leafedges are finely serrated and more the sheaths of  the leaves are covered with prickly hairs which give the coolies  sore shins if they work barelegged  the soil here as everywhere  was exceedingly rich and sawn out into rolling mounds and steep  gulliessometimes almost too steep for canecultivationby the  tropic rains  if as cannot be doubted denudation by rain has gone  on here for thousands of years at the same pace at which it goes  on now the amount of soil removed must be very great so great  that the naparimas may have been when they were first uplifted out  of the gulf hundreds of feet higher than they are now  another tree we went to see in the home park of which i would have  gladly obtained a photograph  a poix doux 187a some said it was  others that it was a figuier 187b  i incline to the former  belief as the leaves seemed to me pinnated  but the doubt was  pardonable enough  there was not a leaf on the tree which was not  nigh one hundred feet over our heads  for size of spurs and wealth  of parasites the tree was almost as remarkable as the ceiba i  mentioned just now  but the curiosity of the tree was a caratpalm  which had started between its very roots had run its straight and  slender stem up parallel with the bole of its companion and had  then pierced through the head of the tree and all its wilderness of  lianes till it spread its huge flat crown of fans among the highest  branches more than a hundred feet aloft  the contrast between the  two forms of vegetation each so grand but as utterly different in  every line as they are in botanical affinities and yet both living  together in such close embrace was very noteworthy a good example  of the rule that while competition is most severe between forms  most closely allied forms extremely wide apart may not compete at  all because each needs something which the other does not  on our return i was introduced to the uncle tom of the  neighbourhood who had come down to spend sunday at the squires  house  he was a middlesized negro in cast of features not above  the average and isaac by name  he told me how he had been born in  baltimore a slave to a quaker master how he and his wife mary  during the second american war ran away and after hiding three  days in the bush got on board a british ship of war and so became  free  he then enlisted into one of the east indian regiments and  served some years as a reward for which he had given him his five  acres of land in trinidad like others of his corps  these negro  yeomenveterans let it be said in passing are among the ablest and  steadiest of the coloured population  military service has given  them just enough of those habits of obedience of which slavery gives  too muchif the obedience of a mere slave depending not on the  independent will but on brute fear is to be called obedience at  all  would that in this respect as in some others the white subject of  the british crown were as well off as the black one  would that  during the last fifty years we had followed the wise policy of the  romans and by settling our soldiers on our colonial frontiers  established there communities of loyal able and valiant citizens   is it too late to begin now  is there no colony left as yet not  delivered over to a selfgovernment which actually means more and  moreaccording to the statements of those who visit the colonies government by an irish faction and which will offer a field for  settling our soldiers when they have served their appointed time so  strengthening ourselves while we reward a class of men who are far  more respectable and far more deserving than most of those on whom  we lavish our philanthropy  surely such men would prove as good subjects as old isaac and his  comrades  for fiftythree years i was told he had lived and  worked in trinidad always independent so independent indeed that  the very last year when all but starving like many of the coloured  people from the long drought which lasted nearly eighteen months  he refused all charity and came down to this very estate to work  for three months in the stifling canefields earningor fancying  that he earnedhis own livelihood  a simple kindly brave  christian man he seemed and all who knew him spoke of him as such   the most curious fact however which i gleaned from him was his  recollection of his own conversion  his mary of whom all spoke  as a woman of a higher intellect than he had been in the gospel  several years before him and used to read and talk to him but he  said without effect  at last he had a severe fever and when he  fancied himself dying had a vision  he saw a grating in the floor  close by his bed and through it the torments of the lost  two  souls he remembered specially one like a singed hog the other  all over black like a charcoal spade  he looked in fear and  heard a voice cry behold your sins  he prayed promised if he  recovered to try and do better  and felt himself forgiven at once  this was his story which i have set down word for word and of  which i can only say that its imagery is no more gross its  confusion between the objective and subjective no more  unphilosophical than the speech on similar matters of many whom we  are taught to call divines theologians and saints  at all events this crisis in his life produced according to his  own statement not merely a religious but a moral change  he  became a better man henceforth  he had the reputation among those  who knew him well of being altogether a good man  if so it  matters little what cause he assigned for the improvement  wisdom  is justified of all her children and i doubt not of old black  isaac among the rest  in 1864 he had a great sorrow  old mary trying to smoke the  mosquitoes out of her house with a charcoalpan set fire in her  shortsightedness to the place and everything was burnedthe  savings of years the precious bible among the rest  the squire  took her down to his house and nursed her  but she died in two  days of cold and fright and isaac had to begin life again alone   kind folks built up his ajoupa and started him afresh and to  their astonishment isaac grew young again and set to work for  himself  he had depended too much for many years on his wifes  superior intellect  now he had to act for himself and he acted   but he spoke of her like any knight of old as of a guardian  goddesshis guardian still in the other world as she had been in  this  he was happy enough he said  but i was told that he had to endure  much vexation from the neighbouring negroes who were baptists  narrow and conceited and whojust as the baptists of the lower  class in england would be but too apt to dotormented him by  telling him that he was not sure of heaven because he went to  church instead of joining their body  but he though he went to  chapel in wet weather clung to his own creed like an old soldier  and came down to massas house to spend the sunday whenever there  was a communion walking some five miles thither and as much back  again  so much i learnt concerning old isaac  and when in the afternoon he  toddled away and back into the forest what wonder if i felt like  wordsworth after his talk with the old leechgatherer      and when he ended i could have laughed myself to scorn to find in that decrepit man so firm a mind god said i be my help and stay secure ill think of thee leechgatherer on the lonely moor   on the monday morning there was a great parade  all the coolies  were to come up to see the governor and after breakfast a long line  of dark people arrived up the lawn the women in their gaudiest  muslins and some of them in cotton velvet jackets of the richest  colours  the oriental instinct for harmonious hues and those at  once rich and sober such as may be seen in indian shawls is very  observable even in these coolies lowcaste as most of them are   there were bangles and jewels among them in plenty and as it was a  high day and a holiday the women had taken out the little gold or  silver stoppers in their pierced nostrils and put in their place  the great gold ring which hangs down over the mouth and is  considered by them as learned men tell us it was by rebekah at the  well a special ornament  the men stood by themselves the women by  themselves the children grouped in front and a merrier healthier  shrewder looking party i have seldom seen  complaints there were  none  all seemed to look on the squire as a father and each face  brightened when he spoke to them by name  but the great ceremony  was the distributing by the governor of red and yellow sweetmeats to  the children out of a huge dish held up by the hindoo butler while  franky in a long nightshirt of crimson cotton velvet acted as  aidedecamp and took his perquisites freely  each of the little  brown darlings got its share the boys putting them into the flap of  their waistcloths the girls into the front of their veils and some  of the married women seemed ready enough to follow the childrens  example some of them indeed were little more than children  themselves  the pleasure of the men at the whole ceremony was very  noticeable and very pleasant  well fed well cared for well  taught when they will allow themselves to be so and with a local  medical man appointed for their special benefit coolies under such  a master ought to be and are prosperous and happy  exceptions  there are and must be  are there none among the workmen of english  manufacturers and farmers  abuses may spring up and do  do none  spring up in london and elsewhere  but the government has the power  to interfere and uses that power  these poor people are  sufficiently protected by law from their white employers what they  need most is protection for the newcomers against the usury or  swindling by people of their own race especially hindoos of the  middle class who are covetous and illdisposed and who use their  experience of the island for their own selfish advantage  but that  evil also government is doing its best to put down  already the  coolies have a far larger amount of money in the savings banks of  the island than the negroes and their prosperity can be safely  trusted to wise and benevolent laws enforced by men who can afford  to stand above public opinion as well as above private interest  i  speak of course only of trinidad because only trinidad i have  seen  but what i say i know intimately to be true  the parade overand a pleasant sight it was and one not easily to  be forgottenwe were away to see the salse or mudvolcano near  monkey town in the forest to the southeast  the crossroads were  deep in mud all the worse because it was beginning to dry on the  surface forming a tough crust above the hastypudding which if  broken through held the horses leg suspended as in a vice and  would have thrown him down if it were possible to throw down a  westindian horse  we passed in one place a quaint little relic of  the older world a small sugarpress rather than mill under a roof  of palmleaf which was worked by hand or a donkey just as a  spanish settler would have worked it three hundred years ago  then  on through plenty of garden cultivation with all the people at  their doors as we passed fat and grinning  then up to a good high road and a school for coolies kept by a presbyterian clergyman  mr mortoni must be allowed to mention his namewho like a  sensible man wore a white coat instead of the absurd regulation  black one too much affected by all welltodo folk lay as well as  clerical in the west indies  the school seemed good enough in all  ways  a senior class of young menincluding one who had had his  head nearly cut off last year by misapplication of that formidable  weapon the cutlass which every coloured man and woman carries in  the west indiescould read pretty well and the smaller children with as much clothing on as they could be persuaded to wearwere a  sight pleasant to see  among them by the by was a little lady who  excited my astonishment  she was i was told twelve years old   she sat summing away on her slate bedizened out in gauze petticoat  velvet jacketbetween which and the petticoat of course the waist  showed just as nature had made itgauze veil bangles necklace  nosejewel for she was a married woman and her papa anglice  husband wished her to look her best on so important an occasion  this overearly marriage among the coolies is a very serious evil  but one which they have brought with them from their own land  the  girls are practically sold by their fathers while yet children  often to wealthy men much older than they  love is out of the  question  but what if the poor child as she grows up sees some  one among that overplus of men to whom she for the first time in  her life takes a fancy  then comes a scandal and one which is  often ended swiftly enough by the cutlass  wifemurder is but too  common among these hindoos and they cannot be made to see that it  is wrong  i kill my own wife  why not  i kill no other mans  wife was said by as pretty gentle graceful a lad of twoand twenty as one need see a convict performing and perfectly the  office of housemaid in a friends house  there is murder of wives  or quasiwives now and then among the baser sort of cooliesmurder  because a poor girl will not give her illearned gains to the  ruffian who considers her as his property  but there is also law in  trinidad and such offences do not go unpunished  then on through savanna grande and village again and past more  sugar estates and past beautiful bits of forest left like english  woods standing in the cultivated fields  one batch of a few acres  on the side of a dell was very lovely  huge figuiers and huras were  mingled with palms and rich undergrowth and lighted up here and  there with purple creepers  so we went on and on and into the thick forest and what was till  sir ralph woodford taught the islanders what an european road was  like one of the pattern royal roads of the island  originally an  indian trace it had been widened by the spaniards and transformed  from a line of mud six feet broad to one of thirty  the only  pleasant reminiscence which i have about it was the finding in  flower a beautiful parasite undescribed by griesbach 192 a wild  pine with a branching spike of crimson flowers purple tipped  which shone in the darkness of the bush like a great bunch of  rosebuds growing among lilyleaves  the present governor like sir ralph woodford before him has been  fully aware of the old sayingwhich the romans knew well and which  the english did not know and only rediscovered some century since that the first step in civilisation is to make roads the second  to make more roads and the third to make more roads still  through this very district aided by men whose talents he had the  talent to discover and employ he has run wide level and sound  roads either already completed or in progress through all parts of  the island which i visited save the precipitous glens of the  northern shore  of such roads we saw more than one in the next few days  that day  we had to commit ourselves when we turned off the royal road to  one of the old spanishindian jungle tracks  and here is a recipe  for making onetake a railway embankment of average steepness  strew it freely with wreck rigging and all to imitate the fallen  timber roots and lianesa few flagstones and boulders here and  there will be quite in place plant the whole with the thickest  pheasantcover set a field of huntsmen to find their way through it  at the points of least resistance three times a week during a wet  winter and if you dare follow their footsteps you will find a very  accurate imitation of a foresttrack in the wet season  at one place we seemed to be fairly stopped  we plunged and slid  down into a muddy brook luckily with a gravel bar on which the  horses could stand at least one by one and found opposite us a  bank of smooth clay bound with slippery roots some ten feet high   we stood and looked at it and the longer we lookedin hunting  phrasethe less we liked it  but there was no alternative  some  one jumped off and scrambled up on his hands and knees his horse  was driven up the bank to himon its knees likewise more than  onceand caught staggering among boughs and mud and by the time  the whole cavalcade was over horses and men looked as if they had  been brickmaking for a week  but here again the cunning of these horses surprised me  on one  very steep pitch for instance i saw before me two logs across the  path two feet and more in diameter and what was worse not two  feet apart  how the brown cob meant to get over i could not guess  but as he seemed not to falter or turn tail as an english horse  would have done i laid the reins on his neck and watched his legs   to my astonishment he lifted a foreleg out of the abyss of mud  put it between the logs where i expected to hear it snap clawed in  front and shuffled behind put the other over the second log the  mud and water splashing into my face and then brought the first  freely out from between the logs andhorrible to seeput a hind  one in  thus did he fairly walk through the whole stopped a moment  to get his breath and then staggered and scrambled upward again as  if he had done nothing remarkable  coming back by the by those  two logs lay heavy on my heart for a mile ere i neared them  he  might get up over them but how would he get down again  and i was  not surprised to hear more than one behind me say i think i shall  lead over  but being in front if i fell i could only fall into  the mud and not on the top of a friend  so i let the brown cob do  what he would determined to see how far a tropic horses legs could  keep him up and to my great amusement he quietly leapt the whole  descending five or six feet into a pool of mud which shot out over  him and me half blinding us for the moment then slid away on his  haunches downward picked himself up and went on as usual solemn  patient and seemingly stupid as any donkey  we had some difficulty in finding our quest the salse or mud volcano  but at last out of a hut half buried in verdure on the  edge of a little clearing there tumbled the quaintest little old  black man cutlass in hand and without being asked went on ahead  as our guide  crookbacked roundshouldered his only dress a  ragged shirt and ragged pair of drawers he had evidently thriven  upon the forest life for many a year  he did not walk nor run but  tumbled along in front of us his bare feet plashing from log to log  and mudheap to mudheap his gray woolly head wagging right and  left and his cutlass brushing almost instinctively at every bough  he passed while he turned round every moment to jabber something  usually in creole french which of course i could not understand  he led us well up and down and at last over a flat of rich muddy  ground full of huge trees and of their roots likewise where there  was no path at all  the solitude was awful so was the darkness of  the shade so was the stifling heat and right glad we were when we  saw an opening in the trees and the little man quickened his pace  and stopped with an air of triumph not unmixed with awe on the edge  of a circular pool of mud and water some two or three acres in  extent  dere de debbils woodyard said he with somewhat bated breath   and no wonder for a more doleful uncanny halfmade spot i never  saw  the sad forest ringed it round with a green wall feathered  down to the ugly mud on which partly perhaps from its saltness  partly from the changeableness of the surface no plant would grow  save a few herbs and creepers which love the brackish water  only  here and there an echites had crawled out of the wood and lay along  the ground its long shoots gay with large creamcoloured flowers  and pairs of glossy leaves and on it and on some dead brushwood  grew a lovely little parasitic orchis an oncidium with tiny fans  of leaves and flowers like swarms of yellow butterflies  there was no track of man not even a hunters footprint but  instead tracks of beasts in plenty  deer quenco 194a and lapo  194b with smaller animals had been treading up and down probably  attracted by the salt water  they were safe enough the old man  said  no hunter dare approach the spot  there were too much  jumbies here and when one of the party expressed a wish to lie out  there some night in the hope of good shooting the negro shook his  head  he would not do that for all the world  de debbil come out  here at night and walk about and he was much scandalised when the  young gentleman rejoined that the chance of such a sight would be an  additional reason for bivouacking there  so we walked out upon the mud which was mostly hard enough past  shallow pools of brackish water smelling of asphalt toward a group  of little mudvolcanoes on the farther side  these curious openings  into the netherworld are not permanent  they choke up after a  while and fresh ones appear in another part of the area thus  keeping the whole clear of plants  they are each some two or three feet high of the very finest mud  which leaves no feeling of grit on the fingers or tongue and dries  of course rapidly in the sun  on the top or near the top of each  is a round hole a fingers breadth polished to exceeding  smoothness and running down through the cone as far as we could  dig  from each oozes perpetually with a clicking noise of gas bubbles water and mud and now and then losing their temper they  spirt out their dirt to a considerable height a feat which we did  not see performed but which is so common that we were in something  like fear and trembling while we opened a cone with our cutlasses   for though we could hardly have been made dirtier than we were an  explosion in our faces of mud with a faint bituminous smell and  impregnated with common salt a notable proportion of iodine and a  trace of carbonate of soda and carbonate of lime 195 would have  been both unpleasant and humiliating  but the most puzzling thing  about the place is that out of the mud comes upnot jumbies but a multitude of small stones like no stones in the neighbourhood we  found concretions of iron sand and scales which seemed to have  peeled off them and pebbles quartzose or jasper or like in  appearance to flint but all evidently long rolled on a seabeach   messrs wall and sawkins mention pyrites and gypsum as being found   but we saw none as far as i recollect  all these must have been  carried up from a considerable depth by the force of the same gases  which make the little mudvolcanoes  now and then this salse so quiet when we saw it is said to be  seized with a violent paroxysm  explosions are heard and large  discharges of mud and even flame are said to appear  some  seventeen years ago according to messrs wall and sawkins such an  explosion was heard six miles off and next morning the surface was  found quite altered and trees had disappeared or been thrown down   butas they wisely saythe reports of the inhabitants must be  received with extreme caution  in the autumn of last year some  such explosion is said to have taken place at the cedros salse a  place so remote unfortunately that i could not visit it  the  negroes and coolies the story goes came running to the overseer at  the noise assuring him that something terrible had happened and  when he in defiance of their fears went off to the salse he found  that many tons of mudi was told thousandshad been thrown out   how true this may be i cannot say  but messrs wall and sawkins  saw with their own eyes in 1856 about two miles from this cedros  salse the results of an explosion which had happened only two  months before and of which they give a drawing  a surface two  hundred feet round had been upheaved fifteen feet throwing the  trees in every direction and the sham earthquake had shaken the  ground for two hundred or three hundred yards round till the  natives fancied that their huts were going to fall  there is a third salse near poole river on the upper ortoire which  is extinct or at least quiescent but this also i could not  visit  it is about seventeen miles from the sea and about two  hundred feet above it  as for the causes of these salses i fear  the reader must be content for the present with a somewhat muddy  explanation of the muddy mystery  messrs wall and sawkins are  inclined to connect it with asphalt springs and pitch lakes  there  is they say easy gradation from the smaller salses to the  ordinary naphtha or petroleum springs  it is certain that in the  production of asphalt carbonic acid carburetted hydrogen and  water are given off  may not they ask these orifices be the  vents by which such gases escape  and in forcing their way to the  surface is it not natural that the liquid asphalt and slimy water  should be drawn up and expelled  they point out the fact that  wherever such volcanoes exist asphalt or petroleum is found hard  by  the mud volcanoes of turbaco in new granada famous from  humboldts description of them lie in an asphaltic country  they  are much larger than those of trinidad the cones being some of  them twenty feet high  when humboldt visited them in 1801 they  gave off hardly anything save nitrogen gas  but in the year 1850 a  bituminous odour had begun to be diffused asphaltic oil swam on  the surface of the small openings and the gas issuing from any of  the cones could be ignited  dr daubeny found the mudvolcanoes of  macaluba giving out bitumen and bubbles of carbonic acid and  carburetted hydrogen  the mudvolcano of saman in the western  caucasus gives off with a continual stream of thick mud ignited  gases accompanied with mimic earthquakes like those of the trinidad  salses and this out of a soil said to be full of bituminous  springs and where as in trinidad the tertiary strata carry veins  of asphalt or are saturated with naphtha  at the famous sacred  fire wells of baku in the eastern caucasus the ejections of mud  and inflammable gas are so mixed with asphaltic products that  eichwald says they should be rather called naphtha volcanoes than  mudvolcanoes as the eruptions always terminate in a large emission  of naphtha  it is reasonable enough then to suppose a similar connection in  trinidad  but whence come either in trinidad or at turbaco the  seasalts and the iodine  certainly not from the sea itself which  is distant in the case of the trinidad salses from two to  seventeen miles  it must exist already in the strata below  and  the ejected pebbles which are evidently seaworn must form part of  a tertiary seabeach covered by sands and covering perhaps in  its turn vegetable debris which as it is converted into asphalt  thrusts the pebbles up to the surface  we had to hurry away from the strange place for night was falling  fast or rather ready to fall as always here in a moment without  twilight and we were scarce out of the forest before it was dark   the wild game were already moving and a deer crossed our line of  march close before one of the horses  however we were not  benighted for the sun was hardly down ere the moon rose bright and  full and we floundered home through the mud to start again next  morning into mud again  through rich rolling land covered with  cane past large sugarworks where croptime and all its bustle was  just beginning along a tramway which made an excellent horseroad  and then along one of the new roads which are opening up the yet  untouched riches of this island  in this district alone thirtysix  miles of good road and thirty bridges have been made where formerly  there were only two abominable bridlepaths  it was a solid  pleasure to see good engineering round the hillsides gullies which  but a year or two before were breakneck scrambles into fords often  impassable after all bridged with baulks of incorruptible timber  on piers sunk to give a hold in that sea of hasty pudding sixteen  feet below the riverbed and side supports sunk as far into the  banks a solid pleasure to congratulate the warden who had joined  us on his triumphs and to hear how he had sought for miles around  in the hastypudding sea ere he could find either gravel or stone  for road metal and had found it after all or how in places  finding no stone at all he had been forced to metal the way with  burnt clay which as i can testify is an excellent substitute or  how again he had coaxed and patted the toocomfortable natives into  being well paid for doing the very roadmaking which if they had  any notion of their own interests they would combine to do for  themselves  and so we rode on chatting      while all the land beneath a broad and equalblowing breeze smelt of the coming summer   for it was winter then and only 80 degrees in the shade till the  road entered the virgin forest through which it has been driven on  the american principle of making land valuable by beginning with a  road and expecting settlers to follow it  some such settlers we  found clearing right and left among them a most satisfactory  sight namely more than one coolie family who had served their  apprenticeship saved money bought government land and set up as  yeomen the foundation it is to be hoped of a class of intelligent  and civilised peasant proprietors  these men as soon as they have  cleared as much land as their wives and children with their help  can keep in order go off usually in gangs of ten to fifteen to  work in many instances on the estates from which they originally  came  this fact practically refutes the opinion which was at first  held by some attorneys and managers of sugarestates that the  settling of free indian immigrants would materially affect the  labour supply of the colony  i must express an earnest hope that  neither will any planters be shortsighted enough to urge such a  theory on the present governor nor will the present governor give  ear to it  the colony at large must gain by the settlement of crown  lands by civilised people like the hindoos if it be only through  the increased exports and imports while the sugarestates will  become more and more sure of a constant supply of labour without  the heavy expense of importing fresh immigrants  i am assured that  the only expense to the colony is the fee for survey amounting to  eighteen dollars for a tenacre allotment as the coolie prefers the  thinlywooded and comparatively poor lands from the greater  facility of clearing them and these lands are quite unsaleable to  other customers  therefore for less than 4 pounds an acclimatised  indian labourer with his family and it must be remembered that  while the negro families increase very slowly the coolies increase  very rapidly being more kind and careful parents are permanently  settled in the colony the man to work five days a week on sugar estates the family to grow provisions for the market instead of  being shipped back to india at a cost including gratuities and  etceteras of not less than 50 pounds  one clearing we reachedwere i fiveandtwenty i should like to  make just such another next to itof a higher class still  a  cultivated scotchman now no longer young but hale and mighty had  taken up three hundred acres and already cleared a hundred and  fifty and there he intended to pass the rest of a busy life not  under his own vine and figtree but under his own castoroil and  cacaotree  we were welcomed by as noble a scots face as i ever  saw and as keen a scots eye and taken in and fed horses and men  even too sumptuously in a palm and timber house  then we wandered  out to see the site of his intended mansion with the rich wooded  hills of the latagual to the north and all around the unbroken  forest where he told us the howling monkeys shouted defiance  morning and evening at him who did   invade their ancient solitary reign   then we went down to see the coolie barracks where the folk seemed  as happy and well cared for as they were certain to be under such a  master then down a rocky pool in the river jammed with bare white  logs as in some north american forest which had been stopped in  flood by one enormous trunk across the stream then back past the  site of the ajoupa which had been our hosts first shelter and  which had disappeared by a cause strange enough to english ears  an  enormous silkcotton near by was felled in spite of the negroes  fears  its boughs when it fell did not reach the ajoupa by twenty  feet or more but the wind of its fall did and blew the hut clean  away  this may sound like a story out of munchausen  but there was  no doubt of the fact and to us who saw the size of the tree which  did the deed it seemed probable enough  we rode away again and into the morichal the hills where moriche  palms are found to see certain springs and a certain tree and well  worth seeing they were  out of the base of a limestone hill amid  delicate ferns under the shade of enormous trees a clear pool  bubbled up and ran away a stream from its very birth as is the  wont of limestone springs  it was a spot fit for a greek nymph at  least for an indian damsel  but the nymph who came to draw water in  a tin bucket and stared stupidly and saucily at us was anything  but greek or even indian either in costume or manners  be it so   white men are responsible for her being there so white men must not  complain  then we went in search of the tree  we had passed as we  rode up some huras sandboxtrees which would have been considered  giants in england and i had been laughed at more than once for  asking is that the tree or that  i soon knew why  we scrambled  up a steep bank of broken limestone through ferns and balisiers  for perhaps a hundred feet and then were suddenly aware of a bole  which justified the saying of one of our partythat when surveying  for a road he had come suddenly on it he felt as if he had run  against a church tower  it was a hura seemingly healthy  undecayed and growing vigorously  its girthwe measured it  carefullywas fortyfour feet six feet from the ground and as i  laid my face against it and looked up i seemed to be looking up a  ships side  it was perfectly cylindrical branchless and smooth  save of course the tiny prickles which beset the bark for a  height at which we could not guess but which we luckily had an  opportunity of measuring  a wild pine grew in the lowest fork and  had kindly let down an airroot into the soil  we tightened the  root set it perpendicular cut it off exactly where it touched the  ground and then pulled carefully till we brought the plant and half  a dozen more strange vegetables down on our heads  the length of  the airroot was just seventyfive feet  some twenty feet or more  above that first fork was a second fork and then the tree began   where its head was we could not see  we could only by laying our  faces against the bole and looking up discern a wilderness of  boughs carrying a green cloud of leaves most of them too high for  us to discern their shape without the glasses  we walked up the  slope and round about in hopes of seeing the head of the tree  clear enough to guess at its total height  but in vain  it was  only when we had ridden some half mile up the hill that we could  discern its masses rising a bright green mound above the darker  foliage of the forest  it looked of any height from one hundred  and fifty to two hundred feet less it could hardly be  it made  says a note by one of our party other huge trees look like  shrubs  i am not surprised that my friend mr st luce dabadie  who measured the tree since my departure found it to be one hundred  and ninetytwo feet in height  i was assured that there were still larger trees in the island  a  certain locusttree and a ceiba were mentioned  the moras too of  the southern hills were said to be far taller  and i can well  believe it for if huge trees were as shrubs beside that sandbox it  would be a shrub by the side of those locusts figured by spix and  martius which fifteen indians with outstretched arms could just  embrace  at the bottom they were eightyfour feet round and sixty  where the boles became cylindrical  by counting the rings of such  parts as could be reached they arrived at the conclusion that they  were of the age of homer and 332 years old in the days of  pythagoras  one estimate indeed reduced their antiquity to 2052  years old while another counting i presume two rings of fresh  wood for every year carried it up to 4104  so we rode on and up the hills by green and flowery paths with  here and there a cottage and a garden and groups of enormous  palmistes towering over the treetops in every glen talking over  that wondrous weed whose head we saw still far below  for weed it  is and nothing more  the wood is soft and almost useless save for  firing and the tree itself botanists tell us is neither more nor  less than a gigantic spurge the cousingerman of the milky garden  weeds with which boys burn away their warts  but if the modern  theory be true that when we speak as we are forced to speak of  the relationships of plants we use no metaphor but state an actual  fact that the groups into which we are forced to arrange them  indicate not merely similarity of type but community of descent then how wonderful is the kindred between the spurge and the hura indeed between all the members of the euphorbiaceous group so  fantastically various in outward form so abundant often huge in  the tropics while in our remote northern island their only  representatives are a few weedy spurges two dogs mercuriesweeds  likewiseand the box  wonderful it is if only these last have had  the same parentagestill more if they have had the same parentage  too with forms so utterly different from them as the prickly stemmed scarletflowered euphorbia common in our hothouses as the  huge succulent cactuslike euphorbia of the canary islands as the  galelike phyllanthus the manyformed crotons which in the west  indies alone comprise according to griesbach at least twelve  genera and thirty species the hemplike maniocs physicnuts  castoroils the scarlet poinsettia which adorns dinnertables in  winter the pretty little pink and yellow dalechampia now common in  hothouses the manchineel with its glossy poplarlike leaves and  this very hura with leaves still more like a poplar and a fruit  which differs from most of its family in having not three but many  divisions usually a multiple of three up to fifteen a fruit which  it is difficult to obtain even where the tree is plentiful  for  hanging at the end of long branches it bursts when ripe with a  crack like a pistol scattering its seeds far and wide  from whence  its name of hura crepitans  but what if all these forms are the descendants of one original  form  would that be one whit more wonderful more inexplicable  than the theory that they were each and all with their minute and  often imaginary shades of difference created separately and at  once  but if it bewhich i cannot allowwhat can the theologian  say save that gods works are even more wonderful than we always  believed them to be  as for the theory being impossible  who are  we that we should limit the power of god  is anything too hard  for the lord asked the prophet of old and we have a right to ask  it as long as time shall last  if it be said that natural selection  is too simple a cause to produce such fantastic variety  we always  knew that god works by very simple or seemingly simple means that  the universe as far as we could discern it was one organisation of  the most simple means it was wonderful or ought to have been in  our eyes that a shower of rain should make the grass grow and that  the grass should become flesh and the flesh food for the thinking  brain of man it was or ought to have been yet more wonderful in  our eyes that a child should resemble its parents or even a  butterfly resembleif not always still usuallyits parents  likewise  ought god to appear less or more august in our eyes if we  discover that his means are even simpler than we supposed  we hold  him to be almighty and allwise  are we to reverence him less or  more if we find that his might is greater his wisdom deeper than  we had ever dreamed  we believed that his care was over all his  works that his providence watched perpetually over the universe   we were taught some of us at least by holy scripture to believe  that the whole history of the universe was made up of special  providences  if then that should be true which mr darwin says it may be metaphorically said that natural selection is daily and  hourly scrutinising throughout the world every variation even the  slightest rejecting that which is bad preserving and adding up all  that is good silently and insensibly working whenever and wherever  opportunity offers at the improvement of each organic being in  relation to its organic and inorganic conditions of lifeif this  i say were proved to be true ought gods care gods providence  to seem less or more magnificent in our eyes  of old it was said by  him without whom nothing is mademy father worketh hitherto and i  work  shall we quarrel with physical science if she gives us  evidence that these words are true  and if it should be proven that  the gigantic hura and the lowly spurge sprang from one common  ancestor what would the orthodox theologian have to say to it  savingi always knew that god was great  and i am not surprised  to find him greater than i thought him  so much for the giant weed of the morichal from which we rode on  and up through rolling country growing lovelier at every step and  turned out of our way to see wild pineapples in a sandy spot or  arenal in a valley beneath  the meeting of the stiff marl and the  fine sand was abrupt and well marked by the vegetation  on one  side of the ravine the tall fanleaved carats marked the rich soil  on the other the sand and gravel loving cocorites appeared at once  crowding their ostrich plumes together  most of them were the  common species of the island 202a in which the pinnae of the  leaves grow in fours and fives and at different angles from the  leafstalk giving the whole a brushy appearance which takes off  somewhat from the perfectness of its beauty  but among them we saw for the first and last time in the foresta few of a far more  beautiful species 202b common on the mainland  in it the pinnae  are set on all at the same distance apart and all in the same  plane in opposite sides of the stalk giving to the whole foliage a  grand simplicity and producing when the curving leafpoints toss  in the breeze that curious appearance which i mentioned in an  earlier chapter of green glass wheels with rapidly revolving  spokes  at their feet grew the pineapples only in flower or  unripe fruit so that we could not quench our thirst with them and  only looked with curiosity at the small wild type of so famous a  plant  but close by and happily nearly ripe we found a fair  substitute for pineapples in the fruit of the karatas  this form  of bromelia closely allied to the pinguin of which hedges are made  bears a straggling plume of prickly leaves six or eight feet long  each close to the ground  the forester looks for a plant in which  the leaves droop outwardsa sign that the fruit is ripe  after  beating it cautiously for snakes are very fond of coiling under its  shade he opens the centre and finds close to the ground a group  of whitish fruits nearly two inches long peels carefully off the  skin which is beset with innumerable sharp hairs and eats the  soursweet refreshing pulp  but not too often for there are always  hairs enough left to make the tongue bleed if more than one or two  are eaten  with lips somewhat less parched we rode away again to see the sight  of the day and a right pleasant sight it was  these montserrat  hills had been within the last three years almost the most lawless  and neglected part of the island  principally by the energy and  tact of one man the wild inhabitants had been conciliated brought  under law and made to pay their light taxes in return for a safety  and comfort enjoyed perhaps by no other peasants on earth  a few words on the excellent system which bids fair to establish in  this colony a thriving and loyal peasant proprietary  up to 1847  crown lands were seldom alienated  in that year a price was set  upon them and persons in illegal occupation ordered to petition for  their holdings  unfortunately though a time was fixed for  petitioning no time was fixed for paying and consequently the vast  majority of petitioners never took any further steps in the matter   unfortunately too the price fixed2 pounds per acrewas too  high and squatting went on much as before  it appeared to the late governor that this evil would best be dealt  with experimentally and locally and he accordingly erected the  chief squatting district montserrat into a ward giving the warden  large discretionary powers as commissioner of crown lands  the  price of crown lands was reduced in 1869 to 1 pounds per acre and  the montserrat system extended as far as possible to other wards  a movement which the results fully justified  in 1867 there were in montserrat 400 squatters holding lands of  from 3 to 120 acres planted with cacao coffee or provisions   some of the cacao plantations were valued at 1000 pounds  these  people lived without paying taxes and almost without law or  religion  the crown woods had been of course sadly plundered by  squatters and by others who should have known better  at every  turn magnificent cedars might have been seen levelled by the axe  only a few feet of the trunk being used to make boards and shingles  while the greater part was left to rot or burn  these  irregularities have been now almost stopped and 266 persons in  montserrat alone have taken out grants of land some of 400 acres   but this by no means represents the number of purchasers as nearly  an equal number have paid for their estates though they have not  yet received their grants and nearly 500 more have made  application  two villages have been formed one of which is that  where we rested containing the church  the other contains the  wardens residence and office the policestation and a numerously  attended school  the squatters are of many races and of many hues of black and  brown  the halfbreeds from the neighbouring coast of venezuela a  mixture probably of spanish negro and indian are among the most  industrious and their cacao plantations in some cases hold 8000  to 10000 trees  the southwest corner of montserrat 204 is  almost entirely settled by africans of various tribesmandingos  foulahs homas yarribas ashantees and congos  the last occupy  the lowest position in the social scale  they lead for the most  part a semibarbarous life dwelling in miserable huts and  subsisting on the produce of an acre or two of badly cultivated  land eked out with the pay of an occasional days labour on some  neighbouring estate  the social position of some of the yarribas  forms a marked contrast to that of the congos  they inhabit houses  of cedar or other substantial materials  their gardens are for  the most part well stocked and kept  they raise crops of yam  cassava indian corn etc and some of them subscribe to a fund on  which they may draw in case of illness or misfortune  they are  however as is to be expected from superior intellect while still  uncivilised more difficult to manage than the congos and highly  impatient of control  these africans mr mitchell says all belong nominally to some  denomination of christianity but their lives are more influenced by  their belief in obeah  while the precepts of religion are little  regarded they stand in mortal dread of those who practise this  mischievous imposture  well might the commissioner say in 1867  that several years must elapse before the chaos which reigned could  be reduced to order  the wonder is that in three years so much has  been done  it was very difficult at first even to find the  whereabouts of many of the squatters  the commissioner had to work  by compass through the pathless forest  getting little or no food  but cassava cakes and guango of maize and now and then a little  coffee and salt fish without time to hunt the game which passed  him and continually wet through he stumbled in suddenly on one  squatting after another to the astonishment of its owner who could  not conceive how he had been found out and had never before seen a  white man alone in the forest  sometimes he was in considerable  danger of a rough reception from people who could not at first  understand what they had to gain by getting legal titles and buying  the lands the fruit of which they had enjoyed either for nothing or  for payment of a small annual assessment for the cultivated portion   in another quartertocoa notoriously lawless squatter had  expressed his intention of shooting the government official  the  white gentleman walked straight up to the little forest fortress  hidden in bush and confronted the negro who had gun in hand  i could have shot you if i had liked buccra  no you could not  i should have cut you down first  so dont  play the fool answered the official quietly hand on cutlass  the wild man gave in paid his rates received the crown title for  his land and became as have all these sons of the forest fast  friends with one whom they have learnt at once to love and fear  but among the montserrat hills the governor had struck on a spot so  fit for a new settlement that he determined to found one forthwith   the quickeyed jesuits had founded a mission on the same spot many  years before  but all had lapsed again into forest  a group of  enormous palmistes stands on a plateau flat and yet lofty and  healthy  the soil is exceeding fertile  there are wells and brooks  of pure water all around  the land slopes down for hundreds of feet  in wooded gorges full of cedar and other admirable timber with  palmistes towering over them everywhere  far away lies the lowland  and every breeze of heaven sweeps over the crests of the hills  so  one peculiarly tall palm was chosen for a central landmark an  ornament to the town square such as no capital in europe can boast   traces were cut streets laid out lots of crown lands put up for  sale and settlers invited in the name of the government  scarcely eighteen months had passed since then and already there  mitchell street violin street duboulay street farfan street had  each its new houses built of cedar and thatched with palm  two  chinese shops had celestials with pigtails and thicksoled shoes  grinning behind cedar counters among stores of bryants safety  matches huntley and palmers biscuits and allsopps pale ale  a  church had been built the shell at least and partly floored with  a very simple but not tasteless altar the abbe had a good house  with a gallery jalousies and white china handles to the doors   the mighty palm in the centre of gordon square had a neat railing  round it as befitted the palladium of the village  behind the  houses among the stumps of huge trees maize and cassava pigeon peas and sweet potatoes fattened in the sun on ground which till  then had been shrouded by vegetation a hundred feet thick and as we  sat at the head mans house with french and english prints upon the  walls and drank beer from a chinese shop and looked out upon the  loyal thriving little settlement i envied the two young men who  could say at least we have not lived in vain for we have made  this out of the primeval forest  then on again  we mounted i  quote now from the notes of one to whom the existence of the  settlement was due to the crest of the hills and had a noble view  southwards looking over the rich mass of dark wood flecked here  and there with a scarlet stain of bois immortelle to the great sea  of bright green sugar cultivation in the naparimas studded by white  works and villages and backed far off by a hazy line of forest out  of which rose the peaks of the moruga mountains  more to the west  lay san fernando hill the calm gulf and the coast toward la brea  and cedros melting into mist  m thought we should get a better  view of the northern mountains by riding up to old nicanos house  so we went thither under the cacao rich with yellow and purple  pods  the view was fine  but the northern range though visible  was rather too indistinct and the mainland was not to be seen at  all  nevertheless the panorama from the top of montserrat is at once the  most vast and the most lovely which i have ever seen  and  whosoever chooses to go and live there may buy any reasonable  quantity of the richest soil at 1 pounds per acre  then down off the ridge toward the northern lowland lay a headlong  old indian path by which we travelled at last across a rocky  brook and into a fresh paradise  i must be excused for using this word so often  but i use it in the  original persian sense as a place in which natural beauty has been  helped by art  an english park or garden would have been called of  old a paradise and the enceinte of a west indian house even in its  present halfwild condition well deserves the same title  that art  can help nature there can be no doubt  the perfection of nature  exists only in the minds of sentimentalists and of certain well meaning persons who assert the perfection of nature when they wish  to controvert science and deny it when they wish to prove this  earth fallen and accursed  mr nesfield can make landscapes by  obedience to certain laws which nature is apt to disregard in the  struggle for existence more beautiful than they are already by  nature and that without introducing foreign forms of vegetation   but if foreign forms wisely chosen for their shapes and colours be  added the beauty may be indefinitely increased  for the plants  most capable of beautifying any given spot do not always grow  therein simply because they have not yet arrived there as may be  seen by comparing any wood planted with rhododendrons and azaleas  with the neighbouring wood in its native state  thus may be  obtained somewhat of that variety and richness which is wanting  everywhere more or less in the vegetation of our northern zone  only just recovering slowly from the destructive catastrophe of the  glacial epoch a richness which small as it is vanishes as we  travel northward till the drear landscape is sheeted more and more  with monotonous multitudes of heather grass fir or other social  plants  but even in the tropics the virgin forest beautiful as it is is  without doubt much less beautiful both in form and colours than it  might be made  without doubt also a mere clearing after a few  years is a more beautiful place than the forest because by it  distance is given and you are enabled to see the sky and the  forest itself beside because new plants and some of them very  handsome ones are introduced by cultivation or spring up in the  rastrajo and lastly but not least because the forest on the edge  of the clearing is able to feather down to the ground and change  what is at first a bare tangle of stems and boughs into a softly  rounded bank of verdure and flowers  when in some future  civilisation the art which has produced not merely a chatsworth or  a dropmore but an average english shrubbery or park is brought to  bear on tropic vegetation then nature always willing to obey when  conquered by fair means will produce such effects of form and  colour around tropic estates and cities as we cannot fancy for  ourselves  mr wallace laments and rightly the absence in the tropic forests  of such grand masses of colour as are supplied by a heather moor a  furze or broomcroft a field of yellow charlock blue bugloss or  scarlet poppy  tropic landscape gardening will supply that defect  and a hundred plants of yellow allamanda or purple dolichos or  blue clitoria or crimson norantea set side by side as we might  use a hundred calceolarias or geraniums will carry up the forest  walls and over the treetops not square yards but i had almost  said square acres of richest positive colour  i can conceive no  limit to the effectsalways heightened by the intense sunlight and  the peculiar tenderness of the distanceswhich landscape gardening  will produce when once it is brought to bear on such material as it  has never yet attempted to touch at least in the west indies save  in the botanic garden at port of spain  and thus the little paradise at tortuga to which we descended to  sleep though cleared out without any regard to art was far more  beautiful than the forest out of which it had been hewn three years  before  the two first settlers regretted the days when the house  was a mere palmthatched hut where they sat on stumps which would  not balance and ate potted meat with their pocket knives  but it  had grown now into a grand place fit to receive ladies  such a  house or rather shed as those south sea island ones which may be  seen in hodges illustrations to cooks voyages save that a couple  of bedrooms have been boarded off at the back a little office on  one side and a bulwark like that of a ship put round the gallery   and as we looked down through the purple gorges and up at the  mountain woods over which the stars were flashing out blight and  fast and listened to the soft strange notes of the forest birds  going to roost again the thought came over mewhy should not  gentlemen and ladies come to such spots as these to live the gentle  life  we slept that night some in beds some in hammocks some on the  floor with the rich warm night wind rushing down through all the  house and then were up once more in the darkness of the dawn to go  down and bathe at a little cascade where a feeble stream dribbled  under ferns and balisiers over soft square limestone rocks like the  artificial rocks of the serpentine and thosecopied probably from  the rocks of fontainebleauwhich one sees in old french landscapes   but a bathe was hardly necessary  so drenched was the vegetation  with night dew that if one had taken off ones clothes at the  house and simply walked under the bananas and through the tanias  and maize which grew among them one would have been well washed ere  one reached the stream  as it was the bathers came back with their  clothes wet through  no matter  the sun was up and half an hour  would dry all again  one object on the edge of the forest was worth noticing and was  watched long through the glasses namely two or three large trees  from which dangled a multitude of the pendant nests of the merles   209 birds of the size of a jackdaw brown and yellow and mocking birds too of no small ability  the pouches two feet long and  more swayed in the breeze fastened to the end of the boughs with a  few threads  each had about halfway down an opening into the  round sac below in and out of which the merles crept and fluttered  talking all the while in twenty different notes  most tropic birds  hide their nests carefully in the bush  the merles hang theirs  fearlessly in the most exposed situations  they find i presume  that they are protected enough from monkeys wild cats and gato melaos a sort of ferret by being hung at the extremity of the  bough  so thinks m leotaud the accomplished describer of the  birds of trinidad  but he adds with good reason  i do not  however understand how birds can protect their nestlings against  ants for so large is the number of these insects in our climes  that it would seem as if everything would become their prey  and so everything will unless the bird murder be stopped  already  the parasolants have formed a warren close to port of spain in  what was forty years ago highly cultivated ground from which they  devastate at night the northern gardens  the forests seem as empty  of birds as the neighbourhood of the city and a sad answer will  soon have to be given to m leotauds question  the insectivorous tribes are the true representatives of our  ornithology  there are so many which feed on insects and their  larvae that it may be asked with much reason what would become of  our vegetation of ourselves should these insect destroyers  disappear  everywhere may be seen m l speaks i presume of  fiveandtwenty years ago  my experience would make me substitute  for his words hardly anywhere can be seen one of these  insectivora in pursuit or seizure of its prey either on the wing or  on the trunks of trees in the coverts of thickets or in the calices  of flowers  whenever called to witness one of those frequent  migrations from one point to another so often practised by ants  not only can the dendrocolaptes connected with our creepers be  seen following the moving trail and preying on the ants and the  eggs themselves but even the black tanager abandons his usual  fruits for this more tempting delicacy  our frugivorous and  baccivorous genera are also pretty numerous and most of them are so  fond of insect food that they unite as occasion offers with the  insectivorous tribes  so it was once  now a traveller accustomed to the swarms of birds  which not counting the game inhabit an average english cover  would be surprised and pained by the scarcity of birds in the  forests of this island  we rode down toward the northern lowland along a broad new road of  last years making terraced with great labour along the hill and  stopped to visit one of those excellent government schools which do  honour first to that wise legislator lord harris and next to the  late governor  here in the depths of the forest where never  policeman or schoolmaster had been before was a house of satinwood  and cedar not two years old used at once as policestation and  school with a shrewd spanishspeaking schoolmaster and fiftytwo  decent little brown children on the schoolbooks and getting when  their lazy parents will send them as good an education as they  would get in england  i shall have more to say on the education  system of trinidad  all it seems to me to want with its late  modifications is compulsory attendance  soon turning down an old indian path we saw the gulf once more and  between us and it the sheet of cane cultivation of which one estate  ran up to our feet like a bright green bay entered by a narrow  strait among the dark forest  just before we came to it we passed  another pleasant sight  more coolie settlers who had had lands  granted them in lieu of the return passage to which they were  entitled were all busily felling wood putting up bamboo and palm leaf cabins and settling themselves down each one his own master  yet near enough to the sugarestates below to get remunerative work  whenever needful  then on over slow miles you must not trot beneath the burning mid day sun of sandy stifling flat between high canes till we saw  with joy through long vistas of straight traces the mangrove  shrubbery which marked the sea  we turned into large sugarworks  to be cooled with sherry and ice by a hospitable manager whose  rooms were hung with good prints and stored with good books and  knickknacks from europe showing the signs of a ladys hand  and  here our party broke up  the rest carried their mud back to port of  spain i in the opposite direction back to san fernando down a  little creek which served as a port to the estate  plastered up to the middle like the rest of the party besides  splashes over face and hat i could get no dirtier than i was  already  i got without compunction into a canoe some three feet  wide and was shoved by three negroes down a long winding ditch of  mingled mud water and mangroveroots  to keep ones self and  ones luggage from falling out during the journey was no easy  matter at one moment indeed it threatened to become impossible   for where the mangroves opened on the sea the creek itself turned  sharply northward along shore leaving as usual a bed of mud  between it and the sea some quarter of a mile broad across which we  had to pass as a short cut to the boat which lay far out  the  difficulty was of course to get the canoe out of the creek up the  steep mudbank  to that end she was turned on her side with me on  board  i could just manage by jamming my luggage under my knees  and myself against the two gunwales to keep in holding on chiefly  by my heels and the back of my neck  but it befell that in the  very agony of the steepest slope when the negroes who worked like  really good fellows were nigh waistdeep in mud my eye fell for  the first time in my life on a party of calling crabs who had been  down to the water to fish and were now scuttling up to their  burrows among the mangroveroots and at the sight of the pairs of  longstalked eyes standing upright like a pair of operaglasses  and the long single arms which each brandished with frightful  menaces as of infuriated nelsons i burst into such a fit of  laughter that i nearly fell out into the mud  the negroes thought  for the instant that the buccra parson had gone mad  but when i  pointed with my head i dare not move a finger to the crabs off  they went in a true negro guffaw which when once begun goes on  and on like thunder echoing round the mountains and can no more  stop itself than a blackcaps song  so all the way across the mud  the jolly fellows working meanwhile like horses laughed for the  mere pleasure of laughing and when we got to the boat the negro in  charge of her saw us laughing and laughed too for company without  waiting to hear the joke and as two of them took the canoe home we  could hear them laughing still in the distance till the lonely  loathsome place rang again  i plead guilty to having given the men  as payment not only for their work but for their jollity just  twice what they asked which after all was very little  but what are calling crabs  i must ask the reader to conceive a  moderatesized crab the front of whose carapace is very broad and  almost straight with a channel along it in which lie right and  left his two eyes each on a footstalk half as long as the breadth  of his body so that the crab when at rest carries his eyes as  epaulettes and peeps out at the joint of each shoulder  but when  business is to be done the eyestalks jump bolt upright side by  side like a pair of little lighthouses and survey the field of  battle in a fashion utterly ludicrous  moreover as if he were not  ridiculous enough even thus he is as mr wood well puts it like a  small man gifted with one arm of hercules and another of tom thumb   one of his claw arms generally the left has dwindled to a mere  nothing and is not seen while along the whole front of his shell  lies folded one mighty right arm on which he trusts and with that  arm when danger appears he beckons the enemy to come on with such  wild defiance that he has gained therefrom the name of gelasimus  vocans the calling laughable and it were well if all scientific  names were as well fitted  he is as might be guessed a shrewd  fighter and uses the true old bristol guard in boxing holding  his long arm across his body and fencing and biting therewith  swiftly and sharply enough  moreover he is a respectable animal  and has a wife and takes care of her and to see him in his glory  it is said he should be watched sitting in the mouth of his  burrow his spouse packed safe behind him inside while he beckons  and brandishes proclaiming to all passersby the treasure which he  protects while he defies them to touch it  such is the calling crab of whom i must say that if he was not  made on purpose to be laughed at then i should be induced to  suspect that nothing was made for any purpose whatsoever  after which sight and weary of waiting not without some fear that as the negroes would have put itif i tap da wan momant ma i  catch da confection while of course a bucket or two of hot water  was emptied on us out of a passing cloud i got on board the  steamer and away to san fernando to wash away dirt and forget  fatigue amid the hospitality of educated and highminded men and  of even more charming women    chapter xi  the northern mountains    i had heard and read much of the beauty of mountain scenery in the  tropics  what i had heard and read is not exaggerated  i saw it  is true in this little island no andes with such a scenery among  them and below them as humboldt alone can describea type of the  great and varied tropical world as utterly different from that of  trinidad as it is from that of kentor siberia  i had not even the  chance of such a view as that from the silla of caraccas described  by humboldt from which you look down at a height of nearly six  thousand feet through layer after layer of floating cloud which  increases the seeming distance to an awful depth upon the blazing  shores of the northern sea  that view our host and his suite had seen themselves the year  before and they assured me that humboldt had not overstated its  grandeur  the mountains of trinidad do not much exceed three  thousand feet in height and i could hope at most to see among them  what my fancy had pictured among the serrated chines and green  gorges of st vincent guadaloupe and st lucia hanging gardens  compared with which those of babylon of old must have been cockney  mounds  the rock among these mountains as i have said already is  very seldom laid bare  decomposed rapidly by the tropic rain and  heat it forms even on the steepest slopes a mass of soil many  feet in depth ever increasing and ever sliding into the valleys  mingled with blocks and slabs of rock still undecomposed  the waste  must be enormous now  were the forests cleared and the soil no  longer protected by the leaves and bound together by the roots it  would increase at a pace of which we in this temperate zone can form  no notion and the whole mountainrange slide down in deluges of  mud as even in the temperate zone the mont ventoux and other  hills in provence are sliding now since they have been rashly  cleared of their primeval coat of woodland  to this degrading influence of mere rain and air must be attributed  i think those vast deposits of boulder which encumber the mouths of  all the southern glens sometimes to a height of several hundred  feet  did one meet them in scotland one would pronounce them at  once to be old glaciermoraines  but messrs wall and sawkins in  their geological survey of this island have abstained from  expressing any such opinion and i think wisely  they are more  simply explained as the mere leavings of the old seaworn mountain  wall at a time when the orinoco or the sea lay along their  southern as it now does along their northern side  the terraces  in which they rise mark successive periods of upheaval and how long  these periods were no reasonable man dare guess  but as for traces  of iceaction none as far as i can ascertain have yet been met  with  he would be a bold man who should deny that during the abyss  of ages a cold epoch may have spread ice over part of that wide  land which certainly once existed to the north of trinidad and the  spanish main  but if so its traces are utterly obliterated  the  commencement of the glacial epoch as far as trinidad is concerned  may be safely referred to the discovery of wenham lake ice and the  effects thereof sought solely in the human stomach and the increase  of messrs haleys wellearned profits  is it owing to this absence  of any iceaction that there are no lakes not even a tarn in the  northern mountains  far be it from me to thrust my somewhat empty  head into the battle which has raged for some time past between  those who attribute all lakes to the scooping action of glaciers and  those who attribute them to original depressions in the earths  surface  but it was impossible not to contrast the lakeless  mountains of trinidad with the mountains of kerry resembling them  so nearly in shape and size but swarming with lakes and tarns   there are no lakes throughout the west indies save such as are  extinct craters or otherwise plainly attributable to volcanic  action as i presume are the lakes of tropical mexico and peru  be  that as it may the want of water or rather of visible water takes  away much from the beauty of these mountains in which the eye grows  tired toward the end of a days journey with the monotonous surges  of green woodland and hails with relief in going northward the  first glimpse of the sea horizon in going south the first glimpse  of the hazy lowland in which the very roofs and chimneystalks of  the sugarestates are pleasant to the eye from the repose of their  perpendicular and horizontal lines after the perpetual unrest of  rolling hills and tangled vegetation  we started then to begin my story a little after five one  morning from a solid old mansion in the canefields which bears  the name of paradise and which has all the right to the name which  beauty of situation and goodness of inhabitants can bestow  as we got into our saddles the hummingbirds were whirring round the  treetops the questce quil dits inquiring the subject of our  talk  the black vultures sat about looking on in silence hoping  that something to their advantage might be dropped or left behind possibly that one of our horses might die  ere the last farewell was given one of our party pointed to a sight  which i never saw before and perhaps shall never see again  it was  the southern cross  just visible in that winter season on the  extreme southern horizon in early morning it hung upright amid the  dim haze of the lowland and the smoke of the sugarworks   impressive as was and always must be the first sight of that  famous constellation i could not but agree with those who say that  they are disappointed by its inequality both in shape and in the  size of its stars  however i had but little time to make up my  mind about it for in five minutes more it had melted away into a  blaze of sunlight which reminded us that we ought to have been on  foot half an hour before  so away we went over the dewy paddocks through broadleaved  grasses and the pink balls of the sensitiveplants and blue  commelyna and the upright negro ipecacuanha 216 with its scarlet  and yellow flowers gayest and commonest of weeds then down into a  bamboo copse and across a pebbly brook and away toward the  mountains  our party consisted of a batmule with food and clothes two or  three negroes a horse for me another for general use in case of  breakdown and four gentlemen who preferred walking to riding  it  seemed at first a serious undertaking on their part but one had  only to see them begin to move long lithe and light as deer hounds in their flannel shirts and trousers with cutlass and pouch  at their waists to be sure that they could both go and stay and  were as well able to get to blanchisseuse as the horses beside which  they walked  the ward of blanchisseuse on the north coast whither we were  bound was of old i understand called blanchi sali or something  to that effect signifying the white cliffs  the french settlers  degraded the name to its present form and that so hopelessly that  the other day an old negress in port of spain puzzled the officer of  crown property by informing him that she wanted to buy a carre in  what you call de washerwomans  it had been described to me as  possibly the remotest loneliest and unhealthiest spot in her  majestys tropical dominions  no white man can live there for more  than two or three years without ruin to his health  in spite of the  perpetual tradewind and the steepness of the hillsides malaria  hangs for ever at the mouth of each little mountain torrent and  crawls up inland to leeward to a considerable height above the sea  but we did not intend to stay there long enough to catch fever and  ague  we had plenty of quinine with us and cheerily we went up the  valley of caura first over the great boulder and pebble ridges not  bare like those of the moor of dinnet or other deeside stone heap  but clothed with canepieces and richest rastrajo copses and then  entered the narrow gorge which we had to follow into the heart of  the hills as our leader taking one parting look at the broad green  lowland behind us reminded us of shelleys lines about the plains  of lombardy seen from the euganean hills   beneath me lies like a green sea the waveless plain of lombardy      where a soft and purple mist like a vaporous amethyst or an airdissolved stone mingling light and fragrance far from the curved horizons bound to the point of heavens profound fills the overflowing sky and the plains that silent lie underneath the leaves unsodden where the infant frost has trodden with his morningwinged feet whose bright fruit is gleaming yet and the red and golden vines piercing with their trellised lines the rough darkskirted wilderness   but there the analogy stopped  it hardly applied even so far   between us and the rough darkskirted wilderness of the high forests  on montserrat the infant frost had never trodden all basked in the  equal heat of the perpetual summer awaiting it may be in ages to  come a civilisation higher even than that whose decay shelley  deplored as he looked down on fallen italy  no clumsy words of mine  can give an adequate picture of the beauty of the streams and glens  which run down from either slope of the northern mountain  the  reader must fancy for himself the loveliest brook which he ever saw  in devonshire or yorkshire ireland or scotland crystalclear  bedded with gray pebbles broken into rapids by rockledges or great  white quartz boulders swirling under steep cliffs winding through  flats of natural meadow and copse  then let him transport his  stream into the great palmhouse at kew stretch out the house up  hill and down dale five miles in length and two thousand feet in  height pour down on it from above a blaze which lights up every  leaf into a gem and deepens every shadow into blackness and yet  that very blackness full of inner lightand if his fancy can do as  much as that he can imagine to himself the stream up which we rode  or walked now winding along the narrow track a hundred feet or two  above looking down on the upper surface of the forest on the  crests of palms and the broad sheets of the balisier copse and  often on the statelier fronds of true bananas which had run wild  along the streamside flowering and fruiting in the wilderness for  the benefit of the parrots and agoutis or on huge dark clumps of  bamboo which probably not indigenous to the island have in like  manner spread themselves along all the streams in the lapse of ages  now we scrambled down into the brook and waded our horses through  amid shoals of the little spotted sardine 218a who are too  fearless or too unaccustomed to man to get out of the way more  than a foot or two  but near akin as they are to the trout they  are still nearer to the terrible pirai 218b of the orinocquan  waters the larger of which snap off the legs of swimming ducks and  the fingers of unwary boatmen while the smaller surround the rash  bather and devour him piecemeal till he drowns torn by a thousand  tiny wounds in water purpled with his own blood  these little  fellows prove their kindred with the pirai by merely nibbling at the  bathers skin making him tingle from head to foot while he thanks  heaven that his visitors are but two inches and not a foot in  length  at last we stopped for breakfast  the horses were tethered to a  tree the food got out and we sat down on a pebbly beach after a  bathe in a deep pool so clear that it looked but four feet deep  though the bathers soon found it to be eight and more  a few dark  logs as usual were lodged at the bottom looking suspiciously like  alligators or boaconstrictors  the alligator however does not  come up the mountain streams and the boaconstrictors are rare  save on the east coast  but it is as well ere you jump into a  pool to look whether there be not a snake in it of any length from  three to twenty feet  over the pool rose a rock carrying a mass of vegetation to be  seen doubtless in every such spot in the island but of a richness  and variety beyond description  nearest to the water the primeval  garden began with ferns and creeping selaginella  next of course  the common arum 218c with snowwhite spathe and spadix mingled  with the larger leaves of balisier wild tania and seguine some of  the latter upborne on crooked fleshy stalks as thick as a mans leg  and six feet high  above them was a tangle of twenty different  bushes with leaves of every shape above them again the arching  shoots of a bamboo clump forty feet high threw a deep shade over  pool and rock and herbage while above it again enormous timber  trees were packed one behind the other up the steep mountainside   on the more level ground were the usual weeds ipomoeas with white  and purple flowers bignonias echites and allamandas with yellow  ones scrambled and tumbled everywhere and if not just there then  often enough elsewhere might be seen a single aristolochia  scrambling up a low tree from which hung amid round leaves huge  flowers shaped like a great helmet with a ladle at the lower lip a  foot or more across of purplish colour spotted like a toad and  about as fragrant as a dead dog  but the plants which would strike a botanist most i think the  first time he found himself on a tropic burnside are the peppers  groves of tall herbs some ten feet high or more utterly unlike any  european plants i have ever seen  some 219a have round leaves  peltate that is with the footstalk springing from inside the  circumference like a onesided umbrella  they catch the eye at  once from the great size of their leaves each a full foot across  but they are hardly as odd and foreignlooking as the more abundant  forms of peppers 219b usually so soft and green that they look as  if you might make them into salad stalks and all yet with a quaint  stiffness and primness given by the regular jointing of their  knotted stalks and the regular tiling of their pointed drooping  strongnerved leaves which are usually to add to the odd look of  the plant all crooked one side of the base and that in each  species always the same side being much larger than the other so  that the whole head of the bush seems to have got a twist from right  to left or left to right  nothing can look more unlike than they  to the climbing true peppers or even to the creeping pepperweeds  which abound in all waste land  but their rattails of small green  flowers prove them to be peppers nevertheless  on we went upward ever past cacao and bois immortelle orchards  and comfortable settlers hamlets and now and then through a strip  of virgin forest in which we began to see for the first time  though not for the last that resplendent calycophyllum as dr  krueger calls it chaconia as it is commonly called here after poor  alonzo de chacon the last spanish governor of this island  it is  indeed the jewel of these woods  a low straggling tree carries on  long pendent branches leaves like a spanish chestnut a foot and  more in length and at the ends of the branches long corymbs of  yellow flowers  but it is not the flowers themselves which make the  glory of the tree  as the flower opens one calyxlobe by a rich  vagary of nature grows into a leaf three inches long of a splendid  scarlet and the whole end of each branch for two feet or more in  length blazes among the green foliage till you can see it and  wonder at it a quarter of a mile away  this is the resplendent  calycophyllum elaborated most probably by long physical  processes of variation and natural selection into a form equally  monstrous and beautiful  there are those who will smile at my  superstition if i state my belief that he who makes all things make  themselves may have used those very processes of variation and  natural selection for a final cause and that the final cause was  that he might delight himself in the beauty of one more strange and  new creation  be it so  i can only assume that their minds are  for the present at least differently constituted from mine  we reached the head of the glen at last and outlet from the  amphitheatre of wood there seemed none  but now i began to find out  what a tropic mountainpath can be and what a west indian horse can  do  we arrived at the lower end of a narrow ditch full of rocks and  mud which wandered up the face of a hill as steep as the roofs of  the louvre or chateau chambord  accustomed only to english horses  i confess i paused in dismay  but as men and horses seemed to take  the hill as a matter of course the only thing to be done was to  give the stout little cob his head and not to slip over his tail   so up we went splashing clawing slipping stumbling but never  falling down pausing every now and then to get breath for a fresh  rush and then on again up a place as steep as a devonshire furze bank for twenty or thirty feet till we had risen a thousand feet  as i suppose and were on a long and more level chine in the midst  of ghastly dead forests the remains of last years fires  much was  burnt to tinder and ash much more was simply killed and scorched  and stood or hung in an infinite tangle of lianes and boughs all  gray and bare  here and there some huge tree had burnt as it stood  and rose like a sootgrimed tower here another had fallen right  across the path and we had to cut our way round it step by step  amid a mass of fallen branches sometimes much higher than our heads  or to lead the horses underneath boughs which were too large to cut  through and just high enough to let them pass  an english horse  would have lost his nerve and become restive from confusion and  terror but these wise brutes like the packmule seemed to  understand the matter as well as we waited patiently till a passage  was cut and then struggled gallantly through often among logs  where i expected to see their legbones snapped in two  but my  fears were needless the deft gallant animals got safe through  without a scratch  however for them as for us the work was very  warm  the burnt forest was utterly without shade and woodcutting  under a perpendicular noonday sun would have been trying enough had  not our spirits been kept up by the excitement the sense of freedom  and of power and also by the magnificent scenery which began to  break upon us  from one cliff off which the whole forest had been  burnt away we caught at last a sight westward of tocuche from  summit to base rising out of a green sea of woodfor the fire  coming from the eastward had stopped halfway down the cliff and  to the right of the picture the blue northern sea shone through a  gap in the hills  what a view that was  to conceive it the reader  must fancy himself at clovelly on the north coast of devon if he  ever has had the good fortune to see that most beautiful of english  cliffwoodlands he must magnify the whole scene four or five times  and then pour down on it a tropic sunshine and a tropic haze  soon we felt and thankful we were to feel it a rush of air soft  and yet bracing cool yet not chilly the champagne atmosphere  as some one called it of the tradewind  and all even the very  horses plucked up heart for that told us that we were at the  summit of the pass and that the worst of our days work was over   in five minutes more we were aware between the treestems of a  green misty gulf beneath our very feet which seemed at the first  glance boundless but which gradually resolved itself into mile  after mile of forest rushing down into the sea  the hues of the  distant woodlands twenty miles away seen through a veil of  ultramarine mingled with the pale greens and blues of the water   and they again with the pale sky till the eye could hardly discern  where land and sea and air parted from each other  we stopped to gaze and breathe and then downward again for nigh  two thousand feet toward blanchisseuse  and so leading our tired  horses we went cheerily down the mountain side in indian file  hopping and slipping from ledge to mud and mud to ledge and calling  a halt every five minutes to look at some fresh curiosity  now a  treefern now a climbing fern now some huge treetrunk whose name  was only to be guessed at now a fresh armadilloburrow now a  parasolants warren which had to be avoided lest horse and man  should sink in it kneedeep and come out sorely bitten now some  glimpse of sea and forest far below now we cut a watervine and  had a long cool drink now a great moth had to be hunted if not  caught or a toucan or some other strange bird listened to or an  eagle watched as he soared high over the green gulf  now all  stopped together for the ground was sprinkled thick with great  beads scarlet with a black eye which had fallen from some tree  high overhead and we all set to work like schoolboys filling our  pockets with them for the ladies at home  now the path was lost  having vanished in the six months growth of weeds and we had to  beat about for it over fallen logs through tangles of liane and  thickets of the tall arouma 221 a cane with a flat tuft of leaves  atop which is plentiful in these dark damp northern slopes  now  we struggled and hopped horse and man down and round a corner at  the head of a glen where a few flagstones fallen across a gully  gave an uncertain foothold and paused under damp rocks covered  with white and pink begonias and ferns of innumerable forms to  drink the clear mountain water out of cups extemporised from a  calathea leaf and then struggled up again over roots and ledges  and round the next spur in cool green darkness on which it seemed  the sun had never shone and in a silence which when our own voices  ceased was saddening all but appalling  at last striking into a broader trace which came from the westward  we found ourselves some six or eight hundred feet above the sea in  scenery still like a magnified clovelly but amid a vegetation  whichhow can i describe  suffice it to say that right and left  of the path and arching together over head rose a natural avenue  of cocorite palms beneath whose shade i rode for miles enjoying  the fresh trade wind the perfume of the vanilla flowers and last  but not least the conversation of one who used his high post to  acquaint himself thoroughly with the beauties the productions the  capabilities of the island which he governed and his high culture  to make such journeys as this a continuous stream of instruction and  pleasure to those who accompanied him  under his guidance we  stopped at one point silent with delight and awe  through an arch of cocorite boughsah that english painters would  go to paint such pictures set in such natural frameswe saw  nearly a thousand feet below us the little bay of fillette  the  height of the horizon line told us how high we were ourselves for  the blue of the caribbean sea rose far above a point which stretched  out on our right covered with noble wood while the dark olive  cliffs along its base were gnawed by snowy surf  on our left the  nearer mountain woods rushed into the sea cutting off the view and  under our very feet in the centre of an amphitheatre of wood as  the eye of the whole picture was a groupsuch as i cannot hope to  see again  out of a group of scarlet bois immortelles rose three  palmistes and close to them a single balata whose height i hardly  dare to estimate  so tall they were that though they were perhaps  a thousand feet below us they stood out against the blue sea far  up toward the horizon line the central palm a hundred and fifty  feet at least the two others as we guessed a hundred and twenty  feet or more  their stems were perfectly straight and motionless  while their dark crowns even at that distance could be seen to  toss and rage impatiently before the rush of the strong trade wind   the black glossy head of the balata almost as high aloft as they  threw off sheets of spangled light which mingled with the spangles  of the waves and above the tree tops as if poised in a blue hazy  sky one tiny white sail danced before the breeze  the whole scene  swam in soft sea air and such combined grandeur and delicacy of  form and of colour i never beheld before  we rode on and downward toward a spot where we expected to find  water  our negroes had lagged behind with the provisions and  hungry and thirsty we tethered our horses to the trees at the  bottom of a gully and went down through the bush toward a low  cliff  as we went if i recollect we found on the ground many  curious pods 224 curled two or three times round something like  those of a medic and when they split bright red inside setting  off prettily enough the bright blue seeds  some animal or other  however admired these seeds as much as we for they had been  stripped as soon as they opened and out of hundreds of pods we only  secured one or two beads  we got to the cliffa smugglers crack in the rock and peered  down with some disgust  there should have been a pole or two  there to get down by  but they were washed away a canoe also   but it had been carried off probably out of the way of the surf   to get down the crack for active men was easy enough  but to get  up again seemed the longer we looked at it the more impossible at  least for me  so after scrambling down holding on by wild pines  as far as we dareduring which process one of us was stung not  bitten by a great huntingant causing much pain and swellingwe  turned away for the heat of the little corner was intolerable  but  wistful eyes did we cast back at the next point of rock behind  which broke out the tantalising spring which we could just not  reach  we rode on sick and sorry to find unexpected relief  we entered a  clearing with bananas and tanias cacao and bois immortelle and  better still avocado pears and orangetree with fruit  a tall and  stately dame was there her only garment a long cottonprint gown  which covered her tall figure from throat to ankle and wrist  showing brown feet and hands which had once been delicate and a  brown face half spanish half indian modest and serious enough   we pointed to a tall orangetree overhead laden with fruit of every  hue from bright green to gold  she on being appealed to in  spanish answered with a courteous smile and then a piercing scream  ofcandelaria come hither and get oranges for the governor and  other senors  candelaria who might have been eighteen or twenty  came sliding down under the bananaleaves all modest smiles and  blushes through her whitybrown skin  but having no more clothes on  than her mother she naturally hesitated at climbing the tree and  after ineffectual attempts to knock down oranges with a bamboo  screamed in her turn for some jose or juan  jose or juan made his  appearance in a ragged shirt  a lanky lad about seventeen years  old he was evidently the oaf or hobbedehoy of the family just as  he would have been on this side of the sea was treated as such and  was accustomed to be so treated  in a tone of angry contempt the  poor boy had done and said nothing the two women hounded him up the  tree  he obeyed in meek resignation and in a couple of minutes we  had more oranges than we could eat  and such oranges  golden green but rather more green than gold which cannot be as at home  bitten or sucked for so strong is the fragrant essential oil in the  skin that it would blister the lips and disorder the stomach and  the orange must be carefully stripped of the outer coat before you  attack a pulp compared with which for flavour the orange of our  shops is but bad sugar and water  as i tethered my horse to a cacaostem and sat on a log among  hothouse ferns peeling oranges with a bowieknife beneath the  burning midday sun the quaintest fancy came over me that it was  all a dream a phantasmagoria a christmas pantomime got up by my  host for my special amusement and that if i only winked my eyes  hard enough when i opened them again it would be all gone and i  should find myself walking with him on ascot heath while the snow  whirled over the heather and the black firtrees groaned in the  northeast wind  we soon rode on with blessings on fair candelaria and her stately  mother while the noise of the surf grew louder and louder in front  of us  we took if i remember right a sudden turn to the left to  get our horses to the shore  our pedestrians held straight on  there was a mangrove swamp and a lagoon in front for which they  bold lads cared nothing  we passed over a sort of open down from which all vegetation had  been cleared save the palmistessuch a wood of them as i had never  seen before  a hundred or more averaging at least a hundred feet  in height stood motionless in the full cut of the strong trade wind  one would have expected them when the wood round was felled  to feel the sudden nakedness  one would have expected the inrush of  salt air and foam to have injured their foliage  but seemingly it  was not so  they stood utterly unharmed save some halfdozen who  had had their tops snapped off by a galethere are no hurricanes in  trinidadand remained as enormous unmeaning pikes or posts fifty  to eighty feet high transformed by that one blast from one of the  loveliest to one of the ugliest natural objects  through the palmiste pillars through the usual black roseau scrub  then under tangled boughs down a steep stony bank and we were on a  long beach of deep sand and quartz gravel  on our right the shore grapes with their green bunches of fruit the mahauts 226 with  their poplarlike leaves and great yellow flowers and the  ubiquitous matapalos fringed the shore  on our left weltered a  broad waste of plunging foam in front green mountains were piled on  mountains blazing in sunlight yet softened and shrouded by an air  saturated with steam and salt  we waded our horses over the mouth  of the little yarra which hurried down through the sand brown and  foul from the lagoon above  we sat down on bare polished logs  which floods had carried from the hills above and ate and drank for our negroes had by now rejoined us and then scrambled up the  shore back again and into a trace running along the low cliff even  more beautiful if possible than that which we had followed in the  morning  along the cliff tall balatas and palmistes with here and  there an equally tall cedar and on the inside bank a green wall of  balisiers with leaves full fifteen feet long and heads of scarlet  flowers marked the richness of the soil  here and there too a  cannonball tree rose grand and strange among the balatas and in  one place the ground was strewn with large white flowers whose  peculiar shape told us at once of some other lecythid tree high  overhead  these lecythids are peculiar to the hottest parts of  south america to the valleys of the orinoco and amazon to  trinidad as a fragment of the old orinocquan land and possibly to  some of the southern antilles  so now as we are in their home it  may be worth our while to pause a little round these strange and  noble forms  botanists tell us that they are or rather may have been in old  times akin to myrtles  if so they have taken a grand and original  line of their own and persevered in it for ages till they have  specialised themselves to a condition far in advance of most  myrtles in size beauty and use  they may be known from all other  trees by one marktheir large handsome flowers  a group of the  innumerable stamens have grown together on one side of the flower  into a hood which bends over the stigma and the other stamens   tall trees they are and glorious to behold when in full flower  but they are notorious mostly for their huge fruits and delicious  nuts  one of their finest forms and the only one which the  traveller is likely to see often in trinidad is the cannonball  tree 227  there is a grand specimen in the botanic garden and  several may be met with in any days ride through the high woods  and distinguished at once from any other tree  the stem rises  without a fork for sixty feet or more and rolls out at the top  into a head very like that of an elm trimmed up and like an elm too  in its lateral waterboughs  for the whole of the stem from the  very ground to the forks and the larger forkbranches likewise are  feathered all over with numberless short prickly pendent branchlets  which roll outward and then down and then up again in graceful  curves and carry large pale crimson flowers each with a pink hood  in the middle looking like a newborn babys fist  those flowers  when torn turn blue on exposure to the light and when they fall  leave behind them the cannonball a rough brown globe as big as a  thirty two pound shot which you must get down with a certain  caution lest that befall you which befell a certain gallant officer  on the mainland of america  for fired with a postprandial  ambition to obtain a cannon ball he took to himself a long bamboo  and poked at the tree  he succeeded  but not altogether as he had  hoped  for the cannon ball in coming down avenged itself by  dropping exactly on the bridge of his nose felling him to the  ground and giving him such a pair of black eyes that he was not  seen on parade for a fortnight  the pulp of this cannonball is they say vinous and pleasant  when fresh but those who are mindful of what befell our forefather  adam from eating strange fruits will avoid it as they will many  more fruits eaten in the tropics but digestible only by the dura  ilia of indians and negroes  whatever virtue it may have when  fresh it begins as soon as stale to give out an odour too  abominable to be even recollected with comfort  more useful and the fruit of an even grander tree are those  brazil nuts which are sold in every sweetshop at home  they  belong to bertholletia excelsa a tree which grows sparinglyi have  never seen it wildin the southern part of the island but  plentifully in the forests of guiana and which is said to be one of  the tallest of all the forest giants  the fruit round like the  cannonball and about the size of a twentyfour pounder is harder  than the hardest wood and has to be battered to pieces with the  back of a hatchet to disclose the nuts which lie packed close  inside  any one who has hammered at a bertholletia fruit will be  ready to believe the story that the indians fond as they are of the  nuts avoid the totocke trees till the fruit has all fallen for  fear of fractured skulls and the older story which humboldt gives  out of old laet 228 that the indians dared not enter the forests  when the trees were fruiting without having their heads and  shoulders covered with bucklers of hard wood  these almendras de  peru peru almonds as they were called were known in europe as  early as the sixteenth century the seeds being carried up the  maragnon and by the cordilleras to peru men knew not from whence   to humboldt himself i believe is due the rediscovery of the tree  itself and its enormous fruit and the name of bertholletia excelsa  was given by him  the tree he says is not more than two or three  feet in diameter but attains one hundred or one hundred and twenty  feet in height  it does not resemble the mammee the starapple  and several other trees of the tropics of which the branches as in  the laurels of the temperate zone rise straight toward the sky   the branches of the bertholletia are open very long almost  entirely bare toward the base and loaded at their summits with  tufts of very close foliage  this disposition of the semi coriaceous leaves a little silvery beneath and more than two feet  long makes the branches bend down toward the ground like the  fronds of the palmtrees  the capuchin monkeys he continues are singularly fond of these  chestnuts of brazil and the noise made by the seeds when the  fruit is shaken as it fell from the tree excites their appetency in  the highest degree  he does not however believe the tale very  current on the lower oroonoco that the monkeys place themselves in  a circle and by striking the shell with a stone succeed in opening  it  that they may try is possible enough for there is no doubt i  believe that monkeysat least the south americando use stones to  crack nuts and i have seen myself a monkey untaught use a stick  to rake his food up to him when put beyond the reach of his chain   the impossibility in this case would lie not in want of wits but  want of strength and the monkeys must have too often to wait for  these feasts till the rainy season when the woody shell rots of  itself and amuse themselves meanwhile as humboldt describes them  in rolling the fruit about vainly longing to get their paws in  through the one little hole at its base  the agoutis however and  pacas and other rodents says humboldt have teeth and perseverance  to gnaw through the shell and when the seeds are once out all the  animals of the forest the monkeys the manaviris the squirrels  the agoutis the parrots the macaws hasten thither to dispute the  prey  they have all strength enough to break the woody covering of  the seeds they get out the kernel and carry it to the tops of the  trees  it is their festival also said the indians who had  returned from the nutharvest and on hearing their complaints of  the animals you perceive that they think themselves alone the  legitimate masters of the forest  but if nature has played the poor monkeys a somewhat tantalising  trick about brazil nuts she has been more generous to them in the  case of some other lecythids 229 which go by the name of monkey pots  huge trees like their kinsfolk they are clothed in bark  layers so delicate that the indians beat them out till they are as  thin as satinpaper and use them as cigarettewrappers  they carry  great urnshaped fruits big enough to serve for drinkingvessels  each kindly provided with a round wooden cover which becomes loose  and lets out the savoury sapucaya nuts inside to the comfort of all  our poor relations  ah when will there arise a tropic landseer  to draw for us some of the strange fashions of the strange birds and  beasts of these landsto draw for instance the cunning selfish  greedy grin of delight on the face of some burly hairy goitred old  red howler as he lifts off a tapa del cacao de monos a monkey cacao cover and looks defiance out of the corners of his winking  eyes at his wives and children cousins and grandchildren who sit  round jabbering and screeching and monkey fashion twisting their  heads upside down as they put their arms round each others waists  to peer over each others shoulders at the great bully who must  feed himself first as his fee for having roared to them for an hour  at sunrise on a treetop while they sat on the lower branches and  looked up trembling and delighted at the sound and fury of the  idiot sermon  what an untried world is here for the artist of every kind not  merely for the animal painter for the landscape painter for the  student of human form and attitude if he chose to live awhile among  the still untrained indians of the main or among the graceful  coolies of trinidad and demerara but also for the botanical artist  for the man who should study long and carefully the more striking  and beautiful of these wonderful leaves and stems flowers and  fruits and introduce them into ornamentation architectural or  other  and so i end my little episode about these lecythids only adding  that the reader must not confound with their nuts the butternuts  caryocar or souari which may be bought i believe at fortnum and  masons and which are of all nuts the largest and the most  delicious  they have not been found as yet in trinidad though they  abound in guiana  they are the fruit also of an enormous tree  230there is a young one fruiting finely in the botanic garden at  port of spainof a quite different order a cousin of the matapalos  and of the soapberries  it carries large threefold leaves on  pointed stalks spikes of flowers with innumerable stamens and here  and there a fruit something like the cannonball though not quite  as large  on breaking the soft rind you find it full of white meal  probably eatable and in the meal three or four great hard wrinkled  nuts rounded on one side wedgeshaped on the other which  cracked are found full of almondlike white jelly so delicious  that one can well believe travellers when they tell us that the  indian tribes wage war against each other for the possession of the  trees which bear these precious vagaries of bounteous nature  and now we began to near the village two scattered rows of clay and  timber bowers right and left of the trace each half buried in  fruittrees and vegetables and fenced in with hedges of scarlet  hibiscus the wooded mountains shading them to the south the sea  thundering behind them to the north  as we came up we heard a bell  and soon were aware of a brown mob running with somewhat mysterious  in the midst  was it the host or a funeral or a fight  soon the  mob came up with profound salutations and smiles of self satisfaction evidently thinking that they had done a fine thing  and disclosed hanging on a long bamboo their one churchbell   their old church a clay and timber thing of their own handiwork  had become ruinous and they dared not leave their bell aloft in it   but now they were going to build themselves a new and larger church  government giving them the site and the bell being on furlough  was put into requisition to ring in his excellency the governor and  his muddy and quaintly attiredor unattiredsuite  ah that i could have given a detailed picture of the scene before  the police courthousethe coloured folk of all hues of skin all  types of feature and all gay colours of dress crowding round the  tall stately brown policeman thompson called forward and receiving  with a military salute the governors commendations for having  saved at the risk of his life some shipwrecked folk out of the  surf close by and the flash of his eye when he heard that he was to  receive the humane societys medal from england and to have his  name mentioned probably to the queen herself the greetings too  of almost filial respect which were bestowed by the coloured people  on one who though still young had been to them a father who  indeed had set the policeman the example of gallantry by saving in  another cove near by other shipwrecked folk out of a still worse  surf by swimming out beyond a ledge of rock swarming with sharks  at the risk every moment of a hideous death  there as in other  places since he had worked like his elder brother at montserrat  as a true civiliser in every sense of the word and when his health  broke down from the noxious climate had moved elsewhere to still  harder and more extensive work belying like his father and his  brothers the common story that the climate forbids exertion and  that the creole gentleman cannot or will not when he has a chance  do as good work as the english gentleman at home  i do not mention  these mens names  in england it matters little in trinidad there  is no need to mention those whom all know all i shall say is  heaven send the queen many more such public servants and me many  more such friends  then up hurried the good little priest and set forth in frenchhe  was very indignant by the by at being taken for a frenchman and  begged it to be understood that he was belgian born and bred setting forth how his excellency had not been expected till next  day or he would have had ready an address from the loyal  inhabitants of blanchisseuse testifying their delight at the honour  of etc etc which he begged leave to present in due form next  day and all the while the brown crowd surged round and in and out  and the naked brown children got between every ones legs and every  one was in a fume of curiosity and delightanything being an event  in blanchisseusesave the one chinaman if i recollect right who  stood in his blue jacket and trousers his hands behind his back  with visage unimpassioned dolorous seemingly stolid a creature of  the earth earthysay rather of the dirt dirtybut doubtless by  no means as stolid as he looked  and all the while the palms and  bananas rustled above and the surf thundered and long streams of  light poured down through the glens in the black northern wall and  flooded the glossy foliage of the mangoes and sapodillas and rose  fast up the palmstems and to their very heads and then vanished  for the sun was sinking and in half an hour more darkness would  have fallen on the most remote little paradise in her majestys  dominions  but where was the warden who was by office as well as by courtesy  to have received us  he too had not expected us and was gone home  after his days work to his new clearing inland  but a man had been  sent on to him over the mountain and over the mountain we must go  and on foot too for the horses could do no more and there was no  stabling for them farther on  how far was the new clearing  oh  perhaps a couple of milesperhaps a league  and how high up  oh  nothingonly a hundred feet or two  one knew what that meant and  with a sigh resigned oneself to a four or five miles mountain walk  at the end of a long day and started up the steep zigzag through  cacao groves past the loveliest gardensi recollect in one an  agave in flower nigh thirty feet high its spike all primrose and  golden yellow in the fading sunlightthen up into rastrajo and  then into high wood and a world of fernstree ferns climbing  ferns and all other ferns which ever delighted the eye in an  english hothouse  for along these northern slopes sheltered from  the sun for the greater part of the year and for ever watered by  the steam of the tradewind ferns are far more luxuriant and varied  than in any other part of the island  soon it grew dark and we strode on up hill and down dale at one  time for a mile or more through burnt forest with its ghastly  spiderwork of leafless decaying branches and creepers against the  moonlit skya sad sight  but music enough we had to cheer us on  our way  we did not hear the howl of a monkey nor the yell of a  tigercat common enough on the mountains which lay in front of us  but of harping fiddling humming drumming croaking clacking  snoring screaming hooting from cicadas toads birds and what  not there was a concert at every step which made the glens ring  again as the brocken might ring on a walpurgisnight  at last pausing on the top of a hill we could hear voices on the  opposite side of the glen  shouts and cooeys soon brought us to  the party which were awaiting us  we hurried joyfully down a steep  hillside across a shallow ford and then up another hillsidethis  time with care for the felled logs and brushwood lay all about a  path full of stumps and we needed a guide to show us our way in the  moonlight up to the hospitable house above  and a right hospitable  house it was  its owner a french gentleman of ancient irish  familywhose ancestors probably had gone to france as one of the  valiant irish brigade whose children may have emigrated thence to  st domingo and their children or grandchildren again to trinidad had prepared for us in the wilderness a right sumptuous feast  nor  did any soul lack aught of the equal banquet  we went to bed or rather i did  for here as elsewhere before  and after i was compelled by the courtesy of the governor to  occupy the one bed of the house as being the oldest least  acclimatised and alas weakliest of the party while he his little  suite and the owner of the house slept anywhere upon the floor on  which between fatigue and enjoyment of the wild life i would have  gladly slept myself  when we turned out before sunrise next morning i found myself in  perhaps the most charming of all the charming camps of these  forests  its owner the warden fearing the unhealthy air of the  seacoast had bought some hundreds of acres up here in the hills  cleared them and built or rather was building in the midst  as  yet the house was rudimentary  a cottage of precious woods cut off  the clearing standing of course on stilts contained two rooms  an inner and an outer  there was no glass in the windows which  occupied half the walls  door or shutters to be closed if the wind  and rain were too violent are all that is needed in a climate where  the temperature changes but little day or night throughout the  year  a table unpolished like the wooden walls but like them  of some precious wood a few chairs or benches not forgetting of  course an american rockingchair a shelf or two with books of law  and medicine and beside them a few good books of devotion  a  press a perch for hanging clothesfor they mildew when kept in  drawersjust such as would have been seen in a mediaeval house in  england a covered fourpost bed with gauze curtains indispensable  for fear of vampires mosquitoes and other forest plagues these  make up the furniture of such a bachelors camp as to the man who  lives doing good work all day out of doors leaves nothing to be  desired  where is the kitchen  it consists of half a dozen great  stones under yonder shed where as good meals are cooked as in any  london kitchen  other sheds hold the servants and hangerson the  horses and mules and as the establishment grows more will be  added and the house itself will probably expand laterally like a  peripheral greek temple by rows of posts probably of palmstems  thatched over with wooden shingle or with the leaves of the timit  233 palm  if ladies come to inhabit the camp fresh rooms will be  partitioned off by boardings as high as the eaves leaving the roof  within open and common for the sake of air  soon no regular  garden but beautiful flowering shrubscrotons dracaenas and  cereuses will be planted great bushes of bauhinia and blue petraea  will roll their long curved shoots over and over each other  gardenias fill the air with fragrance and the bougainvillia or the  clerodendron cover some arbour with lilac or white racemes  but this camp had not yet arrived at so high a state of  civilisation  all round it almost up to the very doors a tangle  of logs stumps branches dead ropes and nets of liane lay still in  the process of clearing and the ground was seemingly as waste as  it was difficultoften impossibleto cross  a second glance  however showed that amongst the stumps and logs indian corn was  planted everywhere and that a few months would give a crop which  would richly repay the clearing over and above the fact that the  whole materials of the house had been cut on the spot and cost  nothing  as for the situation of the little oasis in the wilderness it  bespoke good sense and good taste  the owner had stumbled in his  forest wanderings on a spot where two mountain streams after  nearly meeting parted again and enclosed in a ring a hill some  hundred feet high before they finally joined each other below   that ring was his estate which was formally christened on the  occasion of our visit avocathe meeting of the waters a name as  all agreed full of remembrances of the old world and the land of  his remote ancestors and yet like enough to one of the graceful and  sonorous indian names of the island not to seem barbarous and out of  place  round the clearing the mountain woods surged up a thousand  feet aloft but so gradually and so far off as to allow free  circulation of air and a broad sheet of sky overhead and as the  camp stood on the highest point of the rise it did not give that  choking and crushing sensation of being in a ditch which makes  houses in most mountain valleysto me at leastintolerable  up  one glen toward the south we had a full view of the green cerro of  arima three thousand feet in height and down another to the  northeast was a great gate in the mountains through which we  could hearthough not seethe surf rolling upon the rocks three  miles away  i was woke that morning as often before and afterwards by a  clacking of stones and looking out saw in the dusk a negro  squatting and hammering with a round stone on a flat one the  coffee which we were to drink in a quarter of an hour  it was  turned into a tin saucepan put to boil over a firestick between two  more great stones clarified by some cunning island trick with a  few drops of cold water and then served up bearing in fragrance  and taste the same relation to average english coffee as fresh  things usually do to stale ones or live to dead  after which  manana and a little quinine for fear of fever we lounged about  waiting for breakfast and for the arrival of the horses from the  village  then we inspected a coolies great toe which had been severely  bitten by a vampire in the night  and here let me say that the  popular disbelief of vampire stories is only owing to english  ignorance and disinclination to believe any of the many quaint  things which john bull has not seen because he does not care to see  them  if he comes to those parts he must be careful not to leave  his feet or hands out of bed without mosquito curtains if he has  good horses he ought not to leave them exposed at night without  wiregauze round the stablesheda plan which to my surprise i  never saw used in the west indies  otherwise he will be but too  likely to find in the morning a triangular bit cut out of his own  flesh or even worse out of his horses withers or throat where  twisting and lashing cannot shake the tormentor off and must be  content to have himself lamed or his horses weakened to staggering  and thrown out of collarwork for a week as i have seen happen more  than once or twice  the only method of keeping off the vampire yet  employed in stables is light and a lamp is usually kept burning  there  but the negronot the most careful of menis apt not to  fill and trim it and if it goes out in the small hours the horses  are pretty sure to be sucked if there is a forest near  so  numerous and troublesome indeed are the vampires that there are  pastures in trinidad in which at least till the adjoining woods  were cleared the cattle would not fatten or even thrive being  found morning after morning weak and sick from the bleedings which  they had endured at night  after looking at the coolies toe of which he made light though  the bleeding from the triangular hole would not stop any more than  that from the bite of a horseleech we feasted our ears on the  notes of delicate songsters and our eyes on the colours and shapes  of the forest which rising on the opposite side of the streams  right and left could be seen here more thoroughly than at any spot  i yet visited  again and again were the operaglasses in  requisition to make out or try to make out what this or that tree  might be  here and there a norantea a mile or two miles off  showed like a whole crimson flowerbed in the treetops or a poui  just coming into flower made a spot of golden yellowa guinea  stuck against the mountainside as some one said or the head of a  palm broke the monotony of the broadleaved foliage with its huge  star of green  near us we descried several trees covered with pale yellow flowers  conspicuous enough on the hillside  no one knew what they were and  a couple of negroes who are admirable woodmen were sent off to cut  one down and see  what mattered a tree or two less amid a world of  trees  it was a quaint sightthe two stalwart black figures  struggling down over the fallen logs and with them an englishman  who thought he discerned which tree the flowers belonged to while  we at the house guided them by our shouts and scanned the trunks  through the glasses to make out in our turn which tree should be  felled from the moment that they entered under the green cloud  they of course could see little or nothing over their heads   animated were the argumentsalmost the betsas to which treetop  belonged to which treetrunk  many were the mistakes made and had  it not been for the head of a certain palm which served as a fixed  point which there was no mistaking three or four trees would have  been cut before the right one was hit upon  at last the right tree  came crashing down and a branch of the flowers was brought up to  be carried home and verified at port of spain and meanwhile  disturbed by the axestrokes pair after pair of birds flew  screaming over the treetops which looked like rooks till as they  turned in the sun their colourbrilliant even at that distance showed them to be great green parrots  after breakfastwhich among french and spanish west indians means a  solid and elaborate luncheonour party broke up    i must be  excused if i am almost prolix over the events of a day memorable to  me  the majority went down on horse and foot to blanchisseuse again on  official business  the site of the new church an address from the  inhabitants to the governor inspection of roads examination of  disputed claims squatter questions enclosure questions and so  forth would occupy some hours in hard work  but the piece de  resistance of the day was to be the examination and probable  committal of the obeahman of those parts  that worthy not being  satisfied with the official conduct of our host the warden had  advised himself to bribe with certain dollars a coolie servant of  his to put obeah upon him and had with that intent entrusted to  him a charm to be buried at his door consisting as usual of a  bottle containing toad spider rusty nails dirty water and other  terrible jumbiferous articles  in addition to which attempt on the  life and fortunes of the warden he was said to have promised the  coolie forty dollars if he would do the business thoroughly for him   now the coolie well understood what doing the business thoroughly  for an obeahman involved namely the putting brinvilliers or other  bushpoison into his food or at least administering to him sundry  dozes of ground glass in hopes of producing that dysentery of the  country which proceeds in the west indies i am sorry to say now  and then from other causes than that of climate  but having an  affection for his master and a conscience likewise though he was  but a heathen he brought the bottle straight to the intended  victim and the obeahman was now in durance vile awaiting further  examination and probably on his way to a felons cell  a sort of petition or testimonial had been sent up to the  governor composed apparently by the hapless wizard himself who  seemed to be no mean penman and signed by a dozen or more of the  coloured inhabitants  setting forth how he was known by all to be  far too virtuous a personage to dabble in that unlawful practice of  obeah of which both he and his friends testified the deepest  abhorrence  but there was the bottle safe under lock and key and  as for the testimonial those who read it said that it was not worth  the paper it was written on  most probably every one of these poor  follows had either employed the obeahman themselves to avert  thieves or evil eye from a particularly fine fruittree by hanging  up thereon a somewhat similar bottlesuch as may be seen and more  than one of them in any long days march  it was said again that  if asked by an obeahman to swear to his good character they could  not well refuse under penalty of finding some fine morning a white  cocks headsign of all supernatural plaguesin their garden path  the beak pointing to their door or an obeah bottle under their  doorstep and either brinvilliers in their pottage or such an  expectation of it and of plague and ruin to them and all their  worldly belongings in their foolish souls as would be likely  enough to kill them in a few months of simple mortal fear  here perhaps i may be allowed to tell what i know about this curious  custom of obeah or fetishworship  it appears to me on closer  examination that it is not a worship of natural objects not a  primeval worship scarcely a worship at all  but simply a system of  incantation carried on by a priesthood or rather a sorcerer class  and this being the case it seems to me unfortunate that the term  fetishworship should have been adopted by so many learned men as  the general name for the supposed primeval natureworship  the  negro does not as the primeval man is supposed to have done regard  as divine and therefore as fetish or obeah any object which  excites his imagination anything peculiarly beautiful noble or  powerful anything even which causes curiosity or fear  in fact a  fetish is no natural object at all it is a spirit an obeah jumby  duppy like the duvvels or spirits of the air which are the only  deities of which our gipsies have a conception left  that spirit  belongs to the obeah or fetishman and he puts it by magic  ceremonies into any object which he chooses  thus anything may  become obeah as far as i have ascertained  in a case which  happened very lately an obeahman came into the country put the  obeah into a fresh monkeys jawbone and made the people offer to  it fowls and plantains which of course he himself ate  such is  obeah now and such it was as may be seen by de brys plates when  the portuguese first met with it on the african coast four hundred  years ago  but surely it is an idolatry and not a natureworship  just so  does the priest of southern india after having made his idol  enchant his god into it by due ceremonial  it may be a very ancient  system  but as for its being a primeval one as neither i nor any  one else ever had the pleasure of meeting a primeval man it seems  to me somewhat rash to imagine what primeval mans creeds and  worships must have been like more rash still to conclude that they  must have been like those of the modern negro  for if as is  probable the negro is one of the most ancient varieties of the  human race if as is probable he has remainedto his great  misfortunetill the last three hundred years isolated on that vast  island of central africa which has probably continued as dry land  during ages which have seen the whole of europe and eastern and  southern asia sink more than once beneath the sea  then it is  possible and even probable that during these long ages of the  negros history creed after creed ceremonial after ceremonial may  have grown up and died out among the different tribes and that any  worship or quasiworship which may linger among the negroes now  are likely to be the mere dregs and fragments of those older  superstitions  as a fact obeah is rather to be ranked it seems to me with those  ancient eastern mysteries at once magical and profligate which  troubled society and morals in later rome when   in tiberim defluxit orontes   if so we shall not be surprised to find that a very important  indeed the most practically important element of obeah is  poisoning  this habit of poisoning has not as one might well  suppose sprung up among the slaves desirous of revenge against  their white masters  it has been imported like the rest of the  system from africa  travellers of late have told us enoughand  too much for our comfort of mindof that prevailing dread of poison  as well as of magic which urges the african negroes to deeds of  horrible cruelty and the fact that these african negroes up to the  very latest importations are the special practisers of obeah is  notorious through the west indies  the existence of this trick of  poisoning is denied often enough  sometimes europeans willing to  believe the best of their fellowmenand who shall blame them simply disbelieve it because it is unpleasant to believe   sometimes again white west indians will deny it and the existence  of obeah beside simply because they believe in it a little too  much and are afraid of the negroes knowing that they believe in it   not two generations ago there might be found up and down the  islands respectable white men and women who had the same half belief in the powers of an obeahman as our own ancestors  especially in the highlands and in devonshire had in those of  witches  while as to poisoning it was in some islands a matter  on which the less said the safer  it was but a few years ago that  in a west indian city an old and faithful free servant in a family  well known to me astonished her master on her deathbed by a  voluntary confession of more than a dozen murders  you remember such and such a party when every one was ill  well  i put something in the soup  as another instance a woman who died respectable a christian and a  communicant told this to her clergymanshe had lived from youth  for many years happily and faithfully with a white gentleman who  considered her as his wife  she saw him pine away and die from slow  poison administered she knew by another woman whom he had  wronged  but she dared not speak  she had not courage enough to be  poisoned herself likewise  it is easy to conceive the terrorism and the exactions in the shape  of fowls plantains rum and so forth which are at the command of  an obeah practitioner who is believed by the negro to be  invulnerable himself while he is both able and willing to destroy  them  nothing but the strong arm of english law can put down the  sorcerer and that seldom enough owing to the poor folks dread of  giving evidence  thus a woman madame phyllis by name ruled in a  certain foresthamlet of trinidad  like deborah of old she sat  under her own palmtree and judged her little israelby the  devils law instead of gods  her murders or supposed murders  were notorious  but no evidence could be obtained madame phyllis  dealt in poisons charms and philtres and waxed fat on her trade  for many a year  the first shock her reputation received was from a  friend of mine who in his government duty planned out a road  which ran somewhat nearer her dwelling than was pleasant or safe for  her privacy  she came out denouncing threatening  the coloured  workmen dared not proceed  my friend persevered coolly and madame  finding that the government official considered himself obeahproof  tried to bribe him off with the foolish cunning of a savage with a  present ofbottled beer  to the horror of his workmen he  acceptedfor the day was hot as usuala single bottle and drank  it there and then  the negroes lookedlike the honest maltese at  st paulwhen he should have swollen or fallen down dead  suddenly  but nothing happened and they went on with their work  secure under a leader whom even madame phyllis dared not poison   but he ran a great risk and knew it  i took care said he to see that the cork had not been drawn and  put back again and then to draw it myself  at last madame phylliss cup was full and she fell into the snare  which she had set for others  for a certain coloured policeman went  off to her one night and having poured out his lovelorn heart and  the agonies which he endured from the cruelty of a neighbouring  fair he begged for got and paid for a philtre to win her  affections  on which saying with dantonque mon nom soit fletri  mais que la patrie soit libre he carried the philtre to the  magistrate laid his information and madame phyllis and her male  accomplice were sent to gaol as rogues and impostors  her coloured victims looked on aghast at the audacity of english  lawyers  but when they found that madame was actually going to  prison they rosejust as if they had been french republicans deposed their despot after she had been taken prisoner sacked her  magic castle and levelled it with the ground  whether they did or  did not find skeletons of children buried under the floor or what  they found at all i could not discover and should be very careful  how i believed any statement about the matter  but what they wanted  specially to find was the skeleton of a certain rival obeahman who  having some years before rashly challenged madame to a trial of  skill had gone to visit her one night and never left her cottage  again  the chief centre of this detestable system is st vincent whereso  i was told by one who knows that island wellsome sort of secret  college or school of the prophets diabolic exists  its emissaries  spread over the islands fattening themselves at the expense of  their dupes and exercising no small political authority which has  been ere now and may be again dangerous to society  in jamaica i  was assured by a nonconformist missionary who had long lived there  obeah is by no means on the decrease and in hayti it is probably on  the increase and takingat least until the fall and death of  salnaveshapes which when made public in the civilised world will  excite more than mere disgust  but of hayti i shall be silent  having heard more of the state of society in that unhappy place than  it is prudent for the sake of the few white residents to tell at  present  the same missionary told me that in sierra leone also obeah and  poisoning go hand in hand  arriving home one night he said with  two friends he heard hideous screams from the house of a portuguese  negro a known obeahman  fearing that murder was being done they  burst open his door and found that he had tied up his wife hand and  foot and was flogging her horribly  they cut the poor creature  down and placed her in safety  a day or two after the missionarys servant came in at sunrise with  a mysterious air  you no go out just now massa  there was something in the road  but what he would not tell  my  friend went out of course in spite of the faithful fellows  entreaties and found as he expected a bottle containing the usual  charms and round itsight of horror to all negroes of the old  schoolthree white cocks headsan old remnant it is said of a  worship de quo sileat musapointing their beaks one to his door  one to the door of each of his friends  he picked them up  laughing and threw them away to the horror of his servant  but the obeahman was not so easily beaten  in a few days the  servant came in again with a wise visage  you no drink a milk today massa  why not  oh perhaps something bad in it  you give it a cat  but i dont want to poison the cat  oh dere a strange cat in a stable me give it her  he did so and the cat was dead in half an hour  again the fellow tried watching when the three white men as was  their custom should dine together that he might poison them all   and again the black servant foiled him though afraid to accuse him  openly  this time it wasyou no drink a water in a filter  and  when the filter was searched it was full of poisonleaves  a third attempt the rascal made with no more success and then  vanished from sierra leone consideringas the obeahmen in the  west indies are said to hold of the catholic prieststhat buccra  padres obeah was too strong for his obeah  i know not how true the prevailing belief is that some of these  obeahmen carry a drop of snakes poison under a sharpened finger nail a scratch from which is death  a similar story was told to  humboldt of a tribe of indians on the orinoco and the thing is  possible enough  one story which seemingly corroborates it i  heard so curiously illustrative of negro manners in trinidad during  the last generation that i shall give it at length  i owe itas i  do many curious factsto the kindness of mr lionel fraser chief  of police of the port of spain to whom it was told as it here  stands by the late mr r stipendiary magistrate himself a  creole and a man of colour  when i was a lad of about seventeen years of age i was very  frequently on a sugarestate belonging to a relation of mine and  during croptime particularly i took good care to be there  owing to my connection with the owner of the estate i naturally  had some authority with the people and i did my best to preserve  order amongst them particularly in the boilinghouse where there  used to be a good deal of petty theft especially at night for we  had not then the powerful machinery which enables the planter to  commence his grinding late and finish it early  there was one african on the estate who was the terror of the  negroes owing to his reputed supernatural powers as an obeahman  this man whom i will call martin was a tall powerful negro who  even apart from the mysterious powers with which he was supposed to  be invested was a formidable opponent from his mere size and  strength  i very soon found that martin was determined to try his authority  and influence against mine and i resolved to give him the earliest  possible opportunity for doing so  i remember the occasion when we first came into contact perfectly  well  it was a saturday night and we were boiling off  the  boilinghouse was but very dimly lighted by two murky oillamps the  rays from which could scarcely penetrate through the dense  atmosphere of steam which rose from the seething coppers   occasionally a bright glow from the furnacemouths lighted up the  scene for a single instant only to leave it the next moment darker  than ever  it was during one of these flashes of light that i distinctly saw  martin deliberately filling a large tin pan with sugar from one of  the coolers  i called out to him to desist but he never deigned to take the  slightest notice of me  i repeated my order in a louder and more  angry tone whereupon he turned his eyes upon me and said in a  most contemptuous tone chut ti beque  quitte moue tranquille ou  tende sinon malheur ka rive ou  pshaw little white boy  leave  me alone or worse will happen to you  it was the tone more than the words themselves that enraged me and  without for one moment reflecting on the great disparity between us  i made a spring from the sort of raised platform on which i stood  and snatching the panful of sugar from his hand i flung it sugar  and all into the tache from which i knew nothing short of a  miracle could recover it  for a moment only did martin hesitate and then after fumbling for  one instant with his right hand in his girdle he made a rush at me   fortunately for me i was prepared and springing back to the spot  where i had before been standing i took up a light cutlass which i  always carried about with me and stood on the defensive  i had however no occasion to use the weapon for in running  towards me martins foot slipped in some molasses which had been  spilt on the ground and he fell heavily to the floor striking his  head against the corner of one of the large wooden sugarcoolers  the blow stunned him for the time and before he recovered i had  left the boilinghouse  the next day to my surprise i found him excessively civil and  almost obsequious  but i noticed that he had taken a violent  dislike to our head overseer whom i shall call jean marie and whom  he seemed to suspect as the person who had betrayed him to me when  stealing the sugar  things went on pretty quietly for some weeks till the crop was  nearly over  one afternoon jean marie told me there was to be a jumbydance  amongst the africans on the estate that very night  now jumby dances were even then becoming less frequent and i was extremely  anxious to see one and after a good deal of difficulty i succeeded  in persuading jean marie to accompany me to the hut wherein it was  to be held  it was a miserable kind of an ajoupa near the riverside and we  had some difficulty in making our way to it through the tangled dank  grass and brushwood which surrounded it  nor was the journey  rendered more pleasant by the constant rustling among this  undergrowth that reminded us that there were such things as snakes  and other ugly creatures to be met with on our road  curiosity however urged us on and at length we reached the  ajoupa which was built on a small open space near the river  beneath a gigantic silkcotton tree  here we found assembled some thirty africans men and women very  scantily dressed and with necklaces of beads sharks teeth dried  frogs etc hung round their necks  they were all squatted on  their haunches outside the hut apparently waiting for a signal to  go in  they did not seem particularly pleased at seeing us and one of the  men said something in african apparently addressed to some one  inside the house for an instant after the door was flung open and  martin almost naked and with his body painted to represent a  skeleton stalked forth to meet us  he asked us very angrily what we wanted there and seemed  particularly annoyed at seeing jean marie  however on my repeated  assurances that we only came to see what was going on he at last  consented to our remaining to see the dance only cautioning us that  we must keep perfect silence and that a word much more a laugh  would entail most serious consequences  as long as i live i shall never forget that scene  the hut was  lighted by some eight or ten candles or lamps and in the centre  dimly visible was a fetish somewhat of the appearance of a man  but with the head of a cock  everything that the coarsest fancy  could invent had been done to make this image horrible and yet it  appeared to be the object of special adoration to the devotees  assembled  jean marie to be out of the way clambered on to one of the cross beams that supported the roof whilst i leaned against the side  wall as near as i could get to the aperture that served for a  window to avoid the smells which were overpowering  martin took his seat astride of an african tomtom or drum and i  noticed at the time that jean maries naked foot hung down from the  crossbeam almost directly over martins head  martin now began to chant a monotonous african song accompanying  with the tomtom  gradually he began to quicken the measure quicker went the words  quicker beat the drum and suddenly one of the women sprang into the  open space in front of the fetish  round and round she went  keeping admirable time with the music  quicker still went the drum  and now the whole of the womans body  seemed electrified by it and as if catching the infection a man  now joined her in the mad dance  couple after couple entered the  arena and a true sorcerers sabbath began while light after light  was extinguished till at last but one remained by whose dim ray i  could just perceive the faint outlines of the remaining persons  at this moment from some cause or other jean marie burst into a  loud laugh  instantly the drum stopped and i distinctly saw martin raise his  right hand and as it appeared to me seize jean maries naked foot  between his finger and thumb  as he did so jean marie with a terrible scream which i shall  never forget fell to the ground in strong convulsions  we succeeded in getting him outside  but he never spoke again and  died two hours afterwards his body having swollen up like that of a  drowned man  in those days there were no inquests and but little interest was  created by the affair  martin himself soon after died  but enough of these abominations of which i am forced to omit the  worst  that dayto go on with my own storyi left the rest of the party  to go down to the courthouse while i stayed at the camp sorry to  lose so curious a scene but too tired to face a crowded tropic  court and an atmosphere of perspiration and perjury  moreover that had befallen me which might never befall me againi  had a chance of being alone in the forests and into them i would  wander and meditate on them in silence  so when all had departed i lounged awhile in the rockingchair  watching two negroes astride on the roof of a shed on which they  were nailing shingles  their heads were bare the sun was intense  the roof on which they sat must have been of the temperature of an  average fryingpan on an english fire  but the good fellows worked  on steadily and carefully though not fast chattering and singing  evidently enjoying the very act of living and fattening in the  genial heat  lucky dogs  who had probably never known hunger  certainly never known cold never known possibly a single animal  want which they could not satisfy  i could not but compare their  lot with that of an average english artisan  ah well  there is no  use in fruitless comparisons and it is no reason that one should  grudge the negro what he has because others who deserve it  certainly as much as he have it not  after all the ancestors of  these negroes have been for centuries past so hardworked ill fed illused toosometimes worse than illusedthat it is hard if  the descendants may not have a holiday and take the world easy for  a generation or two  the perpetual saturnalia in which the negro in trinidad at least  lives will surely give physical strength and health to the body  and something of cheerfulness selfhelp independence to the  spirit  if the saturnalia be prolonged too far and run as they  seem inclined to run into brutality and licence those stern laws  of nature which men call political economy will pull the negro up  short and waken him out of his dream soon enough and sharply  enougha judgment by which the wise will profit and be preserved  while the fools only will be destroyed  and meanwhile what if in  these saturnalia as in rome of old the new sense of independence  manifests itself in somewhat of selfassertion and rudeness often  in insolence especially disagreeable because deliberate  what if  you call me black fellow  i mash you white face in were the  first words one heard at st thomass from a negro on being asked  civilly enough by a sailor to cast off from a boat to which he had  no right to be holding on  what if a negro now and then addresses  you as simple buccra while he expects you to call him sir or  if a negro woman on being begged by an english lady to call to  another negro woman answers at last after long pretences not to  hear you coloured lady you hear dis white woman a wanting of  you  let it be  we white people bullied these black people quite  enough for three hundred years to be able to allow them to play  for it is no more at bullying us  as long as the negroes are  decently loyal and peaceable and do not murder their magistrates  and drink their brains mixed with rum nor send delegates to the  president of hayti to ask if he will assist them in case of a  general rising to exterminate the whitestricks which the harmless  negroes of trinidad to do them justice never have played or had a  thought of playingwe must remember that we are very seriously in  debt to the negro and must allow him to take out instalments of his  debt now and then in his own fashion  after all we brought him  here and we have no right to complain of our own work  if like  frankenstein we have tried to make a man and made him badly we  must like frankenstein pay the penalty  so much for the negro  as for the coloured populationespecially  the educated and civilised coloured population of the townsthey  stand to us in an altogether different relation  they claim to be  and are our kinsfolk on another ground than that of common  humanity  we are bound to them by a tie more sacred i had almost  said more stern than we are to the mere negro  they claim and  justly to be considered as our kinsfolk and equals and i believe  from what i have seen of them that they will prove themselves such  whenever they are treated as they are in trinidad  what faults some  of them have proceed mainly from a not dishonourable ambition  mixed with uncertainty of their own position  let them be made to  feel that they are now not a class to forget if possible that  they ever were one  let any allusion to the painful past be  treated not merely as an offence against good manners but as what  it practically is an offence against the british government and  that government will find in them i believe loyal citizens and  able servants  but to go back to the forest  i sauntered forth with cutlass and  collectingbox careless whither i went and careless of what i saw  for everything that i could see would be worth seeing  i know not  that i found many rare or new things that day  i recollect amid  the endless variety of objects filmferns of various delicate  species some growing in the moss treetrunks some clasping the  trunk itself by horizontal lateral fronds while the main rachis  climbed straight up many feet thus embracing the stem in a network  of semitransparent green guipure lace  i recollect too a coarse  low fern 245 on streamgravel which was remarkable because its  stem was set with thick green prickles  i recollect too a dead  giant tree the ruins of which struck me with awe  the stump stood  some thirty feet high crumbling into tinder and dust though its  death was so recent that the creepers and parasites had not yet had  time to lay hold of it and around its great spurroots lay what had  been its trunk and head piled in stacks of rotten wood over which  i scrambled with some caution for fear my leg on breaking through  might be saluted from the inside by some deadly snake  the only  sign of animal life however i found about the tree save a few  millipedes and land snails were some lizardeggs in a crack about  the size of those of a hummingbird  i scrambled down on gravelly beaches and gazed up the green avenues  of the brooks  i sat amid the balisiers and aroumas above still  blue pools bridged by huge fallen trunks or with wild pines of  half a dozen kinds set in rows  i watched the shoals of fish play  in and out of the black logs at the bottom  i gave myself up to the  simple enjoyment of looking careless of what i looked at or what i  thought about it all  there are times when the mind like the body  had best feed gorge if you will and leave the digestion of its  food to the unconscious alchemy of nature  it is as unwise to be  always saying to oneself into what pigeonhole of my brain ought i  to put this fact and what conclusion ought i to draw from it as  to ask your teeth how they intend to chew and your gastric juice  how it intends to convert your three courses and a dessert into  chyle  whether on a scotch moor or in a tropic forest it is well  at times to have full faith in nature to resign yourself to her as  a child upon a holiday to be still and let her speak  she knows  best what to say  and yet i could not altogether do it that day  there was one class  of objects in the forest which i had set my heart on examining with  all my eyes and soul and after a while i scrambled and hewed my  way to them and was well repaid for a quarter of an hours very  hard work  i had remarked from the camp palms unlike any i had seen before  starring the opposite forest with pale graygreen leaves  long and  earnestly i had scanned them through the glasses  now was the time  to see them close and from beneath  i soon guessed and rightly  that i was looking at that palma de jagua 246 which excitedand  no wonderthe enthusiasm of the usually unimpassioned humboldt   magnificent as the tree is when its radiating leaves are viewed from  above it is even more magnificent when you stand beneath it  the  stem like that of the coconut usually curves the height of a man  ere it rises in a shaft for fifty or sixty feet more  from the  summit of that shaft springs a crowni had rather say a fountain of pinnated leaves only eight or ten of them but fiveandtwenty  feet long each  for threefourths of their length they rise at an  angle of 45 degrees or more for the last fourth they fall over  till the point hangs straight down and each leaflet which is about  two feet and a half long falls over in a similar curve completing  the likeness of the whole to a fountain of water or a gush of  rockets  i stood and looked up watching the innumerable curled  leaflets pale green above and silvergray below shiver and rattle  amid the denser foliage of the broadleaved trees and then went on  to another and to another to stare up again and enjoy the mere  shape of the most beautiful plant i had ever beheld excepting  always the musa ensete from abyssinia in the palmhouse at kew   truly spoke humboldt of this or a closely allied species nature  has lavished every beauty of form on the jagua palm  but here as elsewhere to my great regret i looked in vain for that  famous and beautiful tree the piriajo 247 or peach palm which  is described in mr batess book vol ii p 218 under the name of  pupunha  it grows here and there in the island and always marks  the site of an ancient indian settlement  this is probable enough  for it grows says mr bates wild nowhere on the amazons  it is  one of those few vegetable productions including three kinds of  manioc and the american species of banana which the indians have  cultivated from time immemorial and brought with them in their  original migration to brazil  from whence  it has never yet been  found wild its native home may possibly mr bates thinks be in  some still unexplored tract on the eastern slopes of the aequatorial  andes  possibly so  and possibly again on tracts long sunk  beneath the sea  he describes the tree as a noble ornament from  fifty to sixty feet in height and often as straight as a scaffold pole  the taste of the fruit may be compared to a mixture of  chestnuts and cheese  vultures devour it greedily and come in  quarrelsome flocks to the trees when it is ripe  dogs will also eat  it  i do not recollect seeing cats do the same though they will go  into the woods to eat tucuma another kind of palm fruit  it is only the more advanced tribes says mr bates who have  kept up the cultivation     bunches of sterile or seedless  fruitsa mark of very long cultivation as in the case of the  plantainoccur    it is one of the principal articles of food  at ega when in season and is boiled and eaten with treacle or salt   a dozen of the seedless fruits make a good nourishing meal for a  fullgrown person  it is the general belief that there is more  nutriment in pupunha than in fish or vacca marina manati  my friend mr bates will i am sure excuse my borrowing so much  from him about a tree which must be as significant in his eyes as it  is in mine  so passed many hours till i began to be tired ofi may almost say  pained bythe appalling silence and loneliness and i was glad to  get back to a point where i could hear the click of the axes in the  clearing  i welcomed it just as after a long night on a calm sea  when one nears the harbour again one welcomes the sound of the  childrens voices and the stir of life about the quay as a relief  from the utter blank and feels oneself no longer a bubble afloat on  an infinity which knows one not and cares nothing for ones  existence  for in the dead stillness of midday when not only the  deer and the agoutis and the armadillos but the birds and insects  likewise are all asleep the crack of a falling branch was all that  struck my ear as i tried in vain to verify the truth of that  beautiful passage of humboldtstrue doubtless in other forests  or for ears more acute than mine  in the midday he says 248a  the larger animals seek shelter in the recesses of the forest and  the birds hide themselves under the thick foliage of the trees or  in the clefts of the rocks  but if in this apparent entire  stillness of nature one listens for the faintest tones which an  attentive ear can seize there is perceived an allpervading  rustling sound a humming and fluttering of insects close to the  ground and in the lower strata of the atmosphere  everything  announces a world of organic activity and life  in every bush in  the cracked bark of the trees in the earth undermined by  hymenopterous insects life stirs audibly  it is as it were one  of the many voices of nature and can only be heard by the sensitive  and reverent ear of her true votaries  be not too severe great master  a mans ear may be reverent  enough  but you must forgive its not being sensitive while it is  recovering from that most deafening of plagues a tropic cold in the  head  would that i had space to tell at length of our long and delightful  journey back the next day which lay for several miles along the  path by which we came and then after we had looked down once more  on the exquisite bay of fillette kept along the northern wall of  the mountains instead of turning up to the slope which we came over  out of caura  for miles we paced a mulepath narrow but well  keptas it had need to be for a fall would have involved a roll  into green abysses from which we should probably not have  reascended  again the surf rolled softly far below and here and  there a vista through the trees showed us some view of the sea and  woodlands almost as beautiful as that at fillette  ever and anon  some fresh valuable tree or plant wasting in the wilderness was  pointed out  more than once we became aware of a keen and dreadful  scent as of a concentrated essence of unwashed tropic humanity  which proceeded from that strange animal the porcupine with a  prehensile tail 248b who prowls in the treetops all night and  sleeps in them all day spending his idle hours in making this  hideous smell  probably he or his ancestors have found it pay as a  protection for no jaguar or tigercat it is to be presumed would  care to meddle with anything so exquisitely nasty especially when  it is all over sharp prickles  oncei should know the spot again among a thousandwhere we  scrambled over a stony brook just like one in a devonshire wood the  boulders and the little pools between them swarmed with things like  scarlet and orange fingers or sticks of sealingwax which we  recognised and looking up saw a magnificent bois chataigne  249apachira as the indians call itlike a great horse chestnut spreading its heavy boughs overhead  and these were the  fallen petals of its lastnights crop of flowers which had opened  there under the moonlight unseen and alone  unseen and alone   how do we know that  then we emerged upon a beach the very perfection of typical tropic  shore with little rocky coves from one to another of which we had  to ride through rolling surf beneath the welcome shade of low  shrubfringed cliffs while over the little mangroveswamp at the  mouth of the glen tocuche rose sheer like mgillicuddys reeks  transfigured into one huge emerald  we turned inland again and stopped for luncheon at a clear brook  running through a grove of cacao and bois immortelles  we sat  beneath the shade of a huge bamboo clump cut ourselves pintstoups  out of the joints and then like great boys got some of us at  least very wet in fruitless attempts to catch a huge crayfish nigh  eighteen inches long blue and gray and of a shape something  between a gnat and a spider who with a wife and child had taken  up his abode in a pool among the spurs of a great bois immortelle   however he was too nimble for us and we went on and inland once  more luckily not leaving our bamboo stoups behind  we descended i remember to the seashore again at a certain  maraccas bay and had a long ride along bright sands between surf  and scrub in which ride by the by the civiliser of montserrat and  i to avoid the blinding glare of the sand rode along the firm sand  between the sea and the lagoon through the low wood of shore grape  and mahaut pinguin and swamp seguine 249bwhich last is an arum  with a knotted stem from three to twelve feet high  we brushed our  way along with our cutlasses as we sat on our saddles enjoying the  cool shade till my companions mule found herself jammed tight in  scrub and unable to forge either ahead or astern  her rider was  jammed too and unable to get off and the two had to be cut out of  the bush by fair hewing amid much laughter while the wise old  mule as the cutlasses flashed close to her nose never moved a  muscle perfectly well aware of what had happened and how she was  to be got out of the scrape as she had been probably fifty times  before  we stopped at the end of the long beach thoroughly tired and  hungry for we had been on the march many hours and discovered for  the first time that we had nothing left to eat  luckily a certain  little pot of ramornie essence of soup was recollected and brought  out  the kettle was boiling in five minutes and half a teaspoonful  per man of the essence put on a knifes point and stirred with a  cutlass to the astonishment of the grinning and unbelieving  negroes who were told that we were going to make obeah soup and  were more than half of that opinion themselves  meanwhile i saw  the wise mule led up into the bush and on asking its owner why  was told that she was to be fedon what i could not see  but  much to my amusement he cut down a quantity of the young leaves of  the cocorite palm and she began to eat them greedily as did my  policehorse  and when the bamboo stoups were brought out and  threequarters of a pint of good soup was served roundnot  forgetting the negroes one of whom after sucking it down rubbed  his stomach and declared with a grin that it was very good obeah the oddness of the scene came over me  the blazing beach the  misty mountains the hot tradewind the fantastic leaves overhead  the black limbs and faces the horses eating palmleaves and we  sitting on logs among the strange ungainly montrichardias drinking  ramornie out of bamboo washing it down with milk from green  coconutswas this too a scene in a pantomime  would it too  vanish if one only shut ones eyes and shook ones head  we turned up into the loveliest green trace where i know not how  the mountain vegetation had some of it come down to the sealevel   nowhere did i see the melastomas more luxuriant and among them  arching over our heads like parasols of green lace between us and  the sky were tall treeferns as fine as those on the mountain  slopes  in front of us opened a flat meadow of a few acres and beyond it  spur upon spur rose a noble mountain in so steep a wall that it  was difficult to see how we were to ascend  ere we got to the mountain foot some of our party had nigh come to  grief  for across the savanna wandered a deep lagoon brook  the  only bridge had been washed away by rains and we had to get the  horses through as we could all but swimming them two men on each  horse and then to drive the poor creatures back for a fresh double  load with fallings splashings much laughter and a qualm or two  at the recollection that there might be unpleasant animals in the  water  electric eels happily were not invented at the time when  trinidad parted from the main or at least had not spread so far  east  but alligators had been by that time fully developed and had  arrived here in plenty and to be laid hold of by one would have  been undesirable though our party was strong enough to have made  very short work with the monster  so over we got and through much mud and up mountains some fifteen  hundred feet high on which the vegetation was even richer than any  we had seen before and down the other side with the great lowland  and the gulf of paria opening before us  we rested at a police stationalways a pleasant sight in trinidad for the sake of the  stalwart soldierlike brown policemen and their buxom wives and  neat houses and gardens a focus of discipline and civilisation amid  what would otherwise relapse too soon into anarchy and barbarism we  whiled away the time by inspecting the ward police reports which  were kept as neatly and worded as well as they would have been in  england and then rolled comfortably in the carriage down to port of  spain tired and happy after three such days as had made old blood  and old brains young again    chapter xii  the savanna of aripo    the last of my pleasant rides and one which would have been perhaps  the pleasantest of all had i had as on other occasions the  company of my host was to the cocal or cocopalm grove of the  east coast taking on my way the savanna of aripo  it had been our  wish to go up the orinoco as far as ciudad bolivar the angostura  of humboldts travels to see the new capital of southern  venezuela fast rising into wealth and importance under the wise and  pacific policy of its president senor dalla costa a man said to  possess a genius and an integrity far superior to the average of  south american republicansof which latter the less said the  better to push back if possible across those llanos which  humboldt describes in his personal narrative vol iv p 295 it  may be to visit the falls of the caroni  but that had to be done by  others after we were gone  my days in the island were growing  short and the most i could do was to see at aripo a small specimen  of that peculiar savanna vegetation which occupies thousands of  square miles on the mainland  if therefore the reader cares nothing for botanical and geological  speculations he will be wise to skip this chapter  but those who  are interested in the vast changes of level and distribution of land  which have taken place all over the world since the present forms of  animals and vegetables were established on it may possibly find a  valuable fact or two in what i thought i saw at the savanna of  aripo  my first point was of course the little city of san josef  to an  englishman the place will be always interesting as the scene of  raleighs exploit and the capture of berreos and to one who has  received the kindness which i have received from the spanish  gentlemen of the neighbourhood a spot full of most grateful  memories  it lies pleasantly enough on a rise at the southern foot  of the mountains and at the mouth of a torrent which comes down  from the famous chorro or waterfall of maraccas  in going up to  that waterfall just at the back of the town i found buried in  several feet of earth a great number of seemingly recent but very  ancient shells  whether they be remnants of an elevated seabeach  or of some indian kitchenmidden i dare not decide  but the  question is well worth the attention of any geologist who may go  that way  the waterfall and the road up to it are best described  by one who after fourteen years of hard scientific work in the  island now lies lonely in san fernando churchyard far from his  beloved fatherlandhe or at least all of him that could die  i  wonder whether that of him which can never die knows what his  fatherland is doing now  but to the waterfall of maraccas or  rather to poor dr kruegers description of it  the northern chain of mountains covered nearly everywhere with  dense forests is intersected at various angles by numbers of  valleys presenting the most lovely character  generally each valley  is watered by a silvery stream tumbling here and there over rocks  and natural dams ministering in a continuous rain to the strange looking rivercanes dumbcanes and balisiers that voluptuously  bend their heads to the drizzly shower which plays incessantly on  their glistening leaves off which the globules roll in a thousand  pearls as from the glossy plumage of a stately swan  one of these falls deserves particular noticethe cascade of  maraccasin the valley of that name  the high road leads up the  valley a few miles over hills and along the windings of the river  exhibiting the varying scenery of our mountain district in the  fairest style  there on the riverside you may admire the  gigantic peppertrees or the silvery leaves of the calathea the  lofty bamboo or the fragrant pothos the curious cyclanthus or  frowning nettles some of the latter from ten to twelve feet high   but how to describe the numberless treasures which everywhere strike  the eye of the wandering naturalist  to reach the chorro or cascade you strike to the right into a  path that brings you first to a cacao plantation through a few  rice or maize fields and then you enter the shade of the virgin  forest  thousands of interesting objects now attract your  attention  here the wonderful norantea or the resplendent  calycophyllum a tabernaemontana or a faramea filling the air afar  off with the fragrance of their blossoms there a graceful  heliconia winking at you from out some dark ravine  that shrubbery  above is composed of a species of boehmeria or ardisia and that  scarlet flower belongs to our native aphelandra  in the rear are  one or two philodendronsdisagreeable guests for their smell is  bad enough and they blister when imprudently touched  there also  you may see a treefern though a small one  nearer to us and low  down beneath our feet that rich panicle of flowers belongs to a  begonia and here also is an assemblage of ferns of the genera  asplenium hymenophyllum and trichomanes as well as of hepaticae  and mosses  but what are those yellow and purple flowers hanging  above our heads  they are bignonias and mucunascreepers straying  from afar which have selected this spot where they may under the  influence of the suns beams propagate their race  those chain like fantastic strangelooking lianes resembling a family of  boas are bauhinias and beyond through the opening you see in the  abandoned ground of some squatters garden the trumpettree  cecropia and the groogroo the characteristic plants of the  rastrajo  now let us proceed on our walk we mean the cascadehere it is  opposite to you a grand spectacle indeed  from a perpendicular  wall of solid rock of more than three hundred feet down rushes a  stream of water splitting in the air and producing a constant  shower which renders this lovely spot singularly and deliciously  cool  nearly the whole extent of this natural wall is covered with  plants among which you can easily discern numbers of ferns and  mosses two species of pitcairnia with beautiful red flowers some  aroids various nettles and here and there a begonia  how  different such a spot would look in cold europe  below in the  midst of a neverfailing drizzle grow luxuriant ardisias aroids  ferns costas heliconias centropogons hydrocotyles cyperoids  and grasses of various genera tradescantias and commelynas  billbergias and occasionally a few small rubiaceae and  melastomaceae  the cascade when i saw it was somewhat disfigured above and below   above the forestfires of last year had swept the edge of the  cliff and had even crawled halfway down leaving blackened rocks  and gray stems and below loyal zeal had cut away only too much of  the rich vegetation to make a shed or stable in anticipation of a  visit from the duke of edinburgh who did not come  a year or two  however in this climate will heal these temporary scars and all  will be as luxuriant as ever  indeed such scars heal only too fast  here  for the paths become impassable from brush and weeds every  six months and have to be cutlassed out afresh and when it was  known that we were going up to the waterfall a gang had to be set  to work to save the lady of the party being wetted through by leaf dew up to her shoulders as she sat upon her horse  pretty it was a bit out of an older and more simple worldto see the yeoman gentleman who had contracted for the mending of the road and who  counts among his ancestors the famous ponce de leon meeting us  halfway on our return dressed more simply and probably much  poorer than an average english yeoman  but keeping untainted the  stately castilian courtesy as with hat in handi hope i need not  say that my hat was at my saddlebow all the whilehe inquired  whether la senorita had found the path free from all obstructions  and so forth   the old order changes giving place to the new lest one good custom should corrupt the world   but when two hundred years hence there are no more such gentlemen  of the old school left in the world what higher form of true  civilisation shall we have invented to put in its place  none as  yet  all our best civilisation in every class is derived from  that from the true self respect which is founded on respect for  others  from san josef i was taken on in the carriage of a spanish  gentleman through arima a large village where an indian colony  makes those baskets and other wares from the aroumaleaf for which  trinidad is noted and on to his estate at guanapo a pleasant  lowland place with wide plantations of cacao only fourteen years  old but in full and most profitable bearing rich meadows with huge  clumps of bamboo and a roomy timberhouse beautifully thatched  with palm which serves as a retreat in the dry season for him and  his ladies when baked out of dusty san josef  on my way there by  the by i espied and gathered for the first and last time a flower  very dear to mea crimson passion flower rambling wild over the  bush  when we arrived the sun was still so high in heaven that the kind  owner offered to push on that very afternoon to the savanna of  aripo some five miles off  policehorses had arrived from arima  in one of which i recognised my trusty old brown cob of the northern  mountains and laid hands on him at once and away three or four of  us went the squire leading the way on his mule with cutlass and  umbrella both needful enough  we went along a sandy high road bordered by a vegetation new to me   low trees with wiry branches and shining evergreen leaves which  belonged i was told principally to the myrtle tribe were  overtopped by jagua palms and packed below with pinguins with wild  pineapples whose rose and purple flowerheads were very beautiful  and with a species of palm of which i had often heard but which i  had never seen before at least in any abundance namely the timit  256a the leaves of which are used as thatch  a low tree seldom  rising more than twenty or thirty feet it throws out wedge shaped  leaves some ten or twelve feet long sometimes all but entire  sometimes irregularly pinnate because the space between the  straight and parallel side nerves has not been filled up  these  flat wedgeshaped sheets often six feet across and the oblong  pinnae some three feet long by six inches to a foot in breadth  make admirable thatch and on emergency as we often saw that day  good umbrellas  bundles of them lay along the roadside tied up  ready for carrying away and each negro or negress whom we passed  carried a timitleaf and hooked it on to his head when a gush of  rain came down  after a while we turned off the high road into a forest path which  was sound enough the soil being one sheet of poor sand and white  quartz gravel which would in scotland or even devonshire have  carried nothing taller than heath but was here covered with  impenetrable jungle  the luxuriance of this jungle be it  remembered must not delude a stranger as it has too many ere now  into fancying that the land would be profitable under cultivation   as long as the soil is shaded and kept damp it will bear an  abundant crop of woody fibre which composed almost entirely of  carbon and water drains hardly any mineral constituents from the  soil  but if that jungle be once cleared off the slow and careful  work of ages has been undone in a moment  the burning sun bakers up  everything and the soil having no mineral staple wherewith to  support a fresh crop if planted is reduced to aridity and sterility  for years to come  timber therefore i believe and timber only  is the proper crop for these poor soils unless medicinal or  otherwise useful trees should be discovered hereafter worth the  planting  to thin out the useless timbersbut cautiously for fear  of letting in the suns raysand to replace them by young plants of  useful timbers is all that government can do with the poorer bits  of these crown lands beyond protecting as it does now to the best  of its power the natural crop of timitleaves from waste and  destruction  so much it ought to do and so much it can and will do  in trinidad whichhappily for itpossesses a government which  governs instead of leaving every man as in the irishmans  paradise to do what is right in the sight of his own eyes and  what is wrong too av he likes  without such wise regulation and  even restraint of the ignorant greediness of human toil intent  only as in the too exclusive cultivation of the sugarcane and of  the cottonplant on present profits without foresight or care for  the future the lands of warmer climates will surely fall under that  curse so well described by the venerable elias fries of lund  257a  a broad belt of waste land follows gradually in the steps of  cultivation  if it expands its centre and its cradle dies and on  the outer borders only do we find green shoots  but it is not  impossible only difficult for man without renouncing the  advantage of culture itself one day to make reparation for the  injury which he has inflicted he is the appointed lord of creation   true it is that thorns and thistles illfavoured and poisonous  plants well named by botanists rubbishplants mark the track  which man has proudly traversed through the earth  before him lay  original nature in her wild but sublime beauty  behind him he  leaves the desert a deformed and ruined land for childish desire  of destruction or thoughtless squandering of vegetable treasures has  destroyed the character of nature and terrified man himself flies  from the arena of his actions leaving the impoverished earth to  barbarous races or to animals so long as yet another spot in virgin  beauty smiles before him  here again in selfish pursuit of  profit and consciously or unconsciously following the abominable  principle of the great moral vileness which one man has expressed apres nous le delugehe begins anew the work of destruction   thus did cultivation driven out leave the east and perhaps the  deserts formerly robbed of their coverings  like the wild hordes of  old over beautiful greece thus rolls the conquest with fearful  rapidity from east to west through america and the planter now  often leaves the already exhausted land the eastern climate becomes  infertile through the demolition of the forests to introduce a  similar revolution into the far west  for a couple of miles or more we trotted on through this jungle  till suddenly we saw light ahead and in five minutes the forest  ended and a scene opened before us which made me understand the  admiration which humboldt and other travellers have expressed at the  far vaster savannas of the orinoco  a large sheet of graygreen grass bordered by the forest wall as  far as the eye could see and dotted with low bushes weltered in  mirage while stretching out into it some half a mile off a gray  promontory into a green sea was an object which filled me with more  awe and admiration than anything which i had seen in the island  it was a wood of moriche palms like a greek temple many hundred  yards in length and as i guessed nearly a hundred feet in height  and like a greek temple ending abruptly at its full height  the  gray columns perfectly straight and parallel supported a dark roof  of leaves gray underneath and reflecting above from their broad  fans sheets of pale glitteringlight  such serenity of grandeur i  never saw in any group of trees and when we rode up to it and  tethered our horses in its shade it seemed to me almost irreverent  not to kneel and worship in that temple not made with hands  when we had gazed our fill we set hastily to work to collect  plants as many as the lateness of the hour and the scalding heat  would allow  a glance showed the truth of dr kruegers words  it is impossible to describe the feelings of the botanist when  arriving at a field like this so much unlike anything he has seen  before  here are fullblowing large orchids with red white and  yellow flowers and among the grasses smaller ones of great  variety and as great scientific interestmelastomaceous plants of  various genera utricularias droseras rare and various grasses  and cyperoids of small sizes and fine kinds with a species of  cassytha in the water ceratophyllum the wellknown hornwort of  the english ponds and bogmosses  such a variety of forms and  colours is nowhere else to be met with in the island  of the orchids we only found one in flower and of the rest of  course we had time only to gather a very few of the more  remarkable among which was that lovely cousin of the clerodendrons  the crimson amasonia which ought to be in all hothouses  the low  bushes i found were that curious tree the chaparro 259a but not  the chaparro 259b so often mentioned by humboldt as abounding on  the llanos  this chaparro is remarkable first for the queer  little natural order to which it belongs secondly for its tanning  properties thirdly for the very nasty smell of its flowers  fourthly for the roughness of its leaves which make ones flesh  creep and are used i believe for polishing steel and lastly for  its wide geographical range from isla de pinos near cubawhere  columbus to his surprise saw true pines growing in the tropics all over the llanos and down to brazil an ancient ugly sturdy  form of vegetation able to get a scanty living out of the poorest  soils and consequently triumphant as yet in the battle of life  the soil of the savanna was a poor sandy clay treacherous and  often impassable for horses being half dried above and wet beneath   the vegetation grew not over the whole but in innumerable  tussocks which made walking very difficult  the type of the rushes  and grasses was very english but among them grew here and there  plants which excited my astonishment above all certain bladder worts 259c which i had expected to find but which when found  were so utterly unlike any english ones that i did not recognise at  first what they were  our english bladderworts as everybody  knows float in stagnant water on tangles of hairlike leaves  something like those of the waterranunculus but furnished with  innumerable tiny bladders and this raft supports the little scape  of yellow snapdragonlike flowers  there are in trinidad and other  parts of south america bladderworts of this type  but those which  we found today growing out of the damp clay were more like in  habit to a delicate stalk of flax or even a bent of grass upright  leafless or all but leafless with heads of small blue or yellow  flowers and carrying in one species a few very minute bladders  about the roots in another none at all  a strange variation from  the normal type of the family yet not so strange after all as  that of another variety in the high mountain woods which finding  neither ponds to float in nor swamp to root in has taken to lodging  as a parasite among the wet moss on treetrunks not so strange  either as that of yet another which floats but in the most  unexpected spots namely in the water which lodges between the  leafsheaths of the wild pines perched on the treeboughs a  parasite on parasites and sends out long runners as it grows  along the bough in search of the next wild pine and its tiny  reservoirs  in the face of such strange facts is it very absurd to guess that  these utricularias so like each other in their singular and highly  specialised flowers so unlike each other in the habit of the rest  of the plant have started from some one original type perhaps long  since extinct and that carried by birds into quite new situations  they have adapted themselves by natural selection to new  circumstances changing the parts which required changethe leaves  and stalks but keeping comparatively unchanged those which needed  no changethe flowers  but i was not prepared as i should have been had i studied my  griesbachs west indian flora carefully enough beforehand for the  next proof of the wide distribution of waterplants  for as i  scratched and stumbled among the tussocks larding the lean earth  as i stalked along my kind guide put into my hand with something  of an air of triumph a little plant which wasthere was no  denying itnone other than the longleaved sundew 260a with its  clammyhaired paws full of dead flies just as they would have been  in any bog in devonshire or in hampshire in wales or in scotland   but how came it here  and more how has it spread not only over  the whole of northern europe canada and the united states but  even as far south as brazil  its being common to north america and  europe is not surprising  it may belong to that comparatively  ancient flora which existed when there was land way between the two  continents by way of greenland and the bison ranged from russia to  the rocky mountains  but its presence within the tropics is more  probably explained by supposing that it like the bladderworts has  been carried on the feet or in the crop of birds  the savanna itself like those of caroni and piarco offers i  suspect a fresh proof that a branch of the orinoco once ran along  the foot of the northern mountains of trinidad  it is impossible says humboldt 260b to cross the burning  plains of the orinocquan savannas without inquiring whether they  have always been in the same state or whether they have been  stripped of their vegetation by some revolution of nature  the  stratum of mould now found on them is very thin     the plains  were doubtless less bare in the fifteenth century than they are  now yet the first conquistadores who came from coro described  them then as savannas where nothing could be perceived save the sky  and the turf which were generally destitute of trees and difficult  to traverse on account of the reverberation of heat from the soil   why does not the great forest of the oroonoco extend to the north  or the left bank of that river  why does it not fill that vast  space that reaches as far as the cordillera of the coast and which  is fertilised by various rivers  this question is connected with  all that relates to the history of our planet  if indulging in  geological reveries we suppose that the steppes of america and the  desert of sahara have been stripped of their vegetation by an  irruption of the ocean or that they formed the bottom of an inland  lakethe sahara as is now well known is the quite recently  elevated bed of a great sea continuous with the atlanticwe may  conceive that thousands of years have not sufficed for the trees and  shrubs to advance toward the centre from the borders of the forests  from the skirts of the plains either naked or covered with turf and  darken so vast a space with their shade  it is more difficult to  explain the origin of bare savannas enclosed in forests than to  recognise the causes which maintain forests and savannas within  their ancient limits like continents and seas  with these words in my mind i could not but look on the savanna of  aripo as one of the lastmade bits of dry land in trinidad still  unfurnished with the common vegetation of the island  the two  invading armies of tropical plantsone advancing from the north  off the now almost destroyed land which connected trinidad and the  cordillera with the antilles the other from the southwest off the  utterly destroyed land which connected trinidad with guianamet as  i fancy ages since on the opposite banks of a mighty river or  estuary by which the orinoco entered the ocean along the foot of  the northern mountains  as that riverbed rose and became dry land  the two floras crossed and intermingled  only here and there as at  aripo are left patches as it were of a third flora which once  spread uninterruptedly along the southern base of the cordillera and  over the lowland which is now the gulf of paria along the alluvial  flats of the mighty stream and the moriche palms of aripo may be  the lineal descendants of those which now inhabit the llanos of the  main as those again may be the lineal descendants of the moriches  which schomburgk found forming forests among the mountains of  guiana up to four thousand feet above the sea  age after age the  moriche apples floated down the stream settling themselves on every  damp spot not yet occupied by the richer vegetation of the forests  and ennobled with their solitary grandeur what without them would  have been a dreary waste of mud and sand  these savannas of trinidad stand it must be remembered in the very  line where on such a theory they might be expected to stand along  the newest deposit the great band of sand gravel and clay rubbish  which stretches across the island at the mountainfoot its highest  point in thirtysix miles being only two hundred and twenty feetan  elevation far less than the corresponding depression of the bocas  which has parted trinidad from the main cordillera  that the  rubbish on this line was deposited by a river or estuary is as clear  to me as that the river was either a very rapid one or subject to  violent and lofty floods as the orinoco is now  for so are best  explained not merely the sheets of gravel but the huge piles of  boulder which have accumulated at the mouth of the mountain gorges  on the northern side  as for the southern shore of this supposed channel of the orinoco  it at once catches the eye of any one standing on the northern  range  he must see that he is on one shore of a vast channel the  other shore of which is formed by the montserrat tamana and  manzanilla hills far lower now than the northern range tamana only  being over a thousand feet but doubtless in past ages far higher  than now  no one can doubt this who has seen the extraordinary  degradation going on still about the summits or who remembers that  the strata whether tertiary or lower chalk have been over the  greater part of the island upheaved faulted set on end by the  convulsions seemingly so common during the miocene epoch and since  then sawn away by water and air into one rolling outline quite  independent of the dip of the strata  the whole southern two thirds  of trinidad represent a wear and tear which is not to be counted by  thousands or hundreds of thousands of years and yet which i  verily believe has taken place since the average plants trees and  animals of the island dwelt therein  this elevation may have well coincided with the depression of the  neighbouring gulf of paria  that the southern portion of that gulf  was once dry land that the serpents mouth did not exist when the  present varieties of plants and animals were created is matter of  fact proven by the identity of the majority of plants and animals  on both shores  how elseto give a few instances out of hundreds did the mora the brazilnut the cannonball tree  how else did  the anteater the coendou the two cuencos the guazupita deer  enter trinidad  humboldtthough unfortunately he never visited  the islandsaw this at a glance  while he perceived that the  indian story how the boca drago to the north had been only lately  broken through had a foundation of truth it cannot be doubted  he says that the gulf of paria was once an inland basin and the  punta icacque its southwestern extremity united to the punta  toleto east of the boca de pedernales 262  in which case there  may well have beenone may almost say there must have beenan  outlet for that vast body of water which pours often in tremendous  floods from the pedernales mouth of the orinoco as well as from  those of the tigre guanipa caroli and other streams between it  and the cordillera on the north and this outlet probably lay along  the line now occupied by the northern savannas of trinidad  so much this little natural park of aripo taught or seemed to teach  me  but i did not learn the whole of the lesson that afternoon or  indeed till long after  there was no time then to work out such  theories  the sun was getting low and more intolerable as he sank  and to escape a sunstroke on the spot or at least a dark ride home  we hurried off into the forest shade after one last look at the  nevertobeforgotten morichal and trotted home to luxury and  sleep    chapter xiii  the cocal    next day like the young muleteers of grenada a good song which  often haunted me in those days   with mornings earliest twinkle again we are up and gone   with two horses two mules and a negro and a coolie carrying our  scanty luggage in arima baskets  but not without an expression of  pity from the negro who cleaned my boots  where were we going   to the east coast  cuffy turned up what little nose he had  he  plainly considered the east coast and indeed trinidad itself as  not worth looking at  ah you should go barbadoes sa  dat de  country to see  i barbadian sa  no doubt  it is very quaint  this selfsatisfaction of the barbadian negro  whether or not he  belonged originally to some higher racefor there are as great  differences of race among negroes as among any white menhe looks  down on the negroes and indeed on the white men of other islands  as beings of an inferior grade and takes care to inform you in the  first five minutes that he is neider crab nor creole but true  barbadian barn  this selfconceit of his meanwhile is apt to  make him unruly and the cause of unruliness in others when he  emigrates  the barbadian negroes are i believe the only ones who  give or ever have given any trouble in trinidad and in barbadoes  itself though the agricultural negroes work hard and well who that  knows the west indies knows not the insubordination of the  bridgetown boatmen among whose hands a traveller and his luggage  are it is said likely enough to be pulled in pieces  however  they are rather more quiet just now for not a thousand years ago a  certain steamers captain utterly unable to clear his quarter of  the fleet of fighting jabbering brown people turned the steam pipe  on them  at which quite unexpected artillery they fled  precipitately and have had some rational respect for a steamers  quarter ever since  after all i do not deny that this mans being  a barbadian opened my heart to him at once for old sakes sake  another specimen of negro character i was to have analysed or tried  to analyse at the estate where i had slept  m f had lately  caught a black servant at the brookside busily washing something in  a calabash and asked him what was he doing there  the conversation  would have been held of course in frenchspanishafricancreole  patois a language which is becoming fixed with its own grammar and  declensions etc  a curious book on it has lately been published in  trinidad by mr thomas a coloured gentleman who seems to be at  once no mean philologer and no mean humorist  the substance of the  negros answer was why sir you sent me to the town to buy a  packet of sugar and a packet of salt and coming back it rained so  hard the packets burst and the salt was all washed into the sugar   and soi am washing it out again     this worthy was to have been brought to me that i might discover  if possible by what processes of that which he was pleased to call  his mind he had arrived at the conclusion that such a thing could  be done  clearly he could not plead unavoidable ignorance of the  subjectmatter as might the old cook at san josef who the first  time her master brought home wenham lake ice from port of spain was  scandalised at the dirtiness of the american water washed off the  sawdust and dried the ice in the sun  his was a case of handy andyism as that intellectual disease may be named after mr  lovers hero like that of the obeahwoman when she tried to bribe  the white gentleman with half a dozen of bottled beer a case of  muddleheaded craft and elaborate silliness which keeps no  proportion between the means and the end so common in insane  persons frequent too among the lower irish such as handy andy  and very frequent i am afraid among the negroes  butas might  have been expectedthe poor boys moral sense had proved as shaky  as his intellectual powers  he had just taken a fancy to some goods  of his masters and had retreated to enjoy them the more securely  into the southern forests with a couple of brown policemen on his  track  so he was likely to undergo a more simple investigation than  that which was submitted to my analysis viz how he proposed to  wash the salt out of the sugar  we arrived after a while at valencia a scattered hamlet in the  woods with a good shop or store upon a village green under the  verandah whereof lay side by side with bottled ale and biscuit  tins bags of carapo 265 nuts trapezoidal brown nutsenclosed  originally in a round fruitwhich ought some day to form a valuable  article of export  their bitter anthelminthic oil is said to have  medicinal uses but it will be still more useful for machinery as  it haslike that curious flat gourd the sequa 266athe property  of keeping iron from rust  the tree itself common here and in  guiana is one of the true forest giants we saw many a noble  specimen of it in our rides  its timber is tough not over heavy  and extensively used already in the island while its bark is a  febrifuge and tonic  in fact it possesses all those qualities which  make its brethren the meliaceae valuable throughout the tropics   but it is not the only tree of south america whose bark may be used  as a substitute for quinine  they may be counted possibly by  dozens  a glance at the excellent enumerations of the uses of  vegetable products to be found in lindleys vegetable kingdom a  monument of learning will show how god provides how man neglects  and wastes  as a single instance the laurels alone are known  already to contain several valuable febrifuges among which the  demerara greenheart or bibiri 266b claims perhaps the highest  rank  dr maclagan has shown says dr lindley that sulphate of  bibiri acts with rapid and complete success in arresting ague   this tree spreads from jamaica to the spanish main  it is plentiful  in trinidad still more plentiful in guiana and yet all of it which  reaches europe is a little of its hard beautiful wood for the use of  cabinetmakers while in demerara i am assured by an eyewitness  many tons of this precious greenheart bark are thrown away year by  year  so goes the world and man meanwhile at once boasts of his  civilisation and complains of the niggardliness of nature  but if i once begin on this subject i shall not know where to end  our way lay now for miles along a path which justified all that i  had fancied about the magnificent possibilities of landscape  gardening in the tropics  a grass drive as we should call it in  englanda trace as it is called in the west indiessome sixty  feet in width and generally carpeted with short turf led up hill  and down dale for the land though low is much ridged and gullied  and there has been as yet no time to cut down the hills or to metal  the centre of the road  it led as the land became richer through  a natural avenue even grander than those which i had already seen   the light and air entering the trace had called into life the  undergrowth and lower boughs till from the very turf to a hundred  and fifty feet in height rose one solid green wall spangled here  and there with flowers  below was mamure roseau timit aroumas  and tulumas 266c mixed with myrtles and melastomas then the  copper bois mulatres among the cocorite and jagua palms above them  the heads of enormous broadleaved trees of i know not how many  species and the lianes festooning all from cope to base  the  crimson masses of norantea on the highest treetops were here most  gorgeous but we had to beware of staring aloft too long for fear  of riding into mudholesfor the wet season would not end as yet  though dry weather was dueor even worse into the great parasol ant warrens which threatened besides a heavy fall stings  innumerable  at one point i recollect a goldgreen jacamar sat on  a log and looked at me till i was within five yards of her  at  another we heard the screams of parrots at another the double note  of the toucan at another the metallic clank of the bellbird or  what was said to be the bellbird  but this note was not that  solemn and sonorous toll of the campanese of the mainland which is  described by waterton and others  it resembled rather the less  poetical sound of a woman beating a saucepan to make a swarm of bees  settle  at one point we met a gang of negroes felling timber to widen the  road  fresh fallen trees tied together with lianes lay  everywhere  what a harvest for the botanist was among them  i  longed to stay there a week to examine and collect  but time  pressed and indeed collecting plants in the wet season is a  difficult and disappointing work  in an air saturated with moisture  specimens turn black and mouldy and drop to pieces and unless  turned over and exposed to every chance burst of sunshine the  labour of weeks is lost if indeed meanwhile the ants and other  creeping things have not eaten the whole into rags  among these negroes was one who excited my astonishment not merely  for his size though he was perhaps the tallest man whom i saw among  the usually tall negroes of trinidad but for his features which  were altogether european of the highest type the forehead high and  broad the cheekbones flat the masque long and oval and the nose  aquiline and thin enough for any prince  conscious of his own  beauty and strength he stood up among the rest as an old macedonian  might have stood up among the egyptians he had conquered  we tried  to find out his parentage  my companions presumed he was an  african ie imported during the times of slavery  he said no   that he was a creole island born but his father it appeared had  been in one of our negro regiments and had been settled afterwards  on a government grant of land  whether his beauty was the result of  atavismof the reappearance under the black skin and woolly  hair of some old stain of white blood or whether which is more  probable he came of some higher african race one could not look at  him without hopeful surmises as to the possible rise of the negro  and as to the way in which it will come aboutthe only way in which  any race has permanently risen as far as i can ascertain namely  by the appearance among them of sudden sports of nature individuals  of an altogether higher type such a man as that terrible daaga  whose story has been told  if i am any judge of physiognomy such a  man as that havingwhat the negro has not yet hadla carriere  ouverte aux talents might raise not himself merely but a whole  tribe to an altogether new level in culture and ability  just after passing this gang we found lying by the road two large  snakes just killed which i would gladly have preserved had it been  possible  they were the negroes told us dormillons or  mangrove cascabel a species as yet i believe undescribed and  of course here considered as very poisonous owing to their  likeness to the true cascabel 268 whose deadly fangs are justly  dreaded by the lapo hunter  for the cascabel has a fancy for living  in the lapos burrow as does the rattlesnake in that of the prairie  dog in the western united states and in the same friendly and  harmless fashion and is apt when dug out to avenge himself and  his host by a bite which is fatal in a few hours  but these did not  seem to me to have the heads of poisonous snakes and in spite of  the entreaties of the terrified negroes i opened their mouths to  judge for myself and found them as i expected utterly fangless  and harmless  i was not aware then that dr de verteuil had stated  the same fact in print but i am glad to corroborate it for the  benefit of at least the rational people in trinidad  for snakes  even poisonous ones should be killed as seldom as possible  they  feed on rats and vermin and are the farmers good friend whether  in the tropics or in england and to kill a snake or even an adder who never bites any one if he is allowed to run awayis in  nineteen cases out of twenty mere wanton mischief  the way was beguiled if i recollect rightly for some miles on by  stories about cuba and cuban slavery from one of our party  he  described the political morality of cuba as utterly dissolute told  stories of great sums of money voted for roads which are not made to  this day while the money had found its way into the pockets of  government officials and on the whole said enough to explain the  determination of the cubans to shake off spanish misrule and try  what they could do for themselves on this earth  he described cuban  slavery as on the whole mild corporal punishment being restricted  by law to a few blows and very seldom employed  but the mildness  seemed dictated rather by selfinterest than by humanity  illuse  our slaves said a cuban to him  we cannot afford it  you take  good care of your fourlegged mules  we of our twolegged ones   the children it seems are taken away from the mothers not merely  because the mothers are needed for work but because they neglect  their offspring so much that the children have more chance of  livingand therefore of payingif brought up by hand  so each  estate has or had its creche as the french would call ita great  nursery in which the little black things are reared kindly enough  by the elder ladies of the estate  to one old lady who wearied  herself all day long in washing doctoring and cramming the babies  my friend expressed pity for all the trouble she took about her  human brood  oh dear no answered she they are a great deal  easier to rear than chickens  the system however is nearly at an  end  already the cuban revolution has produced measures of half emancipation and in seven years time probably there will not be a  slave in cuba  we waded stream after stream under the bamboo clumps and in one of  them we saw swimming a green rigoise or whipsnake which must have  been nearly ten feet long  it swam with its head and the first two  feet of its body curved aloft like a swan while the rest of the  body lay along the surface of the water in many curvesa most  graceful object as it glided away into dark shadow along an oily  pool  at last we reached an outlying camp belonging to one of our  party who was superintending the making of new roads in that  quarter and there rested our weary limbs some in hammock some on  the tables some again on the clay floor  here i saw as i saw  every ten minutes something newthat quaint vegetable plaything  described by humboldt and others namely the spathe of the timit  palm  it encloses as in most palms a branched spadix covered with  innumerable round buds most like a head of millet two feet and a  half long  but the spathe instead of splitting and forming a hood  over the flowers as in the cocorite and most palms remains entire  and slips off like the finger of a glove  when slipped off it is  found to be made of two transverse layers of fibrea bit of  veritable natural lace similar to though far less delicate than  the famous lacebark of the lagettatree peculiar i believe to  one district in the jamaica mountains  and as it is elastic and  easily stretched what hinders the brown child from pulling it out  till it makes an admirable fools cap some two feet high and  exactly the colour of his own skin and dancing about therein the  fat oily little cupidon without a particle of clothing beside  and  what wonder if we grownup whites made fools caps too for children  on the other side of the atlantic  during which process we found what all said they had never seen beforethat one of the spadices  carried two caps one inside the other and one exactly like the  other a wanton superfluity of nature which i should like to hear  explained by some morphologist  we rode away from that hospitable group of huts whither we were to  return in two or three days and along the green trace once more   as we rode m the civiliser of montserrat and i side by side  talking of cuba and staring at the noranteas overhead a dull sound  was heard as if the earth had opened as indeed it had engulfing  in the mud the whole forehand of ms mule and there he knelt  his beard outspread upon the clay while the mules visage looked  patiently out from under his left arm  however it was soft falling  there  the mule was hauled out by main force  as for cleaning  either her or the rider that was not thought of in a country where  they were sure to be as dirty as ever in an hour and so we rode on  after taking a note of the spot and as it happened forgetting it  againone of us at least  on again along the green trace which rose now to a ridge with  charming glimpses of wooded hills and glens to right and left past  comfortable squatters cottages with cacao drying on sheets at the  doors or under sheds with hedges of dwarf erythrina dotted with  red jumby beads and here and there that pretty climbing vetch the  overlook 270  i forgot by the by to ask whether it is planted  here as in jamaica to keep off the evil eye or overlook whence  its name  nor can i guess what peculiarity about the plant can have  first made the negro fix on it as a fetish  the genesis of folly is  as difficult to analyse as the genesis of most other things  all this while the dull thunder of the surf was growing louder and  louder till not as in england over a bare down but through  thickest foliage down to the high tide mark we rode out upon the  shore and saw before us a right noble sight a flat sandy surf  beaten shore along which stretched in one grand curve lost at  last in the haze of spray fourteen miles of coco palms  this was the cocal and it was worth coming all the way from england  to see it alone  i at once felt the truth of my hosts saying that  if i went to the cocal i should find myself transported suddenly  from the west indies to the east  just such must be the shore of a  coral island in the pacific  these cocos be it understood are probably not indigenous  they  spread it is said from an east indian vessel which was wrecked  here  be that as it may they have thoroughly naturalised  themselves  every nut which falls and lies throws out during the  wet season its roots into the sand and is ready to take the place  of its parent when the old tree dies down  about thirty to fifty feet is the average height of these coco  palms which have all without exception a peculiarity which i have  noticed to a less degree in another sand and shoregrowing tree  the pinaster of the french landes  they never springupright from  the ground  the butt curves indeed lies almost horizontal in some  cases for the lowest two or three yards and the whole stem up to  the top is inclined to lean it matters not toward which quarter  for they lean as often toward the wind as from it crossing each  other very gracefully  i am not mechanician enough to say how this  curve of the stem increases their security amid loose sands and  furious winds  but that it does so i can hardly doubt when i see a  similar habit in the pinaster  another peculiarity was noteworthy   their innumerable roots long fleshy about the thickness of a  large string piercing the sand in every direction and running down  to hightide mark apparently enjoying the salt water and often  piercing through bivalve shells which remained strung upon the  roots  have they a fondness for carbonate of lime as well as for  salt  the most remarkable and to me unexpected peculiarity of a cocal is  one which i am not aware whether any writer has mentioned namely  the prevalence of that amber hue which we remarked in the very first  specimens seen at st thomass  but this is certainly the mark  which distinguishes the coco palm not merely from the cold dark  green of the palmiste or the silvery gray of the jagua but from  any other tree which i have ever seen  when inside the cocal the air is full of this amber light   gradually the eye analyses the cause of it and finds it to be the  resultant of many other hues from bright vermilion to bright green   above the latticed light which breaks between and over the  innumerable leaflets of the fruit fronds comes down in warmest  green  it passes not over merely but through the semitransparent  straw and amber of the older leaves  it falls on yellow spadices  and flowers and rich brown spathes and on great bunches of green  nuts to acquire from them more yellow yet for each fruitstalk and  each flowerscale at the base of the nut is veined and tipped with  bright orange  it pours down the stems semigray on one side then  yellow and then on the opposite side covered with a powdery  lichen varying in colour from orange up to clear vermilion and  spreads itself over a floor of yellow sand and brown fallen nuts  and the only vegetation of which in general is a long crawling  echites with pairs of large creamwhite flowers  thus the  transparent shade is flooded with gold  one looks out through it at  the chequerwork of blue sky all the more intense from its  contrast or at a long whirl of white surf and gray spray or  turning the eyes inland toward the lagoon at dark masses of  mangrove above which rise black and awful the dying balatas  stagheaded blasted tottering to their fall and all as through an  atmosphere of rhine wine or from the inside of a topaz  we rode along mile after mile wondering at many things  first  the innumerable dry fruits of timit palm which lay everywhere  mostly single some double a few treble from coalition i suppose  of the three carpels which every female palm flower ought to have  but of which it usually develops only one  they may have been  brought down the lagoon from inland by floods but the common belief  is that most of them come from the orinoco itself as do also the  mighty logs which lie about the beach in every stage of wear and  tear and which as fast as they are cut up and carried away are  replaced by fresh ones  some of these trees may actually come from  the mainland and drifting into this curving bay be driven on  shore by the incessant trade wind  but i suspect that many of them  are the produce of the island itself and more that they have  grown some of them on the very spot where they now lie  for there  are i think evidences of subsidence going on along this coast   inside the cocal two hundred yards to the westward stretches  inland a labyrinth of lagoons and mangrove swamps impassable to  most creatures save alligators and boaconstrictors  but amid this  labyrinth grow everywhere mighty treesbalatas in plenty among  them in every stage of decay dying seemingly by gradual  submergence of their roots and giving a ghastly and ragged  appearance to the forest  at the mouth of the little river nariva  a few miles down is proof positive unless i am much mistaken of  similar subsidence  for there i found trees of all sizesroseau  scrub among themstanding rooted below hightide mark and killed  where they grew  so we rode on stopping now and then to pick up shells chipchips  274a which are said to be excellent eating a beautiful purple  bivalve 274b to which in almost every case a coralline 274c  had attached itself of a form quite new to me  a lash some  eighteen inches long single or forked purplish as long as its coat  of limeholding the polypesstill remained but when that was  rubbed off a mere round strip of dark horn and in both cases  flexible and elastic so that it can be coiled up and tied in knots  a very curious and graceful piece of natures workmanship  among  them were curious flat cakeurchins with oval holes punched in  them so brittle that in spite of all our care they resolved  themselves into the loose sand of which they had been originally  compact and i could therefore verify neither their genus nor their  species  these were all if i recollect that we found that day  the next  day we came on hundreds of a most beautiful bivalve 274d their  purple colour quite fresh their long spines often quite uninjured   some change of the sandy bottom had unearthed a whole warren of the  lovely things and mixed with chipchips innumerable and with a  great bivalve 274e with a thin wing along the anterior line of the  shell they strewed the shore for a quarter of a mile and more  we came at last to a little river or rather tideway leading from  the lagoon to the sea which goes by the name of doubloon river   some adventurous spaniard the story goes contracted to make a  cutting which would let off the lagoon water in time of flood for  the sum of one doubloonsome three pound five spent six times the  money on it and found his cutting when once the sea had entered  enlarge into a roaring tideway dangerous often impassable and  eating away the cocal rapidly toward the south mother earth in  this case at least having known her own business better than the  spaniard  how we took off our saddles sat down on the sand hallooed waited  how a black policemanwhose house was just being carried away by  the seaappeared at last with a canoe how we and our baggage got  over one by one in the hollow log withoutby seeming miraclebeing  swept out to sea or upset  how some horses would swim and others  would not how the negroes held on by the horses till they all went  head over ears under the surf and how at last breathless with  laughter and anxiety for our scanty wardrobes we scrambled ashore  one by one into prickly roseau resaddled our horses in an  atmosphere of long thorns and then cut our way and theirs out  through scrub into the cocalall this should not be written in  these pages but drawn for the benefit of punch by him who drew the  eggstealing frogwhose pencil i longed for again and again amid  the delightful mishaps of those forest rambles in all of which i  never heard a single grumble or saw temper lost for a moment  we  should have been rather more serious though than we were had we  been aware that the rivergod or presiding jumby of the doubloon  was probably watching us the whole time with the intention of  eating any one whom he could catch and only kept in wholesome awe  by our noise and splashing  at last after the sun had gone down and it was ill picking our way  among logs and groundcreepers we were aware of lights and soon  found ourselves again in civilisation and that of no mean kind  a  large and comfortable house only just rebuilt after a fire stood  among the palmtrees between the sea and the lagoon and behind it  the barns sheds and enginehouses of the cocoworks and inside it  a hearty welcome from a most agreeable german gentleman and his  german engineer  a ladys handi am sorry to say the lady was not  at homewas evident enough in the arrangements of the central room   pretty things a piano and good books especially longfellow and  tennyson told of cultivation and taste in that remotest wilderness   the material hospitality was what it always is in the west indies  and we sat up long into the night around the open door while the  surf roared and the palm trees sighed and the fireflies twinkled  talking of dear old germany and german unity and the possibility  of many things which have since proved themselves unexpectedly most  possible  i went to bed and to somewhat intermittent sleep   first my comrades going to bed romping like english schoolboys  and not in the least like the effeminate and luxurious creoles who  figure in the english imagination broke a fourpost bedstead down  among them with hideous roar and ruin and had to be picked up and  called to order by their elders  next the wind which ranged  freely through the open roof blew my bedclothes off  then the dogs  exploded outside probably at some henroostrobbing opossum and had  a chevy through the cocos till they treed their game and bayed it  to their hearts content  then something else explodedand i do  not deny it set me more aghast than i had been for many a day exploded i say under the window with a shriek of huthuttuttut  huttut such as i hope never to hear again  after which dead  silence save of the surf to the east and the toads to the west  i  fell asleep wondering what animal could own so detestable a voice  and in half an hour was awoke again by another explosion after  which happily the thing i suppose went its wicked way for i  heard it no more  i found out the next morning that the obnoxious bird was not an owl  but a large goatsucker a nycteribius i believe who goes by the  name of jumbybird among the english negroes  and no wonder for  most ghostly and horrible is his cry  but worse  he has but one  eye and a glance from that glaring eye as from the basilisk of  old is certain death  and worse still he can turn off its light  as a policeman does his lantern and become instantly invisible   opinions which if verified by experiment are not always found to  be in accordance with facts  but that is no reason why they should  not be believed  in st vincent for instance the negroes one evening rushed  shrieking out of a boilinghouse oh  massa robert we all killed   dar one great jumbybird come in a hole atop a roof  oh  massa  robert you no go in you killed we killed etc etc  massa  robert went in and could see no bird  ah massa robert him darky  him eye but him see you all da same  you killed we killed etc   da capo  massa robert was not killed  but lives still to the great benefit  of his fellowcreatures negroes especially  nevertheless the  negroes held to their opinion  he might could would or should  have been killed and was not that clear proof that they were right  after this who can deny that the negro is a man and a brother  possessing the same reasoning faculties and exercising them in  exactly the same way as three out of four white persons  but if the night was disturbed pleasant was the waking next  morning pleasant the surprise at finding that the whistling and  howling airbath of the night had not given one a severe cold or  any cold at all pleasant to slip on flannel shut and trousers shoes and stockings were needlessand hurry down through a stampede  of kicking squealing mules who were being watered ere their days  work began under the palms to the sea pleasant to bathe in warm  surf into which the foureyes squattered in shoals as one ran down  and the moment they saw one safe in the water ran up with the next  wave to lie staring at the sky pleasant to sit and read ones book  upon a log and listen to the soft rush of the breeze in the palm leaves and look at a sunrise of green and gold pink and orange  and away over the great ocean and to recollect with a feeling of  mingled nearness and loneliness that there was nothing save that  watery void between oneself and england and all that england held  and then when driven in to breakfast by the morning shower to  begin a new day of seeing and seeing and seeing certain that one  would learn more in it than in a whole week of bookreading at home  we spent the next morning in inspecting the works  we watched the  negroes splitting the coconuts with a single blow of that alluseful  cutlass which they handle with surprising dexterity and force  throwing the thick husk on one side the fruit on the other  we saw  the husk carded out by machinery into its component fibres for  cocorope matting coirrope saddlestuffing brushes and a dozen  other uses while the fruit was crushed down for the sake of its  oil and could but wish all success to an industry which would be  most profitable both to the projectors and to the island itself  were it not for the uncertainty rather than the scarcity of  labour  almost everything is done of course by piecework  the  negro has the price of his labour almost at his own command and  when by working really hard and well for a while he has earned a  little money he throws up his job and goes off careless whether  the whole works stand still or not  however all prosperity to the  cocoworks of messrs uhrich and gerold and may the day soon come  when the english of trinidad like the ceylonese and the dutch of  java shall count by millions the cocopalms which they have planted  along their shores and by thousands of pounds the profit which  accrues from them  after breakfastcall it luncheon ratherwe started for the lagoon   we had set our hearts on seeing manatis sea cows which are  still not uncommon on the east coast of this island though they  have been exterminated through the rest of the west indies since the  days of pere labat  that good missionary speaks of them in his  delightful journal as already rare in the year 1695 and now as far  as i am aware none are to be found north of trinidad and the  spanish main save a few round cuba and jamaica  we were anxious  too to see if not to get a boaconstrictor of one kind or other   for there are two kinds in the island which may be seen alive at  the zoological gardens in the same cage  the true boa 277a which  is here called mahajuel is striped as well as spotted with two  patterns one over the other  the huillia anaconda or waterboa  277b bears only a few large round spots  both are fond of the  water the huillia living almost entirely in it both grow to a very  large size and both are dangerous at least to children and small  animals  that there were huillias about the place possibly within  fifty yards of the house there was no doubt  one of our party had  seen with his own eyes one of sevenandtwenty feet long killed  with a whole kid inside it only a few miles off  the brown  policeman crossing an arm of the guanapo only a month or two  before had been frightened by meeting one in the ford which his  excited imagination magnified so much that its head was on the one  bank while its tail was on the othera measurement which must i  think be divided at least by three  but in the very spot in which  we stood some four years since happened what might have been a  painful tragedy  four young ladies whose names were mentioned to  me preferred not wisely a bathe in the still lagoon to one in the  surf outside and as they disported themselves one of them felt  herself seized from behind  fancying that one of her sisters was  playing tricks she called out to her to let her alone and looking  up saw to her astonishment her three sisters sitting on the bank  and herself alone  she looked back and shrieked for help  and  only just in time for the huillia had her  the other three girls  to their honour dashed in to her assistance  the brute had luckily  got hold not of her poor little body but of her bathingdress and  held on stupidly  the girls pulled the bathingdress which was  luckily of thin cotton was torn off the huillia slid back again  with it in his mouth into the dark labyrinth of the mangroveroots  and the girl was saved  two minutes delay and his coils would  have been round her and all would have been over  the sudden daring of these lazy and stupid animals is very great   their brain seems to act like that of the alligator or the pike  paroxysmally and by rare fits and starts after lying for hours  motionless as if asleep  but when excited they will attempt great  deeds  dr de verteuil tells a storyand if he tells it it must  be believedof some hunters who wounded a deer  the deer ran for  the stream down a bank but the hunters had no sooner heard it  splash into the water than they heard it scream  they leapt down to  the place and found it in the coils of a huillia which they killed  with the deer  and yet this snake which had dared to seize a full grown deer could have had no hope of eating her for it was only  seven feet long  we set out down a foul portercoloured creek which soon opened out  into a river reminding us in spite of all differences of certain  alder and willowfringed reaches of the thames  but here the wood  which hid the margin was altogether of mangrove the common  rhizophoras or black mangroves being of course the most  abundant  over them however rose the statelier avicennias or  white mangroves to a height of fifty or sixty feet and poured down  from their upper branches whole streams of airroots which waved  and creaked dolefully in the breeze overhead  but on the water was  no breeze at all  the lagoon was still as glass the sun was  sickening and we were glad to put up our umbrellas and look out  from under them for manatis and boas  but the manatis usually only  come in at night to put their heads out of water and browse on the  lowest mangrove leaves and the boas hide themselves so cunningly  either altogether under water or with only the head above that we  might have passed half a dozen without seeing them  the only  chance indeed of coming across them is when they are travelling  from lagoon to lagoon or basking on the mud at low tide  so all the game which we saw was a lovely white egret 278 its  back covered with those stiff pinnated plumes which young ladies when they can obtain themare only too happy to wear in their hats   he after being civil enough to wait on a bough till one of us got a  sitting shot at him heard the cap snap thought it as well not to  wait till a fresh one was put on and flapped away  he need not  have troubled himself  the negroesbut too apt to forget something  or otherhad forgotten to bring a spare supply and the gun was  useless  as we descended the left bank of the river was entirely occupied  with cocos and the contrast between them and the mangroves on the  right was made all the more striking by the afternoon sun which as  it sank behind the forest left the mangrove wall in black shadow  while it bathed the palmgroves opposite with yellow light  in one  of these palmgroves we landed for we were right thirsty and to  drink lagoon water would be to drink cholera or fever  but there  was plenty of pure water in the cocotrees and we soon had our  fill  a negro walkednot climbedup a stem like a fourfooted  animal his legs and arms straight his feet pressed flat against  it his hands clinging round ita feat impossible as far as i have  seen to an europeantossed us down plenty of green nuts and our  feast began  two or three blows with the cutlass at the small end of the nut  cut off not only the pithcoat but the point of the shell and  disclosethe nut being held carefully upright meanwhilea cavity  full of perfectly clear water slightly sweet and so cold the  pithcoat being a good nonconductor of heat that you are advised  for fear of cholera to flavour it with a little brandy  after  draining this natural cup you are presented with a natural spoon of  rind green outside and white within and told to scoop out and eat  the cream which lines the inside of the shell a very delicious food  in the opinion of creoles  after which if you are as curious as  some of us were you will sit down under the amber shade and  examine at leisure the construction and germination of these famous  and royal nuts  let me explain it even at the risk of prolixity   the coat of white pith outside with its green skin will gradually  develop and harden into that brown fibre of which matting is made   the clear water inside will gradually harden into that sweetmeat  which little boys eat off stalls and barrows in the street the  first delicate deposit of which is the cream in the green nut  this  is albumen intended to nourish the young palm till it has grown  leaves enough to feed on the air and roots enough to feed on the  soil and the birth of that young palm is in itself a mystery and a  miracle well worth considering  much has been written on it of  which i unfortunately have read very little but i can at least  tell what i have seen with my own eyes  if you search among the creamlayer at the larger end of the nut  you will find gradually separating itself from the mass a little  white lump like the stalk of a very young mushroom  that is the  ovule  in that lies the life the forma formativa of the future  tree  how that life works according to its kind who can tell   what it does is this  it is locked up inside a hard woody shell  and outside that shell are several inches of tough tangled fibre   how can it get out as soft and seemingly helpless as a babys  finger  all know that there are three eyes in the monkeys face as the  children call it at the butt of the nut  two of these eyes are  blind and filled up with hard wood  they are rudimentshints that the nut ought to have perhaps had uncounted ages since not  one ovule but three the typenumber in palms  one ovule alone is  left and that is opposite the one eye which is less blind than the  rest the eye which a schoolboy feels for with his knife when he  wants to get out the milk  as the nut lies upon the sand in shade and rain and heat that  babys finger begins boring its way with unerring aim out of the  weakest eye  soft itself yet with immense wedging power from the  gradual accretion of tiny cells it pierces the wood and then rends  right and left the tough fibrous coat  just so may be seeni have  seena large flagstone lifted in a night by a crop of tiny soft  toadstools which have suddenly blossomed up beneath it  the babys  finger protrudes at last and curves upward toward the light to  commence the campaign of life  but it has meanwhile established  like a good strategist a safe base of operations in its rear from  which it intends to draw supplies  into the albuminous cream which  lines the shell and into the cavity where the milk once was it  throws out white fibrous vessels which eat up the albumen for it  and at last line the whole inside of the shell with a white pith   the albumen gives it food wherewith to grow upward and downward   upward the white plumule hardens into what will be a stem the one  white cotyledon which sheaths it develops into a flat ribbed  forked green leaf sheathing it still and above it fresh leaves  sheathing always at their bases begin to form a tiny crown and  assume each more and more the pinnate form of the usual cocoleaf   but long ere this from the butt of the white plumule just outside  the nut white threads of root have struck down into the sand and  so the nut lies chained to the ground by a bridgelike chord which  drains its albumen through the monkeys eye into the young plant   after a whilea few months i believethe draining of the nut is  complete the chord dries upi know not how for i had neither  microscope nor time wherewith to examineand parts and the little  plant having got all it can out of its poor wetnurse casts her  ungratefully off to wither on the sand while it grows up into a  stately tree which will begin to bear fruit in six or seven years  and thenceforth continue flowering and fruiting the whole year  round without a pause for sixty years and more  i think i have described thisto memiraculum simply enough to  be understood by the nonscientific reader if only he or she have  first learned the undoubted factknown i find to very few  educated english peoplethat the cocopalm which produces coir rope and coconuts and a hundred other useful things is not the  same plant as the cacaobush which produces chocolate nor anything  like it  i am sorry to have to insist upon this fact  but till  professor huxleys dreamand mineis fulfilled and our schools  deign to teach in the intervals of latin and greek some slight  knowledge of this planet and of those of its productions which are  most commonly in use even this fact may need to be restated more  than once  we reembarked again and rowed down to the rivermouth to pick up  shells and drink in the rich roaring trade breeze after the  choking atmosphere of the lagoon and then rowed up home tired and  infinitely amused though neither manati nor boaconstrictor had  been seen and then we fell to siesta during whichwith mr  tennysons forgivenessi read myself to sleep with one of his best  poems and then went to dinner not without a little anxiety  for m the civiliser of montserrat had gone off early with  mule cutlass and haversack back over the doubloon and into the  wilds of manzanilla to settle certain disputed squatter claims and  otherwise enforce the law and now the night had fallen and he was  not yet home  however he rode up at last dead beat with a strong  touch of his old swampfever and having had an adventure which had  like to have proved his last  for as he rode through the doubloon  at low tide in the morning he espied in the surf that rivergod or  jumby of which i spoke just now namely the gray backfin of a  shark and his mule espied it too and laid back her ears knowing  well what it was  m rode close up to the brute  he seemed full  seven feet long and eyed him surlily disinclined to move off so  they parted and m went on his way  but his business detained  him longer than he expected when he got back to the rivermouth it  was quite dark and the tide was full high  he must either sleep on  the sands which with fever upon him would not have been oversafe  or try the passage  so he stripped swam the mule over tied her  up and then went back up to his shoulders in surf and cutlass in  hand too for that same shark might be within two yards of him  but  on his second journey he had to pile on his head first his saddle  and then his clothes and other goods few indeed but enough to  require both hands to steady them  and so walked helpless through  the surf expecting every moment to be accosted by a set of teeth  from which he would hardly have escaped with life  to have faced  such a danger alone and in the dark and thoroughly well aware as  an experienced man of its extremity was good proof if any had  been needed of the indomitable scots courage of the man   nevertheless he said he never felt so cold down his back as he did  during that last wade  by gods blessing the shark was not there  or did not see him and he got safe home thankful for dinner and  quinine  going back the next morning at low tide we kept a good lookout for  ms shark spreading out walkers and riders in hopes of  surrounding him and cutting him up  there were half a dozen weapons  among us of which my heavy bowieknife was not the worst and we  should have given good account of him had we met him and got  between him and the deep water  but our valour was superfluous   the enemy was nowhere to be seen and we rode on looking back  wistfully but in vain for a gray fin among the ripples  so we rode back along the cocal and along that wonderful green  glade where i staring at noranteas in treetops instead of at the  ground beneath my horses feet had the pleasure of being swallowed  upmy horses hindquarters at leastin the very same slough which  had engulfed ms mule three days before and got a roll in much  soft mud  then up to s camp where we expected breakfast not  with greediness though we had been nigh six hours in the saddle  but with curiosity  for he had promised to send out the hunters for  all game that could be found and give us a true forest meal and we  were curious to taste what lapo quenco guazupitadeer and other  strange meats might be like  nay some of us agreed that if the  hunters had but brought in a tender young red monkey 282a we  would surely eat him too if it were but to say that we had done it   but the hunters had had no luck  they had brought in only a pajui  282b an excellent game bird an anteater 282c and a great  cachicame or ninebanded armadillo  the anteater the foolish  fellows had eaten themselvesi would have given them what they  asked for his skeleton but the armadillo was cut up and hashed for  us and was eaten to the last scrap being about the best game i  ever tasted  i fear he is a foul feeder at times who by no means  confines himself to roots or even worms  if what i was told be  true there is but too much probability for captain mayne reids  statement that he will eat his way into the soft parts of a dead  horse and stay there until he has eaten his way out again  but to  do him justice i never heard him accused like the giant armadillo  282d of the main of digging dead bodies out of their graves as  he is doing in a very clever drawing in mr woods homes without  hands  be that as it may the armadillo whatever he feeds on has  the power of transmuting it into most delicate and wholesome flesh  meanwhileand hereby hangs a talei was interested not merely in  the armadillo but in the excellent taste with which it and  everything else was cooked in a little open shed over a few stones  and firesticks  and complimenting my host thereon i found that he  had there in the primeval forest an admirable french cook to whom  i begged to be introduced at once  poor fellow  a little lithe  parisian not thirty years old he had got thither by a wild road   cook to some good bourgeois family in paris he had fallen in love  with his masters daughter and she with him  and when their love  was hopeless and discovered the two young foolish things not  havingas is too common in francethe fear of god before their  eyes could think of no better resource than to shut themselves up  with a pan of lighted charcoal and so go they knew notwhither   the poor girl wentand was found dead  but the boy recovered and  was punished with twenty years of cayenne and here he was now on a  sort of ticketofleave cooking for his livelihood  i talked a  while with him cheered him with some compliments about the  parisians and so forth dear to the frenchmans heartwhat else  was there to sayand so left him not without the fancy that if  he had had but such an education as the middle classes in paris have  not there were the makings of a man in that keen eye large jaw  sharp chin  the very fellow said some one to have been a  firstrate zouave  well  perhaps he was a better man even as he  was than as a zouave  and so we rode away again and through valencia and through san  josef weary and happy back to port of spain  i would gladly had i been able have gone farther due westward into  the forests which hide the river oropuche that i might have visited  the scene of a certain two years idyll which was enacted in them  some forty years and more ago  in 1827 cacao fell to so low a price two dollars per cwt that it  was no longer worth cultivating and the head of the f family  leaving his slaves to live at ease on his estates retreated with a  household of twelve persons to a small property of his own which  was buried in the primeval forests of oropuche  with them went his  second son monsignor f then and afterwards cure of san josef  who died shortly before my visit to the island  i always heard him  spoken of as a gentleman and a scholar a saintly and cultivated  priest of the old french school respected and beloved by men of all  denominations  his church of san josef though still unfinished  had been taxed as well as all the roman catholic churches of the  island to build the roman catholic cathedral at port of spain and  he refusing to obey an order which he considered unjust threw up  his cure and retreated with the rest of the family to the palmleaf  ajoupas in the forest  m f chose three of his finest negroes as companions  melchior  was to go out every day to shoot wild pigeons coming every morning  to ask how many were needed so as not to squander powder and shot   the number ordered were always punctually brought in besides  sometimes a wild turkeypajuior other fine birds  alejos who is  now a cacao proprietor and owner of a house in arima was chosen to  go out every day except sundays with the dogs and scarcely ever  failed to bring in a lapp or quenco  aristobal was chosen for the  fishing and brought in good loads of river fish some sixteen  pounds weight  and thus the little party of cultivated gentlemen  and ladies were able to live though in poverty yet sumptuously  the bishop had given monsignor f permission to perform service on  any of his fathers estates  so a little chapel was built the  family and servants attended every sunday and many days in the  week and the country folk from great distances found their way  through the woods to hear mass in the palmthatched sanctuary of el  riposo  so did that happy family live the gentle life for some two years  till cacao rose again in price the tax on the churches was taken  off and the fs returned again to the world  but not to  civilisation and christianity  those they had carried with them  into the wilderness and those they brought back with them  unstained    chapter xiv  the education question in trinidad    when i arrived in trinidad the little island was somewhat excited  about changes in the system of education which ended in a  compromise like that at home though starting from almost the  opposite point  among the many good deeds which lord harris did for the colony was  the establishment throughout it of secular elementary ward schools  helped by government grants on a system which had i think but two  defects  first that attendance was not compulsory and next that  it was too advanced for the state of society in the island  in an ideal system secular and religious education ought i  believe to be strictly separate and given as far as possible by  different classes of men  the first is the business of scientific  men and their pupils the second of the clergy and their pupils   and the less either invades the domain of the other the better for  the community  but like all ideals it requires not only first rate workmen but firstrate material to work on an intelligent and  highminded populace who can and will think for themselves upon  religious questions and who have moreover a thirst for truth and  knowledge of every kind  with such a populace secular and  religious education can be safely parted  but can they be safely  parted in the case of a populace either degraded or still savage  given up to the lusts of the flesh with no desire for  improvement and ignorant of that moral ideal without the  influence of which as my friend professor huxley well says there  can be no true education  it is well if such a people can be made  to submit to one system of education  is it wise to try to burden  them with two at once  but if one system is to give way to the  other which is the more important  to teach them the elements of  reading writing and arithmetic or the elements of duty and  morals  and how these latter can be taught without religion is a  problem as yet unsolved  so argued some of the protestant and the whole of the roman catholic  clergy of trinidad and withdrew their support from the government  schools to such an extent that at least threefourths of the  children i understand went to no school at all  the roman catholic clergy had certainly much to urge on their own  behalf  the great majority of the coloured population of the  island besides a large proportion of the white belonged to their  creed  their influence was the chief i had almost said the only  civilising and christianising influence at work on the lower orders  of their own coloured people  they knew none so well how much the  negro required not merely to be instructed but to be reclaimed  from gross and ruinous vices  it was not a question in port of  spain any more than it is in martinique of whether the negroes  should be able to read and write but of whether they should exist  on the earth at all for a few generations longer  i say this openly  and deliberately and clergymen and police magistrates know but too  well what i mean  the priesthood were and are doing their best to  save the negro and they naturally wished to do their work on  behalf of society and of the colony in their own way and to  subordinate all teaching to that of religion which includes with  them morality and decency  they therefore opposed the government  schools because they tended it was thought to withdraw the negro  from his priests influence  i am not likely i presume to be suspected of any leaning toward  romanism  but i think a roman catholic priest would have a right to  a fair and respectful hearing if he said  you have set these people free without letting them go through  that intermediate stage of feudalism by which and by which alone  the white races of europe were educated into true freedom  i do not  blame you  you could do no otherwise  but will you hinder their  passing through that process of religious education under a  priesthood by which and by which alone the white races of europe  were educated up to something like obedience virtue and purity  these last you know we teach in the interest of the state as  well as of the negro  and if we should ask the state for aid in  order that we may teach them over and above a little reading and  writingwhich will not be taught save by us for we only shall be  listened toare we asking too much or anything which the state  will not be wise in granting us  we can have no temptation to abuse  our power for political purposes  it would not suit usto put the  matter on its lowest groundto become demagogues  for our  congregations include persons of every rank and occupation and  therefore it is our interest as much as that of the british  government that all classes should be loyal peaceable and  wealthy  as for our peculiar creed with its vivid appeals to the senses   is it not a question whether the utterly unimaginative and illogical  negro can be taught the facts of christianity or indeed any  religion at all save through his senses  is it not a question  whether we do not on the whole give him a juster and clearer  notion of the very truths which you hold in common with us than an  average protestant missionary does  your church of englandit must be understood that the relations  between the anglican and the romish clergy in trinidad are as far  as i have seen friendly and tolerant does good work among its  coloured members  but it does so by speaking as we speak with  authority  it too finds it prudent to keep up in its services  somewhat at least of that dignity even pomp which is as necessary  for the negro as it was for the halfsavage european of the early  middle age if he is to be raised above his mere natural dread of  spells witches and other harmful powers to somewhat of admiration  and reverence  as for the merely dogmatic teaching of the dissenters  we do not  believe that the mere negro really comprehends one of those  propositions whether true or false catholic or calvinist which  have been elaborated by the intellect and the emotions of races who  have gone through a training unknown to the negro  with all respect  for those who disseminate such books we think that the negro can no  more conceive the true meaning of an average dissenting hymnbook  than a sclavonian of the german marches a thousand years ago could  have conceived the meaning of st augustines confessions  for what  we see is thisthat when the personal influence of the white  missionary is withdrawn and the negro left to perpetuate his sect  on democratic principles his creed merely feeds his inordinate  natural vanity with the notion that everybody who differs from him  is going to hell while he is going to heaven whatever his morals  may be  if a roman catholic priest should say all this he would at least  have a right i believe to a respectful hearing  nay more  if he were to say you are afraid of our having too  much to do with the education of the negro because we use the  confessional as an instrument of education  now how far the  confessional is needful or useful or prudent in a highly  civilised and generally virtuous community may be an open matter   but in spite of all your english dislike of it hear our side of the  question as far as negroes and races in a similar condition are  concerned  do you know why and how the confessional arose  have  you looked for instance into the old middleage penitentials  if  so you must be aware that it arose in an age of coarseness which  seems now inconceivable in those barbarous times when the lower  classes of europe slaves or serfs especially in remote country  districts lived lives little better than those of the monkeys in  the forest and committed habitually the most fearful crimes  without any clear notion that they were doing wrong  while the  upper classes to judge from the literature which they have left  were so coarse and often so profligate in spite of nobler  instincts and a higher sense of duty that the purest and justest  spirits among them had again and again to flee from their own class  into the cloister or the hermits cell  in those days it was found necessary to ask christian people  perpetuallyhave you been doing this or that  for if you have  you are not only unfit to be called a christian you are unfit to be  called a decent human being  and this because there was every  reason to suppose that they had been doing it and that they would  not tell of themselves if they could possibly avoid it  so the  confessional arose as a necessary element for educating savages  into common morality and decency  and for the same reasons we  employ it among the negroes of trinidad  have no fears lest we  should corrupt the minds of the young  they see and hear more harm  daily than we could ever teach them were we so devilishly minded   there is vice now rampant and notorious in port of spain which  eludes even our confessional  let us alone to do our best  god  knows we are trying to do it according to our light  if any roman catholic clergyman in port of spain spoke thus to me and i have been spoken to in words not unlike thesei could only  answer gods blessing on you and all your efforts whether i  agree with you in detail or not  the roman catholic inhabitants of the island are to the protestant  as about 25 to 1 288  the whole of the more educated portion of  them as far as i could ascertain are willing to entrust the  education of their children to the clergy  the archbishop of  trinidad monsignor gonin who has jurisdiction also in st lucia  st vincent grenada and tobago is a man not only of great energy  and devotion but of cultivation and knowledge of the world having  i was told attained distinction as a barrister elsewhere before he  took holy orders  a group of clergy is working under himamong  them a personal friend of mineable and ready to do their best to  mend a state of things in which most of the children in the island  born nominal roman catholics but the majority illegitimate were  growing up not only in ignorance but in heathendom and brutality   meanwhile the clergy were in want of funds  there were no funds at  all indeed which would enable them to set up in remote forest  districts a religious school side by side with the secular ward  school and the colony could not well be asked for government grants  to two sets of schools at once  in face of these circumstances the  late governor thought fit to take action on the very able and  interesting report of mr j p keenan one of the chiefs of  inspection of the irish national board of education who had been  sent out as special commissioner to inquire into the state of  education in the island to modify lord harriss plan however  excellent in itself and to pass an ordinance by which government  aid was extended to private elementary schools of whatever  denomination provided they had duly certificated teachers were  accessible to all children of the neighbourhood without distinction  of religion or race and offered solid guarantees for abstinence  from proselytism and intolerance by subjecting their rules and  course of teaching to the board of education and empowering that  board at any moment to cancel the certificate of the teacher  in  the wards in which such schools were founded and proved to be  working satisfactorily the secular ward schools were to be  discontinued  but the government reserved to itself the power of  reopening a secular school in the ward in case the private school  turned out a failure  such is a short sketch of an ordinance which seems to me at least  a rational and fair compromise identical mutatis mutandis with  that embodied in mr forsters new education act and the only one  by which the lower orders of trinidad were likely to get any  education whatever  it was received of course with applause by  the roman catholics and by a great number of the protestants of the  colony  but as was to be expected it met with strong expressions  of dissent from some of the protestant gentry and clergy especially  from one gentleman who attacked the new scheme with an acuteness  and humour which made even those who differed from him regret that  such remarkable talents had no wider sphere than a little island of  fortyfive miles by sixty  an accession of power to the roman  catholic clergy was of course dreaded and all the more because it  was known that the scheme met with the approval of the archbishop  that it was indeed a compromise with the requests made in a  petition which that prelate had lately sent in to the governor a  petition which seems to me most rational and temperate  it was  argued too that though the existing actthat of 1851had more or  less failed it might still succeed if lord harriss plan was fully  carried out and the choice of the ward schoolmaster the selection  of ward schoolbooks and the direction of the course of  instruction were vested in local committees  the simple answer  was that eighteen years had elapsed and the colony had done  nothing in that direction that the great majority of children in  the island did not go to school at all while those who did attended  most irregularly and learnt little or nothing 290 that the  secular system of education had not attracted as it was hoped the  children of the hindoo immigrants of whom scarcely one was to be  found in a ward school that the ward schoolmasters were generally  inefficient and the central board of education inactive that there  was no rigorous local supervision and no local interest felt in the  schools that there were fewer children in the ward schools in 1868  than there had been in 1863 in spite of the rapid increase of  population  and all this for the simple reason which the archbishop  had pointed outthe want of religious instruction  as was to be  expected the good people of the island being most of them  religious people also felt no enthusiasm about schools where little  was likely to be taught beyond the three royal rs  i believe they were wrong  any teaching which involves moral  discipline is better than mere anarchy and idleness  but they had a  right to their opinion and a right too being the great majority of  the islanders to have that opinion respected by the governor  even  now it will be but too likely i think that the establishment and  superintendence of schools in remote districts will devolveas it  did in europe during the middle ageentirely on the different  clergies simply by default of laymen of sufficient zeal for the  welfare of the coloured people  be that as it may the ordinance  has become law and i have faith enough in the loyalty of the good  folk of trinidad to believe that they will do their best to make it  work  if indeed the present ordinance does not work it is difficult to  conceive any that will  it seems exactly fitted for the needs of  trinidad  i do not say that it is fitted for the needs of any and  every country  in ireland for instance such a system would be in  my opinion simply retrograde  the irishman to his honour has  passed centuries since beyond the stage at which he requires to be  educated by a priesthood in the primary laws of religion and  morality  his morality ison certain important pointssuperior to  that of almost any people  what he needs is to be trained to  loyalty and order to be brought more in contact with the secular  science and civilisation of the rest of europe  and that must be  done by a secular and not by an ecclesiastical system of education  the higher education in trinidad seems in a more satisfactory  state than the elementary  the young ladies many of them go  homeie to england or francefor their schooling and some of  the young men to oxford cambridge london or edinburgh  the  gilchrist trust of the university of london has lately offered  annually a scholarship of 100 pounds a year for three years to lads  from the west india colonies the examinations for it to be held in  jamaica barbadoes trinidad and demerara and in trinidad itself  two exhibitions of 150 pounds a year each tenable for three years  are attainable by lads of the queens collegiate school to help  them toward their studies at a british university  the collegiate school received aid from the state to the amount of  3000 pounds per annumless by the students fees and was open to  all denominations  but in it again the secular system would not  work  the great majority of roman catholic lads were educated at  st marys college which received no state aid at all  417  catholic pupils at the former school as against 111 at the latter  wereas mr keenan saysa poor expression of confidence or favour  on the part of the colonists  the roman catholic religion was the  creed of the great majority of the islanders and especially of the  wealthier and better educated of the coloured families  justice  seemed to demand that if state aid were given it should be given to  all creeds alike and prudence certainly demanded that the  respectable young men of trinidad should not be arrayed in two alien  camps in which the differences of creed were intensified by those  of race andin one camp at leastby a sense of something very  like injustice on the part of a protestant and it must always be  remembered originally conquering government  to give the lads as  much as possible the same interests the same views to make them  all alike feel that they were growing up not merely english  subjects but english men was one of the most important social  problems in trinidad  and the simplest way of solving it was to  educate them as much as possible side by side in the same school on  terms of perfect equality  the late governor therefore with the advice and consent of his  council determined to develop the queens collegiate school into a  new royal college which was to be open to all creeds and races  without distinction  but upon such terms as will it is hoped  secure the willing attendance of roman catholic scholars 291  not  only it but schools duly affiliated to it are to receive  government aid and four exhibitions of 150 pounds a year each  instead of two are granted to young men going home to a british  university  the college was inauguratedi am sorry to say after i  had left the islandin june 1870 by the governor in the presence  of to quote the port of spain gazette the council consisting of   the honourable the chief judge needham j scott bushe colonial secretary charles w warner cb e j eagles f warner dr l a a verteuil henry court m maxwell philip his honour mr justice fitzgerald andre bernard esq   the last five of these gentlemen being i believe roman catholics   most of the board of education were also present the principal and  masters of the collegiate school the superiors and reverend  professors of st marys college the clergy of the church of  england in the island the leading professional men and merchants  etc and especially a large number of the roman catholic gentry of  the island mm ambard oconnor giuseppi laney farfan  gillineau rat pantin leotaud besson fraser paull hobson  garcia dr padron etc  i quote their names from the gazette in  the order in which they occur  many of them i have not the honour  of knowing  but judging of those whom i do not know by those whom i  do i should say that their presence at the inauguration was a solid  proof that the foundation of the new college was a just and politic  measure opening as the gazette well says a great future to the  youth of all creeds in the colony  the late governors speech on the occasion i shall print entire  it  will explain the circumstances of the case far better than i can do  and it may possibly meet with interest and approval from those who  like to hear sound sense spoken even in a small colony  we are met here today to inaugurate the royal college an  institution in which the benefits of a sound education i trust  will be secured to protestants and roman catholics alike without  the slightest compromise of their respective principles  the queens collegiate school of which this college is in some  sort an outgrowth and development was founded with the same  object  but successful as it has been in other respects it cannot  be said to have altogether attained this  st marys college was founded by private enterprise with a  different view and to meet the wants of those who objected to the  collegiate school  it has long been felt the existence of two collegesone the  smaller almost entirely supported by the state the other the  larger wholly without state aidwas objectionable and that the  whole question of secondary education presented a most difficult  problem  some saw its solution in the withdrawal of all state aid from  higher education others in the establishment by the state of two  distinct denominational colleges  i have elsewhere explained the reason why i consider both these  suggestions faulty and their probable effect bad the one being  certain to check and discourage superior education altogether the  other likely to substitute inefficient for efficient teaching and  small exclusive schools for a wide national institution  i knew that whilst insuperable objections existed to a combined  education in all subjects that objection had its limits  that in  america and in germany i had seen protestants and catholics learning  side by side that in mauritius a college numbering 700 pupils  partly protestants partly roman catholics existed and that  similar establishments were not uncommon elsewhere  i therefore determined to endeavour to effect the establishment of  a college where combined study might be carried on in those branches  of education with respect to which no objection to such a course was  felt and to support with government aid and bring under government  supervision those establishments where those branches in which a  separate education was deemed necessary were taught  i had when last at home some anxious conferences with the highest  ecclesiastical authority of the roman catholic church in england on  the subject and came to a complete understanding with him in  respect to it  that distinguished prelate himself a man of the  highest university eminence is not one to be indifferent to the  interests of learning  his position his known opinions afford a  guarantee that nothing sanctioned by him could even by the most  scrupulous be considered in the least degree inconsistent with the  interests of his church or his religion  he expressed a strong preference for a totally separate education   but candidly admitted the objections to such a course in a small and  not very wealthy island and drew a wide distinction between  combination for all purposes and for some only  there were certain courses of instruction in which combined  instruction could not possibly be given consistently with due regard  to the faith of the pupils there were others where it was difficult  to decide whether it could or could not properly be given there  were others again where it might be certainly given without  objection  on this understanding the plan carried into effect is based  but  the legislature have gone far beyond what was then agreed and  whilst archbishop manning would have assented to an arrangement  which would have excluded certain branches only of education from  the common course the law as now in force allows exemption from  attendance on all provided competent instruction is given to the  pupils in the same branches elsewhere till in fact all that  remains obligatory is attendance at examinations and at the course  of instruction in one or more of four given branches of education  if it should so happen that no adequate teaching in that particular  branch is given in the pupils own school  a scheme more liberala bond more elasticcould hardly have been  devised capable of effecting if desired the closest union capable of being stretched to almost any degree of slight  connection and even if some catholics would still prefer a wholly  separate system they must if candid men admit that the protestant  population here have a right to demand that they should not be  called on to surrender in order to satisfy a mere preference the  great advantages they derive from a united college under state  control with its efficient staff and national character  if religious difficulties are met and conscientious scruples are  not wounded a sacrifice of preferences must often be made  private  wishes must often yield to the public good  in the first instance all the boys of the former collegiate school  have become students of the college but probably a school of a  similar character but affiliated to the college will shortly be  formed in which a large number of those boys will be included  that the headship of the college should be entrusted to the  principal of the queens collegiate school will i am sure be  universally felt to be only a just tribute to the zeal efficiency  and success with which he has hitherto laboured in his office  whilst in addition to these qualifications he possesses the no  less important one for the post he is about to fill of a mind  singularly impartial just liberal and candid  i hope that the other professors of the college may be taken from  affiliated schools indiscriminately the lectures being given as may  be most convenient and as may be arranged by the college council  it is intended by the college council that the fees charged for  attendance at the royal college should be much lower than those  heretofore charged at the queens collegiate school  i do not  believe that the mere financial loss will be great whilst i believe  a good education will by this means be placed within the reach of  many who cannot now afford it  i hopebut i express only my own personal wish not that of the  council which as yet has pronounced no opinionthat some of the  changes introduced in most states of modern education will be made  here and that especial attention will be given to the teaching of  some of the eastern languages  it is almost impossible to overrate the importance of this both to  the government and the communityto the government as enabling it  to avail itself of the services of honest competent and  trustworthy interpreters and to the general community as relieving  both employer and employed from the necessity of depending on the  interpretation of men not always very competent nor always very  scrupulous whose mistakes or errors whether wilful or accidental  may often effect much injustice and on whose fidelity life may not  unfrequently depend  i thank the members of the college council for having accepted a  task which will at first involve much delicate tact forbearance  caution and firmness and the exercise of talents i know them to  possess and which i am confident will be freely bestowed in working  out the success of the institution committed to their care  i thank the principal and his staff for their past exertions and i  count with confidence on their future labours  i thank the parents who by their presence have manifested their  interest in our undertaking and their wishes for its success and i  especially thank the ladies who have been drawn within these walls  by graver attractions than those which generally bring us together  at this building  i rejoice to see here the superior of st marys college and the  goodly array of those under his charge and i do so for many  reasons  i rejoice because being not as yet affiliated or in any way  officially connected with the royal college their presence is a  spontaneous evidence of their goodwill and kindly feeling and of  the spirit in which they have been disposed to meet the efforts made  to consult their feelings in the arrangements of this institution a  spirit yet further evinced by the fact that the superior has  informed me that he is about voluntarily to alter the course of  study pursued in st marys college so as more nearly to assimilate  it to that pursued here  i rejoice because in their presence i hail a sign that the  affiliation which is i believe desired by the great body of the  roman catholic community in this island and to which it has been  shown no insuperable religious obstacle exists will take place at  no more distant day than is necessary to secure the approval the  naturally requisite approval of ecclesiastical authority elsewhere  i rejoice at their presence because it enables me before this  company to express my high sense of the courage and liberality which  have maintained their college for years past without any aid  whatever from the state and in spite of manifold obstacles and  discouragements have caused it to increase in numbers and  efficiency  i rejoice at their presence because i desire to see the youth of  trinidad of every race without indifference to their respective  creeds brought together on all possible occasions whether for  recreation or for work because i wish to see them engaged in  friendly rivalry in their studies now as they will hereafter be in  the world which i desire to see them enter not as strangers to  each other but as friends and fellowcitizens  i rejoice because their presence enables me to take a personal  farewell of so many of those who will in the next generation be the  planters the merchants the official and professional men of  trinidad  by the time that you are men all the petty jealousies  all the mean resentments of this our day will have faded into the  oblivion which is their proper bourn  but the work now accomplished  will not i trust so fade  they will melt and perish as the snow  of the north would before our tropical sun  but the college will i  trust remain as the rock on which the snow rests and which remains  uninjured by the heat unmoved by the passing storm  may it endure  and strengthen as it passes from the first feeble beginnings of this  its infancy to a vigorous youth and maturity  you will sometimes in  days to come recall the inauguration of your college and perhaps  not forget that its founder prayed you to bear in mind the truth  that you will find even now the truest satisfaction in the strict  discharge of duty that he urged you to form high and unselfish  aimsto seek noble and worthy objects and as you enter on the  world and all its tossing sea of jealousies strife division and  distrust to heed the lesson which an apostle whose words we all  alike revere has taught us if ye bite and devour one another  take ye heed that ye be not consumed one of another  here we hope a point of union has been found which may last  through life and that whilst every man cherishes a love for his own  peculiar school all alike will have an interest in their common  college all alike be proud of a national institution jealous of  its honour and eager to advance its welfare  it is a common thing to hear the bitterness of religious discord  here deplored  i for one looking back on the history of past  years cannot think as some seem to do that it has increased  on  the contrary it seems to me that it has greatly diminished in  violence when displayed and that its displays are far less  frequent  such i believe will be more and more the case and that  whilst religious distinctions will remain the same and  conscientious convictions unaltered social and party differences  consequent on those distinctions and convictions will daily  diminish that all alike will more and more feel in how many things  they can think and act together for the benefit of their common  country and of the community of which they all are members how  they can be glad together in her prosperity and be sad together in  the day of her distress and work together at all times to promote  her good  that this college is calculated to aid in a great degree  in effecting this happy result i for one cannot entertain the  shadow of a doubt  esto perpetua  esto perpetua  but there remains i believe more yet to be done  for education in the west indies and that is to carry out mr  keenans scheme for a central university for the whole of the west  indian colonies 297a as a focus of higher education and a focus  also of cultivated public opinion round which all that is  shrewdest and noblest in the islands shall rally and find strength  in moral and intellectual union  i earnestly recommend all west  indians to ponder mr keenans weighty words on this matter  believing that as they do so even stronger reasons than he has  given for establishing such an institution will suggest themselves  to west indian minds  i am not aware nor would the reader care much to know what schools  there may be in port of spain for protestant young ladies  i can  only say that to judge from the young ladies themselves the  schools must be excellent  but one school in port of spain i am  bound in honour as a clergyman of the church of england not to  pass by without earnest approval namely the convent as it is  usually called  it was established in 1836 under the patronage of  the roman catholic bishop the right rev dr macdonnel and was  founded by the ladies of st joseph a religious sisterhood which  originated in france a few years since for the special purpose of  diffusing instruction through the colonies 297b  this  institution which dr de verteuil says is unique in the west  indies besides keeping up two large girls schools for poor  children gave in 1857 a higher education to 120 girls of the middle  and upper classes and the number has much increased since then  it  is impossible to doubt that this convent has been a blessing to the  colony  at the very time when just after slavery was abolished  society throughout the island was in the greatest peril these good  ladies came to supply a want which under the peculiar circumstances  of trinidad could only have been supplied by the selfsacrifice of  devoted women  the convent has not only spread instruction and  religion among the wealthier coloured class  but it has done more  it has been a centre of true civilisation purity virtue where one  was but too much needed and has preserved doubtless hundreds of  young creatures from serious harm and that without interfering in  any wise i should think with their duty to their parents  on the  contrary many a mother in port of spain must have found in the  convent a protection for her daughters better than she herself  could give against influences to which she herself had been but too  much exposed during the evil days of slavery influences which are  not yet alas extinct in port of spain  creoles will understand my  words and will understand too why i protestant though i am bid  heartily god speed to the good ladies of st joseph  to the anglican clergy meanwhile whom i met in the west indies i  am bound to offer my thanks not for courtesies shown to methat is  a slight matterbut for the worthy fashion in which they seem to be  upholding the honour of the good old church in the colonies  in  port of spain i heard and saw enough of their work to believe that  they are in nowise less activemore active they cannot bethan if  they were seaport clergymen in england  the services were performed  thoroughly well with a certain stateliness which is not only  allowable but necessary in a colony where the majority of the  congregation are coloured but without the least foppery or  extravagance  the very best sermon perhaps for matter and manner  which i ever heard preached to unlettered folk was preached by a  young clergymana west indian bornin the great church of port of  spain and he had no lack of hearers and those attentive ones  the  great church was always a pleasant sight with its crowded  congregation of every hue all well dressed and with the universal  west indian look of comfort and its noble span of roof overhead  all cut from island timberanother proof of what the woodcarver  may effect in the island hereafter  certainly distractions were  frequent and troublesome at least to a newcomer  a large centipede  would come out and take a hurried turn round the governors seat or  a bat would settle in broad daylight in the curates hood or one  had to turn away ones eyes lest they should beholdnot vanity  butthe magnificent head of a cabbagepalm just outside the  opposite window with the black vultures trying to sit on the  footstalks in a high wind and slipping down and flopping up again  half the service through  but one soon got accustomed to the  strange sights though it was to say the least somewhat startling  to find on christmas day the altar and pulpit decked with  exquisite tropic flowers and each doorway arched over with a single  pair of coconut leaves fifteen feet high  the christmas day communion too was one not easily to be  forgotten  at least 250 persons mostly coloured many as black as  jet attended and were i must say for them most devout in manner   pleasant it was to see the large proportion of men among them many  young white men of the middle and upper class and still more  pleasant too to see that all hues and ranks knelt side by side  without the least distinction  one trio touched me deeply  an old  ladyi know not who she waswith the unmistakable long delicate  once beautiful features of a highbred west indian of the ancien  regime came and knelt reverently feebly sadly between two old  negro women  one of them seemed her maid  both of them might have  been once her slaves  here at least they were equals  true  equalitythe consecration of humility not the consecration of  envyfirst appeared on earth in the house of god and at the altar  of christ  and i question much whether it will linger long in any  spot on earth where that house and that altar are despised  it is  easy to propose an equality without christianity as easy as to  propose to kick down the ladder by which you have climbed or to saw  off the bough on which you sit  as easy and as safe  but i must not forget while speaking of education in trinidad one  truly educational establishment which i visited at tacarigua  namely a coolie orphan home assisted by the state but set up and  kept up almost entirely by the zeal of one manthe rev   richards brother of the excellent rector of trinity church port of  spain  this good man having no children of his own has taken for  his children the little brown immigrants who losing father and  mother are but too apt to be neglected by their own folk  at the  foot of the mountains beside a clear swift stream amid scenery and  vegetation which an european millionaire might envy he has built a  smart little quadrangle with a long low house on one side for the  girls on the other for the boys a schoolroom which was as well  supplied with books maps and pictures as any average national  school in england and adjoining the buildings a garden where the  boys are taught to work  a matronwho seemed thoroughly worthy of  her postconducts the whole and comfort cleanliness and order  were visible everywhere  a pleasant sight but the pleasantest  sight of all was to see the little brighteyed brown darlings  clustering round him who was indeed their father in god who had  delivered them from misery and loneliness andin the case of the  girlstoo probably vice likewise and drawn them by love to  civilisation and christianity  the children as fast as they grow  up are put out to domestic service and the great majority of the  boys at least turn out well  the girls i was told are curiously  inferior to the boys in intellect and force of character an  inferiority which is certainly not to be found in negroes among  whom the two sexes are more on a par not only intellectually but  physically also than among any race which i have seen  one  instance indeed we saw of the success of the school  a young  creature brought up there and well married near by came in during  our visit to show off her first baby to the matron and the children  as pretty a mother and babe as one could well see  only we  regretted that in obedience to the supposed demands of  civilisation and of a rise in life she had discarded the graceful  and modest hindoo dress of her ancestresses for a french bonnet and  all that accompanies it  the transfiguration added one must  charitably suppose to her selfrespect if so it must be condoned  on moral grounds  but in an aesthetic view she had made a great  mistake  in remembrance of our visit a little brown child some three or  four years old who had been christened that day was named after  me and i was glad to have my name connected even in so minute an  item with an institution which at all events delivers children from  the fancy that they can without being good or doing good  conciliate the upper powers by hanging garlands on a trident inside  a hut or putting red dust on a stump of wood outside it while they  stare in and mumble prayers to they know not what of gilded wood  the coolie temples are curious places to those who have never before  been face to face with real heathendom  their mark is generally a  long bamboo with a pennon atop outside a low dark hut with a broad  flat verandah or rather shed outside the door  under the latter  opposite each door if i recollect rightly is a stone or small  stump on which offerings are made of red dust and flowers  from it  the worshippers can see the images within  the white man stooping  enters the temple  the attendant priest so far from forbidding  him seems highly honoured especially if the visitor give him a  shilling and points out in the darknessfor there is no light  save through the low doorsthree or four squatting abominations  usually gilded  sometimes these have been carved in the island   sometimes the poor folk have taken the trouble to bring them all the  way from india on board ship  hung beside them on the walls are  little pictures often very well executed in the miniaturelike  hindoo style by native artists in the island  large brass pots  which have some sacred meaning stand about and with them a curious  tridentshaped stand about four feet high on the horns of which  garlands of flowers are hung as offerings  the visitor is told that  the male figures are mahadeva and the female kali  we could hear  of no other deities  i leave it to those who know indian mythology  better than i do to interpret the meaningor rather the past  meaning for i suspect it means very little nowof all this  trumpery and nonsense on which the poor folk seem to spend much  money  it was impossible of course even if one had understood  their language to find out what notions they attached to it all  and all i could do on looking at these heathen idol chapels in the  midst of a christian and civilised land was to ponder in sadness  and astonishment over a puzzle as yet to me inexplicable namely  how human beings first got into their heads the vagary of  worshipping images  i fully allow the cleverness and apparent  reasonableness of m comtes now famous theory of the development of  religions  i blame no one for holding it  but i cannot agree with  it  the more of a saine appreciation as m comte calls it i  bring to bear on the known facts the more i let my thought play  freely around them the more it is inconceivable to me according  to any laws of the human intellect which i have seen at work that  savage or halfsavage folk should have invented idolatries  i do  not believe that fetishism is the parent of idolatry but ratheras  i have said elsewherethat it is the dregs and remnants of  idolatry  the idolatrous nations now as always are not the savage  nations but those who profess a very ancient and decaying  civilisation  the hebrew scriptures uniformly represent the non idolatrous and monotheistic peoples from abraham to cyrus as lower  in what we now call the scale of civilisation than the idolatrous  and polytheistic peoples about them  may not the contrast between  the patriarchs and the pharaohs david and the philistines the  persians and the babylonians mark a law of history of wider  application than we are wont to suspect  but if so what was the  parent of idolatry  for a natural genesis it must have had whether  it be a healthy and necessary development of the human mindas some  hold not without weighty arguments on their side or whether it be  a diseased and merely fungoid growth as i believe it to be  i  cannot hold that it originated in natureworship simply because i  can find no evidence of such an origin  there is rather evidence  if the statements of the idolaters themselves are to be taken that  it originated in the worship of superior races by inferior races  possibly also in the worship of works of art which those races  dying out had left behind them and which the lower race while  unable to copy them believed to be possessed of magical powers  derived from a civilisation which they had lost  after a while the  priesthood which has usually in all ages and countries proclaimed  itself the depository of a knowledge and a civilisation lost to the  mass of the people may have gained courage to imitate these old  works of art with proper improvements for the worse and have  persuaded the people that the new idols would do as well as the old  ones  would that some truly learned man would let his thoughts  play freely round this view of the mystery and see what can be  made out of it  but whatever is made out on either view it will  still remain a mysteryto me at least as much as to isaiah of old how this utterly abnormal and astonishing animal called man first  got into his foolish head that he could cut a thing out of wood or  stone which would listen to him and answer his prayers  yet so it  is so it has been for unnumbered ages  man may be defined as a  speaking animal or a cooking animal  he is best i fear defined  as an idolatrous animal and so much the worse for him  but what if  that very fact diseased as it is should be a sure proof that he is  more than an animal    chapter xv  the racesa letter    dear  i have been to the races  not to bet nor to see the  horses run  not even to see the fair ladies on the grand stand in  all the newest fashions of paris via new york  but to wander en  mufti among the crowd outside and behold the humours of men  and i  must say that their humours were very good humours far better it  seemed to me than those of an english raceground  not that i have  set foot on one for thirty years but at railway stations and  elsewhere one cannot help seeing what manner of folk beside mere  holiday folk rich or poor affect english races or help  pronouncing them if physiognomy be any test of character the most  degraded beings even some of those smartdressed men who carry bags  with their names on them which our pseudocivilisation has yet done  itself the dishonour of producing  now of that class i saw  absolutely none  i do not suppose that the brown fellows who hung  about the horses whether barbadians or trinidad men were of very  angelic morals  but they looked like heroes compared with the  bloated hangdog roughs and quasigrooms of english races  as for  the sporting gentlemen not having the honour to know them i can  only say that they looked like gentlemen and that i wish in all  courtesy that they had been more wisely employed  but the negro or the coloured man of the lower class was in his  glory  he was smart clean shiny happy according to his light   he got up into trees and clustered there grinning from ear to ear   he bawled about island horses and barbadian horsesfor the  barbadians mustered strong and a fight was expected which  however never came off he sang songs possibly some of them  extempore like that which amused ones childhood concerning a once  notable event in a certain island   i went to da place to see da horserace i see mr barton awipin ob his face  run allright run for your life see mr barton a comin wid a knife  oh mr barton i sarry for your loss if you no believe me i tie my head across   that isgo into mourning  but no one seemed inclined to tie their  heads across that day  the coolies seemed as merry as the negroes  even about the face of the chinese there flickered at times a  feeble ray of interest  the coloured women wandered about in showy prints great  crinolines and gorgeous turbans  the coolie women sat in groups on  the glassah isle of the blest where people can sit on the grass  in januarylike live flower beds of the most splendid and yet  harmonious hues  as for jewels of gold as well as silver there  were many there on arms ankles necks and noses which made white  ladies fresh from england break the tenth commandment  i wandered about looking at the live flower beds and giving  passing glances into booths which i longed to enter and hear what  sort of human speech might be going on therein but i was deterred  first by the thought that much of the speech might not be over  edifying and next by the smells especially by that most hideous of  all smellsnew rum  at last i came to a crowd and in the midst of it one of those  great french merrygorounds turned by machinery with pictures of  languishing ladies round the central column  all the way from the  champs elysees the huge piece of fools tackle had lumbered and  creaked hither across the sea to martinique and was now making the  round of the islands and a very profitable round to judge from the  number of its customers  the hobbyhorses swarmed with negresses  and hindoos of the lower order  the negresses i am sorry to say  forgot themselves kicked up their legs shouted to the bystanders  and were altogether incondite  the hindoo women though showing  much more of their limbs than the negresses kept them gracefully  together drew their veils round their heads and sat coyly half  frightened half amused to the delight of their papas or husbands  who had in some cases to urge them to get up and ride while they  stood by as on guard with the long hardwood quarter staff in hand  as i looked on considered what a strange creature man is and  wondered what possible pleasure these women could derive from being  whirled round till they were giddy and stupid i saw an old  gentleman seemingly absorbed in the very same reflection  he was  dressed in dark blue with a straw hat  he stood with his hands  behind his back his knees a little bent and a sort of wise half sad halfhumorous smile upon his aquiline highcheekboned  features  i took him for an old scot a canny austere mana man  too who had known sorrow and profited thereby and i drew near to  him  but as he turned his head deliberately round to me i beheld  to my astonishment the unmistakable features of a chinese  he and i  looked each other full in the face without a word and i fancied  that we understood each other about the merrygoround and many  things besides  and then we both walked off different ways as  having seen enough and more than enough  was he after all an  honest man and true  or had he like ah sin in mr bret hartes  delectable ballad with the smile that was childlike and bland   in his sleeves which were large    twentyfour packs of cards andon his nails which were taper    whats common in tapersthats wax   i know not for the chinese visage is unfathomable  but i incline  to this day to the more charitable judgment for the mans face  haunted me and haunts me still and i am weak enough to believe  that i should know the man and like him if i met him in another  planet a thousand years hence  then i walked back under the blazing sun across the savanna over  the sensitive plants and the molecrickets nests while the great  locusts whirred up before me at every step toward the archway  between the bambooclumps and the red sentry shining like a spark  of fire beneath its deep shadow and found on my way a dying  racehorse with a group of coloured men round him whom i advised in  vain to do the one thing needfulput a blanket over him to keep off  the sun for the poor thing had fallen from sunstroke so i left  them to jabber and do nothing  asking myselfis the human race in  the matter of amusements as civilised as it wassay three thousand  years ago  people have certainlyquite of late yearsgiven up  going to see cocks fight or heretics burnt  but that is mainly  because the heretics just now make the lawsin favour of themselves  and the cocks  but are our amusements to be compared with those of  the old greeks with the one exception of liking to hear really good  music  yet that fruit of civilisation is barely twenty years old  and we owe its introduction be it always remembered to the  germans  french civilisation signifies practically certainly in  the new world little save balletgirls billiardtables and thin  boots  english civilisation little save horseracing and cricket   the latter sport is certainly blameless nay in the west indies  laudable and even heroic when played as on the savanna here under  a noonday sun which feels hot enough to cook a muttonchop  but  with all respect for cricket one cannot help looking back at the  old games of greece and questioning whether man has advanced much  in the art of amusing himself rationally and wholesomely  i had reason to ask the same question that evening as we sat in the  cool verandah watching the fireflies flicker about the treetops  and listening to the weary din of the tomtoms which came from all  sides of the savanna save our own drowning the screeching and  snoring of the toads and even at times the screams of an european  band which was playing a combination tune near the grand stand  half a mile off  to the music of tomtom and chacchac the coloured folk would dance  perpetually till ten oclock after which time the rites of mylitta  are silenced by the policeman for the sake of quiet folk in bed   they are but too apt however to break out again with fresh din  about one in the morning under the excusedis am not last night  policeman  dis am nother day  well  but is the nightly tomtom dance so much more absurd than the  nightly ball which is now considered an integral element of white  civilisation  a few centuries hence may not both of them be looked  back on as equally sheer barbarisms  these tomtom dances are not easily seen  the only glance i ever  had of them was from the steep slope of once beautiful belmont   sitting on a hill apart my host and i were discoursing not of  fate freewill freeknowledge absolute but of a question almost  as mysteriousthe doings of the parasolants who marched up and  down their trackways past us and whether these doings were guided  by an intellect differing from ours only in degree but not in  kind  a hundred yards below we espied a dance in a negro garden a  few couples mostly of women pousetting to each other with violent  and ungainly stampings to the music of tomtom and chacchac if  music it can be called  some power over the emotions it must have  for the negroes are said to be gradually maddened by it and white  people have told me that its very monotony if listened to long is  strangely exciting like the monotony of a bagpipe drone or of a  drum  what more went on at the dance we could not see and if we  had tried we should probably not have been allowed to see  the  negro is chary of admitting white men to his amusements and no  wonder  if a london ballroom were suddenly invaded by phoebus  ares and hermes such as homer drew them they would probably be  unwelcome guests at least in the eyes of the gentlemen  the latter  would i suspect thoroughly sympathise with the negro in the old  story intelligible enough to those who know what is the favourite  food of a west indian chicken  well john so they gave a dignity ball on the estate last night  yes massa very nice ball  plenty of pretty ladies massa  why did you not ask me john  i like to look at pretty ladies as  well as you  ah massa  when cockroach give a ball him no ask da fowls  great and worthy exertions are made every london season for the  conversion of the negro and the heathen and the abolition of their  barbarous customs and dances  it is to be hoped that the negro and  the heathen will some day show their gratitude to us by sending  missionaries hither to convert the london season itself dances and  all and assist it to take the beam out of its own eye in return  for having taken the mote out of theirs    chapter xvi  a provision ground    the provision grounds of the negroes were very interesting  i had  longed to behold alive and growing fruits and plants which i had  heard so often named and seen so often figured that i had expected  to recognise many of them at first sight and found in nine cases  out of ten that i could not  again i had longed to gather some  hints as to the possibility of carrying out in the west indian  islands that system of petite cultureof small spade farming which i have long regarded with mr john stuart mill and others as  not only the ideal form of agriculture but perhaps the basis of any  ideal rustic civilisation  and what scanty and imperfect facts i  could collect i set down here  it was a pleasant sensation to have day after day old names  translated for me into new facts  pleasant at least to me  not so  pleasant i fear to my kind companions whose courtesy i taxed to  the uttermost by stopping to look over every fence and ask what  is that  and that  let the reader who has a taste for the  beautiful as well as the useful in horticulture do the same and  look in fancy over the hedge of the nearest provision ground  there are orangetrees laden with fruit  who knows not them and  that awkwardboughed tree with huge green fruit and deeplycut  leaves a foot or more acrossleaves so grand that as one of our  party often suggested their form ought to be introduced into  architectural ornamentation and to take the place of the greek  acanthus which they surpass in beautythat is of course a bread fruit tree  that roundheaded tree with dark rich portugal laurel foliage  arranged in stars at the end of each twig is the mango always a  beautiful object whether in orchard or in open park  in the west  indies as far as i have seen the mango has not yet reached the  huge size of its ancestors in hindostan  thereto judge at least  from photographsthe mango must be indeed the queen of trees  growing to the size of the largest english oak and keeping always  the round oaklike form  rich in resplendent foliage and still  more rich in fruit the tree easily became encircled with an  atmosphere of myth in the fancy of the imaginative hindoo  that tree with upright branches and large dark glossy leaves  tiled upwards along them is the mammee sapota 311a beautiful  likewise  and what is the next like an evergreen peach shedding  from the under side of every leaf a golden lightcall it not shade   a starapple 311b and that young thing which you may often see  grown into a great timbertree with leaves like a spanish chestnut  is the avocado 311c or as some call it alligator pear  this  with the glossy leaves somewhat like the mammee sapota is a  sapodilla 311d and that with leaves like a great myrtle and  bright fleshcoloured fruit a malaccaapple or perhaps a rose apple 311e  its neighbour with large leaves gray and rough  underneath flowers as big as your two hands with greenish petals  and a purple eye followed by fat scaly yellow apples is the sweet sop 311f and that privetlike bush with little flowers and green  berries a guava 311g of which you may eat if you will as you may  of the rest  the truth however must be told  these west indian fruits are  most of them still so little improved by careful culture and  selection of kinds that not one of them as far as we have tried  them is to be compared with an average strawberry plum or pear  but how beautiful they are all and each after their kinds  what a  joy for a man to stand at his door and simply look at them growing  leafing blossoming fruiting without pause through the perpetual  summer in his little garden of the hesperides where as in those  of the phoenicians of old pear grows ripe on pear and fig on  fig for ever and for ever  now look at the vegetables  at the bananas and plantains first of  all  a strangers eye would not distinguish them  the practical  difference between them is that the plaintain 311h bears large  fruits which require cooking the banana 312a smaller and sweeter  fruits which are eaten raw  as for the plant on which they grow  no mere words can picture the simple grandeur and grace of a form  which startles me whenever i look steadily at it  for however  common it isnone commoner hereit is so unlike aught else so  perfect in itself that like a palm it might well have become in  early ages an object of worship  and who knows that it has not  who knows that there have not been  races who looked on it as the red indians looked on mondamin the  maizeplant as a gift of a godperhaps the incarnation of a god   who knows  whence did the ancestors of that plant come  what was  its wild stock like ages ago  it is wild nowhere now on earth  it  stands alone and unique in the vegetable kingdom with distant  cousins but no brother kinds  it has been cultivated so long that  though it flowers and fruits it seldom or never seeds and is  propagated entirely by cuttings  the only spot as far as i am  aware in which it seeds regularly and plentifully is the remote  and till of late barbarous andaman islands in the bay of bengal  312b  there it regularly springs up in the second growth after the forest  is cleared and bears fruits full of seed as close together as they  can be pressed  how did the plant get there  was it once  cultivated there by a race superior to the now utterly savage  islanders and at an epoch so remote that it had not yet lost the  power of seeding  are the andamans its original home or rather  was its original home that great southern continent of which the  andamans are perhaps a remnant  does not this fact as well as the  broader fact that different varieties of the plantain and banana  girdle the earth round at the tropics and have girdled it as long  as records go back hint at a time when there was a tropic continent  or archipelago round the whole equator and at a civilisation and a  horticulture to which those of old egypt are upstarts of yesterday   there are those who never can look at the banana without a feeling  of awe as at a token of holy ancient the race of man may be and  how little we know of his history  most beautiful it is  the lush fat green stem the crown of huge  leaves falling over in curves like those of human limbs and below  the whorls of green or golden fruit with the purple heart of  flowers dangling below them and all so full of life that this  splendid object is the product of a few months  i am told that if  you cut the stem off at certain seasons you may see the young leaf remember that it is an endogen and grows from within like a palm  or a lily or a grassactually move upward from within and grow  before your eyes and that each stem of plantain will bear from  thirty to sixty pounds of rich food during the year of its short  life  but beside the grand plantains and bananas there are other  interesting plants whose names you have often heard  the tall  plant with stem unbranched but knotty and zigzag and leaves atop  like hemp but of a cold purplish tinge is the famous cassava  313a or manioc the old food of the indians poisonous till its  juice is squeezed out in a curious spiral grass basket  the young  laburnums as they seem with purple flowers are pigeonpeas  313b right good to eat  the creeping vines like our tamus or  black bryony are yams 313cbest of all roots  the branching broadleaved canes with strange white flowers is  arrowroot 313d  the tall mallowlike shrub with large pale  yellowishwhite flowers cotton  the huge grass with beads on it  313e is covered with the jobs tears which are precious in  childrens eyes and will be used as beads for necklaces  the  castoroil plants and the maizethat last always beautifulare of  course well known  the arrow leaves three feet long on stalks  three feet high like gigantic arums are tanias 313f whose roots  are excellent  the plot of creeping convolvuluslike plants with  purple flowers is the sweet or true potato 313g  and we must not overlook the french physicnut 313h with its hemp  like leaves and a little bunch of red coral in the midst with  which the negro loves to adorn his garden and uses it also as  medicine or the indian shot 313i which may be seen planted out  now in summer gardens in england  the negro grows it not for its  pretty crimson flowers but because its hard seed put into a bladder  furnishes him with that detestable musical instrument the chacchac  wherewith he accompanies nightly that equally detestable instrument  the tomtom  the list of vegetables is already long  but there are a few more to  be added to it  for there in a corner creep some plants of the  earthnut 314a a little vetch which buries its pods in the earth   the owner will roast and eat their oily seeds  there is also a tall  bunch of ochro 314ba purplestemmed mallowflowered plantwhose  mucilaginous seeds will thicken his soup  up a tree and round the  houseeaves scramble a large coarse pumpkin and a more delicate  granadilla 314c whose large yellow fruits hang ready to be  plucked and eaten principally for a few seeds of the shape and  colour of young cockroaches  if he be a prudent man especially if  he lives in jamaica he will have a plant of the pretty overlook  pea 314d trailing aloft somewhere to prevent his garden being  overlooked ie bewitched by an evil eye in case the obeah bottle which hangs from the mangotree charged with toad and  spider dirty water and so forth has no terrors for his secret  enemy  he will have a libidibi 314e tree too for astringent  medicine and his hedge will be composed if he be a man of taste as he often seems to beof hibiscus bushes whose magnificent  crimson flowers contrast with the bright yellow bunches of the  common cassia and the scarlet flowers of the jumbybead bush  314f and blue and white and pink convolvuluses  the sulphur and  purple neerembergia of our hothouses which is here one mass of  flower at christmas and the creeping crabseye vine 314g will  scramble over the fence while as a finish to his little paradise  he will have planted at each of its four corners an upright  dragonsblood 314h bush whose violet and red leaves bedeck our  dinnertables in winter and are here used from their unlikeness to  any other plant in the island to mark boundaries  i have not daredfor fear of prolixityto make this catalogue as  complete as i could have done  but it must be remembered that over  and above all this every hedge and wood furnishes wild fruit more  or less eatable the high forests plenty of oily seeds in which the  tropic man delights and woods forests and fields medicinal plants  uncounted  there is more medicine in the bush and better than in  all the shops in port of spain said a wise medical man to me and  to the exhibition of 1862 mr mclintock alone contributed from  british guiana one hundred and forty species of barks used as  medicine by the indians  there is therefore no fear that the  tropical small farmer should suffer either from want or from  monotony of food and equally small fear lest when his children  have eaten themselves sickas they are likely to do if like the  negro children they are eating all day longhe should be unable to  find something in the hedge which will set them all right again  at the amount of food which a man can get off this little patch i  dare not guess  well says humboldt that an european lately arrived  in the torrid zone is struck with nothing so much as the extreme  smallness of the spots under cultivation round a cabin which  contains a numerous family  the plantains alone ought according to  humboldt to give one hundred and thirtythree times as much food as  the same space of ground sown with wheat and fortyfour times as  much as if it grew potatoes  true the plantain is by no means as  nourishing as wheat  which reduces the actual difference between  their value per acre to twentyfive to one  but under his plantains  he can grow other vegetables  he has no winter and therefore some  crop or other is always coming forward  from whence it comes that  as i just hinted his wife and children seem to have always  something to eat in their mouths if it be only the berries and nuts  which abound in every hedge and wood  neither dare i guess at the  profit which he might make and i hope will some day make out of  his land if he would cultivate somewhat more for exportation and  not merely for home consumption  if any one wishes to know more on  this matter let him consult the catalogue of contributions from  british guiana to the london exhibition of 1862 especially the  pages from lix to lxviii on the starchproducing plants of the  west indies  beyond the facts which i have given as to the plantain i have no  statistics of the amount of produce which is usually raised on a  west indian provision ground  nor would any be of use for a glance  shows that the limit of production has not been nearly reached   were the fork used instead of the hoe were the weeds kept down  were the manure returned to the soil instead of festering about  everywhere in sun and rain  in a word were even as much done for  the land as an english labourer does for his garden still more if  as much were done for it as for a suburban marketgarden the  produce might be doubled or trebled and that without exhausting the  soil  the west indian peasant can if he will carry la petite culture  to a perfection and a wealth which it has not yet attained even in  china japan and hindostan and make every rood of ground not  merely maintain its man but its civilised man  this however will  require a skill and a thoughtfulness which the negro does not as yet  possess  if he ever had them he lost them under slavery from the  brutalising effects of a rough and unscientific grande culture  and it will need several generations of training ere he recovers  them  gardentillage and spadefarming are not learnt in a day  especially when they dependas they always must in temperate  climatesfor their main profit on some article which requires  skilled labour to prepare it for the marketon flax for instance  silk wine or fruits  an average english labourer i fear if put  in possession of half a dozen acres of land would fare as badly as  the poor chartists who some twenty years ago joined in feargus  oconnors land scheme unless he knew half a dozen ways of eking  out a livelihood which even our squatters around windsor and the new  forest are alas forgetting under the moneymaking and man unmaking influences of the division of labour  he is vanishing  fast the old beekeeping applegrowing basketmaking copse cutting manycounselled ulysses of our youth as handy as a sailor   and we know too well what he leaves behind him grandchildren better  fed better clothed better taught than he but his inferiors in  intellect and in manhood becausewhatever they may be taughtthey  cannot be taught by schooling to use their fingers and their wits   i fear therefore that the average english labourer would not  prosper here  he has not stamina enough for the hard work of the  sugar plantation  he has not wit and handiness enough for the more  delicate work of a little spadefarm  and he would sink as the  negro seems inclined to sink into a mere grower of food for  himself or take to drinkas too many of the white immigrants to  certain west indian colonies did thirty years agoand burn the life  out of himself with new rum  the hindoo immigrant on the other  hand has been trained by long ages to a somewhat scientific  agriculture and civilised into the want of many luxuries for which  the negro cares nothing and it is to him that we must look i  think for a petite culture which will do justice to the  inexhaustible wealth of the west indian soil and climate  as for the house which is embowered in the little paradise which i  have been describing i am sorry to say that it is in general the  merest wooden hut on stilts the front half altogether open and  unwalled the back half boarded up to form a single room a passing  glance into which will not make the stranger wish to enter if he  has any nose or any dislike of vermin  the group at the door  meanwhile will do anything but invite him to enter and he will  ride on with something like a sigh at what man might be and what  he is  doubtless there are great excuses for the inmates  a house in this  climate is only needed for a sleeping or lounging place  the  cooking is carried on between a few stones in the garden the  washing at the neighbouring brook  no store rooms are needed where  there is no winter and everything grows fresh and fresh save the  saltfish which can be easily keptand i understand usually is  keptunderneath the bed  as for separate bedrooms for boys and  girls and all those decencies and moralities for which those who  build model cottages strive and with good causeof such things  none dream  but it is not so very long ago that the british isles  were not perfect in such matters some think that they are not quite  perfect yet  so we will take the beam out of our own eye before we  try to take the mote from the negros  the latter however no man  can do  for the negro being a freeholder and the owner of his own  cottage must take the mote out of his own eye having no landlord  to build cottages for him in the meanwhile however the less said  about his lodging the better  in the villages however in maraval for instance you see houses  of a far better stamp belonging i believe to coloured people  employed in trades long and low wooden buildings with jalousies  instead of windowsfor no glass is needed here divided into rooms  and smart with paint which is not as pretty as the native wood   you catch sight as you pass of prints usually devotional on the  walls comfortable furniture lookingglasses and sideboards and  other pleasant signs that a civilisation of the middle classes is  springing up and springing to judge from the number of new houses  building everywhere very rapidly as befits a colony whose revenue  has risen since 1855 from 72300 pounds to 240000 pounds beside  the local taxation of the wards some 30000 pounds or 40000 pounds  more  what will be the future of agriculture in the west indian colonies i  of course dare not guess  the profits of sugargrowing in spite of  all drawbacks have been of late very great  they will be greater  still under the improved methods of manufacture which will be  employed now that the sugar duties have been at least rationally  reformed by mr lowe  and therefore for some time to come capital  will naturally flow towards sugarplanting and great sheets of the  forest will be too probably ruthlessly and wastefully swept away  to make room for canes  and yet one must ask regretfully are  there no other cultures save that of cane which will yield a fair  even an ample return to men of small capital and energetic habits   what of the culture of bamboo for paperfibre of which i have  spoken already  it has been i understand taken up successfully in  jamaica to supply the united states paper market  why should it  not be taken up in trinidad  why should not plantainmeal 318a be  hereafter largely exported for the use of the english working  classes  why should not trinidad and other islands export fruits preserved fruits especially  surely such a trade might be  profitable if only a quarter as much care were taken in the west  indies as is taken in england to improve the varieties by selection  and culture and care taken also not to spoil the preserves as now  for the english market by swamping them with sugar or sling  can  nothing be done in growing the oilproducing seeds with which the  tropics abound and for which a demand is rising in england if it  be only for use about machinery  nothing too toward growing drugs  for the home market  nothing toward using the treasures of gutta percha which are now wasting in the balatas  above all can nothing  be done to increase the yield of the cacaofarms and the quality of  trinidad cacao  for this latter industry at least i have hope  my friendif he  will allow me to call him somr john law has shown what  extraordinary returns may be obtained from improved cacaogrowing  at least so far to his own satisfaction that he is himself trying  the experiment  he calculates 318b that 200 acres at a maximum  outlay of about 11000 dollars spread over six years and  diminishing from that time till the end of the tenth year should  give for fifty years after that a net income of 6800 dollars and  then the industrious planter may sit down as i heartily hope mr  law will do and enjoy the fruits of his labour  mr law is of opinion that to give such a return the cacao must be  farmed in a very different way from the usual plan that the trees  must not be left shaded as now by bois immortelles sixty to  eighty feet high during their whole life  the trees he says with  reason impoverish the soil by their roots  the shade causes excess  of moisture chills weakens and retards the plants encourages  parasitic moss and insects and moreover is least useful in the  very months in which the sun is hottest viz  february march and  april which are just the months in which the bois immortelles shed  their leaves  he believes that the cacao needs no shade after the  third year and that till then shade would be amply given by  plantains and maize set between the trees which would in the very  first year repay the planter some 6500 dollars on his first outlay  of some 8000  it is not for me to give an opinion upon the  correctness of his estimates  but the past history of trinidad  shows so many failures of the cacao crop that even a practically  ignorant man may be excused for guessing that there is something  wrong in the old spanish system and that with cacao as with wheat  and every other known crop improved culture means improved produce  and steadier profits  as an advocate of petite culture i heartily hope that such may be  the case  i have hinted in these volumes my belief that exclusive  sugar cultivation on the large scale has been the bane of the west  indies  i went out thither with a somewhat foregone conclusion in that  direction  but it was at least founded on what i believed to be  facts  and it was certainly verified by the fresh facts which i  saw there  i returned with a belief stronger than ever that  exclusive sugar cultivation had put a premium on unskilled slave labour to the disadvantage of skilled whitelabour and to the  disadvantage also of any attempt to educate and raise the negro  whom it was not worth while to civilise as long as he was needed  merely as an instrument exerting brute strength  it seems to me  also that to the exclusive cultivation of sugar is owing more than  to any other cause that frightful decrease throughout the islands  of the white population of which most english people are i  believe quite unaware  do they know for instance that barbadoes  could in cromwells time send three thousand white volunteers and  st kitts and nevis a thousand to help in the gallant conquest of  jamaica  do they know that in 1676 barbadoes was reported to  maintain as against 80000 black 70000 free whites while in 1851  the island contained more than 120000 negroes and people of colour  as against only 15824 whites  that st kitts held even as late as  1761 7000 whites but in 1826before emancipationonly 1600  or  that little montserrat which held about 1648 1000 white families  and had a militia of 360 effective men held in 1787 only 1300  whites in 1828 only 315 and in 1851 only 150  it will be said that this ugly decrease in the white population is  owing to the unfitness of the climate  i believe it to have been  produced rather by the introduction of sugar cultivation at which  the white man cannot work  these early settlers had grants of ten  acres apiece at least in barbadoes  they grew not only provisions  enough for themselves but tobacco cotton and indigoproducts now  all but obliterated out of the british islands  they made cotton  hammocks and sold them abroad as well as in the island  they  might had they been wisely educated to perceive and use the natural  wealth around them have made money out of many other wild products   but the profits of sugargrowing were so enormous in spite of their  uncertainty that during the greater part of the eighteenth  century their little freeholds were bought up and converted into  canepieces by their wealthier neighbours who could afford to buy  slaves and sugarmills  they sought their fortunes in other lands   and so was exterminated a race of yeomen who might have been at  this day a source of strength and honour not only to the colonies  but to england herself  it may be that the extermination was not altogether undeserved that  they were not sufficiently educated or skilful to carry out that  petite culture which requiresas i have said alreadynot only  intellect and practical education but a hereditary and traditional  experience such as is possessed by the belgians the piedmontese  and above all by the charming peasantry of provence and languedoc  the fathers as far as western europe is concerned of all our  agriculture  it may be too that as the sugar cultivation  increased they were tempted more and more in the old hard drinking  days by the special poison of the west indiesnew rum to the  destruction both of soul and body  be that as it may their  extirpation helped to make inevitable the vicious system of large  estates cultivated by slaves a system which is judged by its own  results for it was ruinate before emancipation and emancipation  only gave the coup de grace  the latifundia perdidere the  antilles as they did italy of old  the vicious system brought its  own nemesis  the ruin of the west indies at the end of the great  french war was principally owing to that exclusive cultivation of  the cane which forced the planter to depend on a single article of  produce and left him embarrassed every time prices fell suddenly  or the canes failed from drought or hurricane  we all know what  would be thought of an european farmer who thus staked his capital  on one venture  he is a bad farmer says the proverb who does  not stand on four legs and if he can on five  if his wheat  fails he has his barleyif his barley he has his sheepif his  sheep he has his fatting oxen  the provencal the model farmer  can retreat on his almonds if his mulberries fail on his olives if  his vines fail on his maize if his wheat fails  the west indian  might have hadthe cuban hashis tobacco his indigo too his  coffee oras in trinidadhis cacao and his arrowroot and half a  dozen crops more  indeed had his intellectand he had intellect  in plentybeen diverted from the fatal fixed idea of making money  as fast as possible by sugar he might have ere now discovered in  america or imported from the east plants for cultivation far more  valuable than that breadfruit tree of which such high hopes were  once entertained as a food for the negro  as it was his very  green crops were neglected till in some islands at least he could  not feed his cattle and mules with certainty while the sugarcane  to which everything else had been sacrificed proved sometimes  indeed a valuable servant  but too often a tyrannous and  capricious master  but those days are past and better ones have dawned with better  education and a wider knowledge of the world and of science  what  west indians have to learnsome of them have learnt it alreadyis  that if they can compete with other countries only by improved and  more scientific cultivation and manufacture as they themselves  confess then they can carry out the new methods only by more  skilful labour  they therefore require now as they never required  before to give the labouring classes a practical education to  quicken their intellect and to teach them habits of selfdependent  and originative action which areas in the case of the prussian  soldier and of the english sailor and railway servantperfectly  compatible with strict discipline  let them take warning from the  english manufacturing system which condemns a human intellect to  waste itself in perpetually heading pins or opening and shutting  trapdoors and punishes itself by producing a class of workpeople  who alternate between reckless comfort and moody discontent  let  them be sure that they will help rather than injure the labour market of the colony by making the labourer also a small free holding peasant  he will learn more in his own provision ground properly tilledthan he will in the canepiece  and he will take  to the canepiece and use for his employer the selfhelpfulness  which he has learnt in the provision ground  it is so in england   our best agricultural daylabourers are without exception those  who cultivate some scrap of ground or follow some petty occupation  which prevents their depending entirely on wagelabour  and so i  believe it will be in the west indies  let the landpolicy of the  late governor be followed up  let squatting be rigidly forbidden   let no man hold possession of land without having earned or  inherited money enough to purchase it as a guarantee of his  ability and respectability oras in the case of coolies past their  indenturesas a commutation for rights which he has earned in  likewise  but let the coloured man of every race be encouraged to  become a landholder and a producer in his own small way  he will  thus not only by what he produces but by what he consumes add  largely to the wealth of the colony while his increased wants and  those of his children till they too can purchase land will draw  him and his sons and daughters to the sugarestates as intelligent  and helpful daylabourers  so it may be  and i cannot but trust from what i have seen of the  temper of the gentlemen of trinidad that so it will be    chapter xvii and last  homeward bound    at last we were homeward bound  we had been seven weeks in the  island  we had promised to be back in england if possible within  the three months and we had a certain pride in keeping our promise  not only for its own sake but for the sake of the dear west indies   we wished to show those at home how easy it was to get there how  easy to get home again  moreover though going to sea in the  shannon was not quite the same as going to sea in a sieve our  stayathome friends were of the same mind as those of the dear  little jumblies whom mr lear has made immortal in his new book of  nonsense and we were bound to come back as soon as possible and  not in twenty years or more if we wished them to say      if we live we too will go to sea in a sieve to the hills of the chankly bore   so we left  but it was sore leaving  people had been very kind  and were ready to be kinder still while we busyperhaps too busy over our natural history collections had seen very little of our  neighbours had been able to accept very few of the invitations  which were showered on us and which would i doubt not have given  us opportunities for liking the islanders still more than we liked  them already  another cause made our leaving sore to us  the hunger for travel  had been arousedabove all for travel westwardand would not be  satisfied  up the orinoco we longed to go  but could not  to la  guayra and caraccas we longed to go  but dared not  thanks to  spanish republican barbarism the only regular communication with  that once magnificent capital of northern venezuela was by a filthy  steamer the regos ferreos which had become from her very looks a  byword in the port  on board of her some friends of ours had lately  been glad to sleep in a doghutch on deck to escape the filth and  vermin of the berths and went hungry for want of decent food   caraccas itself was going through one of its periodic revolutions it has not got through the fever fit yetand neither life nor  property was safe  but the longing to go westward was on us nevertheless  it seemed  hard to turn back after getting so far along the great path of the  human race and one had to reason with oneselffoolish soul  whither would you go  you cannot go westward for ever  if you go  up the orinoco you will long to go up the meta  if you get to sta  fe de bogota you will not be content till you cross the andes and  see cotopaxi and chimborazo  when you look down on the pacific you  will be craving to go to the gallapagos after darwin and then to  the marquesas after herman melville and then to the fijis after  seeman and then to borneo after brooke and then to the  archipelago after wallace and then to hindostan and round the  world  and when you get home the westward fever will be stronger  on you than ever and you will crave to start again  go home at  once like a reasonable man and do your duty and thank god for  what you have been allowed to see and try to become of the same  mind as that most brilliant of old ladies who boasted that she had  not been abroad since she saw the apotheosis of voltaire before the  french revolution and did not care to go as long as all manner of  clever people were kind enough to go instead and write charming  books about what they had seen for her  but the westward fever was slow to cool  and with wistful eyes we  watched the sun by day and venus and the moon by night sink down  into the gulf to lighten lands which we should never see  a few  days more and we were steaming out to the bocaswhich we had begun  to love as the gates of a new homeheaped with presents to the last  minute some of them from persons we hardly knew  behind us port of  spain sank into haze  before us monos rose tall dark and grim if monos could be grimin moonless night  we ran on and past the  island this time we were going not through the boca de monos but  through the next the umbrella bocas  it was too dark to see  houses palmtrees aught but the ragged outline of the hills  against the northern sky and beneath sparks of light in sheltered  coves some of which were already to one of us wellbeloved nooks   there was the great gulf of the boca de monos  there was  morrisonsour good scotch host of seven weeks since and the  glasses were turned on it to see if possible through the dusk  the almondtree and the cocogrove for the last time  ah well when we next meet what will he be and where  and where the  handsome creole wife and the little brown  cupid who danced all  naked in the log canoe till the white gentlemen swimming round  upset him and canoe and boy and men rolled and splashed about  like a shoal of seals at play beneath the cliff with the seguines  and cereuses while the ripple lapped the morichenuts about the  roots of the manchineel bush and the skippers leaped and flashed  outside like silver splinters  and here where we steamed along  was the very spot where we had seen the sharks backfin when we  rowed back from the first guacharo cave  and it was all over  we are such stuff as dreams are made of  and as in a dream or  rather as part of a dream and myself a phantom and a playactor i  looked out over the side and saw on the right the black avails of  monos on the left the black walls of huevosa gate even grander  though not as narrow as that of monos and the umbrella rock  capped with matapalo and cactus and nightblowing cereus dim in  the dusk  and now we were outside  the roar of the surf the  tumble of the sea the rush of the tradewind told us that at once   out in the great sea with grenada and kind friends in it ahead  not to be seen or reached till morning light  but we looked astern  and not ahead  we could see into and through the gap in huevos  through which we had tried to reach the guacharo cave  inside that  notch in the cliffs must be the wooded bay whence we picked up the  shells among the fallen leaves and flowers  from under that dark  wall beyond it the guacharos must be just trooping out for their  nightly forage as they had trooped out sincehe alone who made  them knows how long  the outline of huevos the outline of monos  were growing lower and grayer astern  a long ragged haze far  loftier than that on the starboard quarter signified the northern  mountains and far off on the port quarter lay a flat bank of cloud  amid which rose or seemed to rise the cordillera of the main and  the hills where jaguars lie  canopus blazed high astern and  fomalhaut below him to the west as if bidding us a kind farewell   orion and aldebaran spangled the zenith  the young moon lay on her  back in the far west thin and pale over cumana and the cordillera  with venus ragged and red with earth mist just beneath  and low  ahead with the pointers horizontal glimmered the cold polestar  for which we were steering out of the summer into the winter once  more  we grew chill as we looked at him and shuddered it may be  cowered for a moment at the thought of niflheim the home of  frosts and fogs towards which we were bound  however we were not yet out of the tropics  we had still nearly a  fortnight before us in which to feel sure there was a sun in heaven  a fortnight more of the warm champagne atmosphere which was giving  fresh life and health to us both  and up the islands we went  wiser but not sadder than when we went down them casting wistful  eyes though to windward for there awayand scarcely out of  sightlay tobago to which we had a most kind invitation and  gladly would we have looked at that beautiful and fertile little  spot and have pictured to ourselves robinson crusoe and man friday  pacing along the coral beach in one of its little southern coves   more wistfully still did we look to windward when we thought of  barbadoes and of the kind people who were ready to welcome us into  that prosperous and civilised little canegarden which deserves and has deserved for now two hundred years far more than poor old  irelandthe name of the emerald gem of the western world  but it could not be  a few hours at grenada and a few hours at st  lucia were all the stoppages possible to us  the steamer only  passes once a fortnight and it is necessary to spend that time on  each island which is visited unless the traveller commits himself which he cannot well do if he has a lady with himto the chances  and changes of coasting schooners  more frequent and easy  intercommunication is needed throughout the antilles  the good  people whether white or coloured need to see more of each other  and more of visitors from home  whether a small weekly steamer  between the islands would pay in money i know not  that it would  pay morally and socially i am sure  perhaps when the telegraph is  laid down along the islands the need of more steamers will be felt  and supplied  very pleasant was the run up to st thomass not merely on account  of the scenery but because we had once morecontrary to our  expectationthe most agreeable of captains  his french  cultivationhe had been brought up in provencejoined to brilliant  natural talents had made him as good a talker as he doubtless is a  sailor and the charm of his conversation about all matters on  earth and some above the earth will not be soon forgotten by those  who went up with him to st thomass and left him there with  regret  we transhipped to the neva captain woolwardto whom i must tender  my thanks as i do to captain bax of the shannon for all kinds of  civility  we slept a night in the harbour the town having just  then a clean bill of health and were very glad to find ourselves  during the next few days none the worse for having done so  on  remarking the first evening that i did not smell the harbour after  all i was comforted by the answer thatwhen a man did he had  better go below and make his will  it is a pity that the most  important harbour in the caribbean sea should be so unhealthy  no  doubt it offers advantages for traffic which can be found nowhere  else  and there the steamers must continue to assemble yellow  fever or none  but why should not an hotel be built for the  passengers in some healthy and airy spot outside the basinon the  south slope of water island for instance or on buck islandwhere  they might land at once and sleep in pure fresh air and seabreeze   the establishment of such an hotel would surely when once known  attract to the west indies many travellers to whom st thomass is  now as much a name of fear as colon or the panama  we left st thomass by a different track from that by which we came  to it  we ran northward up the magnificent landlocked channel  between tortola and virgin gorda to pass to leeward of virgin gorda  and anegada and so northward toward the gulf stream  this channel has borne the name of drake i presume ever since the  year 1575  for in the account of that fatal though successful  voyage which cost the lives both of sir john hawkins who died off  porto rico and sir francis drake who died off porto bello where  hosier and the greater part of the crews of a noble british fleet  perished a hundred and fifty years afterward it is written in  hakluyt howafter running up n and nw past sabathe fleet  stood away sw and on the 8th of november being a saturday we  came to an anker some 7 or 8 leagues off among certain broken ilands  called las virgines which have bene accounted dangerous  but we  found there a very good rode had it bene for a thousand sails of  ships in 7  8 fadomes fine sand good ankorage high ilands on  either side but no fresh water that we could find  here is much  fish to be taken with nets and hookes  also we stayed on shore and  fowled  here sir john hawkins was extreme sick he died within ten  days which his sickness began upon newes of the taking of the  francis his sternmost vessel  the 18th day wee weied and stood  north and by east into a lesser sound which sir francis in his  barge discovered the night before and ankored in 13 fadomes having  hie steepe hiles on either side some league distant from our first  riding  the 12 in the morning we weied and set sayle into the sea due south  through a small streit but without dangerpossibly the very gap in  which the rhones wreck now liesand then stode west and by north  for s juan de puerto rico  this northerly course is plainly the most advantageous for a  homewardbound ship as it strikes the gulf stream soonest and  keeps in it longest  conversely the southerly route by the azores  is best for outwardbound ships as it escapes most of the gulf  stream and traverses the still sargasso sea and even the extremity  of the westward equatorial current  strange as these virgin isles had looked when seen from the south  outside and at the distance of a few miles they looked still more  strange when we were fairly threading our way between them  sometimes not a rifleshot from the cliffs with the white coral  banks gleaming under our keel  had they ever carried a tropic  vegetation  had the hills of tortola and virgin gorda in shape and  size much like those which surround a sealoch in the western  islands ever been furred with forests like those of guadaloupe or  st lucia  the loftier were now mere mounds of almost barren earth  the lower were often like fallen jerusalem mere long earthless  moles as of minute cyclopean masonry  but what had destroyed their  vegetation if it ever existed  were they not too the mere  remnants of a submerged and destroyed land connected now only by  the coral shoals  so it seemed to us as we ran out past the  magnificent harbour at the back of virgin gorda where in the old  war times the merchantmen of all the west indies used to collect  to be conveyed homeward by the naval squadron and across a shallow  sea white with coral beds  we passed to leeward of the island or  rather reef of anegada so low that it could only be discerned at  a few miles distance by the breaking surf and a few bushes and  then plunged as it were suddenly out of shallow white water into  deep azure ocean  an upheaval of only forty fathoms would i  believe join all these islands to each other and to the great  mountain island of porto rico to the west  the same upheaval would  connect with each other anguilla st martin and st bartholomew  to the east  but santa cruz though so near st thomass and the  virgin gordas to the south would still be parted from them by a  gulf nearly two thousand fathoms deepa gulf which marks still  probably the separation of two ancient continents or at least two  archipelagoes  much light has been thrown on this curious problem since our return  by an american naturalist mr bland in a paper read before the  american philosophical society on the geology and physical  geography of the west indies with reference to the distribution of  mollusca  it is plain that of all animals landshells and  reptiles give the surest tokens of any former connection of islands  being neither able to swim nor fly from one to another and very  unlikely to be carried by birds or currents  judging therefore as  he has a right to do by the similarity of the landshells mr  bland is of opinion that porto rico the virgins and the anguilla  group once formed continuous dry land connected with cuba the  bahamas and hayti and that their shellfauna is of a mexican and  central american type  the shellfauna of the islands to the south  on the contrary from barbuda and st kitts down to trinidad is  south american  but of two types one venezuelan the other  guianan  it seems from mr blands researches that there must  have existed once not merely an extension of the north american  continent southeastward but that very extension of the south  american continent northward at which i have hinted more than once  in these pages  moreovera fact which i certainly did not expect the western side of this supposed land namely trinidad tobago  grenada the grenadines st vincent and st lucia have as far as  landshells are concerned a venezuelan fauna while the eastern  side of it namely barbadoes martinique dominica guadaloupe  antigua etc have most strangely the fauna of guiana  if this be so a glance at the map will show the vast destruction of  tropic land during almost the very latest geological epoch and  show too how little in the present imperfect state of our  knowledge we ought to dare any speculations as to the absence of  man as well as of other creatures on those great lands now  destroyed  for to supply the dry land which mr blands theory  needs we shall have to conceive a junction reaching over at least  five degrees of latitude between the north of british guiana and  barbadoes and may freely indulge in the dream that the waters of  the orinoco when they ran over the lowlands of trinidad passed  east of tobago then northward between barbadoes and st lucia then  turned westward between the latter island and martinique and that  the mighty estuary formedfor a great part at least of that line the original barrier which kept the landshells of venezuela apart  from those of guiana  a stretch of the imagination doubtless   but no greater stretch than will be required by any explanation of  the facts whatsoever  and so thanking mr bland heartily for his valuable contribution to  the infant science of biogeologyi take leave in these pages at  least of the earthly paradise  our run homeward was quite as successful as our run out  the  magnificent neva her captain and her officers were what these  royal mail steamers and their crews arewithout i believe an  exceptionall that we could wish  our passengers certainly were  neither so numerous nor so agreeable as when going out and the most  notable personage among them was a keeneyed strongjawed little  corsican who had been lately hiredso ran his storyby the  coloured insurgents of hayti to put down the presidentalias as  usual in such republics tyrantsalnave  he seemed by his own account to have done his work effectually   seven thousand lives were lost in the attack on salnaves quarters  in port au prince  whole families were bayonetted to save the  trouble of judging and shooting them  women were not spared  and if all that i have heard of hayti be truesome of them did not  deserve to be spared  the noble old french buildings of the city  were ruinedthe corsican said not by his artillery but by  salnaves  he had slain salnave himself and was now going back to  france to claim his rights as a french citizen carrying with him  salnaves sword which was wrapped in a newspaper save when taken  out to be brandished on the main deck  one could not but be  interested in the valiant adventurer  he seemed a man such as red  republics and revolutions breed and need very capable of doing  rough work and not likely to be hampered by scruples as to the  manner of doing it  if he is as i take for granted busy in france  just now he will leave his mark behind  the voyage however seemed likely to be a dull one and to relieve  the monotony a wildbeast show was determined on ere the weather  grew too cold  so one day all the new curiosities were brought on  deck at noon and if some great zoologist had been on board he  would have found materials in our show for more than one interesting  lecture  the doctor contributed an alligator some two feet six  inches long another officer a curiouslymarked anteaterof a  species unknown to me  it was common he said in the isthmus of  panama and seemed the most foolish and helpless of beasts  as no  ants were procurable it was fed on raw yolk of egg which it  contrived to suck in with its long tonguenot enough however to  keep it alive during the voyage  the chief engineer exhibited a live tarantula or birdcatching  spider who was very safely barred into its box with strips of iron  as a bite from it is rather worse than that of an english adder  we showed a vulturine parrot and a kinkajou  the kinkajou by the  by got loose one night and displayed his natural inclination by  instantly catching a rat and dancing between decks with it in his  mouth  but was so tame withal that he let the stewardess stroke  him in passing  the good lady mistook him for a cat and when she  discovered next morning that she had been handling a loose wild  beast her horror was as great as her thankfulness for the supposed  escape  in curious contrast to the natural tameness of the kinkajou  was the natural untameness of a beautiful little nightmonkey  belonging to the purser  its great owls eyes were instinct with  nothing but abject terror of everybody and everything and it was a  miracle that ere the voyage was over it did not die of mere fright   how is it en passant that some animals are naturally fearless and  tamable others not and that even in the same family  among the  south american monkeys the howlers are untamable the sapajous less  so while the spider monkeys are instinctively gentle and fond of  man  as may be seen in the case of the very fine marimonda ateles  beelzebub now dying i fear in the zoological gardens at bristol  as we got into colder latitudes we began to lose our pets  the  anteater departed first  then the doctor who kept his alligator  in a tub on his cabin floor was awoke by doleful wails as of a  babe  being pretty sure that there was not likely to be one on  board and certainly not in his cabin he naturally struck a light  and discovered the alligator who had never uttered a sound before  outside his tub on the floor bewailing bitterly his fate  whether  he wept crocodile tears besides the doctor could not discover  but it was at least clear that if swans sing before they die  alligators do so likewise  for the poor thing was dead next  morning  it was time after this to stow the pets warm between decks and as  near the galleyfires as they could be put  for now as we neared  the roaring forties there fell on us a gale from the northwest  and would not cease  the wind was of course right abeam the sea soon ran very high   the neva being a long screw was lively enough and too lively for  she soon showed a chronic inclination to roll and that suddenly by  fits and starts  the fiddles were on the tables for nearly a week   but they did not prevent more than one of us finding his dinner  suddenly in his lap instead of his stomach  however no one was  hurt nor even frightened  save two poor ladiesnot from trinidad who spent their doleful days and nights in screaming telling their  beads drinking weak brandyandwater and informing the hunted  stewardess that if they had known what horrors they were about to  endure they would have gone to europe ina sailing vessel  the  foreignerswho are usually i know not why bad sailorssoon  vanished to their berths  so did the ladies  even those who were  not ill jammed themselves into their berths and lay there for fear  of falls and bruises while the englishmen and a coloured man or  twothe coloured men usually stand the sea wellhad the deck all  to themselves and slopped about holding on and longing for a  monkeys tail but on the whole rather liking it  for after all it is a glorious pastime to find oneself in a real  gale of wind in a big ship with not a rock to run against within a  thousand miles  one seems in such danger and one is so safe  and  gradually the sense of security grows and grows into a sense of  victory as with the boy who fears his first fence plucks up heart  for the second is rather pleased at the third and craves for the  triumph of the fourth and of all the rest sorry at last when the  run is over  and when a mannot being seasickhas once  discovered that the apparent heel of the ship in rolling is at least  four times less than it looks and that she will jump upright again  in a quarter of a minute like a fishers float has learnt to get  his trunk out from under his berth and put it back again by  jamming his forehead against the berthside and his heels against  the ships wall has learntif he sleep aftto sleep through the  firing of the screw though it does shake all the marrow in his  backbone and has above all made a solemn vow to shave and bathe  every morning let the ship be as lively as she will  then he will  find a full gale a finer tonic and a finer stirrer of wholesome  appetite than all the drugs of apothecaries hall  this particular gale however began to get a little too strong  we  had a sail or two set to steady the ship  on the second night one  split with a crack like a cannon and was tied up in an instant  cordage and strips into inextricable knots  the next night i was woke by a slap which shook the neva from stem  to stern and made her stagger and writhe like a live thing struck  across the loins  then a dull rush of water which there was no  mistaking  we had shipped a green sea  well i could not bale it  out again and there was plenty of room for it on board  so after  ascertaining that r was not frightened i went back to my berth  and slept again somewhat wondering that the roll of the screw was  all but silent  next morning we found that a sea had walked in over the bridge  breaking it and washing off it the first officer and the lookout  manluckily they fell into a sail and not overboard put out the  galleyfires so that we got a cold breakfast and eased the ship  for the shock turned the indicator in the engineroom to ease her   the engineer thinking that the captain had given the order obeyed  it  the captain turned out into the wet to know who had eased his  ship and then returned to bed wisely remarking that the ship knew  her own business best and as she had chosen to ease the engines  herself eased she should be his orders being not to prosecute a  voyage so as to endanger the lives of the passengers or the property  of the company  so we went on easily for sixteen hours the wise captain judging and his judgment proved truethat the centre of the storm was  crossing our course ahead and that if we waited it would pass us   so as he expected we came after a day or two into an almost  windless sea where smooth mountainous waves the relics of the  storm were weltering aimlessly up and down under a dark sad sky  soon we began to sight ship after ship and found ourselves on the  great southwestern highroad of the atlantic and found ourselves  too nearing niflheim day by day  colder and colder grew the wind  lower the sun darker the cloudworld overhead and we went on deck  each morning with some additional garment on sorely against our  wills  only on the very day on which we sighted land we had one of  those treacherously beautiful days which occur now and then in an  english february mild still and shining if not with keen joyful  blaze at least with a cheerful and tender gleam from sea and sky  the lands end was visible at a great distance and as we neared the  lizard we could see not only the lighthouses on the cliff and  every wellknown cove and rock from mullion and kynance round to st  keverne but far inland likewise  breage church and the great tin works of wheal vor stood out hard against the sky  we could see up  the looe pool to helston church and away beyond it till we fancied  that we could almost discern across the isthmus the sacred hill of  carnbrea  along the cornish shore we ran through a sea swarming with sails   an exciting contrast to the loneliness of the wide ocean which we  had leftand so on to plymouth sound  the last time i had been on that water i was looking up in awe at  sir edward codringtons fleet just home from the battle of navarino   even then as a mere boy i was struck by the grand symmetry of that  ample basin  the break waterthen unfinishedlying across the  centre the heights of bovisand and cawsand and those again of  mount batten and mount edgecumbe left and right the citadel and  the hoe across the bottom of the sound the southern sun full on  their walls with the twin harbours and their forests of masts  winding away into dim distance on each side and behind all and  above all the purple range of dartmoor with the black rainclouds  crawling along its top  and now after nearly forty years the  place looked to me even more grand than my recollections had  pictured it  the newer fortifications have added to the moral  effect of the scene without taking away from its physical beauty   and i heard without surprisethough not without pridethe  foreigners express their admiration of this their first specimen of  an english port  we steamed away again after landing our letters close past the  dear old mewstone  the warreners hut stood on it still  and i  wondered whether the old hegoat who used to terrify me as a boy  had left any longbearded descendants  then under the revelstoke  and bolt head cliffs with just one flying glance up into the hidden  nooks of delicious little salcombe and away southwest into the  night bound for cherbourg and a very different scene  we were awakened soon after midnight by the stopping of the steamer   then a gun  after awhile another and presently a third  but there  was no reply though our coming had been telegraphed from england  and for nearly six hours we lay in the heart of the most important  french arsenal with all our mails and passengers waiting to get  ashore and nobody deigning to notice us  true we could do no harm  there  but our delay and other things which happened were proofs and i was told not uncommon onesof that carelessness  unreadiness and general indiscipline of french arrangements which  has helped to bring about since then an utter ruin  as the day dawned through fog we went on deck to find the ship  lying inside a long breakwater bristling with cannon which looked  formidable enough  but the whole thing i was told was useless  against modern artillery and ironclads  and there was more than one  jest on board as to the possibility of running the channel squadron  across and smashing cherbourg in a single night unless the french  learnt to keep a better lookout in time of war than they did in  time of peace  just inside us lay two or three ironclads strong and ugly  untidy  too to a degree shocking to english eyes  all sorts of odds and  ends were hanging over the side and about the rigging the yards  were not properly squared and so forth tillas old sailors would  saythe ships had no more decency about them than so many collier brigs  beyond them were arsenals docks fortifications of which of course  we could not judge and backing all a cliff some two hundred feet  high much quarried for buildingstone  an ugly place it is to look  at and i should think an ugly place to get into with the wind  anywhere between nw and ne an artificial and expensive luxury  built originally as a mere menace to england in days when france  which has had too long a moral mission to right some one thought of  fighting us who only wished to live in peace with our neighbours   alas alas  tu la voulu george dandin  she has fought at last   but not us  out of cherbourg we steamed again sulky enough for the delay would  cause us to get home on the sunday evening instead of the sunday  morning and ran northward for the needles  with what joy we saw at  last the white wall of the island glooming dim ahead  with what joy  we first discerned that huge outline of a visage on freshwater  cliff so well known to sailors which as the eye catches it in one  direction is a ridiculous caricature in another really noble and  even beautiful  with what joy did we round the old needles and run  past hurst castle and with what shivering too  for the wind  though dead south came to us as a continental wind harsh and keen  from off the frozen land of france and chilled us to the very  marrow all the way up to southampton  but there were warm hearts and kind faces waiting us on the quay  and good news too  the gentlemen at the customhouse courteously  declined the least inspection of our luggage and we were at once  away in the train home  at first i must confess an english winter  was a change for the worse  fine old oaks and beeches looked to us  fresh from ceibas and balatas like leafless brooms stuck into the  ground by their handles while the want of light was for some days  painful and depressing but we had done it and within the three  months as we promised  as the king in the old play says what has  been has been and ive had my hour  at last we had seen it and  we could not unsee it  we could not not have been in the tropics    footnotes  4  raleighs report of the truth of the fight about the
