selecting the subjects for the successive volumes of this series it has been the object of the author to look for the names of those great personages whose histories constitute useful and not merely entertaining knowledge there are certain names which are familiar as names to all mankind and every person who seeks for any degree of mental cultivation feels desirous of informing himself of the leading outlines of their history that he may know in brief what it was in their characters or their doings which has given them so widelyextended a fame this knowledge which it seems incumbent on every one to obtain in respect to such personages as hannibal alexander c√¶sar cleopatra darius xerxes alfred william the conqueror queen elizabeth and mary queen of scots it is the design and object of these volumes to communicate in a faithful and at the same time if possible in an attractive manner consequently great historical names alone are selected and it has been the writers aim to present the prominent and leading traits in their characters and all the important events in their lives in a bold and free manner and yet in the plain and simple language which is so obviously required in works which aim at permanent and practical usefulness      contents    chapter                                                    page      i normandy                                              13

rouenits name of le havre de graceintermingling of racessuperiority of the norman stock   one of those great events in english history which occur at distant intervals and form respectively a sort of bound or landmark to which all other events preceding or following them for centuries are referred is what is called the norman conquest the norman conquest was in fact the accession of william duke of normandy to the english throne this accession was not altogether a matter of military force for william claimed a right to the throne which if not altogether perfect was as he maintained at any rate superior to that of the prince against whom he contended the rightfulness of his claim was however a matter of little consequence except so far as the moral influence of it aided him in gaining possession the right to rule was in those days rather more openly and nakedly though not much more really than it is now the right of the strongest  normandy williams native land is a very rich and beautiful province in the north of france the following map shows its situation  illustration map of england and part of france showing the situation of normandy  it lies as will be seen upon the map on the coast of france adjoining the english channel the channel is here irregular in form but may be perhaps on the average one hundred miles wide the line of coast on the southern side of the channel which forms of course the northern border of normandy is a range of cliffs which are almost perpendicular toward the sea and which frown forbiddingly upon every ship that sails along the shore here and there it is true a river opens a passage for itself among these cliffs from the interior and these river mouths would form harbors into which ships might enter from the offing were it not that the northwestern winds prevail so generally and drive such a continual swell of rolling surges in upon the shore that they choke up all these estuary openings as well as every natural indentation of the land with shoals and bars of sand and shingle the reverse is the case with the northern or english shore of this famous channel there the harbors formed by the mouths of the rivers or by the sinuosities of the shore are open and accessible and at the same time sheltered from the winds and the sea thus while the northern or english shore has been for many centuries all the time enticing the seaman in and out over the calm deep and sheltered waters which there penetrate the land the southern side has been an almost impassable barrier consisting of a long line of frowning cliffs with every opening through it choked with shoals and sandbanks and guarded by the rolling and tumbling of surges which scarcely ever rest  it is in a great measure owing to these great physical differences between the two shores that the people who live upon the one side though of the same stock and origin with those who live upon the other have become so vastly superior to them in respect to naval exploits and power they are really of the same stock and origin since both england and the northern part of france were overrun and settled by what is called the scandinavian race that is people from norway denmark and other countries on the baltic these people were called the northmen in the histories of those times those who landed in england are generally termed danes though but a small portion of them came really from denmark they were all however of the same parent stock and possessed the same qualities of courage energy and fearless love of adventure and of danger which distinguish their descendants at the present day they came down in those early times in great military hordes and in fleets of piratical ships through the german ocean and the various british seas braving every hardship and every imaginable danger to find new regions to dwell in more genial and fertile and rich than their own native northern climes in these days they evince the same energy and endure equal privations and hardships in hunting whales in the pacific ocean in overrunning india and seizing its sources of wealth and power or in sallying forth whole fleets of adventurers at a time to go more than half round the globe to dig for gold in california the times and circumstances have changed but the race and spirit are the same  normandy takes its name from the northmen it was the province of france which the northmen made peculiarly their own they gained access to it from the sea by the river seine which as will be seen from the map flows as it were through the heart of the country the lower part of this river and the sea around its mouth are much choked up with sand and gravel which the waves have been for ages washing in their incessant industry would result in closing up the passage entirely were it not that the waters of the river must have an outlet and thus the current setting outward wages perpetual war with the surf and surges which are continually breaking in the expeditions of the northmen however found their way through all these obstructions they ascended the river with their ships and finally gained a permanent settlement in the country they had occupied the country for some centuries at the time when our story beginsthe province being governed by a line of princesalmost if not quite independent sovereignscalled the dukes of normandy  the first duke of normandy and the founder of the linethe chieftain who originally invaded and conquered the countrywas a wild and halfsavage hero from the north named rollo he is often in history called rollo the dane norway was his native land he was a chieftain by birth there and being of a wild and adventurous disposition he collected a band of followers and committed with them so many piracies and robberies that at length the king of the country expelled him  rollo seems not to have considered this banishment as any very great calamity since far from interrupting his career of piracy and plunder it only widened the field on which he was to pursue it he accordingly increased the equipment and the force of his fleet enlisted more followers and set sail across the northern part of the german ocean toward the british shores  off the northwestern coast of scotland there are some groups of mountainous and gloomy islands which have been in many different periods of the world the refuge of fugitives and outlaws rollo made these islands his rendezvous now and he found collected there many other similar spirits who had fled to these lonely retreats some on account of political disturbances in which they had become involved and some on account of their crimes rollos impetuous ardent and selfconfident character inspired them with new energy and zeal they gathered around him as their leader finding his strength thus increasing he formed a scheme of concentrating all the force that he could command so as to organize a grand expedition to proceed to the southward and endeavor to find some pleasant country which they could seize and settle upon and make their own the desperate adventurers around him were ready enough to enter into this scheme the fleet was refitted provisioned and equipped the expedition was organized arms and munitions of war provided and when all was ready they set sail they had no definite plan in respect to the place of their destination their intention being to make themselves a home on the first favorable spot that they should find  they moved southward cruising at first along the coast of scotland and then of england they made several fruitless attempts to land on the english shores but were every where repulsed the time when these events took place was during the reign of alfred the great through alfreds wise and efficient measures the whole of his frontier had been put into a perfect state of defense and rollo found that there was no hope for him there he accordingly moved on toward the straits of dover but before passing them he made a descent upon the coast of flanders here there was a country named hainault it was governed by a potentate called the count of hainault rollo made war upon him defeated him in battle took him prisoner and then compelled the countess his wife to raise and pay him an immense sum for his ransom thus he replenished his treasury by an exploit which was considered in those days very great and glorious to perpetrate such a deed now unless it were on a very great scale would be to incur the universal reprobation of mankind but rollo by doing it then not only enriched his coffers but acquired a very extended and honorable fame  for some reason or other rollo did not attempt to take permanent possession of hainault but after receiving his ransom money and replenishing his ammunition and stores he sailed away with his fleet and turning westward he passed through the straits of dover and cruised along the coast of france he found that the country on the french side of the channel though equally rich and beautiful with the opposite shore was in a very different state of defense he entered the mouth of the seine he was embarrassed at first by the difficulties of the navigation in entering the river but as there was no efficient enemy to oppose him he soon triumphed over these difficulties and once fairly in the river he found no difficulty in ascending to rouena  footnote a see the map at the commencement of this chapter  in the mean time the king of france whose name was charles and who is generally designated in history as charles the simple began to collect an army to meet the invader rollo however had made himself master of rouen before charles was able to offer him any effectual opposition rouen was already a strong place but rollo made it stronger he enlarged and repaired the fortifications built storehouses established a garrison and in a word made all the arrangements requisite for securing an impregnable position for himself and his army  a long and obstinate war followed between rollo and charles rollo being almost uniformly victorious in the combats that took place rollo became more and more proud and imperious in proportion to his success he drove the french king from port to port and from field to field until he made himself master of a large part of the north of france over which he gradually established a regular government of his own charles struggled in vain to resist these encroachments rollo continually defeated him and finally he shut him up and besieged him in paris itself at length charles was compelled to enter into negotiations for peace rollo demanded that the large and rich tract on both sides of the seine next the seathe same in fact that now constitutes normandyshould be ceded to him and his followers for their permanent possession charles was extremely unwilling thus to alienate a part of his kingdom he would not consent to cede it absolutely and entirely so as to make it an independent realm it should be a dukedom and not a separate kingdom so that it might continue still a part of his own royal domainsrollo to reign over it as a duke and to acknowledge a general allegiance to the french king rollo agreed to this the war had been now protracted so long that he began himself to desire repose it was more than thirty years since the time of his landing  charles had a daughter named giselle and it was a part of the treaty of peace that she should become rollos wife he also agreed to become a christian thus there were in the execution of the treaty three ceremonies to be performed first rollo was to do homage as it was called for his duchy for it was the custom in those days for subordinate princes who held their possessions of some higher and more strictly sovereign power to perform certain ceremonies in the presence of their superior lord which was called doing homage these ceremonies were of various kinds in different countries though they were all intended to express the submission of the dependent prince to the superior authority and power of the higher potentate of whom he held his lands this act of homage was therefore to be performed and next to the homage was to come the baptism and after the baptism the marriage  when however the time came for the performance of the first of these ceremonies and all the great chieftains and potentates of the respective armies were assembled to witness it rollo it was found would not submit to what the customs of the french monarchy required he ought to kneel before the king and put his hands clasped together between the kings hands in token of submission and then to kiss his foot which was covered with an elegantly fashioned slipper on such occasions rollo would do all except the last but that no remonstrances urgencies or persuasions would induce him to consent to  and yet it was not a very unusual sign or token of political subordination to sovereign power in those days the pope had exacted it even of an emperor a hundred years before and it is continued by that dignitary to the present day on certain state occasions though in the case of the pope there is embroidered on the slipper which the kneeling suppliant kisses a cross so that he who humbles himself to this ceremony may consider if he pleases that it is that sacred symbol of the divine redeemers sufferings and death that he so reverently kisses and not the human foot by which it is covered  rollo could not be made to consent himself to kiss king charless foot and finally the difficulty was compromised by his agreeing to do it by proxy he ordered one of his courtiers to perform that part of the ceremony the courtier obeyed but when he came to lift the foot he did it so rudely and lifted it so high as to turn the monarch over off his seat this made a laugh but rollo was too powerful for charles to think of resenting it  a few days after this rollo was baptized in the cathedral church at rouen with great pomp and parade and then on the following week he was married to giselle the din of war in which he had lived for more than thirty years was now changed into festivities and rejoicings he took full and peaceable possession of his dukedom and governed it for the remainder of his days with great wisdom and lived in great prosperity he made it in fact one of the richest and most prosperous realms in europe and laid the foundations of still higher degrees of greatness and power which were gradually developed after his death and this was the origin of normandy  it appears thus that this part of france was seized by rollo and his northmen partly because it was nearest at hand to them being accessible from the english channel through the river seine and partly on account of its exceeding richness and fertility it has been famous in every age as the garden of france and travelers at the present day gaze upon its picturesque and beautiful scenery with the highest admiration and pleasure and yet the scenes which are there presented to the view are wholly unlike those which constitute picturesque and beautiful rural scenery in england and america in normandy the land is not inclosed no hedges fences or walls break the continuity of the surface but vast tracts spread in every direction divided into plots and squares of various sizes and forms by the varieties of cultivation like a vast carpet of an irregular tesselated pattern and varied in the color by a thousand hues of brown and green here and there vast forests extend where countless thousands of trees though ancient and venerable in form stand in rows mathematically arranged as they were planted centuries ago these are royal demesnes and hunting grounds and parks connected with the country palaces of the kings or the chateaux of the ancient nobility the cultivators of the soil live not as in america in little farmhouses built along the roadsides and dotting the slopes of the hills but in compact villages consisting of ancient dwellings of brick or stone densely packed together along a single street from which the laborers issue in picturesque dresses men and women together every morning to go miles perhaps to the scene of their daily toil except these villages and the occasional appearance of an ancient chateau no habitations are seen the country seems a vast solitude teeming everywhere however with fertility and beauty the roads which traverse these scenes are magnificent avenues broad straight continuing for many miles an undeviating course over the undulations of the land with nothing to separate them from the expanse of cultivation and fruitfulness on either hand but rows of ancient and venerable trees between these rows of trees the traveler sees an interminable vista extending both before him and behind him in england the public road winds beautifully between walls overhung with shrubbery or hedgerows with stiles or gateways here and there revealing hamlets or cottages which appear and disappear in a rapid and endlessly varied succession as the road meanders like a rivulet between its beautiful banks in a word the public highway in england is beautiful in france it is grand  the greatest city in normandy in modern times is rouen which is situated as will be seen by referring to the map at the commencement of this chapter on the seine half way between paris and the sea at the mouth of the seine or rather on the northern shore of the estuary which forms the mouth of the river is a small inlet which has been found to afford on the whole the best facilities for a harbor that can be found on the whole line of the coast even this little port however is so filled up with sand that when the water recedes at low tide it leaves the shipping all aground the inlet would in fact probably become filled up entirely were it not for artificial means taken to prevent it there are locks and gateways built in such a manner as to retain a large body of water until the tide is down and then these gates are opened and the water is allowed to rush out all together carrying with it the mud and sand which had begun to accumulate this haven being on the whole the best and most commodious on the coast was called the harbor or as the french expressed it in their language le havre the word havre meaning harbor in fact the name was in full le havre de grace as if the normans considered it a matter of special good luck to have even such a chance of a harbor as this at the mouth of their river the english world have however dropped all except the principal word from this long phrase of designation and call the port simply havre                                       from rollo the line of dukes of normandy continued in uninterrupted succession down to the time of william a period of about a hundred and fifty years the country increased all the time in wealth in population and in prosperity the original inhabitants were not however expelled they remained as peasants herdsmen and agriculturists while the norman chieftains settled over them holding severally large estates of land which william granted them the races gradually became intermingled though they continued for many centuries to evince the superior spirit and energy which was infused into the population by the norman stock in fact it is thought by many observers that that superiority

williamwilliam is taken to parishe is presented to the french king   although rouen is now very far before all the other cities of normandy in point of magnitude and importance and though rollo in his conquest of the country made it his principal headquarters and his main stronghold it did not continue exclusively the residence of the dukes of normandy in after years the father of william the conqueror was robert who became subsequently the duke the sixth in the line he resided at the time when william was born in a great castle at falaise falaise as will be seen upon the map is west of rouen and it stands like rouen at some distance from the sea the castle was built upon a hill at a little distance from the town it has long since ceased to be habitable but the ruins still remain giving a picturesque but mournful beauty to the eminence which they crown they are often visited by travelers who go to see the place where the great hero and conqueror was born  the hill on which the old castle stands terminates on one side at the foot of the castle walls in a precipice of rocks and on two other sides also the ascent is too steep to be practicable for an enemy on the fourth side there is a more gradual declivity up which the fortress could be approached by means of a winding roadway at the foot of this roadway was the town the access to the castle from the town was defended by a ditch and drawbridge with strong towers on each side of the gateway to defend the approach there was a beautiful stream of water which meandered along through the valley near the town and after passing it it disappeared winding around the foot of the precipice which the castle crowned the castle inclosures were shut in with walls of stone of enormous thickness so thick in fact they were that some of the apartments were built in the body of the wall there were various buildings within the inclosure there was in particular one large square tower several stories in height built of white stone this tower it is said still stands in good preservation there was a chapel also and various other buildings and apartments within the walls for the use of the ducal family and their numerous retinue of servants and attendants for the storage of munitions of war and for the garrison there were watchtowers on the corners of the walls and on various lofty projecting pinnacles where solitary sentinels watched the livelong day and night for any approaching danger these sentinels looked down on a broad expanse of richlycultivated country fields beautified with groves of trees and with the various colors presented by the changing vegetation while meandering streams gleamed with their silvery radiance among them and hamlets of laborers and peasantry were scattered here and there giving life and animation to the scene  we have said that williams father was robert the sixth duke of normandy so that william himself being his immediate successor was the seventh in the line and as it is the design of these narratives not merely to amuse the reader with what is entertaining as a tale but to impart substantial historical knowledge we must prepare the way for the account of williams birth by presenting a brief chronological view of the whole ducal line extending from rollo to william we recommend to the reader to examine with special attention this brief account of williams ancestry for the true causes which led to williams invasion of england can not be fully appreciated without thoroughly understanding certain important transactions in which some members of the family of his ancestors were concerned before he was born this is particularly the case with the lady emma who as will be seen by the following summary was the sister of the third duke in the line the extraordinary and eventful history of her life is so intimately connected with the subsequent exploits of william that it is necessary to relate it in full and it becomes accordingly the subject of one of the subsequent chapters of this volume  chronological history of the norman line  rollo first duke of normandy  from ad 912 to ad 917  it was about 870 that rollo was banished from norway and a few years after that at most that he landed in france it was not however until 912 that he concluded his treaty of peace with charles so as to be fully invested with the title of duke of normandy  he was advanced in age at this time and after spending five years in settling the affairs of his realm he resigned his dukedom into the hands of his son that he might spend the remainder of his days in rest and peace he died in 922 five years after his resignation  william i second duke of normandy  from 917 to 942  william was rollos son he began to reign of course five years before his fathers death he had a quiet and prosperous reign of about twentyfive years but he was assassinated at last by a political enemy in 942  richard i third duke of normandy  from 942 to 996  he was only ten years old when his father was assassinated he became involved in long and arduous wars with the king of france which compelled him to call in the aid of more northmen from the baltic his new allies in the end gave him as much trouble as the old enemy with whom they came to help william contend and he found it very hard to get them away he wanted at length to make peace with the french king and to have them leave his dominions but they said that was not what they came for  richard had a beautiful daughter named emma who afterward became a very important political personage as will be seen more fully in a subsequent chapter  richard died in 996 after reigning fiftyfour years  richard ii fourth duke of normandy  from 996 to 1026  richard ii was the son of richard i and as his father had been engaged during his reign in contentions with his sovereign lord the king of france he in his turn was harassed by longcontinued struggles with his vassals the barons and nobles of his own realm he too sent for northmen to come and assist him during his reign there was a great contest in england between the saxons and the danes and ethelred who was the saxon claimant to the throne came to normandy and soon afterward married the lady emma richards sister the particulars of this event from which the most momentous consequences were afterward seen to flow will be given in full in a future chapter richard died in 1026 he left two sons richard and robert william the conqueror was the son of the youngest and was born two years before this richard ii died  richard iii fifth duke of normandy  from 1026 to 1028  he was the oldest brother and of course succeeded to the dukedom his brother robert was then only a baronhis son william afterward the conqueror being then about two years old robert was very ambitious and aspiring and eager to get possession of the dukedom himself he adopted every possible means to circumvent and supplant his brother and as is supposed shortened his days by the anxiety and vexation which he caused him for richard died suddenly and mysteriously only two years after his accession it was supposed by some in fact that he was poisoned though there was never any satisfactory proof of this  robert sixth duke of normandy  from 1028 to 1035  robert of course succeeded his brother and then with the characteristic inconsistency of selfishness and ambition he employed all the power of his realm in helping the king of france to subdue his younger brother who was evincing the same spirit of seditiousness and insubmission that he had himself displayed his assistance was of great importance to king henry it in fact decided the contest in his favor and thus one younger brother was put down in the commencement of his career of turbulence and rebellion by another who had successfully accomplished a precisely similar course of crime king henry was very grateful for the service thus rendered and was ready to do all in his power at all times to cooperate with robert in the plans which the latter might form robert died in 1035 when william was about eleven years old  and here we close this brief summary of the history of the ducal line as we have already passed the period of williams birth and we return accordingly to give in detail some of the particulars of that event  illustration william and arlotte                                       although the dukes of normandy were very powerful potentates reigning as they did almost in the character of independent sovereigns over one of the richest and most populous territories of the globe and though william the conqueror was the son of one of them his birth was nevertheless very ignoble his mother was not the wife of robert his father but a poor peasant girl the daughter of an humble tanner of falaise and indeed williams father robert was not himself the duke at this time but a simple baron as his father was still living it was not even certain that he ever would be the duke as his older brother who of course would come before him was also then alive still as the son and prospective heir of the reigning duke his rank was very high  the circumstances of roberts first acquaintance with the tanners daughter were these he was one day returning home to the castle from some expedition on which he had been sent by his father when he saw a group of peasant girls standing on the margin of the brook washing clothes they were barefooted and their dress was in other respects disarranged there was one named arlotteb the daughter of a tanner of the town whose countenance and figure seem to have captivated the young baron he gazed at her with admiration and pleasure as he rode along her complexion was fair her eyes full and blue and the expression of her countenance was frank and open and happy she was talking joyously and merrily with her companions as robert passed little dreaming of the conspicuous place on the page of english history which she was to occupy in all future time in connection with the gay horseman who was riding by  footnote b her name is spelled variously arlette arlotte harlotte and in other ways  the etiquette of royal and ducal palaces and castles in those days as now forbade that a noble of such lofty rank should marry a peasant girl robert could not therefore have arlotte for his wife but there was nothing to prevent his proposing her coming to the castle and living with himthat is nothing but the law of god and this was an authority to which dukes and barons in the middle ages were accustomed to pay very little regard there was not even a public sentiment to forbid this for a nobility like that of england and france in the middle ages stands so far above all the mass of society as to be scarcely amenable at all to the ordinary restrictions and obligations of social life and even to the present day in those countries where dukes exist public sentiment seems to tolerate pretty generally whatever dukes see fit to do  accordingly as soon as robert had arrived at the castle he sent a messenger from his retinue of attendants down to the village to the father of arlotte proposing that she should come to the castle the father seems to have had some hesitation in respect to his duty it is said that he had a brother who was a monk or rather hermit who lived a life of reading meditation and prayer in a solitary place not far from falaise arlottes father sent immediately to this religious recluse for his spiritual counsel the monk replied that it was right to comply with the wishes of so great a man whatever they might be the tanner thus relieved of all conscientious scruples on the subject by this high religious authority and rejoicing in the opening tide of prosperity and distinction which he foresaw for his family through the barons love robed and decorated his daughter like a lamb for the sacrifice and sent her to the castle  arlotte had one of the rooms assigned her which was built in the thickness of the wall it communicated by a door with the other apartments and inclosures within the area and there were narrow windows in the masonry without through which she could look out over the broad expanse of beautiful fields and meadows which were smiling below robert seems to have loved her with sincere and strong affection and to have done all in his power to make her happy her room however could not have been very sumptuously furnished although she was the favorite in a ducal castleat least so far as we can judge from the few glimpses we get of the interior through the ancient chroniclers stories one story is that when william was born his first exploit was to grasp a handful of straw and to hold it so tenaciously in his little fist that the nurse could scarcely take it away the nurse was greatly delighted with this infantile prowess she considered it an omen and predicted that the babe would some day signalize himself by seizing and holding great possessions the prediction would have been forgotten if william had not become the conqueror of england at a future day as it was it was remembered and recorded and it suggests to our imagination a very different picture of the conveniences and comforts of arlottes chamber from those presented to the eye in ducal palaces now where carpets of velvet silence the tread on marble floors and favorites repose under silken canopies on beds of down  the babe was named william and he was a great favorite with his father he was brought up at falaise two years after his birth roberts father died and his oldest brother richard iii succeeded to the ducal throne in two years more which years were spent in contention between the brothers richard also died and then robert himself came into possession of the castle in his own name reigning there over all the cities and domains of normandy  william was of course now about four years old he was a bright and beautiful boy and he grew more and more engaging every year his father instead of neglecting and disowning him as it might have been supposed he would do took a great deal of pride and pleasure in witnessing the gradual development of his powers and his increasing attractiveness and he openly acknowledged him as his son  in fact william was a universal favorite about the castle when he was five and six years old he was very fond of playing the soldier he would marshal the other boys of the castle his playmates into a little troop and train them around the castle inclosures just as ardent and aspiring boys do with their comrades now he possessed a certain vivacity and spirit too which gave him even then a great ascendency over his playfellows he invented their plays he led them in their mischief he settled their disputes in a word he possessed a temperament and character which enabled him very easily and strongly to hold the position which his rank as son of the lord of the castle so naturally assigned him  a few years thus passed away when at length robert conceived the design of making a pilgrimage to the holy land this was a plan not of humbleminded piety but of ambition for fame to make a pilgrimage to the holy land was a romantic achievement that covered whoever accomplished it with a sort of sombre glory which in the case of a prince or potentate mingled with and hallowed and exalted his military renown robert determined on making the pilgrimage it was a distant and dangerous journey in fact the difficulties and dangers of the way were perhaps what chiefly imparted to the enterprise its romance and gave it its charms it was customary for kings and rulers before setting out to arrange all the affairs of their kingdoms to provide a regency to govern during their absence and to determine upon their successors so as to provide for the very probable contingency of their not living to return  as soon therefore as robert announced his plan of a pilgrimage mens minds were immediately turned to the question of the succession robert had never been married and he had consequently no son who was entitled to succeed him he had two brothers and also a cousin and some other relatives who had claims to the succession these all began to maneuver among the chieftains and nobles each endeavoring to prepare the way for having his own claims advanced while robert himself was secretly determining that the little william should be his heir he said nothing about this however but he took care to magnify the importance of his little son in every way and to bring him as much as possible into public notice william on his part possessed so much personal beauty and so many juvenile accomplishments that he became a great favorite with all the nobles and chieftains and knights who saw him sometimes at his fathers castle and sometimes away from home in their own fortresses or towns where his father took him from time to time in his train  at length when affairs were ripe for their consummation duke robert called together a grand council of all the subordinate dukes and earls and barons of his realm to make known to them the plan of his pilgrimage they came together from all parts of normandy each in a splendid cavalcade and attended by an armed retinue of retainers when the assembly had been convened and the preliminary forms and ceremonies had been disposed of robert announced his grand design  as soon as he had concluded one of the nobles whose name and title was guy count of burgundy rose and addressed the duke in reply he was sorry he said to hear that the duke his cousin entertained such a plan he feared for the safety of the realm when the chief ruler should be gone all the estates of the realm he said the barons the knights the chieftains and soldiers of every degree would be all without a head  not so said robert i will leave you a master in my place then pointing to the beautiful boy by his side he added i have a little fellow here who though he is little now i acknowledge will grow bigger by and by with gods grace and i have great hopes that he will become a brave and gallant man i present him to you and from this time forth i give him seizinc of the duchy of normandy as my known and acknowledged heir and i appoint alan duke of brittany governor of normandy in my name until i shall return and in case i shall not return in the name of william my son until he shall become of manly age  footnote c seizin an ancient feudal term denoting the inducting of a party to a legal possession of his right  the assembly was taken wholly by surprise at this announcement alan duke of brittany who was one of the chief claimants to the succession was pleased with the honor conferred upon him in making him at once the governor of the realm and was inclined to prefer the present certainty of governing at once in the name of others to the remote contingency of reigning in his own the other claimants to the inheritance were confounded by the suddenness of the emergency and knew not what to say or do the rest of the assembly were pleased with the romance of having the beautiful boy for their feudal sovereign the duke saw at once that every thing was favorable to the accomplishment of his design he took the lad in his arms kissed him and held him out in view of the assembly william gazed around upon the panoplied warriors before him with a bright and beaming eye they knelt down as by a common accord to do him homage and then took the oath of perpetual allegiance and fidelity to his cause  robert thought however that it would not be quite prudent to leave his son himself in the custody of these his rivals so he took him with him to paris when he set out upon his pilgrimage with view of establishing him there in the court of henry the french king while he should himself be gone young william was presented to the french king on a day set apart for the ceremony with great pomp and parade the king held a special court to receive him he seated himself on his throne in a grand apartment of his palace and was surrounded by his nobles and officers of state all magnificently dressed for the occasion at the proper time duke robert came in dressed in his pilgrims garb and leading young william by the hand his attendant pilgrim knights accompanied him robert led the boy to the feet of their common sovereign and kneeling there ordered william to kneel too to do homage to the king king henry received him very graciously he embraced him and promised to receive him into his court and to take the best possible care of him while his father was away the courtiers were very much struck with the beauty and noble bearing of the boy his countenance beamed with an animated but yet very serious expression as he was somewhat awed by the splendor of the scene around him he was himself then nine years old     chapter iii  the accession  ad 10351040  robert departs on his pilgrimagehe visits rome and constantinopleroberts illnesslitter bearersdeath of

to henrythe castle at arques takenwilliam crowned at falaise   after spending a little time at paris robert took leave of the king and of william his son and went forth with a train of attendant knights on his pilgrimage he had a great variety of adventures which can not be related here as it is the history of the son and not of the father which is the subject of this narrative though he traveled strictly as a pilgrim it was still with great pomp and parade after visiting rome and accomplishing various services and duties connected with his pilgrimage there he laid aside his pilgrims garb and assuming his proper rank as a great norman chieftain he went to constantinople where he made a great display of his wealth and magnificence at the time of the grand procession for example by which he entered the city of constantinople he rode a mule which besides being gorgeously caparisoned had shoes of gold instead of iron and these shoes were purposely attached so slightly to the hoofs that they were shaken off as the animal walked along to be picked up by the populace this was to impress them with grand ideas of the riders wealth and splendor after leaving constantinople robert resumed his pilgrims garb and went on toward the holy land  the journey however did not pass without the usual vicissitudes of so long an absence and so distant a pilgrimage at one time robert was sick and after lingering for some time in a fever he so far recovered his strength as to be borne on a litter by the strength of other men though he could not advance himself either on horseback or on foot and as for traveling carriages there had been no such invention in those days they made arrangements therefore for carrying the duke on a litter there were sixteen moorish slaves employed to serve as his bearers this company was divided into sets four in each the several sets taking the burden in rotation robert and his attendant knights looked down with great contempt on these black pagan slaves one day the cavalcade was met by a norman who was returning home to normandy after having accomplished his pilgrimage he asked duke robert if he had any message to send to his friends at home yes said he tell them you saw me here on my way to paradise carried by sixteen demons  robert reached jerusalem and set out on his return and soon after rumors came back to paris that he had died on his way home the accounts of the manner of his death were contradictory and uncertain but the fact was soon made sure and the news produced every where a great sensation it soon appeared that the brothers and cousins of robert who had claimed the right to succeed him in preference to his son william had only suspended their claimsthey had not abandoned them they began to gather their forces each in his own separate domain and to prepare to take the field if necessary in vindication of what they considered their rights to the inheritance in a word their oaths of fealty to william were all forgotten and each claimant was intent only on getting possession himself of the ducal crown  in the mean time william himself was at paris and only eleven years of age he had been receiving a careful education there and was a very prepossessing and accomplished young prince still he was yet but a mere boy he had been under the care of a military tutor whose name was theroulde theroulde was a veteran soldier who had long been in the employ of the king of france he took great interest in his young pupils progress he taught him to ride and to practice all the evolutions of horsemanship which were required by the tactics of those days he trained him too in the use of arms the bow and arrow the javelin the sword the spear and accustomed him to wear and to exercise in the armor of steel with which warriors were used in those days to load themselves in going into battle young princes like william had suits of this armor made for them of small size which they were accustomed to wear in private in their military exercises and trainings and to appear in publicly on great occasions of state these dresses of iron were of course very heavy and uncomfortable but the young princes and dukes were nevertheless very proud and happy to wear them  while william was thus engaged in pursuing his military education in paris several competitors for his dukedom immediately appeared in normandy and took the field the strongest and most prominent among them was the earl of arques his name was william too but to distinguish him from the young duke we shall call him arques he was a brother of robert and maintained that as robert left no lawful heir he was indisputably entitled to succeed him arques assembled his forces and prepared to take possession of the country  it will be recollected that robert when he left normandy in setting out on his pilgrimage had appointed a nobleman named alan to act as regent or governor of the country until he should return or in case he should never return until william should become of age alan had a council of officers called the council of regency with whose aid he managed the administration of the government this council with alan at their head proclaimed young william duke and immediately began to act in his name when they found that the earl of arques was preparing to seize the government they began to assemble their forces also and thus both sides prepared for war  before they actually commenced hostilities however the pilgrim knights who had accompanied robert on his pilgrimage and who had been journeying home slowly by themselves ever since their leaders death arrived in normandy these were chieftains and nobles of high rank and influence and each of the contending parties were eager to have them join their side besides the actual addition of force which these men could bring to the cause they should espouse the moral support they would give to it was a very important consideration their having been on this long and dangerous pilgrimage invested them with a sort of romantic and religious interest in the minds of all the people who looked up to them in consequence of it with a sort of veneration and awe and then as they had been selected by robert to accompany him on his pilgrimage and had gone on the long and dangerous journey with him continuing to attend upon him until he died they were naturally regarded as his most faithful and confidential friends for these and similar reasons it was obvious that the cause which they should espouse in the approaching contest would gain a large accession of moral power by their adhesion  as soon as they arrived in normandy rejecting all proposals from other quarters they joined young williams cause with the utmost promptitude and decision alan received them at once into his councils an assembly was convened and the question was discussed whether william should be sent for to come to normandy some argued that he was yet a mere boy incapable of rendering them any real service in the impending contest while he would be exposed more perhaps than they themselves to be taken captive or slain they thought it best therefore that he should remain for the present in paris under the protection of the french king  others on the other hand contended that the influence of williams presence boy as he was would animate and inspire all his followers and awaken every where throughout the country a warm interest in his cause that his very tenderness and helplessness would appeal strongly to every generous heart and that his youthful accomplishments and personal charms would enlist thousands in his favor who would forget and perhaps abandon him if he kept away besides it was by no means certain that he was so safe as some might suppose in king henrys custody and power king henry might himself lay claims to the vacant duchy with a view of bestowing it upon some favorite of his own in which case he might confine young william in one of his castles in an honorable but still rigid and hopeless captivity or treacherously destroy his life by the secret administration of poison  these latter counsels prevailed alan and the nobles who were with him sent an embassage to the court of king henry to bring william home henry made objections and difficulties this alarmed the nobles they feared that it would prove true that henry himself had designs on normandy they sent a new embassage with demands more urgent than before finally after some time spent in negotiations and delays king henry concluded to yield and william set out on his return he was now about twelve or thirteen years old his military tutor theroulde accompanied him and he was attended likewise by the embassadors whom alan had sent for him and by a strong escort for his protection by the way he arrived in safety at alans headquarters  williams presence in normandy had the effect which had been anticipated from it it awakened every where a great deal of enthusiasm in his favor the soldiers were pleased to see how handsome their young commander was in form and how finely he could ride he was in fact a very superior equestrian for one so young he was more fond even than other boys of horses and as of course the most graceful and the fleetest horses which could be found were provided for him and as theroulde had given him the best and most complete instruction he made a fine display as he rode swiftly through the camp followed by veteran nobles splendidly dressed and mounted and happy to be in his train while his own countenance beamed with a radiance in which native intelligence and beauty were heightened by the animation and excitement of pride and pleasure in respect to the command of the army of course the real power remained in alans hands but every thing was done in williams name and in respect to all external marks and symbols of sovereignty the beautiful boy seemed to possess the supreme command and as the sentiment of loyalty is always the strongest when the object which calls for the exercise of it is most helpless or frail alan found his power very much increased when he had this beautiful boy to exhibit as the true and rightful heir in whose name and for whose benefit all his power was held  still however the country was very far from becoming settled the earl of arques kept the field and other claimants too strengthened themselves in their various castles and towns as if preparing to resist in those days every separate district of the country was almost a separate realm governed by its own baron who lived with his retainers within his own castle walls and ruled the land around him with a rod of iron these barons were engaged in perpetual quarrels among themselves each plundering the dominions of the rest or making hostile incursions into the territories of a neighbor to revenge some real or imaginary wrong this turbulence and disorder prevailed every where throughout normandy at the time of williams return in the general confusion williams government scarcely knew who were his friends or his enemies at one time when a deputation was sent to some of the barons in williams name summoning them to come with their forces and join his standard as they were in duty bound to do they felt independent enough to send back word to him that they had too much to do in settling their own quarrels to be able to pay any attention to his  in the course of a year or two moreover and while his own realm continued in this unsettled and distracted state william became involved in what was almost a quarrel with king henry himself when he was fifteen years old which was two or three years after his return from paris to normandy henry sent directions to william to come to a certain town called evreux situated about half way between falaise and paris and just within the confines of normandyd to do homage to him there for his duchy there was some doubt among williams counselors whether it would be most prudent to obey or disobey this command they finally concluded that it was best to obey grand preparations were accordingly made for the expedition and when all was ready the young duke was conducted in great state and with much pomp and parade to meet his sovereign  footnote d see map at the commencement of chapter ix  the interview between william and his sovereign and the ceremonies connected with it lasted some days in the course of this time william remained at evreux and was in some sense of course in henrys power william having been so long in henrys court as a mere boy accustomed all the time to look up to and obey henry as a father regarded him somewhat in that light now and approached him with great deference and respect henry received him in a somewhat haughty and imperious manner as if he considered him still under the same subjection as heretofore  william had a fortress or castle on the frontiers of his dukedom toward henrys dominions the name of the castle was telli√®res and the governor of it was a faithful old soldier named de crespin williams father robert had intrusted de crespin with the command of the castle and given him a garrison to defend it henry now began to make complaint to william in respect to this castle the garrison he said were continually making incursions into his dominions william replied that he was very sorry that there was cause for such a complaint he would inquire into it and if the fact were really so he would have the evil immediately corrected henry replied that that was not sufficient you must deliver up the castle to me he said to be destroyed william was indignant at such a demand but he was so accustomed to obey implicitly whatever king henry might require of him that he sent the order to have the castle surrendered  when however the order came to de crespin the governor of the castle he refused to obey it the fortress he said had been committed to his charge by robert duke of normandy and he should not give it up to the possession of any foreign power when this answer was reported to william and his counselors it made them still more indignant than before at the domineering tyranny of the command and more disposed than ever to refuse obedience to it still william was in a great measure in the monarchs power on cool reflection they perceived that resistance would then be vain new and more authoritative orders were accordingly issued for the surrender of the castle de crespin now obeyed he gave up the keys and withdrew with his garrison william was then allowed to leave evreux and return home and soon afterward the castle was razed to the ground  this affair produced of course a great deal of animosity and irritation between the governments of france and normandy and where such a state of feeling exists between two powers separated only by an imaginary line running through a populous and fertile country aggressions from one side and from the other are sure to follow these are soon succeeded by acts of retaliation and revenge leading in the end to an open and general war it was so now henry marched his armies into normandy seized towns destroyed castles and where he was resisted by the people he laid waste the country with fire and sword he finally laid siege to the very castle of falaise  william and his government were for a time nearly overwhelmed with the tide of disaster and calamity the tide turned however at length and the fortune of war inclined in their favor william rescued the town and castle of falaise it was in a very remarkable manner too that this exploit was accomplished the fortress was closely invested with henrys forces and was on the very eve of being surrendered the story is that henry had offered bribes to the governor of the castle to give it up to him and that the governor had agreed to receive them and to betray his trust while he was preparing to do so william arrived at the head of a resolute and determined band of normans they came with so sudden an onset upon the army of besiegers as to break up their camp and force them to abandon the siege the people of the town and the garrison of the castle were extremely rejoiced to be thus rescued and when they came to learn through whose instrumentality they had been saved and saw the beautiful horseman whom they remembered as a gay and happy child playing about the precincts of the castle they were perfectly intoxicated with delight they filled the air with the wildest acclamations and welcomed william back to the home of his childhood with manifestations of the most extravagant joy as to the traitorous governor he was dealt with very leniently perhaps the general feeling of joy awakened emotions of leniency and forgiveness in williams mindor perhaps the proof against the betrayer was incomplete they did not therefore take his life which would have been justly forfeited according to the military ideas of the times if he had been really guilty they deprived him of his command confiscated his property and let him go free  after this williams forces continued for some time to make head successfully against those of the king of france but then on the other hand the danger from his uncle the earl of arques increased the earl took advantage of the difficulty and danger in which william was involved in his contests with king henry and began to organize his forces again he fortified himself in his castle at arquese and was collecting a large force there arques was in the northeastern part of normandy near the sea where the ruins of the ancient castle still remain the earl built an almost impregnable tower for himself on the summit of the rock on which the castle stood in a situation so inaccessible that he thought he could retreat to it in any emergency with a few chosen followers and bid defiance to any assault in and around this castle the earl had got quite a large army together william advanced with his forces and encamping around them shut them in king henry who was then in a distant part of normandy began to put his army in motion to come to the rescue of arques  footnote e see map chapter ix  things being in this state william left a strong body of men to continue the investment and siege of arques and went off himself at the head of the remainder of his force to intercept henry on his advance the result was a battle and a victory gained under circumstances so extraordinary that william young as he was acquired by his exploits a brilliant and universal renown  it seems that henry in his progress to arques had to pass through a long and gloomy valley which was bounded on either side by precipitous and forestcovered hills through this dangerous defile the long train of henrys army was advancing arranged and marshaled in such an order as seemed to afford the greatest hope of security in case of an attack first came the vanguard a strong escort formed of heavy bodies of soldiery armed with battleaxes and pikes and other similar weapons the most efficient then known immediately after this vanguard came a long train of baggage the tents the provisions the stores and all the munitions of war the baggage was followed by a great company of servantsthe cooks the carters the laborers the camp followers of every descriptiona throng of noncombatants useless of course in a battle and a burden on a march and yet the inseparable and indispensable attendant of an army whether at rest or in motion after this throng came the main body of the army with the king escorted by his guard of honor at the head of it an active and efficient corps of lancers and menatarms brought up the rear  william conceived the design of drawing this cumbrous and unmanageable body into an ambuscade he selected accordingly the narrowest and most dangerous part of the defile for the purpose and stationed vast numbers of norman soldiers armed with javelins and arrows upon the slopes of the hill on either side concealing them all carefully among the thickets and rocks he then marshaled the remainder of his forces in the valley and sent them up the valley to meet henry as he was descending this body of troops which was to advance openly to meet the king as if they constituted the whole of williams force were to fight a pretended battle with the vanguard and then to retreat in hopes to draw the whole train after them in a pursuit so eager as to throw them into confusion and then when the column thus disarranged should reach the place of ambuscade the normans were to come down upon them suddenly from their hidingplaces and complete their discomfiture  the plan was well laid and wisely and bravely executed and it was most triumphantly successful in its result the vanguard of henrys army were deceived by the pretended flight of the norman detachment they supposed too that it constituted the whole body of their enemies they pressed forward therefore with great exultation and eagerness to pursue them news of the attack and of the apparent repulse with which the french soldiers had met it passed rapidly along the valley producing every where the wildest excitement and an eager desire to press forward to the scene of conflict the whole valley was filled with shouts and outcries baggage was abandoned that those who had charge of it might hurry on men ran to and fro for tidings or ascended eminences to try to see horsemen drove at full speed from front to rear and from rear on to the front again orders and counter orders were given which nobody would understand or attend to in the general confusion and din in fact the universal attention seemed absorbed in one general and eager desire to press forward with headlong impetuosity to the scene of victory and pursuit which they supposed was enacting in the van  the army pressed on in this confused and excited manner until they reached the place of ambuscade they went on too through this narrow passage as heedlessly as ever and when the densest and most powerful portion of the column was crowding through they were suddenly thunderstruck by the issuing of a thousand weapons from the heights and thickets above them on either handa dreadful shower of arrows javelins and spears which struck down hundreds in a moment and overwhelmed the rest with astonishment and terror as soon as this first discharge had been effected the concealed enemy came pouring down the sides of the mountain springing out from a thousand hidingplaces as if suddenly brought into being by some magic power the discomfiture of henrys forces was complete and irremediable the men fled every where in utter dismay trampling upon and destroying one another as they crowded back in terrified throngs to find some place of safety up the valley there after a day or two henry got together the scattered remains of his army and established something like a camp  it is a curious illustration of the feudal feelings of those times in respect to the gradation of ranks or else of the extraordinary modesty and good sense of williams character that he assumed no airs of superiority over his sovereign and showed no signs of extravagant elation after this battle he sent a respectful embassage to henry recognizing his own acknowledged subjection to henry as his sovereign and imploring his protection he looked confidently to him he said for aid and support against his rebellious subjects  though he thus professed however to rely on henry he really trusted most it seems to his own right arm for as soon as this battle was fairly over and while the whole country was excited with the astonishing brilliancy of the exploit performed by so young a man william mounted his horse and calling upon those to follow him who wished to do so he rode at full speed at the head of a small cavalcade to the castle at arques his sudden appearance here with the news of the victory inspirited the besiegers to such a degree that the castle was soon taken he allowed the rebel earl to escape and thus perhaps all the more effectually put an end to the rebellion he was now in peaceable possession of his realm  he went in triumph to falaise where he was solemnly crowned with great ceremony and parade and all normandy was filled with congratulations and rejoicings     chapter iv  williams reign in normandy  ad 10401060  a lapse of twenty

braverywilliams victoryapplause of the french armywilliam firmly seated on his thronehis new projects   from the time of williams obtaining quiet possession of his realm to his invasion of england a long period intervened there was a lapse of more than twenty years during this long interval william governed his duchy suppressed insurrections built castles and towns carried on wars regulated civil institutions and in fact exercised in a very energetic and successful manner all the functions of governmenthis life being diversified all the time by the usual incidents which mark the career of a great military ruler of an independent realm in the middle ages we will give in this chapter a description of some of these incidents  on one occasion a conspiracy was formed to take his life by secret assassination a great chieftain named guy of burgundy williams uncle was the leader of it and a halfwitted man named galet who occupied the place of jester or fool in williams court was the means of discovering and exposing it these jesters of whom there was always one or more in the retinue of every great prince in those days were either very eccentric or very foolish or halfinsane men who were dressed fantastically in gaudy colors and with cap and bells and were kept to make amusement for the court the name of williams jester was galet  guy of burgundy and his fellowconspirators occupied certain gloomy castles built in remote and lonely situations on the confines of normandy here they were accustomed to assemble for the purpose of concocting their plans and gathering their men and their resourcesdoing every thing in the most cunning and secret manner before their scheme was fully ripe for execution it happened that william made a hunting excursion into the neighborhood of their territory with a small band of followerssuch as would be naturally got together on such a party of pleasure galet the fool was among them  as soon as guy and his fellowconspirators learned that william was so near they determined to precipitate the execution of their plan and waylay and assassinate him on his return  they accordingly left their secret and lonely rendezvous among the mountains one by one in order to avoid attracting observation and went to a town called bayeux through which they supposed that william would have to pass on his return here they held secret consultations and formed their final plans they sent out a part of their number in small bands into the region of country which william would have to cross to occupy the various roads and passes and thus to cut off all possibility of his escape they made all these arrangements in the most secret and cautious manner and began to think that they were sure of their prey  it happened however that some of williams attendants with galet the fool among them had preceded william on his return and had reached bayeuxf at the time when the conspirators arrived there the townspeople did not observe the coming of the conspirators particularly as many horsemen and soldiers were coming and going at that time and they had no means of distinguishing the dukes friends from his enemies but galet as he sauntered about the town noticed that there were many soldiers and knights to be seen who were not of his masters party this attracted his attention he began to watch the motions of these strangers and to listen without seeming to listen in order to catch the words they spoke to each other as they talked in groups or passed one another in the streets he was soon satisfied that some mischief was intended he immediately threw aside his cap and bells and his fantastic dress and taking a staff in his hand he set off on foot to go back as fast as possible in search of the duke and give him the alarm he found the duke at a village called valonges he arrived there at night he pressed forward hastily into his masters chamber half forcing his way through the attendants who accustomed to the liberties which such a personage as he was accustomed to take on all occasions made only a feeble resistance to his wishes he found the duke asleep and he called upon him with a very earnest voice to awake and arise immediately for his life was in danger  footnote f see map chapter ix  william was at first inclined to disbelieve the story which galet told him and to think that there was no cause to fear he was however soon convinced that galet was right and that there was reason for alarm he arose and dressed himself hastily and inasmuch as a monarch in the first moments of the discovery of a treasonable plot knows not whom to trust william wisely concluded not to trust any body he went himself to the stables saddled his horse with his own hand mounted him and rode away he had a very narrow escape for at the same time while galet was hastening to valonges to give his master warning of his danger the conspirators had been advancing to the same place and had completely surrounded it and they were on the eve of making an attack upon williams quarters at the very hour when he set out upon his flight william had accordingly proceeded only a little way on his route before he heard the footsteps of galloping horses and the clanking of arms on the road behind him it was a troop of the conspirators coming who finding that william had fled had set off immediately in pursuit william rode hastily into a wood and let them go by  illustration williams escape  he remained for some time in his hidingplace and then cautiously emerged from it to continue his way he did not dare to keep the public road although it was night but took a wild and circuitous route in lanes and bypaths which conducted him at length to the vicinity of the sea here about daybreak he was passing a mansion supposing that no one would observe him at so early an hour when suddenly he perceived a man sitting at the gate armed and equipped and in an attitude of waiting he was waiting for his horse he was a nobleman named hubert he recognized william immediately as the duke and accosted him in a tone of astonishment saying why my lord duke is it possible that this is you he was amazed to see the ruler of the realm out at such an hour in such a condition alone exhausted his dress all in disorder from the haste with which he had put it on and his steed breathless and covered with dust and ready apparently to drop down with fatigue and exhaustion  william finding that he was recognized related his story it appeared in the end that hubert held his own castle and village as a tenant of one of the principal conspirators and was bound according to the feudal ideas of the time to espouse his landlords cause he told william however that he had nothing to fear i will defend your life said he as if it were my own so saying he called his three sons who were all athletic and courageous young men and commanded them to mount their horses and get ready for a march he took william into his castle and gave him the food and refreshment that he needed then he brought him again into the courtyard of the house where william found the three young horsemen mounted and ready and a strong and fleet steed prepared for himself he mounted hubert commanded his sons to conduct the prince with all dispatch to falaise without traveling at all upon the highway or entering a town they took accordingly a straight course across the countrywhich was probably then as now nearly destitute of inclosuresand conducted william safely to his castle at falaise  in the course of the morning williams pursuers came to huberts castle and asked if the duke had been seen going by hubert replied in the affirmative and he mounted his steed with great readiness to go and show them the road which the fugitive had taken he urged them to ride hard in hopes of soon overtaking the object of their pursuit they drove on accordingly with great impetuosity and ardor under huberts guidance but as he had purposely taken a wrong road he was only leading them further and further astray finally they gave up the chase and hubert returned with the disappointed pursuers to his fortress william having in the mean time arrived safely at falaise  the conspirators now found that it was useless any longer to attempt to conceal their plans in fact they were already all exposed and they knew that william would immediately summon his troops and come out to seize them they must therefore either fly from the country or attempt an open rebellion they decided on the latterthe result was a civil war in the end william was victorious he took a large number of the rebels prisoners and he adopted the following very singular plan for inflicting a suitable punishment upon them and at the same time erecting a permanent monument of his victory he laid out a public road across the country on the line over which he had been conducted by the sons of hubert and compelled the rebels to make it a great part of this country was low and marshy and had been for this reason avoided by the public road which took a circuitous course around it the rebel prisoners were now however set at work to raise a terrace or embankment on a line surveyed by williams engineers which followed almost exactly the course of his retreat the high road was then laid out upon this terrace and it became immediately a public thoroughfare of great importance it continued for several centuries one of the most frequented highways in the realm and was known by the name of the raised roadterre lev√©ethroughout the kingdom in fact the remains of it appearing like the ruins of an ancient railroad embankment exist to the present day  in the course of the war with these rebels a curious incident occurred at one of the battles or rather is said to have occurred by the historians who tell the story which if true illustrates very strikingly the romantic and chivalrous ideas of the times just as the battle was commencing william perceived a strong and finelyequipped body of horsemen preparing to charge upon the very spot where he himself surrounded by his officers was standing now the armor worn by knights in battle in those times covered and concealed the figure and the face so fully that it would have been impossible even for acquaintances and friends to recognize each other were it not that the knights were all accustomed to wear certain devices upon some part of their armorpainted for instance upon their shields or embroidered on little banners which they boreby means of which they might be known these devices became at length hereditary in the great familiessons being proud to wear themselves the emblems to which the deeds of their fathers had imparted a trace of glory and renown the devices of different chieftains were combined sometimes in cases of intermarriage or were modified in various ways and with these minor changes they would descend from generation to generation as the family coat of arms and this was the origin of heraldry  now the body of horsemen that were advancing to the charge as above described had each of them his device upon a little flag or banner attached to their lances as they were advancing william scrutinized them closely and presently recognized in their leader a man who had formerly been upon his side his name was rollo de tesson he was one of those who had sworn fealty to him at the time when his father robert presented him to the council when setting out upon his pilgrimage william accordingly exclaimed with a loud voice why these are my friends the officers and the soldiers of the bodyguard who were with him taking up the cry shouted friends friends rollo de tesson and the other knights who were slowly coming up preparing to charge upon williams party surprised at being thus accosted paused in their advance and finally halted rollo said to the other knights who gathered around him i was his friend i gave my oath to his father that i would stand by him and defend him with my life and now i have this morning sworn to the count of cotentinthe count of cotentin was the leader of the rebellionthat i would seek out william on the battlefield and be the first to give him a blow i know not what to do keep both oaths replied one of his companions go and strike him a gentle blow and then defend him with your life the whole troop seconded this proposal by acclamation rollo advanced followed by the other knights with gestures and shouts denoting that they were friends he rode up to william told him that he had that morning sworn to strike him and then dealt him a pretended blow upon his shoulder but as both the shoulder and the hand which struck it were armed with steel the clanking sound was all the effect that was produced rollo and his trooptheir sworn obligation to the count of cotentin being thus fulfilledturned now into the ranks of williams soldiery and fought valiantly all day upon his side  although william was generally victorious in the battles that he fought and succeeded in putting down one rebellion after another with promptness and decision still new rebellions and new wars were constantly breaking out which kept his dominions in a continual state of commotion in fact the chieftains the nobles and the knights constituting the only classes of society that exercised any influence or were regarded with any respect in those days were never contented except when actively employed in military campaigns the excitements and the glory of war were the only excitements and glory that they understood or had the means of enjoying their dwellings were great fortresses built on the summits of the rocks which however picturesque and beautiful they appear as ruins now were very gloomy and desolate as residences then they were attractive enough when their inmates were flying to them for refuge from an enemy or were employed within the walls in concentrating their forces and brightening up their arms for some new expedition for vengeance or plunder but they were lonely and lifeless scenes of restlessness and discontent in times of quietness and peace  it is difficult for us at this day to conceive how destitute of all the ordinary means of comfort and enjoyment in comparison with a modern dwelling the ancient feudal castles must have been they were placed in situations as nearly inaccessible as possible and the natural impediments of approach were increased by walls and gates and ditches and drawbridges the door of access was often a window in the wall ten or fifteen feet from the ground to which the inmates or their friends mounted by a ladder the floors were of stone the walls were naked the ceiling was a rudelyconstructed series of arches the apartments too were ordinarily small and were arranged one above another in the successive stories of a tower nor could these celllike chambers be enlivened by the wide and cheerful windows of modern times which not only admit the light to animate the scene within but also afford to the spectator there widespread and sometimes enchanting views of the surrounding country the castle windows of ancient days were on the contrary narrow loopholes each at the bottom of a deep recess in the thick wall if they had been made wide they would have admitted too easily the arrows and javelins of besiegers as well as the wind and rain of wintery storms there were no books in these desolate dwellings no furniture but armor no pleasures but drinking and carousals  nor could these noble and valiant knights and barons occupy themselves in any useful employment there was nothing which it was respectable for them to do but to fight they looked down with contempt upon all the industrial pursuits of life the cultivation of farms the rearing of flocks and herds arts manufactures and commerceevery thing of this sort by which man can benefit his fellowman was entirely beneath them in fact their descendants to the present day even in england entertain the same ideas their younger sons can enter the army or the navy and spend their lives in killing and destroying or in awaiting in idleness dissipation and vice for orders to kill and destroy without dishonor but to engage in any way in those vast and magnificent operations of peaceful industry on which the true greatness and glory of england depend would be perpetual and irretrievable disgrace a young nobleman can serve in the most subordinate official capacity on board a manofwar and take pay for it without degradation but to build a manofwar itself and take pay for it would be to compel his whole class to disown him  it was in consequence of this state of feeling among the knights and barons of williams day that peace was always tedious and irksome to them and they were never contented except when engaged in battles and campaigns it was this feeling probably quite as much as any settled hostility to williams right to reign that made his barons so eager to engage in insurrections and rebellions there was however after all a real and deepseated opposition to williams right of succession founded in the ideas of the day they could not well endure that one of so humble and even ignominious birth on the mothers side should be the heir of so illustrious a line as the great dukes of normandy williams enemies were accustomed to designate him by opprobrious epithets derived from the circumstances of his birth though he was patient and enduring and often very generous in forgiving other injuries these insults to the memory of his mother always stung him very deeply and awakened the strongest emotions of resentment one instance of this was so conspicuous that it is recorded in almost all the histories of william that have been written  it was in the midst of one of the wars in which he was involved that he was advancing across the country to the attack of a strong castle which in addition to the natural strength of its walls and fortifications was defended by a numerous and powerful garrison so confident in fact were the garrison in their numbers and power that when they heard that william was advancing to attack them they sent out a detachment to meet him this detachment however were not intending to give him open battle their plan was to lay in ambuscade and attack williams troops when they came to the spot and while they were unaware of the vicinity of an enemy and off their guard  william however they found was not off his guard he attacked the ambuscade with so much vigor as to put the whole force immediately to flight of course the fugitives directed their steps toward the castle william and his soldiers followed them in headlong pursuit the end was that the detachment from the garrison had scarcely time after making good their own entrance to raise the drawbridges and secure the gates so as to keep their pursuers from entering too they did however succeed in doing this and william establishing his troops about the castle opened his lines and commenced a regular siege  the garrison were very naturally vexed and irritated at the bad success of their intended stratagem to have the ambuscade not only fail of its object but to have also the men that formed it driven thus ignominiously in and so narrowly escaping also the danger of letting in the whole troop of their enemies after them was a great disgrace to retaliate upon william and to throw back upon him the feelings of mortification and chagrin which they felt themselves they mounted the walls and towers and shouted out all sorts of reproaches and insults finally when they found that they could not make mere words sufficiently stinging they went and procured skins and hides and aprons of leather and every thing else that they could find that was connected with the trade of a tanner and shook them at the troops of their assailants from the towers and walls with shouts of merriment and derision  william was desperately enraged at these insults he organized an assaulting party and by means of the great exertions which the exasperation of his men stimulated them to make he carried some of the outworks and took a number of prisoners these prisoners he cut to pieces and then caused their bloody and mangled limbs and members to be thrown by great slings over the castle walls  at one time during the period which is included within the limits of this chapter and in the course of one of those intervals of peace and quietness within his own dominions which william sometimes enjoyed the king of france became involved in a war with one of his own rebellious subjects and william went with an army of normans to render him aid king henry was at first highly gratified at this prompt and effectual succor but he soon afterward began to feel jealous of the universal popularity and renown which the young duke began soon to acquire william was at that time only about twentyfour years old but he took the direction of every thingmoved to and fro with the utmost celerityplanned the campaignsdirected the sieges and by his personal accomplishments and his bravery he won all hearts and was the subject of every bodys praises king henry found himself supplanted in some measure in the regard and honorable consideration of his subjects and he began to feel very envious and jealous of his rival  sometimes particular incidents would occur in which williams feats of prowess or dexterity would so excite the admiration of the army that he would be overwhelmed with acclamations and applause these were generally exploits of combat on the field or of escape from pursuers when outnumbered in which good fortune had often perhaps quite as much to do in securing the result as strength or courage but in those days a soldiers good luck was perhaps as much the subject of applause as his muscular force or his bravery and in fact it was as deservedly so for the strength of arm and the coolness or rather the ferocity of courage which make a good combatant in personal contests on a battlefield are qualities of brutes rather than of men we feel a species of respect for them in the lion or tiger but they deserve only execration when exercised in the wantonness of hatred and revenge by man against his brother man  one of the instances of williams extraordinary success was the following he was reconnoitering the enemy on one occasion accompanied only by four or five knights who acted as his attendants and bodyguard the party were at a distance from the camp of the enemy and supposed they were not observed they were observed however and immediately a party of twelve chosen horsemen was formed and ordered to ride out and surprise them this detachment concealed themselves in an ambuscade at a place where the reconnoitering party must pass and when the proper moment arrived they burst out suddenly upon them and summoned them to surrender twelve against six seemed to render both flight and resistance equally vain william however advanced immediately to the attack of the ambuscaders he poised his long lance and riding on with it at full speed he unhorsed and killed the foremost of them at a blow then just drawing back his weapon to gather strength for another blow he killed the second of his enemies in the same manner his followers were so much animated at this successful onset that they advanced very resolutely to the combat in the mean time the shouts carried the alarm to williams camp and a strong party set off to rescue william and his companions the others then turned to fly while william followed them so eagerly and closely that he and they who were with him overtook and disabled seven of them and made them prisoners the rest escaped william and his party then turned and began to proceed toward their own camp conveying their prisoners in their train  they were met by king henry himself at the head of a detachment of three hundred men who not knowing how much necessity there might be for efficient aid were hastening to the scene of action the sight of william coming home victorious and the tales told by his companions of the invincible strength and daring which he had displayed in the sudden danger awakened a universal enthusiasm and the plaudits and encomiums with which the whole camp resounded were doubtless as delicious and intoxicating to him as they were bitter to the king  it was by such deeds and by such personal and mental characteristics as these that william notwithstanding the untoward influences of his birth fought his way during the twenty years of which we have been speaking into general favor and established a universal renown he completely organized and arranged the internal affairs of his own kingdom and established himself firmly upon the ducal throne his mind had become mature his resources were well developed and his soul always ambitious and aspiring began to reach forward to the grasping of some grander objects of pursuit and to the entering upon some wider field of action than his duchy of normandy could afford during this interval however he was married and as the circumstances of his marriage were somewhat extraordinary we must make that event the subject of a separate chapter     chapter v  the marriage  ad 10451052  political importance of a royal marriagewilliams views in

letterbaldwins surprise   one of the most important points which an hereditary potentate has to attend to in completing his political arrangements is the question of his marriage until he has a family and an heir mens minds are unsettled in respect to the succession and the various rival candidates and claimants to the throne are perpetually plotting and intriguing to put themselves into a position to spring at once into his place if sickness or a battle or any sudden accident should take him away this evil was more formidable than usual in the case of william for the men who were prepared to claim his place when he was dead were all secretly or openly maintaining that their right to it was superior to his while he was living this gave a double intensity to the excitement with which the public was perpetually agitated in respect to the crown and kept the minds of the ambitious and the aspiring throughout williams dominions in a continual fever it was obvious that a great part of the cause of this restless looking for change and consequent planning to promote it would be removed if william had a son  it became therefore an important matter of state policy that the duke should be married in fact the barons and military chieftains who were friendly to him urged this measure upon him on account of the great effect which they perceived it would have in settling the minds of the people of the country and consolidating his power william accordingly began to look around for a wife it appeared however in the end that though policy was the main consideration which first led him to contemplate marriage love very probably exercised an important influence in determining his choice of the lady at all events the object of his choice was an object worthy of love she was one of the most beautiful and accomplished princesses in europe  she was the daughter of a great potentate who ruled over the country of flanders flanders lies upon the coast east of normandy beyond the frontiers of france and on the southern shore of the german ocean her fathers title was the earl of flanders he governed his dominions however like a sovereign and was at the head of a very effective military power his family too occupied a very high rank and enjoyed great consideration among the other princes and potentates of europe it had intermarried with the royal family of england so that matilda the daughter of the earl whom william was disposed to make his bride was found by the genealogists who took great interest in those days in tracing such connections to have descended in a direct line from the great english king alfred himself  this relationship by making matildas birth the more illustrious operated strongly in favor of the match as a great part of the motive which william had in view in his intended marriage was to aggrandize and strengthen his own position by the connection which he was about to form there was however another consanguinity in the case which had a contrary tendency matildas father had been connected with the norman as well as with the english line and matilda and william were in some remote sense cousins this circumstance led in the sequel as will presently be seen to serious difficulty and trouble  matilda was seven years younger than william she was brought up in her fathers court and famed far and wide for her beauty and accomplishments the accomplishments in which ladies of high rank sought to distinguish themselves in those days were two music and embroidery the embroidery of tapestry was the great attainment and in this art the young matilda acquired great skill the tapestry which was made in the middle ages was used to hang against the walls of some of the more ornamented rooms in royal palaces and castles to hide the naked surface of the stones of which the building was constructed the cloths thus suspended were at first plain afterward they began to be ornamented with embroidered borders or other decorations and at length ladies learned to employ their own leisure hours and beguile the tedium of the long confinement which many of them had to endure within their castles in embroidering various devices and designs on the hangings intended for their own chambers or to execute such work as presents for their friends matildas industry and skill in this kind of work were celebrated far and wide  the accomplishments which ladies take great pains to acquire in their early years are sometimes it is said laid almost entirely aside after their marriage not necessarily because they are then less desirous to please but sometimes from the abundance of domestic duty which allows them little time and sometimes from the pressure of their burdens of care or sorrow which leave them no heart for the occupations of amusement or gayety it seems not to have been so in matildas case however she resumed her needle often during the years of her wedded life and after william had accomplished his conquest of england she worked upon a long linen web with immense labor a series of designs illustrating the various events and incidents of his campaign and the work has been preserved to the present day  at least there is such a web now existing in the ancient town of bayeux in normandy which has been there from a period beyond the memory of men and which tradition says was worked by matilda it would seem however that if she did it at all she must have done it as solomon built the templewith a great deal of help for this famous piece of embroidery which has been celebrated among all the historians and scholars of the world for several hundred years by the name of the bayeux tapestry is over four hundred feet long and nearly two feet wide the wet is of linen while the embroidery is of woolen it was all obviously executed with the needle and was worked with infinite labor and care the woolen thread which was used was of various colors suited to represent the different objects in the design though these colors are of course now much tarnished and faded  the designs themselves are very simple and even rude evincing very little knowledge of the principles of modern art the specimens on the following page of engravings made from them will give some idea of the childish style of delineation which characterizes all matildas designs childish however as such a style of drawing would be considered now it seems to have been in matildas days very much praised and admired  illustration plowing from the bayeux tapestry  illustration sowing from the bayeux tapestry  we often have occasion to observe in watching the course of human affairs the frailty and transitoriness of things apparently most durable and strong in the case of this embroidery on the contrary we are struck with the durability and permanence of what would seem to be most frail and fleeting williams conquest of england took place in 1066 this piece of tapestry therefore if matilda really worked it is about eight hundred years old and when we consider how delicate slender and frail is the fibre of a linen thread and that the various elements of decay always busy in the work of corrupting and destroying the works of man have proved themselves powerful enough to waste away and crumble into ruin the proudest structures which he has ever attempted to rear we are amazed that these slender filaments have been able to resist their action so long the bayeux tapestry has lasted nearly a thousand years it will probably last for a thousand years to come so that the vast and resistless power which destroyed babylon and troy and is making visible progress in the work of destroying the pyramids is foiled by the durability of a piece of needlework executed by the frail and delicate fingers of a woman  we may have occasion to advert to the bayeux tapestry again when we come to narrate the exploits which it was the particular object of this historical embroidery to illustrate and adorn in the mean time we return to our story  the matrimonial negotiations of princes and princesses are always conducted in a formal and ceremonious manner and through the intervention of legates embassadors and commissioners without number who are of course interested in protracting the proceedings so as to prolong as much as possible their own diplomatic importance and power besides these accidental and temporary difficulties it soon appeared that there were in this case some real and very formidable obstacles which threatened for a time entirely to frustrate the scheme  among these difficulties there was one which was not usually in such cases considered of much importance but which in this instance seemed for a long time to put an effectual bar to williams wishes and that was the aversion which the young princess herself felt for the match she could have one would suppose no personal feeling of repugnance against william for he was a tall and handsome cavalier highly graceful and accomplished and renowned for his bravery and success in war he was in every respect such a personage as would be most likely to captivate the imagination of a maiden princess in those warlike times matilda however made objections to his birth she could not consider him as the legitimate descendant and heir of the dukes of normandy it is true he was then in possession of the throne but he was regarded by a large portion of the most powerful chieftains in his realm as a usurper he was liable at any time on some sudden change of fortune to be expelled from his dominions his position in a word though for the time being very exalted was too precarious and unstable and his personal claims to high social rank were too equivocal to justify her trusting her destiny in his hands in a word matildas answer to williams proposals was an absolute refusal to become his wife  these ostensible grounds however on which matilda based her refusal plausible as they were were not the real and true ones the secret motive was another attachment which she had formed there had been sent to her fathers court in flanders from the english king a young saxon embassador whose name was brihtric brihtric remained some little time at the court in flanders and matilda who saw him often at the various entertainments celebrations and parties of pleasure which were arranged for his amusement conceived a strong attachment to him he was of a very fair complexion and his features were expressive and beautiful he was a noble of high position in england though of course his rank was inferior to that of matilda as it would have been deemed hardly proper for him under the circumstances of the case to have aspired to the princesss hand on account of the superiority of her social position matilda felt that it was her duty to make known her sentiments to him and thus to open the way she did so but she found unhappy maiden that brihtric did not feel himself the love which he had inspired in her and all the efforts and arts to which she was impelled by the instinct of affection proved wholly unavailing to call it forth brihtric after fulfilling the object of his mission took leave of matilda coldly while her heart was almost breaking and went away  as the sweetest wine transforms itself into the sharpest vinegar so the warmest and most ardent love turns when it turns at all to the most bitter and envenomed hate love gave place soon in matildas heart to indignation and indignation to a burning thirst for revenge the intensity of the first excitement subsided but matilda never forgot and never forgave the disappointment and the indignity which she had endured she had an opportunity long afterward to take terrible revenge on brihtric in england by subjecting him to cruelties and hardships there which brought him to his grave  in the mean time while her thoughts were so occupied with this attachment she had of course no heart to listen favorably to williams proposals her friends would have attached no importance to the real cause of her aversion to the match but they felt the force of the objections which could justly be advanced against williams rank and his real right to his throne then the consanguinity of the parties was a great source of embarrassment and trouble persons as nearly related to each other as they were were forbidden by the roman catholic rules to marry there was such a thing as getting a dispensation from the pope by which the marriage would be authorized william accordingly sent embassadors to rome to negotiate this business this of course opened a new field for difficulties and delays  the papal authorities were accustomed in such cases to exact as the price or rather as the condition of their dispensation some grant or beneficial conveyance from the parties interested to the church such as the foundation of an abbey or a monastery the building of a chapel or the endowment of a charity by way as it were of making amends to the church by the benefit thus received for whatever injury the cause of religion and morality might sustain by the relaxation of a divine law of course this being the end in view the tendency on the part of the authorities at rome would be to protract the negotiations so as to obtain from the suitors impatience better terms in the end the embassadors and commissioners too on williams part would have no strong motive for hastening the proceedings rome was an agreeable place of residence and to live there as the embassador of a royal duke of normandy was to enjoy a high degree of consideration and to be surrounded continually by scenes of magnificence and splendor then again william himself was not always at leisure to urge the business forward by giving it his own close attention for during the period while these negotiations were pending he was occupied from time to time with foreign wars or in the suppression of rebellions among his barons thus from one cause and another it seemed as if the business would never come to an end  in fact a less resolute and determined man than william would have given up in despair for it was seven years it is said before the affair was brought to a conclusion one story is told of the impetuous energy which william manifested in this suit which seems almost incredible  it was after the negotiations had been protracted for several years and at a time when the difficulties were principally those arising from matildas opposition that the occurrence took place it was at an interview which william had with matilda in the streets of bruges one of her fathers cities all that took place at the interview is not known but in the end of it williams resentment at matildas treatment of him lost all bounds he struck her or pushed her so violently as to throw her down upon the ground it is said that he struck her repeatedly and then leaving her with her clothes all soiled and disheveled rode off in a rage love quarrels are often the means of bringing the contending parties nearer together than they were before but such a terrible love quarrel as this we hope is very rare  violent as it was however it was followed by a perfect reconciliation and in the end all obstacles were removed and william and matilda were married the event took place in 1052  the marriage ceremony was performed at one of williams castles on the frontiers of normandy as it is customary for princes and kings to be married always in their own dominions matilda was conducted there with great pomp and parade by her parents and was accompanied by a large train of attendants and friends this company mountedboth knights and ladieson horses beautifully caparisoned moved across the country like a little army on a march or rather like a triumphal procession escorting a queen matilda was received at the castle with distinguished honor and the marriage celebrations and the entertainments accompanying it were continued for several days it was a scene of unusual festivity and rejoicing  the dress both of william and matilda on this occasion was very specially splendid she wore a mantle studded with the most costly jewels and in addition to the other splendors of his dress william too wore a mantle and a helmet both of which were richly adorned with the same costly decorations so much importance was attached in those days to this outward show and so great was the public interest taken in it that these dresses of william and matilda with all the jewelry that adorned them were deposited afterward in the great church at bayeux where they remained a sort of public spectacle the property of the church for nearly five hundred years  from the castle of augi where the marriage ceremonies were performed william proceeded after these first festivities and rejoicings were over to the great city of rouen conducting his bride thither with great pomp and parade here the young couple established themselves living in the enjoyment of every species of luxury and splendor which were attainable in those days as has already been said the interiors even of royal castles and palaces presented but few of the comforts and conveniences deemed essential to the happiness of a home in modern times the european ladies of the present day delight in their suites of retired and wellfurnished apartments adorned with velvet carpets and silken curtains and luxuriant beds of down with sofas and couches adapted to every fancy which the caprice of fatigue or restlessness may assume and cabinets stored with treasures and libraries of embellished booksthe whole scene illuminated by the splendor of gaslights whose brilliancy is reflected by mirrors and candelabras sparkling with a thousand hues matildas feudal palace presented no such scenes as these the cold stone floors were covered with mats of rushes the wallsif the naked masonry was hidden at allwere screened by hangings of coarse tapestry ornamented with uncouth and hideous figures the beds were miserable pallets the windows were loopholes and the castle itself had all the architectural characteristics of a prison  still there was a species of luxury and splendor even then matilda had splendid horses to ride all magnificently caparisoned she had dresses adorned most lavishly with gold and jewels there were troops of valiant knights all glittering in armor of steel to escort her on her journeys and accompany and wait upon her on her excursions of pleasure and there were grand banquets and carousals from time to time in the long castle hall with tournaments and races and games and other military shows conducted with great parade and pageantry matilda thus commenced her married life in luxury and splendor  in luxury and splendor but not in peace william had an uncle whose name was mauger he was the archbishop of rouen and was a dignitary of great influence and power now it was of course the interest of williams relatives that he should not be married as every increase of probability that his crown would descend to direct heirs diminished their future chances of the succession and of course undermined their present importance mauger had been very much opposed to this match and had exerted himself in every way while the negotiations were pending to impede and delay them the point which he most strenuously urged was the consanguinity of the parties a point to which it was incumbent on him as he maintainedbeing the head of the church in normandyparticularly to attend it seems that notwithstanding williams negotiations with the pope to obtain a dispensation the affair was not fully settled at rome before the marriage and very soon after the celebration of the nuptials mauger fulminated an edict of excommunication against both william and matilda for intermarrying within the degrees of relationship which the canons of the church proscribed  an excommunication in the middle ages was a terrible calamity the person thus condemned was made so far as such a sentence could effect it an outcast from man and a wretch accursed of heaven the most terrible denunciations were uttered against him and in the case of a prince like that of william his subjects were all absolved from their allegiance and forbidden to succor or defend him a powerful potentate like william could maintain himself for a time against the influence and effects of such a course but it was pretty sure to work more and more strongly against him through the superstitions of the people and to wear him out in the end  william resolved to appeal at once to the pope and to effect by some means or other the object of securing his dispensation there was a certain monk then obscure and unknown but who afterward became a very celebrated public character named lanfranc whom for some reason or other william supposed to possess the necessary qualifications for this mission he accordingly gave him his instructions and sent him away lanfranc proceeded to rome and there he managed the negotiation with the pope so dexterously as soon to bring it to a conclusion  the arrangement which he made was this the pope was to grant the dispensation and confirm the marriage thus removing the sentence of excommunication which the archbishop mauger had pronounced on condition that william should build and endow a hospital for a hundred poor persons and also erect two abbeys one to be built by himself for monks and one by matilda for nuns lanfranc agreed to these conditions on the part of william and matilda and they when they came to be informed of them accepted and confirmed them with great joy the ban of excommunication was removed all normandy acquiesced in the marriage and william and matilda proceeded to form the plans and to superintend the construction of the abbeys  they selected the city of caen for the site the place of this city will be seen marked upon the map near the northern coast of normandyg it was situated in a broad and pleasant valley at the confluence of two rivers and was surrounded by beautiful and fertile meadows it was strongly fortified being surrounded by walls and towers which williams ancestors the dukes of normandy had built william and matilda took a strong interest in the plans and constructions connected with the building of the abbeys williams was a very extensive edifice and contained within its inclosures a royal palace for himself where in subsequent years himself and matilda often resided  footnote g see map chapter ix  the principal buildings of these abbeys still stand though the walls and fortifications of caen are gone the buildings are used now for other purposes than those for which they were erected but they retain the names originally given them and are visited by great numbers of tourists being regarded with great interest as singular memorials of the pasttwin monuments commemorating an ancient marriage  the marriage being thus finally confirmed and acquiesced in william and matilda enjoyed a long period of domestic peace the oldest child was a son he was born within a year of the marriage and william named him robert that as the reader will recollect having been the name of williams father there was in process of time a large family of children their names were robert william rufus henry cecilia agatha constance adela adelaide and gundred matilda devoted herself with great maternal fidelity to the care and education of these children and many of them became subsequently historical personages of the highest distinction  the object which it will be recollected was one of williams main inducements for contracting this alliance namely the strengthening of his power by thus connecting himself with the reigning family of flanders was in a great measure accomplished the two governments leagued together by this natural tie strengthened each others power and often rendered each other essential assistance though there was one occasion subsequently when williams reliance on this aid was disappointed it was as follows  when he was planning his invasion of england he sent to matildas brother baldwin who was then count of flanders inviting him to raise a force and join him baldwin who considered the enterprise as dangerous and quixotic sent back word to inquire what share of the english territory william would give him if he would go and help him conquer it william thought that this attempt to make a bargain beforehand for a division of spoil evinced a very mercenary and distrustful spirit on the part of his brotherinlawa spirit which he was not at all disposed to encourage he accordingly took a sheet of parchment and writing nothing within he folded it in the form of a letter and wrote upon the outside the following rhyme       beau fr√®re en angleterre vous aures      ce qui dedans escript vous trouveres  which royal distich might be translated thus       your share good brother of the land we win      youll find entitled and described within  william forwarded the empty missive by the hand of a messenger who delivered it to baldwin as if it were a dispatch of great consequence baldwin received it eagerly and opened it at once he was surprised at finding nothing within and after turning the parchment every way in vain search after the description of his share he asked the messenger what it meant it means said he that as there is nothing writ within so nothing you shall have  notwithstanding this witticism however some arrangement seems afterward to have been made between the parties for flanders did in fact contribute an important share toward the force which william raised when preparing for the invasion     chapter vi  the lady emma  ad 10021052  williams claims to the english

counterplots   it is not to be supposed that even in the warlike times of which we are writing such a potentate as a duke of normandy would invade a country like england so large and powerful in comparison to his own without some pretext williams pretext was that he himself was the legitimate successor to the english crown and that the english king who possessed it at the time of his invasion was a usurper in order that the reader may understand the nature and origin of this his claim it is necessary to relate somewhat in full the story of the lady emma  by referring to the genealogy of the norman line of dukes contained in the second chapter of this volume it will be seen that emma was the daughter of the first richard she was celebrated in her early years for her great personal beauty they called her the pearl of normandy  she married at length one of the kings of england whose name was ethelred england was at that time distracted by civil wars waged between the two antagonist races of saxons and danes there were in fact two separate dynasties or lines of kings who were contending all the time for the mastery in these contests sometimes the danes would triumph for a time and sometimes the saxons and sometimes both races would have a royal representative in the field each claiming the throne and reigning over separate portions of the island thus there were at certain periods two kingdoms in england both covering the same territory and claiming the government of the same populationwith two kings two capitals two administrationswhile the wretched inhabitants were distracted and ruined by the terrible conflicts to which these hostile pretensions gave rise  ethelred was of the saxon line he was a widower at the time of his marriage to emma nearly forty years old and he had among other children by his former wife a son named edmund an active energetic young man who afterward became king one motive which he had in view in marrying emma was to strengthen his position by securing the alliance of the normans of normandy the danes his english enemies were normans the government of normandy would therefore be naturally inclined to take part with them by this marriage however ethelred hoped to detach the normans of france from the cause of his enemies and to unite them to his own he would thus gain a double advantage strengthening himself by an accession which weakened his foes  his plan succeeded so far as inducing richard himself the duke of normandy to espouse his cause but it did not enable ethelred to triumph over his enemies they on the contrary conquered him and in the end drove him from the country altogether he fled to normandy for refuge with emma his wife and his two young sons their names were edward and alfred  richard ii emmas brother who was then the duke of normandy received the unhappy fugitives with great kindness although he at least scarcely deserved it it was not surprising that he was driven from his native realm for he possessed none of those high qualities of mind which fit men to conquer or to govern like all other weakminded tyrants he substituted cruelty for wisdom and energy in his attempts to subjugate his foes as soon as he was married to emma for instance feeling elated and strong at the great accession of power which he imagined he had obtained by this alliance he planned a general massacre of the danes and executed it on a given day by means of private orders sent secretly throughout the kingdom vast numbers of the danes were destroyed and so great was the hatred of the two races for each other that they who had these bloody orders to obey executed them with a savage cruelty that was absolutely horrible in one instance they buried women to the waist and then set dogs upon them to tear their naked flesh until they died in agony it would be best in narrating history to suppress such horrid details as these were it not that in a land like this where so much depends upon the influence of every individual in determining whether the questions and discussions which are from time to time arising and are hereafter to arise shall be settled peacefully or by a resort to violence and civil war it is very important that we should all know what civil war is and to what horrible atrocities it inevitably leads  alfred the great when he was contending with the danes in england a century before this time treated them so far as he gained advantages over them with generosity and kindness and this policy wholly conquered them in the end ethelred on the other hand tried the effect of the most tyrannical cruelty and the effect was only to arouse his enemies to a more determined and desperate resistance it was the phrensy of vengeance and hate that these atrocities awakened every where among the danes which nerved them with so much vigor and strength that they finally expelled him from the island so that when he arrived in normandy a fugitive and an exile he came in the character of a dethroned tyrant execrated for his senseless and atrocious cruelties and not in that of an unhappy prince driven from his home by the pressure of unavoidable calamity nevertheless richard the duke of normandy received him as we have already said with kindness he felt the obligation of receiving the exiled monarch in a hospitable manner if not on his own account at least for the sake of emma and the children  the origin and end of emmas interest in ethelred seems to have been merely ambition the pearl of normandy had given herself to this monster for the sake apparently of the glory of being the english queen her subsequent conduct compels the readers of history to make this supposition which otherwise would be uncharitable she now mourned her disappointment in finding that instead of being sustained by her husband in the lofty position to which she aspired she was obliged to come back to her former home again to be once more dependent and with the additional burden of her husband himself and her children upon her fathers family her situation was rendered even still more humiliating in some degree by the circumstances that her father was no longer alive and that it was to her brother on whom her natural claim was far less strong that she had now to look for shelter and protection richard however received them all in a kind and generous manner  in the mean time the wars and commotions which had driven ethelred away continued to rage in england the saxons gradually gaining ground against the danes at length the king of the danes who had seized the government when ethelred was expelled died the saxons then regained their former power and they sent commissioners to ethelred to propose his return to england at the same time they expressed their unwillingness to receive him unless they could bind him by a solemn treaty to take a very different course of conduct in the future management of his government from that which he had pursued before ethelred and emma were eager to regain on any terms their lost throne they sent over embassadors empowered to make in ethelreds name any promises which the english nobles might demand and shortly afterward the royal pair crossed the channel and went to london and ethelred was acknowledged there by the saxon portion of the population of the island once more as king  the danes however though weakened were not yet disposed to submit they declared their allegiance to canute who was the successor in the danish line then followed a long war between canute and ethelred canute was a man of extraordinary sagacity and intelligence and also of great courage and energy ethelred on the other hand proved himself notwithstanding all his promises incurably inefficient cowardly and cruel in fact his son prince edmund the son of his first wife was far more efficient than his father in resisting canute and the danes edmund was active and fearless and he soon acquired very extensive power in fact he seems to have held the authority of his father in very little respect one striking instance of this insubordination occurred ethelred had taken offense for some reason or other at one of the nobles in his realm and had put him to death and confiscated his estates and in addition to this with a cruelty characteristic of him he shut up the unhappy widow of his victim a young and beautiful woman in a gloomy convent as a prisoner edmund his son went to the convent liberated the prisoner and made her his own wife  illustration the rescue  with such unfriendly relations between the king and his son who seems to have been the ablest general in his fathers army there could be little hope of making head against such an enemy as canute the dane in fact the course of public affairs went on from bad to worse emma leading all the time a life of unceasing anxiety and alarm at length in 1016 ethelred died and emmas cup of disappointment and humiliation was now full her own sons edward and alfred had no claims to the crown for edmund being the son by a former marriage was older than they they were too young to take personally an active part in the fierce contests of the day and thus fight their way to importance and power and then edmund who was now to become king would of course feel no interest in advancing them or doing honor to her a son who would thwart and counteract the plans and measures of a father as edmund had done would be little likely to evince much deference or regard for a motherinlaw or for half brothers whom he would naturally consider as his rivals in a word emma had reason to be alarmed at the situation of insignificance and danger in which she found herself suddenly placed she fled a second time in destitution and distress to her brothers in normandy she was now however a widow and her children were fatherless it is difficult to decide whether to consider her situation as better or worse on this account than it was at her former exile  her sons were lads but little advanced beyond the period of childhood and edward the eldest on whom the duty of making exertions to advance the family interests would first devolve was of a quiet and gentle spirit giving little promise that he would soon be disposed to enter vigorously upon military campaigns edmund on the other hand who was now king was in the prime of life and was a man of great spirit and energy there was a reasonable prospect that he would live many years and even if he were to be suddenly cut off there seemed to be no hope of the restoration of emma to importance or power for edmund was married and had two sons one of whom would be entitled to succeed him in case of his decease it seemed therefore to be emmas destiny now to spend the remainder of her days with her children in neglect and obscurity the case resulted differently however as we shall see in the end  edmund notwithstanding his prospect of a long and prosperous career was cut off suddenly after a stormy reign of one year during his reign canute the dane had been fast gaining ground in england notwithstanding the vigor and energy with which edmund had opposed him finally the two monarchs assembled their armies and were about to fight a great final battle edmund sent a flag of truce to canutes camp proposing that to save the effusion of blood they should agree to decide the case by single combat and that he and canute should be the champions and fight in presence of the armies canute declined this proposal he was himself small and slender in form while edmund was distinguished for his personal development and muscular strength canute therefore declined the personal contest but offered to leave the question to the decision of a council chosen from among the leading nobles on either side this plan was finally adopted the council convened and after long deliberations they framed a treaty by which the country was divided between the two potentates and a sort of peace was restored a very short period after this treaty was settled edmund was murdered  canute immediately laid claim to the whole realm he maintained that it was a part of the treaty that the partition of the kingdom was to continue only during their joint lives and that on the death of either the whole was to pass to the survivor of them the saxon leaders did not admit this but they were in no condition very strenuously to oppose it ethelreds sons by emma were too young to come forward as leaders yet and as to edmunds they were mere children there was therefore no one whom they could produce as an efficient representative of the saxon line and thus the saxons were compelled to submit to canutes pretensions at least for a time they would not wholly give up the claims of edmunds children but they consented to waive them for a season they gave canute the guardianship of the boys until they should become of age and allowed him in the mean time to reign himself over the whole land  canute exercised his power in a very discreet and judicious manner seeming intent in all his arrangements to protect the rights and interests of the saxons as well as of the danes it might be supposed that the lives of the young saxon princes edmunds sons would not have been safe in his hands but the policy which he immediately resolved to pursue was to conciliate the saxons and not to intimidate and coerce them he therefore did the young children no harm but sent them away out of the country to denmark that they might if possible be gradually forgotten perhaps he thought that if the necessity should arise for it they might there at any time be put secretly to death  there was another reason still to prevent canutes destroying these children which was that if they were removed the claims of the saxon line would not thereby be extinguished but would only be transferred to emmas children in normandy who being older were likely the sooner to be in a condition to give him trouble as rivals it was therefore a very wise and sagacious policy which prompted him to keep the young children of edmund alive but to remove them to a safe distance out of the way  in respect to emmas children canute conceived a different plan for guarding against any danger which came from their claims and that was to propose to take their mother for his wife by this plan her family would come into his power and then her own influence and that of her norman friends would be forever prevented from taking sides against him he accordingly made the proposal emma was ambitious enough of again returning to her former position of greatness as english queen to accept it eagerly the world condemned her for being so ready to marry for her second husband the deadly enemy and rival of the first but it was all one to her whether her husband was saxon or dane provided that she could be queen  the boys or rather the young men for they were now advancing to maturity were very strongly opposed to this connection they did all in their power to prevent its consummation and they never forgave their mother for thus basely betraying their interests they were the more incensed at this transaction because it was stipulated in the marriage articles between canute and emma that their future childrenthe offspring of the marriage then contractedshould succeed to the throne of england to the exclusion of all previously born on either side thus canute fancied that he had secured his title and that of his descendants to the crown forever and emma prepared to return to england as once more its queen the marriage was celebrated with great pomp and splendor and emma bidding normandy and her now alienated children farewell was conducted in state to the royal palace in london  we must now pass over with a very few words a long interval of twenty years it was the period of canutes reign which was prosperous and peaceful during this period emmas norman sons continued in normandy she had another son in england a few years after her marriage who was named canute after his father but he is generally known in history by the name of hardicanute the prefix being a saxon word denoting energetic or strong canute had also a very celebrated minister in his government named godwin godwin was a saxon of a very humble origin and the history of his life constitutes quite a romantic taleh he was a man of extraordinary talents and character and at the time of canutes death he was altogether the most powerful subject in the realm  footnote h it is given at length in the last chapter of our history of alfred the great  when canute found that he was about to die and began to consider what arrangements he should make for the succession he concluded that it would not be safe for him to fulfill the agreement made in his marriage contract with emma that the children of that marriage should inherit the kingdom for hardicanute who was entitled to succeed under that covenant was only about sixteen or seventeen years old and consequently too young to attempt to govern he therefore made a will in which he left the kingdom to an older son named harolda son whom he had had before his marriage with emma this was the signal for a new struggle the influence of the saxons and of emmas friends was of course in favor of hardicanute while the danes espoused the cause of harold godwin at length taking sides with this lastnamed party harold was established on the throne and emma and all her children whether descended from ethelred or canute were set aside and forgotten  emma was not at all disposed to acquiesce in this change of fortune she remained in england but was secretly incensed at her second husbands breach of faith toward her and as he had abandoned the child of his marriage with her for his former children she now determined to abandon him for hers she gave up hardicanutes cause therefore and began secretly to plot among the saxon population for bringing forward her son edward to the throne when she thought that things were ripe for the execution of the plot she wrote a letter to her children in normandy saying to them that the saxon population were weary of the danish line and were ready she believed to rise in behalf of the ancient saxon line if the true representative of it would appear to lead them she therefore invited them to come to london and consult with her on the subject she directed them however to come if they came at all in a quiet and peaceful manner and without any appearance of hostile intent inasmuch as any thing which might seem like a foreign invasion would awaken universal jealousy and alarm  when this letter was received by the brothers in normandy the eldest edward declined to go but gave his consent that alfred should undertake the expedition if he were disposed alfred accepted the proposal in fact the temperament and character of the two brothers were very different edward was sedate serious and timid alfred was ardent and aspiring the younger therefore decided to take the risk of crossing the channel while the elder preferred to remain at home  the result was very disastrous contrary to his mothers instructions alfred took with him quite a troop of norman soldiers he crossed the channel in safety and advanced across the country some distance toward london harold sent out a force to intercept him he was surrounded and he himself and all his followers were taken prisoners he was sentenced to lose his eyes and he died in a few days after the execution of this terrible sentence from the mingled effects of fever and of mental anguish and despair emma fled to flanders  finally harold died and hardicanute succeeded him in a short time hardicanute died leaving no heirs and now of course there was no one lefti to compete with emmas oldest son edward who had remained all this time quietly in normandy he was accordingly proclaimed king this was in 1041 he reigned for twenty years having commenced his reign about the time that william the conqueror was established in the possession of his dominions as duke of normandy edward had known william intimately during his long residence in normandy and william came to visit him in england in the course of his reign william in fact considered himself as edwards heir for as edward though married had no children the dukes of the norman line were his nearest relatives he obtained he said a promise from edward that edward would sanction and confirm his claim to the english crown in the event of his decease by bequeathing it to william in his will  footnote i the children of ethelreds oldest son edmund were in hungary at this time and seem to have been wellnigh forgotten  emma was now advanced in years the ambition which had been the ruling principle of her life would seem to have been well satisfied so far as it is possible to satisfy ambition for she had had two husbands and two sons all kings of england but as she advanced toward the close of her career she found herself wretched and miserable her son edward could not forgive her for her abandonment of himself and his brother to marry a man who was their own and their fathers bitterest enemy she had made a formal treaty in her marriage covenant to exclude them from the throne she had treated them with neglect during all the time of canutes reign while she was living with him in london in power and splendor edward accused her also of having connived at his brother alfreds death the story is that he caused her to be tried on this charge by the ordeal of fire this method consisted of laying redhot irons upon the stone floor of a church at certain distances from each other and requiring the accused to walk over them with naked feet if the accused was innocent providence as they supposed would so guide his footsteps that he should not touch the irons thus if he was innocent he would go over safely if guilty he would be burned emma according to the story of the times was subjected to this test in the cathedral of winchester to determine whether she was cognizant of the murder of her son whether this is true or not there is no doubt that edward confined her a prisoner in the monastery at winchester where she ended her days at last in neglect and wretchedness  when edward himself drew near to the close of his life his mind was greatly perplexed in respect to the succession there was one descendant of his brother edmundwhose children it will be remembered canute had sent away to denmark in order to remove them out of the waywho was still living in hungary the name of this descendant was edward he was in fact the lawful heir to the crown but he had spent his life in foreign countries and was now far away and in the mean time the earl godwin who has been already mentioned as the great saxon nobleman who rose from a very humble rank to the position of the most powerful subject in the realm obtained such an influence and wielded so great a power that he seemed at one time stronger than the king himself godwin at length died but his son harold who was as energetic and active as his father inherited his power and seemed as edward thought to be aspiring to the future possession of the throne edward had hated godwin and all his family and was now extremely anxious to prevent the possibility of harolds accession he accordingly sent to hungary to bring edward his nephew home edward came bringing his family with him he had a young son named edgar it was king edwards plan to make arrangements for bringing this prince edward to the throne after his death that harold might be excluded  the plan was a very judicious one but it was unfortunately frustrated by prince edwards death which event took place soon after he arrived in england the young edgar then a child was of course his heir the king was convinced that no government which could be organized in the name of edgar would be able to resist the mighty power of harold and he turned his thoughts therefore again to the accession of william of normandy who was the nearest relative on his mothers side as the only means of saving the realm from falling into the hands of the usurper harold a long and vexatious contest then ensued in which the leading powers and influences of the kingdom were divided and distracted by the plans plots maneuvers and counter maneuvers of harold to obtain the accession for himself and of edward to secure it for william of normandy in this contest harold conquered in the first instance and edward and william in

william   harold the son of the earl godwin who was maneuvering to gain possession of the english throne and william of normandy though they lived on opposite sides of the english channel the one in france and the other in england were still personally known to each other for not only had william as was stated in the last chapter paid a visit to england but harold himself on one occasion made an excursion to normandy the circumstances of this expedition were in some respects quite extraordinary and illustrate in a striking manner some of the peculiar ideas and customs of the times they were as follows  during the life of harolds father godwin there was a very serious quarrel between him that is godwin and king edward in which both the king and his rebellious subject marshaled their forces and for a time waged against each other an open and sanguinary war in this contest the power of godwin had proved so formidable and the military forces which he succeeded in marshaling under his banners were so great that edwards government was unable effectually to put him down at length after a long and terrible struggle which involved a large part of the country in the horrors of a civil war the belligerents made a treaty with each other which settled their quarrel by a sort of compromise godwin was to retain his high position and rank as a subject and to continue in the government of certain portions of the island which had long been under his jurisdiction he on his part promising to dismiss his armies and to make war upon the king no more he bound himself to the faithful performance of these covenants by giving the king hostages  the hostages given up on such occasions were always near and dear relatives and friends and the understanding was that if the party giving them failed in fulfilling his obligations the innocent and helpless hostages were to be entirely at the mercy of the other party into whose custody they had been given the latter would in such cases imprison them torture them or put them to death with a greater or less degree of severity in respect to the infliction of pain according to the degree of exasperation which the real or fancied injury which he had received awakened in his mind  this cruel method of binding fierce and unprincipled men to the performance of their promises has been universally abandoned in modern times though in the rude and early stages of civilization it has been practiced among all nations ancient and modern the hostages chosen were often of young and tender years and were always such as to render the separation which took place when they were torn from their friends most painful as it was the very object of the selection to obtain those who were most beloved they were delivered into the hands of those whom they had always regarded as their bitterest enemies and who of course were objects of aversion and terror they were sent away into places of confinement and seclusion and kept in the custody of strangers where they lived in perpetual fear that some new outbreak between the contending parties would occur and consign them to torture or death the cruelties sometimes inflicted in such cases on the innocent hostages were awful at one time during the contentions between ethelred and canute canute being driven across the country to the seacoast and there compelled to embark on board his ships to make his escape was cruel enough to cut off the hands and the feet of some hostages which ethelred had previously given him and leave them writhing in agony on the sands of the shore  the hostages which are particularly named by historians as given by godwin to king edward were his son and his grandson their names were ulnoth and hacune ulnoth of course was harolds brother and hacune his nephew edward thinking that godwin would contrive some means of getting these securities back into his possession again if he attempted to keep them in england decided to send them to normandy and to put them under the charge of william the duke for safe keeping when godwin died harold applied to edward to give up the hostages since as he alleged there was no longer any reason for detaining them they had been given as security for godwins good behavior and now godwin was no more  edward could not well refuse to surrender them and yet as harold succeeded to the power and evidently possessed all the ambition of his father it seemed to be politically as necessary to retain the hostages now as it had been before edward therefore without absolutely refusing to surrender them postponed and evaded compliance with harolds demand on the ground that the hostages were in normandy he was going he said to send for them as soon as he could make the necessary arrangements for bringing them home in safety  under these circumstances harold determined to go and bring them himself he proposed this plan to edward edward would not absolutely refuse his consent but he did all in his power to discourage such an expedition he told harold that william of normandy was a crafty and powerful man that by going into his dominions he would put himself entirely into his power and would be certain to involve himself in some serious difficulty this interview between harold and the king is commemorated on the bayeux tapestry by the opposite uncouth design  what effect edwards disapproval of the project produced upon harolds mind is not certainly known it is true that he went across the channel but the accounts of the crossing are confused and contradictory some of them stating that while sailing for pleasure with a party of attendants and companions on the coast he was blown off from the shore and driven across to france by a storm the probability however is that this story was only a pretense he was determined to go but not wishing to act openly in defiance of the kings wishes he contrived to be blown off in order to make it seem that he went against his will  illustration harolds interview with edward  at all events the storm was real whether his being compelled to leave the english shores by the power of it was real or pretended it carried him too out of his course driving him up the channel to the eastward of normandy where he had intended to land and at length throwing his galley a wreck on the shore not far from the mouth of the somme the galley itself was broken up but harold and his company escaped to land they found that they were in the dominions of a certain prince who held possessions on that coast whose style and title was guy count of ponthieu  the law in those days was that wrecks became the property of the lord of the territory on the shores of which they occurred and not only were the ships and the goods which they contained thus confiscated in case of such a disaster but the owners themselves became liable to be seized and held captive for a ransom harold knowing his danger was attempting to secrete himself on the coast till he could get to normandy when a fisherman who saw him and knew by his dress and appearance and by the deference with which he was treated by the rest of the company that he was a man of great consequence in his native land went to the count and said that for ten crowns he would show him where there was a man who would be worth a thousand to him the count came down with his retinue to the coast seized the unfortunate adventurers took possession of all the goods and baggage that the waves had spared and shut the men themselves up in his castle at abbeville till they could pay their ransom  harold remonstrated against this treatment he said that he was on his way to normandy on business of great importance with the duke from the king of england and that he could not be detained but the count was very decided in refusing to let him go without his ransom harold then sent word to william acquainting him with his situation and asking him to effect his release william sent to the count demanding that he should give his prisoner up all these things however only tended to elevate and enlarge the counts ideas of the value and importance of the prize which he had been so fortunate to secure he persisted in refusing to give him up without ransom finally william paid the ransom in the shape of a large sum of money and the cession in addition of a considerable territory harold and his companions in bondage were then delivered to williams messengers and conducted by them in safety to rouen where william was then residing  william received his distinguished guest with every possible mark of the most honorable consideration he was escorted with great parade and ceremony into the palace lodged in the most sumptuous manner provided with every necessary supply and games and military spectacles and feasts and entertainments without number were arranged to celebrate his visit william informed him that he was at liberty to return to england whenever he pleased and that his brother and his nephew the hostages that he had come to seek were at his disposal he however urged him not to return immediately but to remain a short time in normandy with his companions harold accepted the invitation  all this exuberance of hospitality had its origin as the reader will readily divine in the dukes joy in finding the only important rival likely to appear to contest his claims to the english crown so fully in his power and in the hope which he entertained of so managing affairs at this visit as to divert harolds mind from the idea of becoming the king of england himself and to induce him to pledge himself to act in his that is williams favor he took therefore all possible pains to make him enjoy his visit in normandy he exhibited to him the wealth and the resources of the countryconducting him from place to place to visit the castles the abbeys and the townsand finally he proposed that he should accompany him on a military expedition into brittany  harold pleased with the honors conferred upon him and with the novelty and magnificence of the scenes to which he was introduced entered heartily into all these plans and his companions and attendants were no less pleased than he william knighted many of these followers of harold and made them costly presents of horses and banners and suits of armor and other such gifts as were calculated to captivate the hearts of martial adventurers such as they william soon gained an entire ascendency over their minds and when he invited them to accompany him on his expedition into brittany they were all eager to go  brittany was west of normandy and on the frontiers of it so that the expedition was not a distant one nor was it long protracted it was in fact a sort of pleasure excursion william taking his guest across the frontier into his neighbors territory on a marauding party just as a nobleman in modern times would take a party into a forest to hunt william and harold were on the most intimate and friendly terms possible during the continuance of this campaign they occupied the same tent and ate at the same table harold evinced great military talents and much bravery in the various adventures which they met with in brittany and william felt more than ever the desirableness of securing his influence on his that is williams side or at least of preventing his becoming an open rival and enemy on their return from brittany into normandy he judged that the time had arrived for taking his measures he accordingly resolved to come to an open understanding with harold in respect to his plans and to seek his cooperation  he introduced the subject the historians say one day as they were riding along homeward from their excursion and had been for some time talking familiarly on the way relating tales to one another of wars battles sieges and hairbreadth escapes and other such adventures as formed generally the subjects of narrative conversation in those days at length william finding harold as he judged in a favorable mood for such a communication introduced the subject of the english realm and the approaching demise of the crown he told him confidentially that there had been an arrangement between him william and king edward for some time that edward was to adopt him as his successor william told harold moreover that he should rely a great deal on his cooperation and assistance in getting peaceable possession of the kingdom and promised to bestow upon him the very highest rewards and honors in return if he would give him his aid the only rival claimant william said was the young child edgar and he had no friends no party no military forces and no means whatever for maintaining his pretensions on the other hand he william and harold had obviously all the power in their own hands and if they could only cooperate together on a common understanding they would be sure to have the power and the honors of the english realm entirely at their disposal  harold listened to all these suggestions and pretended to be interested and pleased he was in reality interested but he was not pleased he wished to secure the kingdom for himself not merely to obtain a share however large of its power and its honors as the subject of another he was however too wary to evince his displeasure on the contrary he assented to the plan professed to enter into it with all his heart and expressed his readiness to commence immediately the necessary preliminary measures for carrying it into execution william was much gratified with the successful result of his negotiation and the two chieftains rode home to williams palace in normandy banded together apparently by very strong ties in secret however harold was resolving to effect his departure from normandy as soon as possible and to make immediate and most effectual measures for securing the kingdom of england to himself without any regard to the promises that he had made to william  nor must it be supposed that william himself placed any positive reliance on mere promises from harold he immediately began to form plans for binding him to the performance of his stipulations by the modes then commonly employed for securing the fulfillment of covenants made among princes these methods were threeintermarriages the giving of hostages and solemn oaths  william proposed two marriages as means of strengthening the alliance between himself and harold harold was to give to william one of his daughters that william might marry her to one of his norman chieftains this would be of course placing her in williams power and making her a hostage all but in name harold however consented the second marriage proposed was between williams daughter and harold himself but as his daughter was a child of only seven years of age it could only be a betrothment that could take place at that time harold acceded to this proposal too and arrangements were made for having the faith of the parties pledged to one another in the most solemn manner a great assembly of all the knights nobles and ladies of the court was convened and the ceremony of pledging the troth between the fierce warrior and the gentle and wondering child was performed with as much pomp and parade as if it had been an actual wedding the name of the girl was adela  in respect to hostages william determined to detain one of those whom harold as will be recollected had come into normandy to recover he told him therefore that he might take with him his nephew hacune but that ulnoth his brother should remain and william would bring him over himself when he came to take possession of the kingdom harold was extremely unwilling to leave his brother thus in williams power but as he knew very well that his being allowed to return to england himself would depend upon his not evincing any reluctance to giving william security or manifesting any other indication that he was not intending to keep his plighted faith he readily consented and it was thus settled that ulnoth should remain  finally in order to hold harold to the fulfillment of his promises by every possible form of obligation william proposed that he should take a public and solemn oath in the presence of a large assembly of all the great potentates and chieftains of the realm by which he should bind himself under the most awful sanctions to keep his word harold made no objection to this either he considered himself as in fact in duress and his actions as not free he was in williams power and was influenced in all he did by a desire to escape from normandy and once more recover his liberty he accordingly decided in his own mind that whatever oaths he might take he should afterward consider as forced upon him and consequently as null and void and was ready therefore to take any that william might propose  the great assembly was accordingly convened in the middle of the council hall there was placed a great chair of state which was covered with a cloth of gold upon this cloth and raised considerably above the seat was the missal that is the book of service of the catholic church written on parchment and splendidly illuminated the book was open at a passage from one of the evangeliststhe evangelists being a portion of the holy scriptures which was in those days supposed to invest an oath with the most solemn sanctions  harold felt some slight misgivings as he advanced in the midst of such an imposing scene as the great assembly of knights and ladies presented in the council hall to repeat his promises in the very presence of god and to imprecate the retributive curses of the almighty on the violation of them which he was deliberately and fully determined to incur he had however gone too far to retreat now he advanced therefore to the open missal laid his hand upon the book and repeating the words which william dictated to him from his throne he took the threefold oath required namely to aid william to the utmost of his power in his attempt to secure the succession to the english crown to marry williams daughter adela as soon as she should arrive at a suitable age and to send over forthwith from england his own daughter that she might be espoused to one of williams nobles  as soon as the oath was thus taken william caused the missal and the cloth of gold to be removed and there appeared beneath it on the chair of state a chest containing the sacred relics of the church which william had secretly collected from the abbeys and monasteries of his dominions and placed in this concealment that without harolds being conscious of it their dreadful sanction might be added to that which the holy evangelists imposed these relics were fragments of bones set in caskets and frames and portions of bloodrelics as the monks alleged of apostles or of the saviorand small pieces of wood similarly preserved which had been portions of the cross of christ or of his thorny crown these things were treasured up with great solemnity in the monastic establishments and in the churches of these early times and were regarded with a veneration and awe of which it is almost beyond our power even to conceive harold trembled when he saw what he had unwittingly done he was terrified to think how much more dreadful was the force of the imprecations that he had uttered than he had imagined while uttering them but it was too late to undo what he had done the assembly was finally dismissed william thought he had the conscience of his new ally firmly secured and harold began to prepare for leaving normandy  he continued on excellent terms with william until his departure william accompanied him to the seashore when the time of his embarkation arrived and dismissed him at last with many farewell honors and a profusion of presents harold set sail and crossing the channel in safety he landed in england  he commenced immediately an energetic system of measures to strengthen his own cause and prepare the way for his own accession he organized his party collected arms and munitions of war and did all that he could to ingratiate himself with the most powerful and wealthy nobles he sought the favor of the king too and endeavored to persuade him to discard william the king was now old and infirm and was growing more and more inert and gloomy as he advanced in age his mind was occupied altogether in ecclesiastical rites and observances or plunged in a torpid and lifeless melancholy which made him averse to giving any thought to the course which the affairs of his kingdom were to take after he was gone he did not care whether harold or william took the crown when he laid it aside provided they would allow him to die in peace  he had had a few years previous to this time a plan of making a pilgrimage to jerusalem but had finally made an arrangement with the pope allowing him to build a cathedral church to be dedicated to st peter a few miles west of london in lieu of his pilgrimage there was already a cathedral church or minster in the heart of london which was dedicated to st paul the new one was afterward often called to distinguish it from the other the west minster which designation westminster became afterward its regular name it was on this spot where westminster abbey now stands that edwards church was to be built it was just completed at the time of which we are speaking and the king was preparing for the dedication of it he summoned an assembly of all the prelates and great ecclesiastical dignitaries of the land to convene at london in order to dedicate the new cathedral before they were ready for the service the king was taken suddenly sick they placed him upon his couch in his palace chamber where he lay restless and moaning in pain and repeating incessantly half in sleep and half in delirium the gloomy and threatening texts of scripture which seemed to haunt his mind he was eager to have the dedication go on and they hastened the service in order to gratify him by having it performed before he died the next day he was obviously failing harold and his friends were very earnest to have the departing monarch declare in his favor before he died and their coming and going and their loud discussions rude soldiers as they were disturbed his dying hours he sent them word to choose whom they would for king duke or earl it was indifferent to him and thus expired  harold had made his arrangements so well and had managed so effectually to secure the influence of all the powerful nobles of the kingdom that they immediately convened and offered him the crown edgar was in the court of edward at the time but he was too young to make any effort to advance his claims he was in fact a foreigner though in the english royal line he had been brought up on the continent of europe and could not even speak the english tongue he acquiesced therefore without complaint in these proceedings and was even present as a consenting spectator on the occasion of harolds coronation which ceremony was performed with great pomp and parade at st pauls in london very soon after king edwards death harold rewarded edgar for his complaisance and discretion by conferring upon him the honor of knighthood immediately after the coronation and in the church where the ceremony was performed he also conferred similar distinctions and honors upon many other aspiring and ambitious men whom he wished to secure to his side he thus seemed to have secure and settled possession of the throne  previously to this time harold had married a young lady of england a sister of two very powerful noblemen and the richest heiress in the realm this marriage greatly strengthened his influence in england and helped to prepare the way for his accession to the supreme power the tidings of it however when they crossed the channel and reached the ears of william of normandy as the act was an open and deliberate violation of one of the covenants which harold had made with william convinced the latter that none of these covenants would be kept and prepared him to expect all that afterward followed     chapter viii  the preparations  ad 1066  harolds brother tostighe brings

who brought william the tidings of harolds accession to the throne was a man named tostig harolds brother though he was harolds brother he was still his bitterest enemy brothers are seldom friends in families where there is a crown to be contended for there were of course no public modes of communicating intelligence in those days and tostig had learned the facts of edwards death and harolds coronation through spies which he had stationed at certain points on the coast he was himself at that time on the continent he rode with all speed to rouen to communicate the news to william eager to incite him to commence hostilities against his brother  illustration william receiving tostigs tidings  when tostig arrived at rouen william was in a park which lay in the vicinity of the city trying a new bow that had been recently made for him william was a man of prodigious muscular strength and they gave him the credit of being able to use easily a bow which nobody else could bend a part of this credit was doubtless due to the etiquette which in royal palaces and grounds leads all sensible courtiers to take good care never to succeed in attempts to excel the king but notwithstanding this consideration there is no doubt that the duke really merited a great portion of the commendation that he received for his strength and dexterity in the use of the bow it was a weapon in which he took great interest a new one had been made for him of great elasticity and strength and he had gone out into his park with his officers to try its powers when tostig arrived tostig followed him to the place and there advancing to his side communicated the tidings to him privately  william was greatly moved by the intelligence his arrow dropped upon the ground he gave the bow to an attendant he stood for a time speechless tying and untying the cordon of his cloak in his abstraction presently he began slowly to move away from the place and to return toward the city his attendants followed him in silence wondering what the exciting tidings could be which had produced so sudden and powerful an effect  william went into the castle hall and walked to and fro a long time thoughtful and evidently agitated his attendants waited in silence afraid to speak to him rumors began at length to circulate among them in respect to the nature of the intelligence which had been received at length a great officer of state named fitzosborne arrived at the castle as he passed through the courtyard and gates the attendants and the people knowing that he possessed in a great degree the confidence of his sovereign asked him what the tidings were that had made such an impression i know nothing certain about it said he but i will soon learn so saying he advanced toward william and accosted him by saying why should you conceal from us your news it is reported in the city that the king of england is dead and that harold has violated his oaths to you and has seized the kingdom is that true  william acknowledged that that was the intelligence by which he had been so vexed and chagrined fitzosborne urged the duke not to allow such events to depress or dispirit him as for the death of edward said he that is an event past and sure and can not be recalled but harolds usurpation and treachery admits of a very easy remedy you have the right to the throne and you have the soldiers necessary to enforce that right undertake the enterprise boldly you will be sure to succeed  william revolved the subject in his mind for a few days during which the exasperation and anger which the first receipt of the intelligence had produced upon him was succeeded by calm but indignant deliberation in respect to the course which he should pursue he concluded to call a great council of state and to lay the case before themnot for the purpose of obtaining their advice but to call their attention to the crisis in a formal and solemn manner and to prepare them to act in concert in the subsequent measures to be pursued the result of the deliberations of this council guided doubtless by williams own designs was that the first step should be to send an embassy to harold to demand of him the fulfillment of his promises  the messenger was accordingly dispatched he proceeded to london and laid before harold the communication with which he had been intrusted this communication recounted the three promises which harold had made namely to send his daughter to normandy to be married to one of williams generals to marry williams daughter himself and to maintain williams claims to the english crown on the death of edward he was to remind harold also of the solemnity with which he had bound himself to fulfill these obligations by oaths taken in the presence of the most sacred relics of the church and in the most public and deliberate manner  harold replied  1 that as to sending over his daughter to be married to one of williams generals he could not do it for his daughter was dead he presumed he said that william did not wish him to send the corpse  2 in respect to marrying williams daughter to whom he had been affianced in normandy he was sorry to say that that was also out of his power as he could not take a foreign wife without the consent of his people which he was confident would never be given besides he was already married he said to a saxon lady of his own dominions  3 in regard to the kingdom it did not depend upon him he said to decide who should rule over england as edwards successor but upon the will of edward himself and upon the english people the english barons and nobles had decided with edwards concurrence that he harold was their legitimate and proper sovereign and that it was not for him to controvert their will however much he might be disposed to comply with williams wishes and to keep his promise it was plain that it was out of his power for in promising him the english crown he had promised what did not belong to him to give  4 as to his oaths he said that notwithstanding the secret presence of the sacred relics under the cloth of gold he considered them as of no binding force upon his conscience for he was constrained to take them as the only means of escaping from the duress in which he was virtually held in normandy promises and oaths even when extorted by necessity were null and void  the messenger returned to normandy with these replies and william immediately began to prepare for war  his first measure was to call a council of his most confidential friends and advisers and to lay the subject before them they cordially approved of the plan of an invasion of england and promised to cooperate in the accomplishment of it to the utmost of their power  the next step was to call a general council of all the chieftains and nobles of the land and also the notables as they were called or principal officers and municipal authorities of the towns the main point of interest for the consideration of this assembly was whether the country would submit to the necessary taxation for raising the necessary funds william had ample power as duke to decide upon the invasion and to undertake it he could also without much difficulty raise the necessary number of men for every baron in his realm was bound by the feudal conditions on which he held his land to furnish his quota of men for any military enterprise in which his sovereign might see fit to engage but for so distant and vast an undertaking as this william needed a much larger supply of funds than were usually required in the wars of those days for raising such large supplies the political institutions of the middle ages had not made any adequate provision governments then had no power of taxation like that so freely exercised in modern times and even now taxes in france and england take the form of grants from the people to the kings and as to the contrivance so exceedingly ingenious by which inexhaustible resources are opened to governments at the present daythat is the plan of borrowing the money and leaving posterity to pay or repudiate the debt as they please no minister of finance had in williams day been brilliant enough to discover it thus each ruler had to rely then mainly on the rents and income from his own lands and other private resources for the comparatively small amount of money that he needed in his brief campaigns but now william perceived that ships must be built and equipped and great stores of provisions accumulated and arms and munitions of war provided all which would require a considerable outlay and how was this money to be obtained  the general assembly which he convened were greatly distracted by the discussion of the question the quiet and peaceful citizens who inhabited the towns the artisans and tradesmen who wished for nothing but to be allowed to go on in their industrial pursuits in peace were opposed to the whole project they thought it unreasonable and absurd that they should be required to contribute from their earnings to enable their lord and master to go off on so distant and desperate an undertaking from which even if successful they could derive no benefit whatever many of the barons too were opposed to the scheme they thought it very likely to end in disaster and defeat and they denied that their feudal obligation to furnish men for their sovereigns wars was binding to the extent of requiring them to go out of the country and beyond the sea to prosecute his claims to the throne of another kingdom  others on the other hand among the members of williams assembly were strongly disposed to favor the plan they were more ardent or more courageous than the rest or perhaps their position and circumstances were such that they had more to hope from the success of the enterprise than they or less to fear from its failure thus there was great diversity of opinion and as the parliamentary system of rules by which a body of turbulent men in modern times are kept in some semblance of organization and order during a debate had not then been developed the meeting of these norman deliberators was for a time a scene of uproar and confusion the members gathered in groups each speaker getting around him as many as he could obtain to listen to his harangue the more quiet and passive portion of the assembly moving to and fro from group to group as they were attracted by the earnestness and eloquence of the different speakers or by their approval of the sentiments which they heard them expressing the scene in fact was like that presented in exciting times by a political caucus in america before it is called to order by the chairman  fitzosborne the confidential friend and counselor who has already been mentioned as the one who ventured to accost the duke at the time when the tidings of edwards death and of harolds accession first reached him now seeing that any thing like definite and harmonious action on the part of this tumultuous assembly was out of the question went to the duke and proposed to him to give up the assembly as such and make the best terms and arrangements that he could with the constituent elements of it individually and severally he would himself he said furnish forty ships manned equipped and provisioned and he recommended to the duke to call each of the others into his presence and ask them what they were individually willing to do the duke adopted this plan and it was wonderfully successful those who were first invited made large offers and their offers were immediately registered in form by the proper officers each one who followed was emulous of the example of those who had preceded him and desirous of evincing as much zeal and generosity as they then besides the duke received these vassals with so much condescension and urbanity and treated them with so much consideration and respect as greatly to flatter their vanity and raise them in their own estimation by exalting their ideas of the importance of the services which they could render in carrying so vast an enterprise to a successful result in a word the tide turned like a flood in favor of granting liberal supplies the nobles and knights promised freely men money ships arms provisionsevery thing in short that was required and when the work of receiving and registering the offers was completed and the officers summed up the aggregate amount william found to his extreme satisfaction that his wants were abundantly supplied  there was another very important point which william adopted immediate measures to secure and that was obtaining the popes approval of his intended expedition the moral influence of having the roman pontiff on his side would he knew be of incalculable advantage to him he sent an embassage accordingly to rome to lay the whole subject before his holiness and to pray that the pope would declare that he was justly entitled to the english crown and authorize him to proceed and take possession of it by force of arms lanfranc was the messenger whom he employedthe same lanfranc who had been so successful some years before in the negotiations at rome connected with the confirmation of william and matildas marriage  lanfranc was equally successful now the pope after examining williams claims pronounced them valid he decided that william was entitled to the rank and honors of king of england he caused a formal diploma to be made out to this effect the diploma was elegantly executed signed with the cross according to the pontifical custom and sealed with a round leaden sealj  footnote j the latin name for such a seal was bulla it is on account of this sort of seal which is customarily affixed to them that papal edicts have received the name of bulls  it was in fact very natural that the roman authorities should take a favorable view of williams enterprise and feel an interest in its success as it was undoubtedly for the interest of the church that william rather than harold should reign over england as the accession of william would bring the english realm far more fully under the influence of the roman church william had always been very submissive to the pontifical authority as was shown in his conduct in respect to the question of his marriage he himself and also matilda his wife had always taken a warm interest in the welfare and prosperity of the abbeys the monasteries the churches and the other religious establishments of the times then the very circumstance that he sent his embassador to rome to submit his claims to the pontiffs adjudication while harold did not do so indicated a greater deference for the authority of the church and made it probable that he would be a far more obedient and submissive son of the church in his manner of ruling his realm if he should succeed in gaining possession of it than harold his rival the pope and his counselors at rome thought it proper to take all these things into the account in deciding between william and harold as they honestly believed without doubt that it was their first and highest duty to exalt and aggrandize by every possible means the spiritual authority of the sacred institution over which they were called to preside  the pope and his cardinals accordingly espoused williams cause very warmly in addition to the diploma which gave william formal authority to take possession of the english crown the pope sent him a banner and a ring the banner was of costly and elegant workmanship its value however did not consist in its elegance or its cost but in a solemn benediction which his holiness pronounced over it by which it was rendered sacred and inviolable the banner thus blessed was forwarded to william by lanfranc with great care  it was accompanied by the ring the ring was of gold and it contained a diamond of great value the gold and the diamond both however served only as settings to preserve and honor something of far greater value than they this choice treasure was a hair from the head of the apostle peter a sacred relic of miraculous virtue and of inestimable value  when the edict with its leaden seal and the banner and the ring arrived in normandy they produced a great and universal excitement to have bestowed upon the enterprise thus emphatically the solemn sanction of the great spiritual head of the church to whom the great mass of the people looked up with an awe and a reverence almost divine was to seal indissolubly the rightfulness of the enterprise and to insure its success there was thenceforward no difficulty in procuring men or means every body was eager to share in the glory and to obtain the rewards of an enterprise thus commended by an authority duly commissioned to express in all such cases the judgment of heaven  finding that the current was thus fairly setting in his favor william sent proclamations into all the countries surrounding normandy inviting knights and soldiers and adventurers of every degree to join him in his projected enterprise these proclamations awakened universal attention great numbers of adventurous men determined to enter williams service horses arms and accoutrements were everywhere in great demand the invasion of england and the question of joining it were the universal topics of conversation the roads were covered with knights and soldiers some on horseback and alone others in bands large or small all proceeding to normandy to tender their services william received them all and made liberal promises to bestow rewards and honors upon them in england in the event of his success to some he offered pay in money to others booty to others office and power every one had his price even the priests and dignitaries of the church shared the general enthusiasm one of them furnished a ship and twenty armed men under an agreement to be appointed bishop of a certain valuable english diocese when william should be established on his throne  while all these movements were going on in the interior of the country all the seaports and towns along the coast of normandy presented a very busy scene of naval preparation naval architects were employed in great numbers in building and fitting out vessels some were constructed and furnished for the transportation of men others for conveying provisions and munitions of war and lighters and boats were built for ascending the rivers and for aiding in landing troops upon shelving shores smiths and armorers were occupied incessantly in manufacturing spears and swords and coats of mail while vast numbers of laboring men and beasts of burden were employed in conveying arms and materials to and from the manufactories to the ships and from one point of embarkation to another  as soon as william had put all these busy agencies thus in successful operation he considered that there was one more point which it was necessary for him to secure before finally embarking and that was the cooperation and aid of the french king whose name at this time was philip in his character of duke of normandy the king of france was his liege lord and he was bound to act in some degree under an acknowledgment of his superior authority in his new capacity that is as king of england or rather as heir to the english kingdom he was of course wholly independent of philip and consequently not bound by any feudal obligation to look to him at all he thought it most prudent however to attempt at least to conciliate philips favor and accordingly leaving his officers and his workmen to go on with the work of organizing his army and of building and equipping the fleet he set off himself on an expedition to the court of the french king he thought it safer to undertake this delicate mission himself rather than to intrust it to an embassador or deputy  he found philip at his palace of st germains which was situated at a short distance from paris the duke assumed in his interview with the king a very respectful and deferential air and manner philip was a very young man though haughty and vain william was very much his superior not only in age and experience but in talents and character and in personal renown still he approached the monarch with all the respectful observance due from a vassal to his sovereign made known his plans and asked for philips approbation and aid he was willing he said in case that aid was afforded him to hold his kingdom of england as he had done the duchy of normandy as a dependency of the french crown  philip seemed not at all disposed to look upon the project with favor he asked william who was going to take care of his duchy while he was running off after a kingdom william replied at first that that was a subject which he did not think his neighbors need concern themselves about then thinking on reflection that a more respectful answer would be more politic under the circumstances of the case he added that he was providentially blessed with a prudent wife and loving subjects and that he thought he might safely leave his domestic affairs in their hands until he should return philip still opposed the plan it was quixotic he said and dangerous he strongly advised william to abandon the scheme and be content with his present possessions such desperate schemes of ambition as those he was contemplating would only involve him in ruin  before absolutely deciding the case however philip called a council of his great nobles and officers of state and laid williams proposals before them the result of their deliberations was to confirm philip in his first decision they said that the rendering to william the aid which he desired would involve great expense and be attended with great danger and as to williams promises to hold england as a vassal of the king of france they had no faith in the performance of them it had been very difficult they said for many years for the kings of france to maintain any effectual authority over the dukes of normandy and when once master of so distant and powerful a realm as england all control over them would be sundered forever  philip then gave william his final answer in accordance with these counsels the answer was received on williams part with strong feelings of disappointment and displeasure philip conducted the duke to his retinue when the hour of departure arrived in order to soothe as far as possible his irritated feelings by dismissing him from his court with marks of his honorable consideration and regard william however was not in a mood to be pleased he told philip on taking leave of him that he was losing the most powerful vassal that any lord sovereign ever had by the course which he had decided to pursue i would have held the whole realm of england as a part of your dominions acknowledging you as sovereign over all if you had consented to render me your aid but i will not do it since you refuse i shall feel bound to repay only those who assist me  william returned to normandy where all the preparations for the expedition had been going on with great vigor during his absence and proceeded to make arrangements for the last great measure which it was necessary to take previous to his departure that was the regular constitution of a government to rule in normandy while he should be gone he determined to leave the supreme power in the hands of his wife matilda appointing at the same time a number of civil and military officers as a council of regency who were to assist her in her deliberations by giving her information and advice and to manage under her direction the different departments of the government her title was duchess regent and she was installed into her office in a public and solemn manner at a great assembly of the estates of the realm at the close of the ceremonies after william had given matilda his charge he closed his address by adding and do not let us fail to enjoy the benefit of your prayers and those of all the ladies of your court that the blessing of god may attend us and secure the success of our expedition  we are not necessarily to suppose as we might at first be strongly inclined to do that there was any special hypocrisy and pretense in williams thus professing to rely on the protection of heaven in the personal and political dangers which he was about to incur it is probable that he honestly believed that the inheritance of the english crown was his right and that being the case that a vigorous and manly effort to enforce his right was a solemn duty in the present age of the world now that there are so many countries in which intelligence industry and love of order are so extensively diffused that the mass of the community are capable of organizing and administering a government themselves republicans are apt to look upon hereditary sovereigns as despots ruling only for the purpose of promoting their own aggrandizement and the ends of an unholy and selfish ambition that there have been a great many such despots no one can deny but then on the other hand there have been many others who have acted in a greater or less degree under the influence of principles of duty in their political career they have honestly believed that the vast power with which in coming forward into life they have found themselves invested without in most cases any agency of their own was a trust imposed upon them by divine providence which could not innocently be laid aside that on them devolved the protection of the communities over which they ruled from external hostility and the preservation of peace and order within and the promotion of the general industry and welfare as an imperious and solemn duty and they have devoted their lives to the performance of this duty with the usual mixture it is true of ambition and selfishness but still after all with as much conscientiousness and honesty as the mass of men in the humbler walks of life evince in performing theirs william of normandy appears to have been one of this latter class and in obeying the dictates of his ambition in seeking to gain possession of the english crown he no doubt considered himself as fulfilling the obligations of duty too  however this may be he went on with his preparations in the most vigorous and prosperous manner the whole country were enthusiastic in the cause and their belief that the enterprise about to be undertaken had unquestionably secured the favor of heaven was confirmed by an extraordinary phenomenon which occurred just before the armament was ready to set sail a comet appeared in the sky which as close observers declared had a double tail it was universally agreed that this portended that england and normandy were about to be combined and to form a double kingdom which should exhibit to all mankind a wonderful spectacle of splendor     chapter ix  crossing the channel  ad 1066  the river divefinal assembling of the fleetmapbrilliant and magnificent

convey the expedition across the channel was the mouth of a small river called the dive which will be seen upon the following map flowing from the neighborhood of the castle of falaise northward into the sea the grand gathering took place in the beginning of the month of september in the year 1066 this date which marks the era of the norman conquest is one of the dates which students of history fix indelibly in the memory  illustration normandy  the gathering of the fleet in the estuary of the dive and the assembling of the troops on the beach along its shores formed a very grand and imposing spectacle the fleets of galleys ships boats and barges covering the surface of the waterthe long lines of tents under the cliffs on the landthe horsemen splendidly mounted and glittering with steelthe groups of soldiers all busily engaged in transporting provisions and stores to and fro or making the preliminary arrangements for the embarkationthe thousands of spectators who came and went incessantly and the duke himself gorgeously dressed and mounted on his warhorse with the guards and officers that attended himthese and the various other elements of martial parade and display usually witnessed on such occasions conspired to produce a very gay and brilliant as well as magnificent scene  of course the assembling of so large a force of men and of vessels and the various preparations for the embarkation consumed some time and when at length all was readywhich was early in septemberthe equinoctial gales came on and it was found impossible to leave the port there was in fact a continuance of heavy winds and seas and stormy skies for several weeks short intervals from time to time occurred when the clouds would break away and the sun appear but these intervals did not liberate the fleet from its confinement for they were not long enough in duration to allow the sea to go down the surf continued to come rolling and thundering in upon the shore and over the sandbars at the mouth of the river making destruction the almost inevitable destiny of any ship which should undertake to brave its fury the state of the skies gradually robbed the scene of the gay and brilliant colors which first it wore the vessels furled their sails and drew in their banners and rode at anchor presenting their heads doggedly to the storm the men on the shore sought shelter in their tents the spectators retired to their homes while the duke and his officers watched the scudding clouds in the sky day after day with great and increasing anxiety  in fact william had very serious cause for apprehension in respect to the effect which this longcontinued storm was to have on the success of his enterprise the delay was a very serious consideration in itself for the winter would soon be drawing near in one month more it would seem to be out of the question for such a vast armament to cross the channel at all then when men are embarking in such dark and hazardous undertakings as that in which william was now engaged their spirits and their energy rise and sink in great fluctuations under the influence of very slight and inadequate causes and nothing has greater influence over them at such times than the aspect of the skies william found that the ardor and enthusiasm of his army were fast disappearing under the effects of chilling winds and driving rain the feelings of discontent and depression which the frowning expression of the heavens awakened in their minds were deepened and spread by the influence of sympathy the men had nothing to do during the long and dreary hours of the day but to anticipate hardships and dangers and to entertain one another as they watched the clouds driving along the cliffs and the rolling of the surges in the offing with anticipations of shipwrecks battles and defeats and all the other gloomy forebodings which haunt the imagination of a discouraged and discontented soldier  nor were these ideas of wrecks and destruction wholly imaginary although the body of the fleet remained in the river where it was sheltered from the winds yet there were many cases of single ships that were from time to time exposed to them these were detached vessels coming in late to the rendezvous or small squadrons sent out to some neighboring port under some necessity connected with the preparations or strong galleys whose commanders more bold than the rest were willing in cases not of absolute necessity to brave the danger many of these vessels were wrecked the fragments of them with the bodies of the drowned mariners were driven to the shore the ghastly spectacles presented by these dead bodies swollen and mangled and half buried in the sand as if the sea had been endeavoring to hide the mischief it had done shocked and terrified the spectators who saw them william gave orders to have all these bodies gathered up and interred secretly as fast as they were found still exaggerated rumors of the number and magnitude of these disasters were circulated in the camp and the discontent and apprehensions grew every day more and more alarming  william resolved that he must put to sea at the very first possible opportunity the favorable occasion was not long wanting the wind changed the storm appeared to cease a breeze sprang up from the south which headed back the surges from the french shore william gave orders to embark the tents were struck the baggage of the soldiers was sent on board the transport vessels the men themselves crowded into great flatbottomed boats passed in masses to the ships from the shore the spectators reappeared and covered the cliffs and promontories near to witness the final scene the sails were hoisted and the vast armament moved out upon the sea  the appearance of a favorable change in the weather proved fallacious after all for the clouds and storm returned and after being driven in apprehension and danger about a hundred miles to the northeast along the coast the fleet was compelled to seek refuge again in a harbor the port which received them was st valery near dieppe the duke was greatly disappointed at being obliged thus again to take the land still the attempt to advance had not been a labor wholly lost for as the french coast here trends to the northward they had been gradually narrowing the channel as they proceeded and were in fact so far on the way toward the english shores then there were besides some reasons for touching here before the final departure to receive some last reenforcements and supplies william had also one more opportunity of communicating with his capital and with matilda  these delays disastrous as they seemed to be and ominous of evil were nevertheless attended with one good effect of which however william at the time was not aware they led harold in england to imagine that the enterprise was abandoned and so put him off his guard there were in those days as has already been remarked no regular and public modes of intercommunication by which intelligence of important movements and events was spread every where as now with promptness and certainty governments were obliged accordingly to rely for information in respect to what their enemies were doing on rumors or on the reports of spies rumors had gone to england in august that william was meditating an invasion and harold had made some extensive preparations to meet and oppose him but finding that he did not comethat week after week of september passed away and no signs of an enemy appeared and gaining no certain information of the causes of the delay he concluded that the enterprise was abandoned or else perhaps postponed to the ensuing spring accordingly as the winter was coming on he deemed it best to commence his preparations for sending his troops to their winter quarters he disbanded some of them and sent others away distributing them in various castles and fortified towns where they would be sheltered from the rigors of the season and saved from the exposure and hardships of the camp and yet at the same time remain within reach of a summons in case of any sudden emergency which might call for them they were soon summoned though not in the first instance to meet harold as will presently appear  while adopting these measures however which he thought the comfort and safety of his army required harold did not relax his vigilance in watching as well as he could the designs and movements of his enemy he kept his secret agents on the southern coast ordering them to observe closely every thing that transpired and to gather and send to him every item of intelligence which should find its way by any means across the channel of course william would do all in his power to intercept and cut off all communication and he was at this time very much aided in these efforts by the prevalence of the storms which made it almost impossible for the fishing and trading vessels of the coast to venture out to sea or attempt to cross the channel the agents of harold therefore on the southern coast of england found that they could obtain but very little information  at length the king unwilling to remain any longer so entirely in the dark resolved on sending some messengers across the sea into normandy itself to learn positively what the true state of the case might be messengers going thus secretly into the enemys territory or into the enemys camp become by so doing in martial law spies and incur if they are taken the penalty of death the undertaking therefore is extremely hazardous and as the death which is inflicted in cases of detection is an ignominious onespies being hung not shotmost men are very averse to encountering the danger still desperate characters are always to be found in camps and armies who are ready to undertake it on being promised very extraordinary pay  harolds spies contrived to make their way across the channel probably at some point far to the east of normandy where the passage is narrow they then came along the shore disguised as peasants of the country and they arrived at st valery while williams fleets were there here they began to make their observations scrutinizing every thing with close attention and care and yet studiously endeavoring to conceal their interest in what they saw notwithstanding all their vigilance however they were discovered proved to be spies and taken before william to receive their sentence  instead of condemning them to death which they undoubtedly supposed would be their inevitable fate william ordered them to be set at liberty go back said he to king harold and tell him he might have saved himself the expense of sending spies into normandy to learn what i am preparing for him he will soon know by other meansmuch sooner in fact than he imagines go and tell him from me that he may put himself if he pleases in the safest place he can find in all his dominions and if he does not find my hand upon him before the year is out he never need fear me again as long as he lives  nor was this expression of confidence in the success of the measures which he was taking a mere empty boast william knew the power of harold and he knew his own the enterprise in which he had embarked was not a rash adventure it was a cool deliberate wellconsidered plan it appeared doubtful and dangerous in the eyes of mankind for to mere superficial observers it seemed simply an aggressive war waged by a duke of normandy the ruler of a comparatively small and insignificant province against a king of england the monarch of one of the greatest and most powerful realms in the world william on the other hand regarded it as an effort on the part of the rightful heir to a throne to dispossess a usurper he felt confident of having the sympathy and cooperation of a great part of the community even in england the moment he could show them that he was able to maintain his rights and that he could show them that by a very decisive demonstration was evident visibly before him in the vast fleet which was riding at anchor in the harbor and in the long lines of tents filled with soldiery which covered the land  on one occasion when some of his officers were expressing apprehensions of harolds power and their fears in respect to their being able successfully to cope with it william replied that the more formidable harolds power should prove to be the better he should be pleased as the glory would be all the greater for them in having overcome it i have no objection said he that you should entertain exalted ideas of his strength though i wonder a little that you do not better appreciate our own i need be under no concern lest he at such a distance should learn too much by his spies about the force which i am bringing against him when you who are so near me seem to know so little about it but do not give yourselves any concern trust to the justice of your cause and to my foresight perform your parts like men and you will find that the result which i feel sure of and you hope for will certainly be attained  the storm at length entirely cleared away and the army and the fleet commenced their preparations for the final departure in the midst of this closing scene the attention of all the vast crowds assembled on board the ships and on the shores was one morning attracted by a beautiful ship which came sailing into the harbor it proved to be a large and splendid vessel which the duchess matilda had built at her own expense and was now bringing in to offer to her husband as her parting gift she was herself on board with her officers and attendants having come to witness her husbands departure and to bid him farewell her arrival of course under such circumstances produced universal excitement and enthusiasm the ships in harbor and the shores resounded with acclamations as the new arrival came gallantly in  matildas vessel was finely built and splendidly decorated the sails were of different colors which gave it a very gay appearance upon them were painted in various places the three lions which was the device of the norman ensign at the bows of the ship was an effigy or figurehead representing william and matildas second son shooting with a bow this was the accomplishment which of all others his father took most interest in seeing his little son acquire the arrow was drawn nearly to its head indicating great strength in the little arms which were guiding it and it was just ready to fly the name of this vessel was the mira william made it his flag ship he hoisted upon its mast head the consecrated banner which had been sent to him from rome and went on board accompanied by his officers and guards and with great ceremony and parade  at length the squadron was ready to put to sea at a given signal the sails were hoisted and the whole fleet began to move slowly out of the harbor there were four hundred ships of large size if we may believe the chronicles of the times and more than a thousand transports the decks of all these vessels were covered with men banners were streaming from every mast and spar and every salient point of the shore was crowded with spectators the sea was calm the air serene and the mighty cloud of canvas which whitened the surface of the water moved slowly on over the gentle swell of the waves forming a spectacle which as a picture merely for the eye was magnificent and grand and when regarded in connection with the vast results to the human race which were to flow from the success of the enterprise must have been considered sublime  the splendidly decorated ship which matilda had presented to her husband proved itself on trial to be something more than a mere toy it led the van at the commencement of course and as all eyes watched its progress it soon became evident that it was slowly gaining upon the rest of the squadron so as continually to increase its distance from those that were following it william pleased with the success of its performance ordered the sailing master to keep on without regard to those who were behind and thus it happened that when night came on the fleet was at very considerable distance in rear of the flag ship of course under these circumstances the fleet disappeared from sight when the sun went down but all expected that it would come into view again in the morning when the morning came however to the surprise and disappointment of every one on board the flag ship no signs of the fleet were to be seen the seamen and the officers on the deck gazed long and intently into the southern horizon as the increasing light of the morning brought it gradually into view but there was not a speck to break its smooth and even line  they felt anxious and uneasy but william seemed to experience no concern he ordered the sails to be furled and then sent a man to the mast head to look out there nothing was to be seen william still apparently unconcerned ordered breakfast to be prepared in a very sumptuous manner loading the tables with wine and other delicacies that the minds of all on board might be cheered by the exhilarating influence of a feast at length the lookout was sent to the mast head again what do you see now said william i see said the man gazing very intently all the while toward the south four very small specks just in the horizon the intense interest which this announcement awakened on the deck was soon at the same time heightened and relieved by the cry i can see more and morethey are the shipsyes the whole squadron is coming into view  the advancing fleet soon came up with the mira when the latter spread her sails again and all moved slowly on together toward the coast of england  the ships had directed their course so much to the eastward that when they made the land they were not very far from the straits of dover as they drew near to the english shore they watched very narrowly for the appearance of harolds cruisers which they naturally expected would have been stationed at various points to guard the coast but none were to be seen there had been such cruisers and there still were such off the other harbors but it happened very fortunately for william that those which had been stationed to guard this part of the island had been withdrawn a few days before on account of their provisions being exhausted thus when williams fleet arrived there was no enemy to oppose their landing there was a large and open bay called the bay of pevensey which lay smiling before them extending its arms as if inviting them in the fleet advanced to within the proper distance from the land and there the seamen cast their anchors and all began to prepare for the work of disembarkation  a strong body of soldiery is of course landed first on such occasions in this instance the archers williams favorite corps were selected to take the lead william accompanied them in his eagerness to get to the shore as he leaped from the boat his foot slipped and he fell the officers and men around him would have considered this an evil omen but he had presence of mind enough to extend his arms and grasp the ground pretending that his prostration was designed and saying at the same time thus i seize this land from this moment it is mine as he arose one of his officers ran to a neighboring hut which stood near by upon the shore and breaking off a little of the thatch carried it to william and putting it into his hand said that he thus gave him seizin of his new possessions this was a customary form in those times of putting a new owner into possession of lands which he had purchased or acquired in any other way the new proprietor would repair to the ground where the party whose province it was to deliver the property would detach something from it such as a piece of turf from a bank or a little of the thatch from a cottage and offering it to him would say thus i deliver thee seizin that is possession of this land this ceremony was necessary to complete the conveyance of the estate  the soldiers as soon as they were landed began immediately to form an encampment and to make such military arrangements as were necessary to guard against an attack or the sudden appearance of an enemy while this was going on the boats continued to pass to and fro accomplishing as fast as possible the work of disembarkation in addition to those regularly attached to the army there was a vast company of workmen of all kinds engineers pioneers carpenters masons and laborers to be landed and there were three towers or rather forts built of timber which had been framed and fashioned in normandy ready to be put up on arriving these had now to be landed piece by piece on the strand these forts were to be erected as soon as the army should have chosen a position for a permanent encampment and were intended as a means of protection for the provisions and stores the circumstance shows that the plan of transporting buildings ready made across the seas has not been invented anew by our emigrants to california  while these operations were going on william dispatched small squadrons of horse as reconnoitering parties to explore the country around to see if there were any indications that harold was near these parties returned one after another after having gone some miles into the country in all directions and reported that there were no signs of an enemy to be seen things were now getting settled too in the camp and william gave directions that the army should kindle their camp fires for the night and prepare and eat their suppers his own supper or dinner as perhaps it might be called was also served which he partook with his officers in his own tent his mind was in a state of great contentment and satisfaction at the successful accomplishment of the landing and at finding himself thus safely established at the head of a vast force within the realm of england  every circumstance of the transit had been favorable excepting one and that was that two of the ships belonging to the fleet were missing william inquired at supper if any tidings of them had been received they told him in reply that the missing vessels had been heard from they had in some way or other been run upon the rocks and lost there was a certain astrologer who had made a great parade before the expedition left normandy of predicting its result he had found by consulting the stars that william would be successful and would meet with no opposition from harold this astrologer had been on board one of the missing ships and was drowned william remarked on receiving this information what an idiot a man must be to think that he can predict by means of the stars the future fate of others when it is so plain that he can not foresee his own  it is said that williams dinner on this occasion was served on a large stone instead of a table the stone still remains on the spot and is called the conquerors stone to this day  the next day after the landing the army was put in motion and advanced along the coast toward the eastward there was no armed enemy to contend against them there or to oppose their march the people of the country through which the army moved far from attempting to resist them were filled with terror and dismay this terror was heightened in fact by some excesses of which some parties of the soldiers were guilty the inhabitants of the hamlets and villages overwhelmed with consternation at the sudden descent upon their shores of such a vast horde of wild and desperate foreigners fled in all directions some made their escape into the interior others taking with them the helpless members of their households and such valuables as they could carry sought refuge in monasteries and churches supposing that such sanctuaries as those not even soldiers unless they were pagans would dare to violate others still attempted to conceal themselves in thickets and fens till the vast throng which was sweeping onward like a tornado should have passed though william afterward always evinced a decided disposition to protect the peaceful inhabitants of the country from all aggressions on the part of his troops he had no time to attend to that subject now he was intent on pressing forward to a place of safety  william reached at length a position which seemed to him suitable for a permanent encampment it was an elevated land near the sea to the westward of it was a valley formed by a sort of recess opened in the range of chalky cliffs which here form the shore of england in the bottom of this valley down upon the beach was a small town then of no great consequence or power but whose name which was hastings has since been immortalized by the battle which was fought in its vicinity a few days after williams arrival the position which william selected for his encampment was on high land in the vicinity of the town the lines of the encampment were marked out and the forts or castles which had been brought from normandy were set up within the inclosures vast multitudes of laborers were soon at work throwing up embankments and building redoubts and bastions while others were transporting the arms the provisions and the munitions of war and storing them in security within the lines the encampment was soon completed and the long line of tents were set up in streets and squares within it by the time however that the work was done some of williams agents and spies came into camp from the north saying that in four days harold would be upon him at the head of a hundred thousand men     chapter x  the battle of hastings  ad 1066  tostighe is driven from englandexpedition of tostighe sails to norwaytostigs alliance with the norwegiansthe norwegian

hastingsdefeat of haroldhe is slainfinal subjugation of the islandwilliam crowned at westminsterwilliams powerhis greatness   the reader will doubtless recollect that the tidings which william first received of the accession of king harold were brought to him by tostig harolds brother on the day when he was trying his bow and arrows in the park at rouen tostig was his brothers most inveterate foe he had been during the reign of edward a great chieftain ruling over the north of england the city of york was then his capital he had been expelled from these his dominions and had quarreled with his brother harold in respect to his right to be restored to them in the course of this quarrel he was driven from the country altogether and went to the continent burning with rage and resentment against his brother and when he came to inform william of harolds usurpation his object was not merely to arouse william to actionhe wished to act himself he told william that he himself had more influence in england still than his brother and that if william would supply him with a small fleet and a moderate number of men he would make a descent upon the coast and show what he could do  william acceded to his proposal and furnished him with the force which he required and tostig set sail william had not apparently much confidence in the power of tostig to produce any great effect but his efforts he thought might cause some alarm in england and occasion sudden and fatiguing marches to the troops and thus distract and weaken king harolds forces william would not therefore accompany tostig himself but dismissing him with such force as he could readily raise on so sudden a call he remained himself in normandy and commenced in earnest his own grand preparations as is described in the last chapter  tostig did not think it prudent to attempt a landing on english shores until he had obtained some accession to the force which william had given him he accordingly passed through the straits of dover and then turning northward he sailed along the eastern shores of the german ocean in search of allies he came at length to norway he entered into negotiations there with the norwegian king whose name too was harold this northern harold was a wild and adventurous soldier and sailor a sort of sea king who had spent a considerable portion of his life in marauding excursions upon the seas he readily entered into tostigs views an arrangement was soon concluded and tostig set sail again to cross the german ocean toward the british shores while harold promised to collect and equip his own fleet as soon as possible and follow him all this took place early in september so that at the same time that williams threatened invasion was gathering strength and menacing harolds southern frontier a cloud equally dark and gloomy and quite as threatening in its aspect was rising and swelling in the north while king harold himself though full of vague uneasiness and alarm could gain no certain information in respect to either of these dangers  the norwegian fleet assembled at the port appointed for the rendezvous of it but as the season was advanced and the weather stormy the soldiers there like williams soldiers on the coast of france were afraid to put to sea some of them had dreams which they considered as bad omens and so much superstitious importance was attached to such ideas in those times that these dreams were gravely recorded by the writers of the ancient chronicles and have come down to us as part of the regular and sober history of the times one soldier dreamed that the expedition had sailed and landed on the english coast and that there the english army came out to meet them before the front of the army rode a woman of gigantic stature mounted on a wolf the wolf had in his jaws a human body dripping with blood which he was engaged in devouring as he came along the woman gave the wolf another victim after he had devoured the first  another of these ominous dreams was the following just as the fleet was about setting sail the dreamer saw a crowd of ravenous vultures and birds of prey come and alight every where upon the sails and rigging of the ships as if they were going to accompany the expedition upon the summit of a rock near the shore there sat the figure of a female with a stern and ferocious countenance and a drawn sword in her hand she was busy counting the ships pointing at them as she counted with her sword she seemed a sort of fiend of destruction and she called out to the birds to encourage them to go go said she without fear you shall have abundance of prey i am going too  it is obvious that these dreams might as easily have been interpreted to portend death and destruction to their english foes as to the dreamers themselves the soldiers were however inclinedin the state of mind which the season of the year the threatening aspect of the skies and the certain dangers of their distant expedition producedto apply the gloomy predictions which they imagined these dreams expressed to themselves their chief however was of too desperate and determined a character to pay any regard to such influences he set sail his armament crossed the german sea in safety and joined tostig on the coast of scotland the combined fleet moved slowly southward along the shore watching for an opportunity to land  illustration the norwegians at scarborough  they reached at length the town of scarborough and landed to attack it the inhabitants retired within the walls shut the gates and bid the invaders defiance the town was situated under a hill which rose in a steep acclivity upon one side the story is that the norwegians went upon this hill where they piled up an enormous heap of trunks and branches of trees with the interstices filled with stubble dried bark and roots and other such combustibles and then setting the whole mass on fire they rolled it down into the towna vast ball of fire roaring and crackling more and more by the fanning of its flames in the wind as it bounded along the intelligent reader will of course pause and hesitate in considering how far to credit such a story it is obviously impossible that any mere pile however closely packed could be made to roll but it is perhaps not absolutely impossible that trunks of trees might be framed together or fastened with wet thongs or iron chains after being made in the form of a rude cylinder or ball and filled with combustibles within so as to retain its integrity in such a descent  the account states that this strange method of bombardment was successful the town was set on fire the people surrendered tostig and the norwegians plundered it and then embarking again in their ships they continued their voyage  the intelligence of this descent upon his northern coasts reached harold in london toward the close of september just as he was withdrawing his forces from the southern frontier as was related in the last chapter under the idea that the norman invasion would probably be postponed until the spring so that instead of sending his troops into their winter quarters he had to concentrate them again with all dispatch and march at the head of them to the north to avert this new and unexpected danger  while king harold was thus advancing to meet them tostig and his norwegian allies entered the river humber their object was to reach the city of york which had been tostigs former capital and which was situated near the river ouse a branch of the humber they accordingly ascended the humber to the mouth of the ouse and thence up the latter river to a suitable point of debarkation not far from york here they landed and formed a great encampment from this encampment they advanced to the siege of the city the inhabitants made some resistance at first but finding that their cause was hopeless they offered to surrender and a treaty of surrender was finally concluded this negotiation was closed toward the evening of the day and tostig and his confederate forces were to be admitted on the morrow they therefore feeling that their prize was secure withdrew to their encampment for the night and left the city to its repose  it so happened that king harold arrived that very night coming to the rescue of the city he expected to have found an army of besiegers around the walls but instead of that there was nothing to intercept his progress up to the very gates of the city the inhabitants opened the gates to receive him and the whole detachment which was marching under his command passed in while tostig and his norwegian allies were sleeping quietly in their camp wholly unconscious of the great change which had thus taken place in the situation of their affairs  the next morning tostig drew out a large portion of the army and formed them in array for the purpose of advancing to take possession of the city although it was september and the weather had been cold and stormy it happened that on that morning the sun came out bright and the air was calm giving promise of a warm day and as the movement into the city was to be a peaceful onea procession as it were and not a hostile marchthe men were ordered to leave their coats of mail and all their heavy armor in camp that they might march the more unencumbered while they were advancing in this unconcerned and almost defenseless condition they saw before them on the road leading to the city a great cloud of dust arising it was a strong body of king harolds troops coming out to attack them at first tostig and the norwegians were completely lost and bewildered at the appearance of so unexpected a spectacle very soon they could see weapons glittering here and there and banners flying a cry of the enemy the enemy arose and passed along their ranks producing universal alarm tostig and the norwegian harold halted their men and marshaled them hastily in battle array the english harold did the same when he had drawn up near to the front of the enemy both parties then paused and stood surveying one another presently there was seen advancing from the english side a squadron of twenty horsemen splendidly armed and bearing a flag of truce they approached to within a short distance of the norwegian lines when a herald who was among them called out aloud for tostig tostig came forward in answer to the summons the herald then proclaimed to tostig that his brother did not wish to contend with him but desired on the contrary that they should live together in harmony he offered him peace therefore if he would lay down his arms and he promised to restore him his former possessions and honors  tostig seemed very much inclined to receive this proposition favorably he paused and hesitated at length he asked the messenger what terms king harold would make with his friend and ally the norwegian harold he shall have replied the messenger seven feet of english ground for a grave he shall have a little more than that for he is taller than common men then replied tostig tell my brother to prepare for battle it shall never be said that i abandoned and betrayed my ally and friend  the troop returned with tostigs answer to harolds lines and the battle almost immediately began of course the most eager and inveterate hostility of the english army would be directed against the norwegians and their king whom they considered as foreign intruders without any excuse or pretext for their aggression it accordingly happened that very soon after the commencement of the conflict harold the norwegian fell mortally wounded by an arrow in his throat the english king then made new proposals to tostig to cease the combat and come to some terms of accommodation but in the mean time tostig had become himself incensed and would listen to no overtures of peace he continued the combat until he was himself killed the remaining combatants in his army had now no longer any motive for resistance harold offered them a free passage to their ships that they might return home in peace if they would lay down their arms they accepted the offer retired on board their ships and set sail harold then having in the mean time heard of williams landing on the southern coast set out on his return to the southward to meet the more formidable enemy that menaced him there  his army though victorious was weakened by the fatigues of the march and by the losses suffered in the battle harold himself had been wounded though not so severely as to prevent his continuing to exercise the command he pressed on toward the south with great energy sending messages on every side into the surrounding country on his line of march calling upon the chieftains to arm themselves and their followers and to come on with all possible dispatch and join him he hoped to advance so rapidly to the southern coast as to surprise william before he should have fully intrenched himself in his camp and without his being aware of his enemys approach but william in order to guard effectually against surprise had sent out small reconnoitering parties of horsemen on all the roads leading northward that they might bring him in intelligence of the first approach of the enemy harolds advanced guard met these parties and saw them as they drove rapidly back to the camp to give the alarm thus the hope of surprising william was disappointed harold found too by his spies as he drew near to his utter dismay that williams forces were four times as numerous as his own it would of course be madness for him to think of attacking an enemy in his intrenchments with such an inferior force the only alternative left him was either to retreat or else to take some strong position and fortify himself there in the hope of being able to resist the invaders and arrest their advance though he was not strong enough to attack them  some of his counselors advised him not to hazard a battle at all but to fall back toward london carrying with him or destroying every thing which could afford sustenance to williams army from the whole breadth of the land this would soon they said reduce williams army to great distress for want of food since it would be impossible for him to transport supplies across the channel for so vast a multitude besides they said this plan would compel william in the extremity to which he would be reduced to make so many predatory excursions among the more distant villages and towns as would exasperate the inhabitants and induce them to join harolds army in great numbers to repel the invasion harold listened to these counsels but said after consideration that he could never adopt such a plan he could not be so derelict to his duty as to lay waste a country which he was under obligations to protect and save or compel his people to come to his aid by exposing them designedly to the excesses and cruelties of so ferocious an enemy  harold determined therefore on giving william battle it was not necessary however for him to attack the invader he perceived at once that if he should take a strong position and fortify himself in it william must necessarily attack him since a foreign army just landed in the country could not long remain inactive on the shore harold accordingly chose a position six or seven miles from williams camp and fortified himself strongly there of course neither army was in sight of the other or knew the numbers disposition or plans of the enemy the country between them was so far as the inhabitants were concerned a scene of consternation and terror no one knew at what point the two vast clouds of danger and destruction which were hovering near them would meet or over what regions the terrible storm which was to burst forth when the hour of that meeting should come would sweep in its destructive fury the inhabitants therefore were every where flying in dismay conveying away the aged and the helpless by any means which came most readily to hand taking with them too such treasures as they could carry and hiding in rude and uncertain places of concealment those which they were compelled to leave behind the region thus which lay between the two encampments was rapidly becoming a solitude and a desolation across which no communication was made and no tidings passed to give the armies at the encampments intelligence of each other  harold had two brothers among the officers of his army gurth and leofwin their conduct toward the king seems to have been of a more fraternal character than that of tostig who had acted the part of a rebel and an enemy gurth and leofwin on the contrary adhered to his cause and as the hour of danger and the great crisis which was to decide their fate drew nigh they kept close to his side and evinced a truly fraternal solicitude for his safety it was they specially who had recommended to harold to fall back on london and not risk his life and the fate of his kingdom on the uncertain event of a battle  as soon as harold had completed his encampment he expressed a desire to gurth to ride across the intermediate country and take a view of williams lines such an undertaking was less dangerous then than it would be at the present day for now such a reconnoitering party would be discovered from the enemys encampment at a great distance by means of spyglasses and a twentyfourpound shot or a shell would be sent from a battery to blow the party to pieces or drive them away the only danger then was of being pursued by a detachment of horsemen from the camp or surrounded by an ambuscade to guard against these dangers harold and gurth took the most powerful and fleetest horses in the camp and they called out a small but strong guard of wellselected men to escort them thus provided and attended they rode over to the enemys lines and advanced so near that from a small eminence to which they ascended they could survey the whole scene of williams encampment the palisades and embankments with which it was guarded which extended for miles the long lines of tents within the vast multitude of soldiers the knights and officers riding to and fro glittering with steel and the grand pavilion of the duke himself with the consecrated banner of the cross floating above it harold was very much impressed with the grandeur of the spectacle  after gazing on this scene for some time in silence harold said to gurth that perhaps after all the policy of falling back would have been the wisest for them to adopt rather than to risk a battle with so overwhelming a force as they saw before them he did not know he added but that it would be best for them to change their plan and adopt that policy now gurth said that it was too late they had taken their stand and now for them to break up their encampment and retire would be considered a retreat and not a maneuver and it would discourage and dishearten the whole realm  after surveying thus as long as they desired to do so the situation and extent of williams encampment harolds party returned to their own lines still determined to make a stand there against the invaders but feeling great doubt and despondency in respect to the result harold sent over too in the course of the day some spies the men whom he employed for this purpose were normans by birth and they could speak the french language there were many normans in england who had come over in king edwards time these norman spies could of course disguise themselves and mingle without attracting attention among the thousands of workmen and camp followers that were going and coming continually around the grounds which williams army occupied they did this so effectually that they penetrated within the encampment without difficulty examined every thing and in due time returned to harold with their report they gave a formidable account of the numbers and condition of williams troops there was a large corps of bowmen in the army which had adopted a fashion of being shaven and shorn in such a manner that the spies mistook them for priests they told harold accordingly on their return that there were more priests in williams camp than there were soldiers in all his army  during this eventful day william too sent a body of horsemen across the country which separated the two encampments though his emissaries were not spies but embassadors with propositions for peace william had no wish to fight a battle if what he considered as rightfully his kingdom could be delivered to him without it and he determined to make one final effort to obtain a peaceable surrender of it before coming to the dreadful resort of an appeal to arms he accordingly sent his embassy with three propositions to make to the english king the principal messenger in this company was a monk whose name was maigrot he rode with a proper escort and a flag of truce to harolds lines the propositions were these by accepting either of which the monk said that harold might avoid a battle 1 that harold should surrender the kingdom to william as he had solemnly sworn to do over the sacred relics in normandy 2 that they should both agree to refer the whole subject of controversy between them to the pope and abide by his decision 3 that they should settle the dispute by single combat the two claimants to the crown to fight a duel on the plain in presence of their respective armies  it is obvious that harold could not accept either of these propositions the first was to give up the whole point at issue as for the second the pope had already prejudged the case and if it were to be referred to him there could be no doubt that he would simply reaffirm his former decision and in respect to single combat the disadvantage on harolds part would be as great in such a contest as it would be in the proposed arbitration he was himself a man of comparatively slender form and of little bodily strength william on the other hand was distinguished for his size and for his extraordinary muscular energy in a modern combat with firearms these personal advantages would be of no avail but in those days when the weapons were battleaxes lances and swords they were almost decisive of the result harold therefore declined all williams propositions and the monk returned  william seems not to have been wholly discouraged by this failure of his first attempt at negotiation for he sent his embassage a second time to make one more proposal it was that if harold would consent to acknowledge william as king of england william would assign the whole territory to him and to his brother gurth to hold as provinces under williams general sway under this arrangement william would himself return to normandy making the city of rouen which was his capital there the capital of the whole united realm to this proposal harold replied that he could not on any terms give up his rights as sovereign of england he therefore declined this proposal also he however now made a proposition in his turn he was willing he said to compromise the dispute so far as it could be done by the payment of money if william would abandon his invasion and return to normandy giving up his claims to the english crown he would pay him he said any sum of money that he would name  william could not accept this proposal he was as he believed the true and rightful heir to the throne of england and there was a point of honor involved as well as a dictate of ambition to be obeyed in insisting on the claim in the mean time the day had passed while these fruitless negotiations had been pending night was coming on williams officers and counselors began to be uneasy at the delay they said that every hour new reenforcements were coming into harolds camp while they themselves were gaining no advantage and consequently the longer the battle was delayed the less was the certainty of victory so william promised them that he would attack king harold in his camp the very next morning  as the time for the great final struggle drew near harolds mind was oppressed more and more with a sense of anxiety and with foreboding fears his brothers too were ill at ease their solicitude was increased by the recollection of harolds oath and of the awful sanctions with which they feared the sacred relics might have invested it they were not sure that their brothers excuse for setting it aside would save him from the guilt and curse of perjury in the sight of heaven so they proposed on the eve of the battle that harold himself should retire and leave them to conduct the defense we can not deny they said that you did take the oath and notwithstanding the circumstances which seem to absolve you from the obligation it is best to avoid if possible the open violation of it it will be better on the whole for you to leave the army and go to london you can aid very effectually in the defense of the kingdom by raising reenforcements there we will stay and encounter the actual battle heaven can not be displeased with us for so doing for we shall be only discharging the duty incumbent on all of defending their native land from foreign invasion  harold would not consent to adopt this plan he could not retire himself he said at the hour of approaching danger and leave his brothers and his friends exposed when it was his crown for which they were contending  such were the circumstances of the two armies on the evening before the battle and of course in such a state of things the tendency of the minds of men would be in harolds camp to gloom and despondency and in williams to confidence and exultation harold undertook as men in his circumstances often do to lighten the load which weighed upon his own heart and oppressed the spirits of his men by feasting and wine he ordered a plentiful supper to be served and supplied his soldiers with abundance of drink and it is said that his whole camp exhibited during the whole night one widespread scene of carousing and revelry the troops being gathered every where in groups around their camp fires some half stupefied others quarreling and others still singing national songs and dancing with wild excitement according to the various effects produced upon different constitutions by the intoxicating influence of beer and wine  in williams camp there were witnessed very different scenes there were a great many monks and ecclesiastics in the train of his army and on the night before the battle they spent the time in saying masses reading litanies and prayers chanting anthems and in other similar acts of worship assisted by the soldiers who gathered in great congregations for this wild worship in the open spaces among the tents and around the camp fires at length they all retired to rest feeling an additional sense of safety in respect to the work of the morrow by having as they supposed entitled themselves by their piety to the protection of heaven  in the morning too in williams camp the first thing done was to convene the army for a grand celebration of mass it is a curious illustration of the mingling of the religious or perhaps we ought rather to say the superstitious sentiment of the times with the spirit of war that the bishop who officiated in this solemn service of the mass wore a coat of mail under his pontifical attire and an attendant stood by his side while he was offering his prayers with a steelpointed spear in his hand ready for the martial prelate to assume as soon as the service should be ended accordingly when the religious duty was performed the bishop threw off his surplice took his spear and mounting his white charger which was also all saddled and bridled beside him he headed a brigade of horse and rode on to the assault of the enemy  william himself mounted a very magnificent warhorse from spain a present which he had formerly received from one of his wealthy barons the name of the horse was bayard from williams neck were suspended some of the most sacred of the relics over which harold had taken his false oath he imagined that there would be some sort of charm in them to protect his life and to make the judgment of heaven more sure against the perjurer the standard which the pope had blessed was borne by his side by a young standard bearer who was very proud of the honor an older soldier however on whom the care of this standard officially devolved had asked to be excused from carrying it he wished he said to do his work that day with the sword while making these preliminary arrangements for going into battle william with the party around him stood upon a gentle eminence in the middle of the camp and in sight of the whole army every one was struck with admiration at the splendid figure which their commander madehis large and wellformed limbs covered with steel and his horse whose form was as noble as that of his master prancing restlessly as if impatient for the battle to begin  when all were ready the norman army advanced gayly and joyously to attack the english lines but the gayety and joyousness of the scene soon disappeared as corps after corps got fairly engaged in the awful work of the day for ten long hours there reigned over the whole field one widespread scene of havoc and deathevery soul among all those countless thousands delivered up to the supreme dominion of the most dreadful passions excited to a perfect phrensy of hatred rage and revenge and all either mercilessly killing others or dying themselves in agony and despair when night came the normans were every where victorious they were in full possession of the field and they rode triumphantly to and fro through harolds camp leaping their horses over the bodies of the dead and dying which covered the ground those of king harolds followers that had escaped the slaughter of the day fled in hopeless confusion toward the north where the flying masses strewed the roads for miles with the bodies of men who sank down on the way spent with wounds or exhausted by fatigue  in the morning william marshaled his men on the field and called over the names of the officers and men as they had been registered in normandy for the purpose of ascertaining who were killed while this melancholy ceremony was going on two monks came in sent from the remains of the english army and saying that king harold was missing and that it was rumored that he had been slain if so his body must be lying somewhere they said upon the field and they wished for permission to make search for it the permission was granted with the aid of some soldiers they began to explore the ground turning over and examining every lifeless form which by the dress or the armor might seem to be possibly the kings their search was for a long time vain the ghastly faces of the dead were so mutilated and changed that nobody could be identified at length however a woman who had been in harolds family and knew his person more intimately than they found and recognized the body and the monks and the soldiers carried it away                                       the battle of hastings sealed and settled the controversy in respect to the english crown it is true that the adherents of harold and also those of edgar atheling made afterward various efforts to rally their forces and recover the kingdom but in vain william advanced to london fortified himself there and made excursions from that city as a centre until he reduced the island to his sway he was crowned at length at westminster abbey with great pomp and parade he sent for matilda to come and join him and instated her in his palace as queen of england he confiscated the property of all the english nobles who had fought against him and divided it among the norman chieftains who had aided him in the invasion he made various excursions to and from normandy himself being received every where throughout his dominions on both sides the channel with the most distinguished honors in a word he became in the course of a few years after he landed one of the greatest and most powerful potentates on the globe how far all his riches and grandeur were from making him happy will appear in the following chapter     chapter xi  prince roberts rebellion

devote their time and attention through all the early years of life to their personal and political aggrandizement have little time to appropriate to the government and education of their children and their later years are often embittered by the dissipation and vice or by the unreasonable exactions of their sons at least it was so in williams case by the time that his public enemies were subdued and he found himself undisputed master both of his kingdom and his duchy his peace and happiness were destroyed and the tranquillity of his whole realm was disturbed by a terrible family quarrel  the name of his oldest son was robert he was fourteen years old when his father set off on his invasion of england at that time he was a sort of spoiled child having been his mothers favorite and as such always greatly indulged by her when william went away it will be recollected that he appointed matilda regent to govern normandy during his absence this boy was also named in the regency so that he was nominally associated with his mother and he considered himself doubtless as the more important personage of the two in a word while william was engaged in england prosecuting his conquests there robert was growing up in normandy a vain selfconceited and ungovernable young man  his father in going back and forth between england and normandy often came into conflict with his son as usual in such cases in these contests matilda took sides with the son williams second son whose name was william rufus was jealous of his older brother and was often provoked by the overbearing and imperious spirit which robert displayed william rufus thus naturally adhered to the fathers part in the family feud william rufus was as rough and turbulent in spirit as robert but he had not been so indulged he possessed therefore more selfcontrol he knew very well how to suppress his propensities and conceal the unfavorable aspects of his character when in the presence of his father  there was a third brother named henry he was of a more quiet and inoffensive character and avoided taking an active part in the quarrel except so far as william rufus led him on he was william rufuss friend and companion and as such robert considered him as his enemy all in fact except matilda were against robert who looked down in a haughty and domineering manneras the oldest son and heir is very apt to do in rich and powerful familiesupon the comparative insignificance of his younger brethren the king instead of restraining this imperious spirit in his son as he might perhaps have done by a considerate and kind and at the same time decisive exercise of authority teased and tormented him by sarcasms and petty vexations among other instances of this he gave him the nickname of short boots because he was of inferior stature as robert was however at this time of full age he was stung to the quick at having such a stigma attached to him by his father and his bosom burned with secret sentiments of resentment and revenge  he had besides other causes of complaint against his father more serious still when he was a very young child his father according to the custom of the times had espoused him to the daughter and heiress of a neighboring earl a child like himself her name was margaret the earldom which this little margaret was to inherit was maine it was on the frontiers of normandy and it was a rich and valuable possession it was a part of the stipulation of the marriage contract that the young brides domain was to be delivered to the father of the bridegroom to be held by him until the bridegroom should become of age and the marriage should be fully consummated in fact the getting possession of this rich inheritance with a prospect of holding it so many years was very probably the principal end which william had in view in contracting for a matrimonial union so very premature  if this was in reality williams plan it resulted in the end even more favorably than he had anticipated for the little heiress died a short time after her inheritance was put into the possession of her fatherinlaw there was nobody to demand a restoration of it and so william continued to hold it until his son the bridegroom became of age robert then demanded it contending that it was justly his william refused to surrender it he maintained that what had passed between his son in his infancy and the little margaret was not a marriage but only a betrothmenta contract for a future marriage which was to take place when the parties were of agethat since margarets death prevented the consummation of the union robert was never her husband and could not consequently acquire the rights of a husband the lands therefore ought manifestly he said to remain in the hands of her guardian and whatever rights any other persons might have claiming to succeed margaret as her natural heirs it was plain that his son could have no title whatever  however satisfactory this reasoning might be to the mind of william robert was only exasperated by it he looked upon the case as one of extreme injustice and oppression on the part of his father who not content he said with his own enormous possessions must add to them by robbing his own son in this opinion roberts mother matilda agreed with him as for william rufus and henry they paid little attention to the argument but were pleased with the result of it and highly enjoyed their brothers vexation and chagrin in not being able to get possession of his earldom  there was another very serious subject of dispute between robert and his father it has already been stated that when the duke set out on his expedition for the invasion of england he left matilda and robert together in charge of the duchy at the commencement of the period of his absence robert was very young and the actual power rested mainly in his mothers hands as he grew older however he began to exercise an increasing influence and control in fact as he was himself ambitious and aspiring and his mother indulgent the power passed very rapidly into his hands it was eight years from the time that william left normandy before his power was so far settled and established in england that he could again take the affairs of his original realm into his hands he had left robert at that time a mere boy of fourteen who though rude and turbulent in character was still politically powerless he found him on his return a man of twentytwo ruder and more turbulent than before and in the full possession of political power this power too he found him very unwilling to surrender  in fact when william came to receive back the province of normandy again robert almost refused to surrender it he said that his father had always promised him the duchy of normandy as his domain so soon as he should become of age and he claimed now the fulfillment of this promise besides he said that now that his father was king of england his former realm was of no consequence to him it did not add sensibly to his influence or his power and he might therefore without suffering any sensible loss himself grant it to his son william on his part did not acknowledge the force of either of these arguments he would not admit that he had ever promised normandy to his son and as to voluntarily relinquishing any part of his possessions he had no faith in the policy of a mans giving up his power or his property to his children until they were justly entitled to inherit it by his death at any rate he should not do it he had no idea as he expressed it of putting off his clothes before he was going to bed  the irritation and illwill which these dissensions produced grew deeper and more inveterate every day though the disagreement had been thus far a private and domestic dispute confined in its influence to the kings immediate household an occasion however now occurred on which the private family feud broke out into an open public quarrel the circumstances were these  king william had a castle in normandy at a place called laigle he was spending some time there in the year 1076 with his court and family one day william rufus and henry were in one of the upper apartments of the castle playing with dice and amusing themselves in company with other young men of the court in various ways there was a window in the apartment leading out upon a balcony from which one might look down upon the courtyard of the castle below robert was in this courtyard with some of his companions walking there in an irritated state of mind which had been produced by some previous disputes with his brothers william rufus looked down from the balcony and saw him and by way perhaps of quenching his anger poured some water down upon him the deed changed the suppressed and silent irritation in roberts heart to a perfect phrensy of rage and revenge he drew his sword and sprang to the staircase he uttered loud and terrible imprecations as he went declaring that he would kill the author of such an insult even if he was his brother the courtyard was of course immediately filled with shouts and exclamations of alarm and every body pressed forward toward the room from which the water had been thrown some to witness and some to prevent the affray  the king himself who happened to be in that part of the castle at the time was one of the number he reached the apartment just in time to interpose between his sons and prevent the commission of the awful crime of fratricide as it was he found it extremely difficult to part the ferocious combatants it required all his paternal authority and not a little actual force to arrest the affray he succeeded however at length with the help of the bystanders in parting his sons and robert out of breath and pale with impotent rage was led away  robert considered his father as taking sides against him in this quarrel and he declared that he could not and would not endure such treatment any longer he found some sympathy in the conversation of his mother to whom he went immediately with bitter complainings she tried to soothe and quiet his wounded spirit but he would not be pacified he spent the afternoon and evening in organizing a party of wild and desperate young men from among the nobles of the court with a view of raising a rebellion against his father and getting possession of normandy by force they kept their designs profoundly secret but prepared to leave laigle that night to go and seize rouen the capital which they hoped to surprise into a surrender accordingly in the middle of the night the desperate troop mounted their horses and rode away in the morning the king found that they were gone and he sent an armed force after them their plan of surprising rouen failed the kings detachment overtook them and after a sharp contest succeeded in capturing a few of the rebels though robert himself accompanied by some of the more desperate of his followers escaped over the frontier into a neighboring province where he sought refuge in the castle of one of his fathers enemies  this result as might have been expected filled the mind of matilda with anxiety and distress a civil war between her husband and her son was now inevitable and while every consideration of prudence and of duty required her to espouse the fathers cause her maternal love a principle stronger far in most cases than prudence and duty combined drew her irresistibly toward her son robert collected around him all the discontented and desperate spirits of the realm and for a long time continued to make his father infinite trouble matilda while she forbore to advocate his cause openly in the presence of the king kept up a secret communication with him she sent him information and advice from time to time and sometimes supplies and was thus technically guilty of a great crimethe crime of maintaining a treasonable correspondence with a rebel in a moral point of view however her conduct may have been entirely right at any rate its influence was very salutary for she did all in her power to restrain both the father and the son and by the influence which she thus exerted she doubtless mitigated very much the fierceness of the struggle  of course the advantage in such a civil war as this would be wholly on the side of the sovereign william had all the power and resources of the kingdom in his own handsthe army the towns the castles the treasures robert had a troop of wild desperate and unmanageable outlaws without authority without money without a sense of justice on their side he gradually became satisfied that the contest was vain in proportion as the activity of the hostilities diminished matilda became more and more open in her efforts to restrain it and to allay the animosity on either side she succeeded finally in inducing robert to lay down his arms and then brought about an interview between the parties in hopes of a peaceful settlement of the quarrel  it appeared very soon however at this interview that there was no hope of any thing like a real and cordial reconciliation though both the father and son had become weary of the unnatural war which they had waged against each other yet the ambitious and selfish desires on both sides in which the contest had originated remained unchanged robert began the conference by imperiously demanding of his father the fulfillment of his promise to give him the government of normandy his father replied by reproaching him with his unnatural and wicked rebellion and warned him of the danger he incurred in imitating the example of absalom of sharing that wretched rebels fate robert rejoined that he did not come to meet his father for the sake of hearing a sermon preached he had had enough of sermons he said when he was a boy studying grammar he wanted his father to do him justice not preach to him the king said that he should never divide his dominions while he lived with any one and added notwithstanding what robert had contemptuously said about sermons that the scripture declared that a house divided against itself could not stand he then proceeded to reproach and incriminate the prince in the severest manner for his disloyalty as a subject and his undutifulness and ingratitude as a son it was intolerable he said that a son should become the rival and bitterest enemy of his father when it was to him that he owed not merely all that he enjoyed but his very existence itself  these reproaches were probably uttered in an imperious and angry manner and with that spirit of denunciation which only irritates the accused and arouses his resentment instead of awakening feelings of penitence and contrition at any rate the thought of his filial ingratitude as his father presented it produced no relenting in roberts mind he abruptly terminated the interview and went out of his fathers presence in a rage  in spite of all his mothers exertions and entreaties he resolved to leave the country once more he said he would rather be an exile and wander homeless in foreign lands than to remain in his fathers court and be treated in so unjust and ignominious a manner by one who was bound by the strongest possible obligations to be his best and truest friend matilda could not induce him to change this determination and accordingly taking with him a few of the most desperate and dissolute of his companions he went northward crossed the frontier and sought refuge in flanders flanders it will be recollected was matildas native land her brother was the earl of flanders at this time the earl received young robert very cordially both for his sisters sake and also probably in some degree as a means of petty hostility against king william his powerful neighbor whose glory and good fortune he envied  robert had not the means or the resources necessary for renewing an open war with his father but his disposition to do this was as strong as ever and he began immediately to open secret communications and correspondence with all the nobles and barons in normandy whom he thought disposed to espouse his cause he succeeded in inducing them to make secret contributions of funds to supply his pecuniary wants of course promising to repay them with ample grants and rewards so soon as he should obtain his rights he maintained similar communications too with matilda though she kept them very profoundly secret from her husband  robert had other friends besides those whom he found thus furtively in normandy the king of france himself was much pleased at the breaking out of this terrible feud in the family of his neighbor who from being his dependent and vassal had become by his conquest of england his great competitor and rival in the estimation of mankind philip was disposed to rejoice at any occurrences which tended to tarnish williams glory or which threatened a division and diminution of his power he directed his agents therefore both in normandy and in flanders to encourage and promote the dissension by every means in their power he took great care not to commit himself by any open and positive promises of aid and yet still he contrived by a thousand indirect means to encourage robert to expect it thus the mischief was widened and extended while yet nothing effectual was done toward organizing an insurrection in fact robert had neither the means nor the mental capacity necessary for maturing and carrying into effect any actual plan of rebellion in the mean time months passed away and as nothing effectual was done roberts adherents in normandy became gradually discouraged they ceased their contributions and gradually forgot their absent and incompetent leader robert spent his time in dissipation and vice squandering in feasts and in the company of abandoned men and women the means which his followers sent him to enable him to prepare for the war and when at last these supplies failed him he would have been reduced gradually to great distress and destitution were it not that one faithful and devoted friend still adhered to him that friend was his mother  matilda knew very well that whatever she did for her absent son must be done in the most clandestine manner and this required much stratagem and contrivance on her part she was aided however in her efforts at concealment by her husbands absence he was now for a time in england having been called there by some pressing demands of public duty he left a great minister of state in charge of normandy whose vigilance matilda thought it would be comparatively easy to elude she sent to robert in flanders first her own private funds then she employed for this purpose a portion of such public funds as came into her hands the more she sent however the more frequent and imperious were roberts demands for fresh supplies the resources of a mother whether great or small are always soon exhausted by the insatiable requirements of a dissolute and profligate son when matildas money was gone she sold her jewels then her more expensive clothes and finally such objects of value belonging to herself or to her husband as could be most easily and privately disposed of the minister who was very faithful and watchful in the discharge of his duties observed indications that something mysterious was going on his suspicions were aroused he watched matildas movements and soon discovered the truth he sent information to william william could not believe it possible that his ministers surmises could be true for william was simply a statesman and a soldier and had very inadequate ideas of the absorbing and uncontrollable power which is exercised by the principle of maternal love  he however determined immediately to take most efficient measures to ascertain the truth he returned to normandy and there he succeeded in intercepting one of matildas messengers on his way to flanders with communications and money for robert the name of this messenger was sampson william seized the money and the letters and sent the messenger to one of his castles to be shut up in a dungeon then with the proofs of guilt which he had thus obtained he went full of astonishment and anger to find matilda and to upbraid her as he thought she deserved for her base and ungrateful betrayal of her husband  the reproaches which he addressed to her were bitter and stern though they seem to have been spoken in a tone of sorrow rather than of anger i am sure he said i have ever been to you a faithful and devoted husband i do not know what more you could have desired than i have done i have loved you with a sincere and true affection i have honored you i have placed you in the highest positions intrusting you repeatedly with large shares of my own sovereign power i have confided in youcommitting my most essential and vital interests to your charge and now this is the return you employ the very position and power and means which your confiding husband has put into your hands to betray him in the most cruel way and to aid and encourage his worst and most dangerous enemy  to these reproaches matilda attempted no reply except to plead the irresistible impetuosity and strength of her maternal love i could not bear she said to leave robert in distress and suffering while i had any possible means of relieving him he is my child i think of him all the time i love him more than my life i solemnly declare to you that if he were now dead and i could restore him to life by dying for him i would most gladly do it how then do you suppose that i could possibly live here in abundance and luxury while he was wandering homeless in destitution and want and not try to relieve him whether it is right or wrong for me to feel so i do not know but this i know i must feel so i can not help it he is our firstborn son i can not abandon him  william went away from the presence of matilda full of resentment and anger of course he could do nothing in respect to her but reproach her but he determined that the unlucky sampson should suffer severely for the crime he sent orders to the castle where he lay immured requiring that his eyes should be put out matilda however discovered the danger which threatened her messenger in time to send him warning he contrived to make his escape and fled to a certain monastery which was under matildas special patronage and charge a monastery was in those days a sanctuary into which the arm even of the most despotic authority scarcely dared to intrude in pursuit of its victim to make the safety doubly sure the abbot proposed that the trembling fugitive should join their order and become a monk sampson was willing to do any thing to save his life the operation of putting out the eyes was very generally fatal so that he considered his life at stake he was accordingly shaven and shorn and clothed in the monastic garb he assumed the vows of the order and entered with his brother monks upon the course of fastings penances and prayers which pertained to his new vocation and william left him to pursue it in peace  things went on worse instead of better after this discovery of the mothers participation in the councils of the son either through the aid which his mother had rendered or by other means there seemed to be a strong party in and out of normandy who were inclined to espouse roberts cause his friends at length raised a very considerable army and putting him at the head of it they advanced to attack rouen the king greatly alarmed at this danger collected all the forces that he could command and went to meet his rebel son william rufus accompanied his father intending to fight by his side while matilda in an agony of terror and distress remained half distracted within her castle wallsas a wife and mother might be expected to be on the approach of a murderous conflict between her husband and her son the thought that one of them might perhaps be actually killed by the other filled her with dismay  and in fact this dreadful result came very near being realized robert in the castle at laigle had barely been prevented from destroying his brother and now on the plain of archembraye where this battle was fought his father fell and was very near being killed by his hand in the midst of the fight while the horsemen were impetuously charging each other in various parts of the field all so disguised by their armor that no one could know the individual with whom he was contending robert encountered a large and powerful knight and drove his lance through his armor into his arm through the shock of the encounter and the faintness produced by the agony of the wound the horseman fell to the ground and robert perceived by the voice with which his fallen enemy cried out in his pain and terror that it was his father that he had thus pierced with his steel at the same moment the wounded father in looking at his victorious antagonist recognized his son he cursed his unnatural enemy with a bitter and terrible malediction robert was shocked and terrified at what he had done he leaped from his horse knelt down by the side of his father and called for aid the king distracted by the anguish of his wound and by the burning indignation and resentment which raged in his bosom against the unnatural hostility which inflicted it turned away from his son and refused to receive any succor from him  besides the misfortune of being unhorsed and wounded the battle itself went that day against the king roberts army remained masters of the field william rufus was wounded too as well as his father matilda was overwhelmed with distress and mental anguish at the result she could not endure the idea of allowing so unnatural and dreadful a struggle to go on she begged her husband with the most earnest importunities and with many tears to find some way of accommodating the dispute her nights were sleepless her days were spent in weeping and her health and strength were soon found to be wasting very rapidly away she was emaciated wan and pale and it was plain that such distress if long continued would soon bring her to the grave  matildas intercessions at length prevailed the king sent for his son and after various negotiations some sort of compromise was effected the armies were disbanded peace was restored and robert and his father once more seemed to be friends soon after this william having a campaign to make in the north of england took robert with him as one of the generals in his army     chapter xii  the conclusion  ad

at the intermentthe sarcophagus too smallthe body burstwilliam rufus obtains possession of the english throne   from the time of the battle of hastings which took place in 1066 to that of williams death which occurred in 1087 there intervened a period of about twenty years during which the great monarch reigned over his extended dominions with a very despotic sway though not without a large share of the usual dangers difficulties and struggles attending such a rule he brought over immense numbers of normans from normandy into england and placed all the military and civil power of the empire in their hands and he relied almost entirely upon the superiority of his physical force for keeping the country in subjugation to his sway it is true he maintained that he was the rightful heir to the english crown and that consequently the tenure by which he held it was the right of inheritance and not the right of conquest and he professed to believe that the people of england generally admitted his claim this was in fact to a considerable extent true at least there was probably a large part of the population who believed williams right to the crown superior to that of harold whom he had deposed still as william was by birth and education and language a foreigner and as all the friends and followers who attended him and in fact almost the whole of the army on which he mainly relied for the preservation of his power were foreigners toowearing a strange dress and speaking in an unknown tonguethe great mass of the english people could not but feel that they were under a species of foreign subjugation quarrels were therefore continually breaking out between them and their norman masters resulting in fierce and bloody struggles on their part to get free these rebellions were always effectually put down but when quelled in one quarter they soon broke out in another and they kept william and his forces almost always employed  but william was not a mere warrior he was well aware that the permanence and stability of his own and his successors sway in england would depend finally upon the kind of basis on which the civil institutions of the country should rest and on the proper consolidation and adjustment of the administrative and judicial functions of the realm in the intervals of his campaigns therefore william devoted a great deal of time and attention to this subject and he evinced a most profound and statesmanlike wisdom and sagacity in his manner of treating it  he had in fact a herculean task to performa double taskviz to amalgamate two nations and also to fuse and merge two languages into one he was absolutely compelled by the circumstances under which he was placed to grapple with both these vast undertakings if at the time when in his park at rouen he first heard of harolds accession he had supposed that there was a party in england in his favor strong enough to allow of his proceeding there alone or with a small norman attendance so that he might rely mainly on the english themselves for his accession to the throne the formidable difficulties which as it was he had subsequently to encounter would all have been saved but there was no such partyat least there was no evidence that there was one of sufficient strength to justify him in trusting himself to it it seemed to him then that if he undertook to gain possession of the english throne at all he must rely entirely on the force which he could take with him from normandy to make this reliance effectual the force so taken must be an overwhelming one then if normans in great numbers were to go to england for the purpose of putting him upon the english throne they must be rewarded and so vast a number of candidates for the prizes of honor and wealth could be satisfied only in england and by confiscations there his possessions in normandy would obviously be insufficient for such a purpose it was evident moreover that if a large number of norman adventurers were placed in stations of trust and honor and charged with civil offices and administrative functions all over england they would form a sort of class by themselves and would be looked upon with jealousy and envy by the original inhabitants and that there was no hope of maintaining them safely in their position except by making the class as numerous and as strong as possible in a word william saw very clearly that while it would have been very well if it had been possible for him to have brought no normans to england it was clearly best since so many must go to contrive every means to swell and increase the number it was one of those cases where being obliged to go far it is best to go farther and william resolved on thoroughly normanizing so to speak the whole british realm this enormous undertaking he accomplished fully and permanently and the institutions of england the lines of family descent the routine of judicial and administrative business and the very language of the realm retain the norman characteristics which he ingrafted into them to the present day  it gives us a feeling akin to that of sublimity to find even in our own land and in the most remote situations of it the lingering relics of the revolutions and deeds of these early ages still remaining like a faint ripple rolling gently upon a beach in a deep and secluded bay which was set in motion perhaps at first as one of the mountainous surges of a wintery storm in the most distant seas for example if we enter the most humble court in any remote and newlysettled country in the american forests a plain and rusticlooking man will call the equally rusticlooking assembly to order by rapping his baton the only symbol of his office on the floor and calling out in words mystic and meaningless to him o yes o yes o yesk he little thinks that he is obeying a behest of william the conqueror issued eight hundred years ago ordaining that his native tongue should be employed in the courts of england the irresistible progress of improvement and reform have gradually displaced the intruding language againexcept so far as it has become merged and incorporated with the common language of the countryfrom all the ordinary forms of legal proceedings it lingers still however as it were on the threshold in this call to order and as it is harmless there the spirit of conservatism will perhaps preserve for it this last place of refuge for a thousand years to come and o yes will be the phrase for ordaining silence by many generations of officers who will perhaps never have heard of the authority whose orders they unwittingly obey  footnote k oyez oyez oyez norman french for hearken hearken hearken  the work of incorporating the norman and english families with one another and fusing the two languages into one required about a century for its full accomplishment and when at last it was accomplished the people of england were somewhat puzzled to know whether they ought to feel proud of williams exploits in the conquest of england or humiliated by them so far as they were themselves descended from the normans the conquest was one of the glorious deeds of their ancestors so far as they were of english parentage it would seem to be incumbent on them to mourn over their fathers defeat it is obvious that from such a species of perplexity as this there was no escape and it has accordingly continued to embarrass the successive generations of englishmen down to the present day the norman conquest occupies therefore a very uncertain and equivocal position in english history the various modern writers who look back to it now being hardly able to determine whether they are to regard it as a mortifying subjugation which their ancestors suffered or a glorious victory which they gained  one of the great measures of williams reign and one in fact for which it has been particularly famous in modern times was a grand census or registration of the kingdom which the conqueror ordered with a view of having on record a perfect enumeration and description of all the real and personal property in the kingdom this grand national survey was made in 1078 the result was recorded in two volumes of different sizes which were called the great and the little domesday book these books are still preserved and are to this day of the very highest authority in respect to all questions touching ancient rights of property one is a folio and the other a quarto volume the records are written on vellum in a close abridged and to ordinary readers a perfectly unintelligible character the language is latin but a modern latin scholar without any means other than an inspection of the work would be utterly unable to decipher it in fact though the character is highly wrought and in some respects elegant the whole style and arrangement of the work is pretty nearly on a par in respect to scientific skill with queen emmas designs upon the bayeux tapestry about half a century ago copies of these works were printed by means of type made to represent the original character but these printed editions were found unintelligible and useless until copious indexes were prepared and published to accompany them at great expense of time and labor  some little idea of the character and style of this celebrated record may be obtained from the following specimen which is as faithful an imitation of the original as any ordinary typography will allow  illustration  the passage deciphered and expressed in full stands thusthe letters omitted in

the year 1082 queen matildas health began seriously to decline she was harassed by a great many anxieties and cares connected with the affairs of state which devolved upon her and arising from the situation of her family these anxieties produced great dejection of spirits and aggravated if they did not wholly cause her bodily disease she was at this time in normandy one great source of her mental suffering was her anxiety in respect to one of her daughters who as well as herself was declining in health forgetting her own danger in her earnest desires for the welfare of her child she made a sort of pilgrimage to a monastery which contained the shrine of a certain saint who as she imagined had power to save her daughter she laid a rich present on the shrine she offered before it most earnest prayers imploring with tears of bitter grief the intercession of the saint and manifesting every outward symbol of humility and faith she took her place in the religious services of the monastery and conformed to its usages as if she had been in the humblest private station but all was in vain the health of her beloved daughter continued to fail until at length she died and matilda growing herself more feeble and almost broken hearted through grief shut herself up in the palace at caen  it was in the same palace which william had built within his monastery many long years before at the time of their marriage matilda looked back to that period and to the buoyant hopes and bright anticipations of power glory and happiness which then filled her heart with sadness and sorrow the power and the glory had been attained and in a measure tenfold greater than she had imagined but the happiness had never come ambition had been contending unceasingly for twenty years among all the branches of her family against domestic peace and love she possessed herself an aspiring mind but the principles of maternal and conjugal love were stronger in her heart than those of ambition and yet she was compelled to see ambition bearing down and destroying love in all its forms every where around her her last days were embittered by the breaking out of new contests between her husband and her son  matilda sought for peace and comfort in multiplying her religious services and observances she fasted she prayed she interceded for the forgiveness of her sins with many tears the monks celebrated mass at her bedside and made as she thought by renewing the sacrifice of christ a fresh propitiation for her sins william who was then in normandy hearing of her forlorn and unhappy condition came to see her he arrived just in time to see her die  they conveyed her body from the palace in her husbands monastery at caen to the convent which she had built it was received there in solemn state and deposited in the tomb for centuries afterward there remained many memorials of her existence and her greatness there in paintings embroideries sacred gifts and records which have been gradually wasted away by the hand of time they have not however wholly disappeared for travelers who visit the spot find that many memorials and traditions of matilda linger there still  william himself did not live many years after the death of his wife he was several years older than she in fact he was now considerably advanced in age he became extremely corpulent as he grew old which as he was originally of a large frame made him excessively unwieldy the inconvenience resulting from this habit of body was not the only evil that attended it it affected his health and even threatened to end in serious if not fatal disease while he was thus made comparatively helpless in body by the infirmities of his advancing age he was nevertheless as active and restless in spirit as ever it was however no longer the activity of youth and hope and progress which animated him but rather the fitful uneasiness with which age agitates itself under the vexations which it sometimes has to endure or struggles convulsively at the approach of real or imaginary dangers threatening the possessions which it has been the work of life to gain the dangers in williams case were real not imaginary he was continually threatened on every side in fact the very year before he died the dissensions between himself and robert broke out anew and he was obliged unwieldy and helpless as he was to repair to normandy at the head of an armed force to quell the disturbances which robert and his partisans had raised  robert was countenanced and aided at this time by philip the king of france who had always been king williams jealous and implacable rival philip who as will be recollected was very young when william asked his aid at the time of his invasion of england was now in middle life and at the height of his power as he had refused william his aid he was naturally somewhat envious and jealous of his success and he was always ready to take part against him he now aided and abetted robert in his turbulence and insubordination and ridiculed the helpless infirmities of the aged king  while william was in normandy he submitted to a course of medical treatment in the hope of diminishing his excessive corpulency and relieving the disagreeable and dangerous symptoms which attended it while thus in his physicians hands he was of course confined to his chamber philip in ridicule called it being in the straw he asked some one who appeared at his court having recently arrived from normandy whether the old woman of england was still in the straw some miserable talebearer such as every where infest society at the present day who delight in quoting to one friend what they think will excite their anger against another repeated these words to william sick as he was the sarcasm aroused him to a furious paroxysm of rage he swore by gods brightness and resurrection that when he got out again he would kindle such fires in philips dominions in commemoration of his delivery as should make his realms too hot to hold him  he kept his wordat least so far as respects the kindling of the fires but the fires instead of making philips realms too hot to hold him by a strange yet just retribution were simply the means of closing forever the mortal career of the hand that kindled them the circumstances of this final scene of the great conquerors earthly history were these  in the execution of his threat to make philips dominions too hot to hold him william as soon as he was able to mount his horse headed an expedition and crossed the frontiers of normandy and moved forward into the heart of france laying waste the country as he advanced with fire and sword he came soon to the town of mantes a town upon the seine directly on the road to paris williams soldiers attacked the town with furious impetuosity carried it by assault and set it on fire william followed them in through the gates glorying in the fulfillment of his threats of vengeance some timbers from a burning house had fallen into the street and burning there had left a smoldering bed of embers in which the fire was still remaining william excited with the feeling of exultation and victory was riding unguardedly on through the scene of ruin he had made issuing orders and shouting in a frantic manner as he went when he was suddenly stopped by a violent recoil of his horse from the burning embers on which he had stepped and which had been concealed from view by the ashes which covered them william unwieldy and comparatively helpless as he was was thrown with great force upon the pommel of the saddle he saved himself from falling from the horse but he immediately found that he had sustained some serious internal injury he was obliged to dismount and to be conveyed away by a very sudden transition from the dreadful scene of conflagration and vengeance which he had been enacting to the solemn chamber of death they made a litter for him and a corps of strong men was designated to bear the heavy and now helpless burden back to normandy  illustration williams horse stepping on the embers  they took the suffering monarch to rouen the ablest physicians were summoned to his bedside after examining his case they concluded that he must die the tidings threw the unhappy patient into a state of extreme anxiety and terror the recollection of the thousand deeds of selfish ambition and cruelty which he had been perpetrating he said all his days filled him with remorse he shrunk back with invincible dread from the hour now so rapidly approaching when he was to appear in judgment before god and answer like any common mortal for his crimes he had been accustomed all his life to consider himself as above all law superior to all power and beyond the reach of all judicial question but now his time had come he who had so often made others tremble trembled now in his turn with an acuteness of terror and distress which only the boldest and most highhanded offenders ever feel he cried bitterly to god for forgiveness and brought the monks around him to help him with incessant prayers he ordered all the money that he had on hand to be given to the poor he sent commands to have the churches which he had burned at mantes rebuilt and the other injuries which he had effected in his anger repaired in a word he gave himself very earnestly to the work of attempting by all the means considered most efficacious in those days to avert and appease the dreaded anger of heaven  of his three oldest sons robert was away the quarrel between him and his father had become irreconcilable and he would not come to visit him even in his dying hours william rufus and henry were there and they remained very constantly at their fathers bedsidenot however from a principle of filial affection but because they wanted to be present when he should express his last wishes in respect to the disposal of his dominions such an expression though oral would be binding as a will when at length the king gave his dying directions in respect to the succession it appeared that after all he considered his right to the english throne as very doubtful in the sight of god he had in a former part of his life promised normandy to robert as his inheritance when he himself should die and though he had so often refused to surrender it to him while he himself continued to live he confirmed his title to the succession now i have promised it to him he said and i keep my promise and yet i know that that will be a miserable country which is subject to his government he is a proud and foolish knave and can never prosper as for my kingdom of england he continued i bequeath it to no one for it was not bequeathed to me i acquired it by force and at the price of blood i leave it in the hands of god only wishing that my son william rufus may have it for he has been submissive to me in all things and what do you give me father asked henry eagerly at this point i give you said the king five thousand pounds from my treasury but what shall i do with my five thousand pounds asked henry if you do not give me either house or land be quiet my son rejoined the king and trust in god let your brothers go before you your turn will come after theirs  the object which had kept the young men at their fathers bedside having been now attained they both withdrew henry went to get his money and william rufus set off immediately for england to prepare the way for his own accession to the throne as soon as his father should be no more  the king determined to be removed from his castle in rouen to a monastery which was situated at a short distance from the city without the walls the noise of the city disturbed him and besides he thought he should feel safer to die on sacred ground he was accordingly removed to the monastery there on the tenth of september he was awakened in the morning by hearing the city bells ringing he asked what it meant he was told that the bells were ringing for the morning service at the church of st mary he lifted up his hands looked to heaven and said i commend myself to my lady mary the holy mother of god and almost immediately expired  the readers of history have frequent occasion to be surprised at the sudden and total change which often takes place at the moment of the death of a mighty sovereign and even sometimes before his death in the indications of the respect and consideration with which his attendants and followers regard him in williams case as has happened in many other cases since the moment he ceased to breathe he was utterly abandoned every body fled carrying with them as they went whatever they could seize from the chamberthe arms the furniture the dresses and the plate for all these articles became their perquisites on the decease of their master the almost incredible statement is made that the heartless monsters actually stripped the dead body of their sovereign to make sure of all their dues and left it naked on the stone floor while they bore their prizes to a place of safety the body lay in this neglected state for many hours for the tidings of the great monarchs death which was so sudden at last produced as it spread universal excitement and apprehension no one knew to what changes the event would lead what wars would follow between the sons or what insurrections or rebellions might have been secretly formed to break out suddenly when this crisis should have arrived thus the whole community were thrown into a state of excitement and confusion  the monk and lay brethren of the monastery at length came in took up the body and prepared it for burial they then brought crosses tapers and censers and began to offer prayers and to chant requiems for the repose of the soul of the deceased they sent also the archbishop of rouen to know what was to be done with the body the archbishop gave orders that it should be taken to caen and be deposited there in the monastery which william had erected at the time of his marriage  the tale which the ancient historians have told in respect to the interment is still more extraordinary and more inconsistent with all the ideas we naturally form of the kind of consideration and honor which the remains of so great a potentate would receive at the hands of his household and his officers of state than the account of his death it is said that all the members of his household and all his officers immediately after his decease abandoned the townall eagerly occupied in plans and maneuvers to secure their positions under the new reign some went in pursuit of robert and some to follow william rufus henry locked up his money in a strong box well ironed and went off with it to find some place of security there was nobody left to take the neglected body to the grave  at last a countryman was found who undertook to transport the heavy burden from rouen to caen he procured a cart and conveyed it from the monastery to the river where it was put on board a vessel and taken down the seine to its mouth and thence by sea to caen the abbot of st stephens which was the name of williams monastery there came with some monks and a procession of the people to accompany the body to the abbey as this procession was moving along however a fire broke out in the town and the attendants actuated either by a sense of duty requiring them to aid in extinguishing the flames or by curiosity to witness the conflagration abandoned the funeral cort√®ge the procession was broken up and the whole multitude clergy and laity went off to the fire leaving the coffin with its bearers alone the bearers however went on and conveyed their charge to the church within the abbey walls  when the time arrived for the interment a great company assembled to witness the ceremonies stones had been taken up in the church floor and a grave dug a stone coffin a sort of sarcophagus had been prepared and placed in the grave as a receptacle for the body when all was ready and the body was about to be let down a man suddenly came forward from the crowd and arrested the proceedings he said that the land on which the abbey stood belonged to him that william had taken forcible possession of it for the abbey at the time of his marriage that he the owner had been compelled thus far to submit to this wrong inasmuch as he had during williams lifetime no means of redress but now he protested against a spoliation the land he said is mine it belonged to my father i have not sold it or forfeited it nor pledged it nor given it it is my right i claim it in the name of god i forbid you to put the body of the spoiler there or to cover him with my ground  when the excitement and surprise which this denunciation had awakened had subsided a little the bishops called this sudden claimant aside examined the proofs of his allegations and finding that the case was truly as he stated it they paid him on the spot a sum equal to the value of ground enough for a grave and promised to take immediate measures for the payment of the rest the remonstrant then consented that the interment might proceed  in attempting to let the body down into the place prepared for it they found that the sarcophagus was too small they undertook to force the body in in attempting this the coffin was broken and the body already through the long delays advanced in decomposition was burst the monks brought incense and perfumes and burned and sprinkled them around the place but in vain the church was so offensive that every body abandoned it at once except the workmen who remained to fill the grave                                       while these things were transpiring in normandy william rufus had hastened to england taking with him the evidences of his fathers dying wish that he should succeed him on the english throne before he reached headquarters there he heard of his fathers death and he succeeded in inducing the norman chieftains to proclaim him king roberts friends made an effort to advance his claims but they could do nothing effectual for him and so it was soon settled by a treaty between the brothers that william rufus should reign in england while robert was to content himself with his fathers ancient domain of normandy                                the end
