51301250	jeff benson or the young coastguardsman by rm ballantyne    chapter one  our hero introduced with some of his friends  a poor schoolmaster named benson died not long ago in a little town on the southeast coast of england which shall be called cranby  he left an only son jeffrey and an elder brother jacob to mourn his loss  the son mourned for his father profoundly for he loved him much the brother mourned him moderately for he was a closefisted hardhearted stern man of the law whose little soul enclosed in a large body had not risen to the conception of any nobler aim in life than the acquisition of wealth or any higher enjoyment than a social evening with men like himself  the son jeffrey was a freeandeasy hearty goodnatured lad with an overgrown and handsome person an enthusiastic spirit a strong will and a thorough belief in his own ability to achieve anything to which he chose to set his mind  up to the time of his fathers death jeffs main idea of the desirable in life wasfun  fun in all its more innocent phases seemed to him the sum of what was wanted by man  he had experienced it in all its scholastic forms ever since he was a little boy and even when at the mature age of fifteen he was promoted to the rank of usher in his fathers school his chief source of solace and relaxation was the old playground where he naturally reigned supreme being the best runner rower wrestler jumper gymnast and generally the best fellow in the school  he had never known a mothers love and his fathers death was the first blow that helped to shatter his early notions of felicity  the cloud that overshadowed him at that time was very dark and he received no sympathy worth mentioning from his only relative the solicitor  well jeff what dyou think of doing asked that austere relative two days after the funeral  of course at your age you cant carry on the school alone  of course not answered the boy with a suppressed sob  what say you to entering my office and becoming a lawyer jeff  thanks uncle id rather not  what will you do then demanded the uncle somewhat offended at this flat rejection of his proposal  the lad thought for a moment and then said quietly but decidedly ill go to sea  go to the worlds end if you like returned the uncle who was proud and touchy and hated the sea but dont ask me to help you  thank you uncle replied the lad who was as proud as himself though not touchy and had a strong affection for the sea having no particular business at the worlds end just now ill put off my visit to a more convenient season  they parted and we need scarcely add that the brief intercourse of uncle and nephew which had thus suddenly begun as suddenly ceased  it is not usually difficult for a strong active lad with merry black eyes and cheery manners to obtain employment  at least jeffrey benson did not find it so  a few miles from his native town there was a seaport  thither he repaired and looked about him  in the harbour lay a small vessel which looked like a yacht it was so trim and clean  on the quay near to it stood a seafaring man with an amiable expression of countenance  is that your schooner asked jeff of this man  yes it is  dyou want a hand  no i dont  jeff turned on his heel and was walking away when the seafaring man recalled him  have ee ever bin to sea lad he asked  no never  dye know anything about ships  next to nothing  dye think you could do anything now aboard of a ship  perhaps  come along then wi me to the office an ill see to this  thus was jeff introduced to the skipper of the coasting vessel in which he spent the succeeding six years of his life  at the end of that time his schooner was totally wrecked in a gale that sent more than two hundred vessels on the rocks of the british isles  the skipper was washed overboard and drowned but jeff was saved along with the rest of the crew by means of the rocket apparatus  by that time our hero had become a tall powerful man with a curly black beard and moustache  through the influence of a friend he was offered a situation in the coastguard accepted it and to his great satisfaction was stationed in the neighbourhood of cranby his native town  now near to that town jeff had a confidante into whose sympathetic bosom he had poured his joys and sorrows from the days of little boyhood  of course this confidante was a womana thin little elderly creature with bright blue eyes and grey hair that had once been golden who had a sort of tremble in her voice and whose frame was so light that the fishermen were wont to say of her that if she was to show her nose outside when it was blowing only half a gale shed be blowed away like a fleck of foam  nevertheless miss millet was a distinct power in cranby  being off duty one fine afternoon our coastguardsman walked along the beach in the direction of cranby bent on paying a visit to miss millet whom he had not seen for several years  on his way he had to pass a piece of common close to the town where he found that a number of the townsmen and some of the fishermen from the neighbouring hamlet had assembled to hold high holiday and engage in athletic exercises  the memory of schooldays came strong upon him as he watched the sport and he longed to join but was modest enough to feel that his offering to do so in connection with games which seemed to have been already organised might be an intrusion  two men were wrestling when he joined the circle of spectatorsone was a fisherman the other a huge blacksmith of the town  they were well matched for although the fisherman was shorter than the blacksmith he was an unusually powerful man  great was the excitement as the two herculean men strove for the mastery and loud was the cheer when at last the blacksmith prevailed and threw his adversary  but the enthusiasm was somewhat damped by the boastful manner in which the victor behaved for it is not easy to sing the praises of a man whose looks and words show that he greatly overrates himself  you dont need to look so cocky rodger cried a cynical voice in the crowd  there be lots o men as could throw thee though they bent here just now  rodger turned sharply round intending to give an angry defiance to the speaker but seeing that it was only reuben drew a whitehaired old shoemaker of small stature he burst into a sarcastic laugh  well i dont deny he said that there may be many men as could throw me but i defy any of ee now present to do it  this was an opening for jeff benson who was not slow to avail himself of it  stepping into the ring he threw off his coat  come along rodger he said with a goodhumoured look youll have to make good your words  of course our hero was received with a cheer of satisfaction for although jeff was two inches shorter than his adversarythe latter being six feet twoit could be seen at a glance that he was at least his match in breadth of shoulder and development of muscle  but in truth the young coastguardsman was much more than the blacksmiths match for at school he had received special training in the art of wrestling from his father who was a cornishman and hard service in the coasting trade had raised his strength of limb to the highest possible point  surely ive seen that young man somewhere whispered one of the spectators to reuben  so have i returned the latter  dont he look uncommon like the old schoolmasters son  hallo  and well might reuben exclaim hallo for jeff instead of grasping his opponent round the waist had suddenly seized him with one hand by the neck with the other by the leg and lifting him completely off the ground had flung him on his back  the people were too much astonished at first to cheer  they burst into a fit of laughter which however extended into a hearty cheer when reuben cried out it is jeffrey benson as sure as im alive and claimed him as a townsman  youre right reuben said jeff as he put on his coat though i am a good bit changed no doubt since i was here last  then the townsman have beaten the seaman after all exclaimed one who was inclined to triumph  not so returned jeff quickly for im a seaman myself and take sides with the fishermen  well said give us your hand mate cried john golding one of the latter holding out his hand which our hero grasped warmly for he had known the man in former years  youve done well in credit o the sea  an better still said little reuben in doing credit to the land by refusin to boast  nevertheless though jeff benson did not boast it is but just to say that he felt considerable satisfaction in his triumph and rejoiced in the possession of so powerful a frame as he continued his walk to miss millets house  it did not occur to him however to thank god for his strength of body because at that time god was not in all his thoughts  miss millet was a woman of action and projects  her whole being was absorbed in one ideathat of doing good but her means were small very small for besides being exceedingly poor she was in delicate health and getting old  she subsisted on quite a microscopic annuity but instead of trying to increase it she devoted the whole of her time to labours of love and charity  the labour that suited her health and circumstances best was knitting socks for the poor because that demanded little thought and set her mind free to form unlimited projects  the delight which miss millet experienced in meeting with her old friend jeffrey benson was displayed in the vivacity of her reception of him and the tremulosity of her little cap  its just like coming home auntiemay i still venture to call you so  jeff had been wont to sit on a stool at the good ladys feet  he did so nowon the old stool  you may call me what you please jeff  it was your childfancy to accord to me that honourable relationship so you may continue it if you will  how you are grown too  i could not have known you had i met youso big and with that horrible black beard  horrible  miss millet  well terrible if you prefer it  its so bushy and unnatural for one so young  that can hardly be auntie rejoined the youth with a smile that sent quite a ripple down the objectionable beard because my beard was provided by nature  well jeff returned the spinster promptly were not scissors and razors provided byno it was art that provided them she continued with a little smile of confusion but they are provided all the same andbut we wont pursue that subject for you men are incorrigible now tell me jeff where you have been and why you didnt come to see me sooner and why your letters have been so fewthough i admit they were long  we will not inflict on the reader all the conversation that ensued when jeff had exhausted his narrative miss millet discovered that it was teatime and while engaged in preparations for the evening meal she enlarged upon some of her projects being encouraged thereto by jeff whose heart was naturally sympathetic  but some of my projects are impossible she said with a little sigh some small things indeed i have accomplished with gods blessing but there are others which are quite beyond me  indeed  tell me now auntie if you had aladdins wonderful lamp what would you ask for  id ask forlet me see the old face became quite thoughtful here id ask for a library  you see cranby is very badly off for books and people cannot easily improve without reading you know  then i would ask for a new church and a school room and a townhall where we might have lectures and concerts and for a whole street of modelhouses for the poor and a gymnasium and a swimmingbath and  a swimmingbath auntie exclaimed jeff  isnt the sea big enough  yes but children wont learn in the sea  theyre too fond of running about the edge and of romping in the shallow water  besides the bath could be used in winter when the sea is too cold  but im praying for all these things  if god sees fit he will give them  if not i am content with what he has already given  a somewhat sceptical smile rested for a moment on the young mans lips happily his heavy moustache concealed it and saved miss millets feelings  but she went on to vindicate the ways of god with man and to impress upon jeff the fact that in his good wisdom ills or wells and things that seem to us only evil work out gracious ends  jeff listened but said little and evidently his difficulties were not all removed  presently observing that three cups were laid on the table he asked do you expect company  yes my brother the captain is coming to tea  he is about to start for china and im so glad you happen to be here for id like you to know each other and youre sure to like him  jeff did not feel quite so sure on that point for he had counted on a long teteatete with his old friend  he took care however to conceal his disappointment and before he had time to reply the door opened with a crash  what cheer old girl what cheer resounded in bosunsmate tones through the house and next moment a rugged seacaptain stood before them    chapter two  a seacaptain relates his adventures and refuses to draw morals  captain richard millet like his sister was rather eccentric  unlike her however he was large broad and powerful  it would have taken considerably more than half a gale to blow him away  even a gale and a half might have failed to do that  glad to meet you he said extending his solidlooking hand with a frank hearty air on being introduced to jeff  my sister molly has often spoken of you  sorry to hear youve left the sea  great mistake young mangreat mistake  theres no school like the sea for teaching a man his dependence on his maker  the school is not very successful if one may judge from the character of most of its pupils replied the youth  perhaps you misjudge their character returned the captain with a look of goodnatured severity  im sure he does cried miss millet with enthusiasm noblehearted simple men who would probably never go wrong at all if it were not for their unsuspecting trustfulness and bad companions come sit down dick  tea is ready  yes young man continued captain millet you misjudge em  you should not judge of a school by the shouting and mischief of the worst boys who always flaunt their colours while the good ones steer quietly on their course  youll understand that better when your beard is grey youth is fond o lookin at the surface an so is apt to misjudge the character of men as well as the ways of providence  jeff took the rebuke in good part readily admitted that youth was prone to err and slily expressed a hope that in his case coming in contact with age might do him good  if you mean that for a shot at me cried the captain with a loud guffaw youve missed the mark for im only fortyfive an that isnt age is it molly  of course not  why youre little more than a baby yet replied miss millet who greatly enjoyed even a small jokeindeed she enjoyed almost everything more or less that was not wicked  but now dick i want you to tell jeff some of your adventures in foreign partsespecially those that have a moral you know  why molly thats a hard jobyou dont want me to draw the moral do you  i never was good at that though ive known fellows with that peculiar cast o brain as could draw a moral out of a marlinespike if they were hard put to it  seems to me that its best to let morals draw themselves  for instance that time when i was wrecked on the south american coast i came to a shallow river an had to wade across but was too lazy to pull off my boots cause they were long fishermans boots right up to the hip an rather tight so in i went boots an all just as i was gettin to the other side a most awful alligator seized hold o my right foot  its wonderful how easy my boot came off just then  although i was used to tug an shove and gasp and pull at that boot of a night no sooner did the alligator lay hold on it than my leg came out like a cork out of a bottle and i was out o the water and up the bank like a squirrel  now molly what would you say was the moral that should be drawn from thatnever use an alligator as a bootjackeh  i should say never wade across a south american river without your boots on suggested jeff  well now i should say never wade across a south american river at all said miss millet but brother thats not what i meant  before you arrived jeff and i had been talking about gods ways with man and i was trying to show that disasters and what we call misfortunes are not necessarily evil but are often the means of great blessing  i dont think jeff quite sees that  i cant explain myself clearly brother but you know what i mean  while the old lady was speaking the captain had become thoughtful  yes i know what you mean he replied and i agree with you heartily is it not written of our saviour he hath done all things well and is he not unchangeable  of course it is not to be expected that we shall always see through and understand his ways though we can always trust him but sometimes he lifts a corner of the veil and lets us see very odd molly continued the captain extracting a large black pocketbook with some difficulty from a breastpocket very odd that you should have touched on this question for i have somethin to say to you that bears on it  look here  whats that  he handed an oblong piece of paper to his sister who examined it slowly  why dick its a cheque for 500 pounds  just so old girl an its yours  mine  ay i might have given it to you when i first came back but i took a fancy to keep it as a little surprise for our last evenin together so that i might leave you with a good taste in your mouth  now listen an ill spin you an jeff a yarn  but first fill up my cup  im fond o teanatrally bein a teetotaler  up to the brim molly i like a good bucketful  thankeenow let me see  the captain put his hand to his rugged brow became thoughtful for a few moments and then resumed  just before startin on my last voyage to china i ran down to folkestone to see rosebudthats my little daughter jeff  surely you must have seen her when knocking about here  you forget captain i have not been in these parts for six years nevertheless i did see rosebud some ten or twelve years ago with her nurse in this very room  yes so you did chimed in miss millet  she was six at that time and the dearest little angel i ever saw  she was all that and a great deal more said the enthusiastic father it dont become me to have much of an opinion about the angels but i wouldnt give my rosebud for the whole lot o them an all the cherubs throwd into the bargain  well as i was sayin i ran down to folkestone to the school where she is and as we were partin she made me promise when i got to hongkong to run up the river to see an old schoolmate o hers that had gone out there with her father  i was to give clara rosebuds dear love and her photograph and get hers in exchange  i would have done this of course for my darlin anyhow but i promised all the more readily because i had some business to do with old nibsworth the father  well after id got to hongkong an seen the ship all snug i thought of runnin up the river in a small steamer that was ready to start  it so happened that i got a letter that very day from nibsworth himself who had heard of my arrival askin me to come without delay as there was a grand chance of doin a bit of business that might turn in some thousands of pounds  but it would have to be settled next day or the chance would be lost  you may be sure i didnt waste time after readin this but when i got to the riverside i found that the steamer had started and there wasnt another till next mornin  what a pity exclaimed the sympathetic sister and jeff in the same breath  yes wasnt it  of course it wasnt a personal loss but it was the loss of a splendid outotheway chance to do a good turn to the owners  it was an ill windjeff almost a disaster  howsever i had to grin an bear it  but i couldnt rest till next day so i hired a native boat determined to do my best in the circumstances and you may be sure i wasnt in the best of humours as we went creepin slowly up that river when i knew that the hours of opportunity were slippin away  it was not till the evenin o the next day that i reached old nibsworths house  just before we rounded the bend of the river that brought it into view i noticed smoke risin pretty thick above the trees  of course i thought nothin of it till i found that it was the old mans house was afire  didnt we bend to the oars then with a will  as we drew near we found that all the servants and workpeople about the place were runnin here and there shoutin and yellin for ropes and ladders  most people seem to lose their heads in a fire  anyhow those people had for nobody could find a ladder long enough to reach a top window where i could see that someone was waving his arms for help the moment we touched the beach i jumped out o the boat and ran up to the house  it was blazin fiercely in the lower rooms and i soon found that old nibsworth and his daughter were insidedriven to the attics by the fire and smoke  they soon left the window where i had first seen the arms waving and threw open another that was further from the fire  i saw that the old man was frail  the girl they told me was delicate  get straw hay branchesanything soft i shouted an pile em under the window  hims too weak for jump gasped a native servant  do as i bid ye said i with a glare that sent em all off doublequick  happily i found a rope handy in a storehouse hard by  i made a coil of it  you know a seaman can usually heave a coil of rope pretty well  i made a splendid heave an sent it right in at the window  the old man caught it  make fast to a bedpost i roared or a table or chest o drawers anything big  he understood me i could see and presently he looked over the window an shook his head  then i could see the face of a darkhaired beautiful girl  even through the increasing smoke i could tell that she was deadly pale and drew back with a shudder  by this time a big pile of straw lay under the window  i saw there was no hope of such an old man lettin himself or his girl down by a rope so up i went hand over hand  many a time had i done the sort o thing for a lark when i was a youngster but bein out o practice and a good deal heavier than in old days i found it hard work i can tell you  howsever i managed it and got in at the window an didnt my heart give a jump when i saw that the old chap had only made the rope fast to a light bedroom chair if id bin a stone heavier id have pulled that chair right over the window  god bless you cried the tremblin old man save my clara  there was no time for pretty speeches  i made fast the end of the rope to the leg of a table made a loop on the other end threw it over the girl caught her round the waist an swung her over the window  i was in such a hurry that the rope nearly took the skin off my hands but i landed her safe on the straw below  the old man was heavier and not so easy to manage but i got him lowered safe and then slipping over myself began to descend  the flames had by that time got headway and were dartin like fiery serpents tongues out o the windows below  one o them gave me a wipe in passin an cleared eyelashes eyebrows and half the hair o my head away  another twined round the rope and singed it so that when i was halfway down it snapped and i came to the ground with a thud that damaged my canvas ducks though they were by no means delicate  howsever the pile of straw broke the fall and i was none the worse  the gratitude o that poor old man and his daughter knew no bounds specially when he found i was the father of his claras favourite schoolmate  now captain millet says he at partin nothin in this world can repay what we owe you  i know it would be insultin to offer you money for such service but sometimes men like you like to help a good cause will you accept of five hundred pounds for such a purpose  no sir says i i wont  but ive a sister at home who spends all her time in tryin to do good  if youll be kind enough to send it to her shell consider it a blessed windfall and will lay it out to the best possible advantage  good said he seizin his pen an writin out the cheque  is your sister well off  she might be better off said i  then pray beg her in my name to accept of a few shares in an australian tinmine which came to me a few days ago  they are not worth much but i dont want to be troubled with them indeed will consider it a favour if she will take them off my hands  the old fellow said this with a laughso there you are molly 500 pounds to the credit of your charity account an i dont know how much tin transferred to your own  o brother how goodhow kind  miss millet paused here and gazed in silence at the cheque for she had already begun to calculate how far that sum would go towards the library and the church and the townhall and the modelhouses and the gymnasium and the swimmingbath  and now young man said the captain turning to our coastguardsman the missin of that steamer at which i growled so much that day turned out to be a great blessin after all although it seemed such a misfortune  for it caused me to arrive just in the nick of time to save two human livesbesides givin the old girl here somethin to think about and work upon for the next twelvemonth to comewhereas if i had arrived the day before i would have bin sleepin in the house and mayhap have bin burnt alive wi old nibsworth and his daughter  seems to me as if that little story had some sort o bearin on the subject you was discussin wi molly  but im not good at drawin morals so ill leave you to draw it for yourself    chapter three  our coastguardsman meets with a serious but very common fall  whether jeff benson drew the moral of captain millets story for himself or not we cannot tell but it is certain that his mates found him after that date a man who was prone to solitary meditations with occasional fits of absence of mind  they also found him a pleasant companion and a most active comrade in all the duties of his station  sometimes these duties involved great hardship and frequent risk to life and limb for as is well known our coastguardsmen not only perambulate our shores in all weathers but often work the rocket apparatus for saving life from shipwreck and are frequently called upon to assist the lifeboatmen by putting off to the rescue in their own boats when others are not available  in all these duties jeffrey benson did his work with tremendous energy as might have been expected of one so strong and with reckless disregard to personal safety which was appropriate in a hero  one evening about a year after the period of which we have been writing jeff was returning along shore with a party in charge of the rocketcart after having rescued the crew of a small coasting vessel four men and a boy with the skippers wife  the service had been prolonged and pretty severe but feelings of exhaustion were for the time at least banished from the coastguardsmens breasts by the joy resulting from success in their heroic work  on the way the party had to pass close to miss millets cottageher cottage by the sea as the romantic old lady was fond of calling it  jeffalthough fatigued and hungry besides being drenched dishevelled about the hair bespattered with mud and bruised as well as lacerated somewhat about the handsdetermined to pay a short visit to the cottage being anxious to have it out with his confidante about that matter of good being made to come out of evil  o jeff exclaimed the horrified old lady when he entered wounded perhaps fatally  not quite so bad as that auntie replied jeff with a hearty laugh for miss millets power to express alarm was wonderful  ill soon put myself to rights when i get back to the station  i ought to apologise for calling in such a plight but ive been thinking much since i last saw you and i want to have a talk  not till i have bound up all your wounds said miss millet firmly  knowing that he would gain his end more quickly by giving in jeff submitted to have several fingers of both hands done up with pieces of white rag and a slight cut across the bridge of his handsome nose ornamented with black stickingplaster  he not only enjoyed the operation with a sort of reckless joviality but sought to gratify his friend by encouraging her to use her appliances to the utmost intending to remove them all when he quitted the cottage  the earnest little woman availed herself fully of the encouragement but could scarcely refrain from laughing when she surveyed him after the operation was completed  now auntie have you finished  yes  well then tell me do you really think that at all times and in all circumstances god causes events that are disastrous to work out good  indeed i do returned miss millet becoming very serious and earnest as she sat down opposite her young friend  no doubt there is much of mystery connected with the subject but i cant help that any more than i can help my beliefs  of course we know because it is written that all things work together for good to them that love god but even in the case of those who do not love him i think he often sends sorrow and trouble for the very purpose of driving them out of trust in themselves and so clearing the way to bring them to the saviour  and is it not written surely the wrath of man shall praise thee  the young man remained silent for a few moments  well now he said what think you of this case  the skipper whom we rescued this afternoon along with his wife told me that he has been reduced to beggary  he owned the vessel which now lies out on the rocks there a total wreck  it was his last venture  he had put all that he possessed into it and not a scrap of the cargo will be saved  having been a lucky man all his life previously he said he had determined to chance his luck this time and did not insure vessel or cargo so that all is gone  his wife and several children are dependent on him  he has no relatives rich enough or willing enough to help him and poor fellow he has received injuries while being rescued which will probably render him helpless for the rest of his life  now do you think that good will come out of all that  i am sure it will returned miss millet confidently and good to him too if he seeks it though of course i know not how or when  but why are you so sure  because jeff it is written that god does not afflict the children of men willingly  he does it for their good and that good cannot fail of accomplishment unless they refuse the good and choose the evil  again jeff became silent and thoughtful  i have meditated much of late he said about captain millets adventure in china  by the way interrupted miss millet that reminds me that the captains little girl roserosebud as he calls heris to come here this very evening to stay with me for a week  indeed that will be pleasant auntie  i must come and see her as an old acquaintance  oh yes you must jeff  youve no idea what a sweet girl she has become  i am quite charmed with herso modest and unselfish and clever and good andand in short i call her the four fs for she is fair fragile fervent and funny  what a catalogue exclaimed the youth laughing you may well be charmed with her  but what do you mean by funny  does she try to make people laugh  oh dear no  in company she can scarce be made to speak at all but she is so fond of funhas such a lively appreciation of humour and laughs so heartily  she has grown quite into a woman since i last saw her when her father went to sea  there she is  miss millet sprang from her chair with the agility almost of a young woman and ran to open the door for a cab was heard pulling up in front of the cottage  there was a delighted little shriek from auntie and the warmest salutations of welcome and the next moment miss millet with the captains daughter arm in arm embracing one another entered the parlour  the coastguardsman was transfixed for there before him flushed and panting stood    a maid with eyes of heavenly blue   and rippling hair of golden hue   with parted lips of coral too   disclosing pearlsand  all the rest of it  yes no wonder that jeffrey benson was transfixed still less wonder that rosebud stood in much the same condition for a young giant in pilotcloth damp and dirty dishevelled bespattered with mud tied up about the fingers and plastered over the nose was not precisely what she had expected to find in aunt millets parlour  they were soon introduced however and on the best of terms for the shrinking from jeffs filthy appearance changed in a moment to heroworship in the romantic heart of rose when she was told the cause of the youths condition and heard all the details of the rescue from his own manly lips  it was love at first sight with both of them more than that it was first love at first sight  we have profound sympathy with young people thus circumstanced especially when they are reticent and dont give way to sentimental silliness  a good manly and womanly case of this sort of love in which the parties concerned take a serious header and go deep down without the smallest intention of ever coming up again is pleasant to contemplate and agreeable to record  of course it must not be supposed that rose millet understood what had happened  she was fully aware indeed that something unusual had occurred within her inexperienced breast but she quietly set it down to heroworship  she had read carlyle on that subject  she had seen occasional reference in newspapers and magazines to lifeboat work and she had been thrilled by the record of noble deeds done by heroic seamen and coastguardsmen  at last it was her lot to come athwart one of those heroes  he quite came up to her conceptionnay more than came up to it  she regarded jeff with feelings approaching to awe  the idea of love in connection with a damp dirty wounded noseplastered hairravelled giant with beard enough to make an average hearthbroom never entered her fair head  if suggested to her she would have laughed it to scornhad it been possible for one so bright and funny to become scornful  as for jeffhe more than suspected what had happened in regard to himself  his experience of life had been varied and extensive for his yearsat least in a nautical directionand that is saying a great deal  done for he remarked to himself that evening as he left the residence of miss millet and sauntered slowly homeward divesting his fingers of the wrappings in an absent manner as he went along but he forgot the plastered nose and was taken to task about it by his comrades  why wherever did you get the stickinplaster asked david bowers an anglosaxon much like himself in form and size only that his locks and beard were yellow instead of dark brown  from a friend replied jeff  a female friend asked bowers with a sly glance  yes replied jeff so promptly and with a look of such benignity that the anglosaxon felt constrained to give up his intended badinage  that night curiously enough rose and jeff were beset by dreams exactly similar in kind though slightly modified in form  both were in the midst of howling blasts and raging billows but while the one was saving a fair and slender girl in circumstances of great but scorned risk the other was being rescued by a young giant with a brown beard in a style the most heroic and in the midst of dangers the most appalling  next day when jeffhaving got rid of the noseplaster and removed the mud and brushed the dishevelled hair and put on dry garmentspaid another visit to miss millet the rosebud formed a more correct estimate of her condition became alarmed and shrank like a sensitive plant before the gaze of the coastguardsman insomuch that she drove him to the conclusion that he had no hope whatever in that quarter and that he was foolish to think of her seriously  what was she after all  a mere chit of a school girl  it was ridiculous  he would heave her overboard forthwith and trouble his head no more about her  he would not however give up visiting his old confidante on her accountoh dear no  it was wonderful what an amount of guarding seemed to be required by the coast in the vicinity of miss millets cottage during the following week  any one observing the frequency of jeffs visits to it and his prolonged earnest gazing at the sea would have imagined that the ancient smuggling days had revived or that the old tendency of the french to suddenly come oer and find the britons awaiting them on shore was not yet extinct  one evening our hero after paying a little unwonted attention to his toilet prepared to set out for miss millets cottage  he had obtained leave of absence for the evening and had made up his mind to spend an hour or two in metaphysical discussion  rose had not yet left her aunt but no matter  if she could not assist in the conversation she could at all events listen and might be benefited  in passing through the station the officer on duty called to him  i want you benson to take wilsons place tonight  he is unwell and off duty  we may possibly require all our force for the barometer has suddenly fallen much lower than usual  no shade of disappointment betrayed itself on the grave countenance of the welldisciplined jeff as he replied very well sir and went out but profound disappointment nevertheless harrowed his broad bosom for he had promised himself such a long and pleasant evening of discussion possibly of benefit to the young girl for whom he cared nothing nowa mere passing fancy pooh  but even while ejecting the pooh he wondered why the disappointment was so severe  was it possible that he was being taught by experience the lesson which miss millets reasoning powers had failed to inculcate  it was blowing hard when jeff reached the cliffs and bending forward to the increasing blast made his way to the rugged coast which was to be the scene of his night vigil  as he stood on the shore with hands in pockets and legs apart to steady himself and gazed out upon the darkening sea he saw plainly enough that the prophetic barometer was right  far out on the water a ledge of rocks barely covered at high water caught the billows as they rolled shoreward broke them up and sent them spouting into the air in volumes of foam  on the horizon the clouds were so black that the shrieking seabirds passed athwart them like flakes of snow  low muttering thunder was heard at intervals and as night drew on gleams of lightning flashed in the obscurity  during one of these flashes jeff thought he saw a vessel labouring heavily  he could not be quite sure for by that time spray borne on the whistling wind was blinding him  suddenly a red flash was seen followed by a report  it was a signal of distress  every thought and feeling save that of duty was instantly banished from the mind of our coastguardsman as he hurried away to give the alarm and join in the rescue    chapter four  a wreck and rescue  terrible was the gale which burst that night upon the shores of old england and awful the fate that awaited many of the vessels which were nearing port at the time  better far for many of them had they met the foe in the open field of what seamen term blue water for no place is so dangerous as the shallow waters off the coast when the stormfiend is abroad  perhaps it may be news to some readers that the losses of this country by shipwreck form a perennial drain of life and wealth as regular and certain as the recurrence of the seasons  nearly two thousand ships two millions sterling and little short of a thousand lives are lost each year on the shores of the united kingdomsometimes more sometimes lesseach and every year  we give round numbers because they are more easily remembered  on the particular night of which we write many a gallant ship was driving over the sea making for her port nearing home and friends rushing to her doom  passengers and crews alike had by that time doubtless become so familiar with whistling gales and heaving seas that they had ceased to fear them but some among them had yet to learn when too late that the dangers of the deep are insignificant compared with the perils of the shore  among these hapless ships was one to which we direct the readers particular attention  she was a large ship with a crew of between twenty and thirty men bound from china to the thames  she carried no passengers and was commanded by our friend captain millet  no captain in the mercantile navy of britain was better qualified than he to take his ship across the trackless main and if need be carry her safely into port but seamanship and knowledge of channels and bars and currents avail nothing when the sails and cordage of a ship are unseaworthy and her timbers worn out  the owners of the north star cared little for human lives  they were economists of the strictest kind  hence her condition was bad  the gale overtook the north star when she was not far from the coast where nestled her captains native town of cranby  a pilot had been signalled for in vain for the night was thick as well as stormy  at last one was obtained and all went fairly well until the vessel was off the black rocks on which the eyes of jeff benson had been resting for some time  fearing that he was too near that point of danger the pilot gave orders to go about  while the vessel was in stays one of the ropes parted and she missed  at the same moment a squall came down on her and carried away the main and foretopmasts with the jibboom instantly the vessel was unmanageable and drifted bodily towards the rocks  captain millet and his men toiled like heroes to clear away the wreckage and orders were given to fire the signalgun  as we have seen our coastguardsman was swift to carry the alarm to his station and without delay the lifeboat was launched  at the same time orders were given to get ready the coastguard boat in case its services should be required  the regular crew of the lifeboat had as usual been on the alert and the bright blue boat of mercy was at once run down to the beach until her carriage reached the edge of the foaming sea  now lads jump in shouted the coxswain  it was found however when they had taken their places and seized the oars that two of the crew were missing  volunteers were instantly called for and jeff with his friend david bowers answered to the call  they put on the cork lifebelts took the vacant seats and grasped the oars  then the transporting carriage with the boat and crew on it was pushed by many willing hands as far into the sea as possible the men bending forward with the oars out ready to pull at a moments notice  the launching ropes were already manned  at another signal from the coxswain the boat plunged into the boiling surf the oars were dipped ten strong backs were bent and away they shot on their errand of mercydrenched and filled by the first great billow through which they cut their way but not swamped for the water ran out through the discharging tubes as fast as it came in  an hour of hard toil brought them within sight of the wreck  keeping well to windward the coxswain cast anchor and the bowman taking a turn or two of the cable round the bollard allowed the boat to drop down to the wreck stern foremost  cant you get round to leeward of the wreck asked jeff who sat near the stern of the boat keeping a firm grasp of his oar which the rushing and breaking seas wellnigh forced out of his hands  no not as the rocks lie replied the coxswain curtly  on drawing a few yards nearer it became evident that no boat could live in the seething caldron of rocks and foam that lay under the lee of the wreck  their only chance lay in approaching from the weather side which was not only a difficult and dangerous operation but was rendered doubly so by the violent swaying of the wreck from side to side  the roaring of the gale and thunder of the seas combined with the darkness and the hurtling spray rendered it impossible for the men in the lifeboat to distinguish anything clearly until close to the wreck then it was seen that the whole crew had taken to the rigging of the mainmastthe topmast of which had been carried away by the fall of the foremast and mizzen  a lusty cheer told that the shipwrecked men were still strong in hope though their situation was terrible for every lurch of the hull shook the swaying top so violently as almost to tear even the strong seamen from their grasp  jeff said bowers who sat on the same thwart with his friend did ye not recognise a voice in that cheer  ay that i did returned jeff with feelings of great anxiety  twas uncommon like captain millet  look out for the rope roared one of the lifeboat men as he swung and discharged the loaded stick with a line attached  the heave was successful  the men on the maintop of the wreck caught the line and by means of it passed a stout warp between the mast and the boat down which they began to shin like squirrels for the prompt appearance of their rescuers had not left time for the exhaustion of their strength  is your vessel the north star commanded by captain millet shouted jeff in the ear of the first arrival for the noise of raging elements rendered ordinary tones almost useless  ay she is replied the man but you wont see him till the last of us is safe aboard  hallo  captain millet cried jeff with a roar that almost equalled the elements  ay ay is that you jeff came back in a similar roar but greatly softened by distance from the swirling sprayclouds that raged above the wreck  cheer up captain well save you all right returned our coastguardsman in another enthusiastic roar which of itself did something to cheer up all who heard it  about a dozen of the sailors had been got into the lifeboat when a tremendous rending sound was heard followed by a loud cry of alarm as the mast broke off a few feet above the deck and plunged with the men still upon it into the boiling sea  to add to the confusion and terror some part of the cordage caught the lifeboat and completely sank as well as overturned it  to an ignorant observer it might have seemed that all hope was gone that every man must perish  but this was not so  the buoyant qualities of the magnificent lifeboat brought it to the surface like a cork the instant it was freed  its selfrighting qualities turned it on its keel  the selfacting discharging tubes emptied it in less than two minutes and the crew supported by their cork lifebelts caught the lifelines festooned round the boats side for this very purpose and clambered into her  of the men of the wreck who had been tumbled into the sea along with them some clung to their rescuers whose belts could easily sustain two  others were able to lay hold of the boat and a few held on to the floating wreckage till they were saved  suddenly the voice of captain millet was heard hold on lads dont go without me  my foots jammed here and i cant  he stopped abruptly for the head of the mast plunged under water at the moment taking the captain along with it  without a word jeff rose and sprang into the sea at the spot where his friend had disappeared  almost at the same moment the end of the mast reappeared and struck our hero on the side with terrible violence  in spite of the blow however he was able to free the captain who was caught by several strong arms and hauled inboard at the same moment that his rescuer laid hold of one of the hanging lifelines  while they were still heaving at the captain david bowers heard jeffs voice  your hand davy  the stout coastguardsman was not slow to obey and he received a grip like that of a drowning man but his mate made no other effort to save himself  help here two of you cried bowers  another moment and six brawny arms embraced jeff and lifted him into the boat  not hurt i hope jeff  not much davyat least not to speak of only im a bit stunned  just let me lie here  one o the north stars men can take my oar  there was no time for delicate attentions or inquiries in the circumstances for the wreck of the mainmast had already given the boat strong though it was some damaging lunges as it shot wildly to and fro in the mad sea  all there demanded the coxswain of the saved men who had been rapidly counting their numbers  all here thank god answered captain millet  haul off lads  the men laid hold of the hawser and hauled with a willnot a moment too soon for the wreck was breaking up and the sea around was strewn with heavy timbers  having hauled the boat up to her anchor the latter was got in and the oars were shipped  these last being made fast to the boat with strong lines had not been lost in all the turmoil though two of them were broken  they were replaced however by spare oars and then the lifeboat being pulled out of danger hoisted her scrap of sail and scudded away gaily before the wind for the shore with her rescued freight  of course the news spread like wildfire that the lifeboat had come in with the crew of the wrecked north starsome said the whole crew others part of the crew for verbal reports of this kind never do coincide after travelling a short way  jeff i must go straight to my sister and be first wi the news said captain millet on landing  you said my rosebud is with her just now  yes ill go with ee captain  come along then lad but i fear youve got hurt  youre sure it isnt broken ribs  oh nothing to speak of replied the youth with a light laugh  first however i must telegraph to the owners said the captain  this duty performed and his men comfortably housed in a neighbouring inn captain millet and jeff went off to the cottage  it was about two in the morning when they reached it  no one had yet been there  in his excited state of mind the captain who had no nerves thundered at the door  if there was one thing that miss millet had a horror of it was housebreakers  she leaped out of bed and began to dress in terror having roused rose who slept with her  burglars never thunder like that auntie suggested rose as she hastily threw on her garments  miss millet admitted the force of the argument and then somewhat relieved concluded that it must be tipsy men  under this impression she raised the windowsashher bedroom being on the upper floorand looked timidly out  go away bad naughty men she said in a remonstrative tone  if you dont i shall send for the police  why molly dont you know me  brother shrieked miss millet  father exclaimed the rosebud  need we say that after a few more hurried touches to costume the door was opened and the untimely visitors were admitted  need we add that when rose with a little cry of joy leaped into her fathers arms and received a paternal hug she leaped out of them again with a little shriek of surprise  father youre all wet a perfect sponge  true darling i forgot  ive just been wrecked and rescued by the lifeboat through gods great mercy long with all my crew and there he added pointing to jeff stands the man that saved my life  if rose loved the young coastguardsman before she absolutely idolised him now  something of the feeling must have betrayed itself on her fair face for jeff made a step towards her as if under an irresistible impulse to seize her hand  but at that moment he experienced an agonising sensation of pain and staggering backwards sat downalmost fellupon the sofa  nothingnothing he replied to the anxious inquiries of miss millet only a little pain caused by the rap i got from that mast  come now auntie dont fuss about me but sit down and hear what the captain has got to say    chapter five  miss millet receives a surprise rosebud a disappointment and our hero another blow  miss millet was one of those cheery unselfish activeminded women who are not easily thrown off their balancederanged as the french sayby untoward circumstances  the arrival of any two friends at two in the morning would have failed to disturb the good nature or weaken the hospitality of that amiable creature  her joy therefore at the sudden though untimely appearance of her brother and friend was not marred by selfish considerations and although she was eager to bear what the captain had to say she would not let him begin until he and jeff had retired to an attic chamber and put on dry habiliments  how male attire came to be so handy in a spinsters house is easily accounted for by the fact that her regard for the memory of her departed father was so great as to have induced her to leave his hat and stick in the passage in their wonted places after his death and to leave undisturbed the chest of drawers which contained the greater part of his wardrobe  nothing short of absolute necessity would have induced miss millet to disturb these sacred relics but she knew that death might result from sitting in drenched clothes and her wellbalanced mind at once pointed out that here was a case which demanded a sacrifice  she therefore bowed to the inevitable and handed her brother the key of the chest of drawers  as the late mr millet had been a large man the result was that her visitors were admirably fitted outthe only disadvantage being that the captain had to turn up the legs of the trousers and the cuffs of the coat  meanwhile miss millet lighted a gasstove which she had always ready for invalid purposes and rose arranged the table so that when their visitors returned to the parlour they were greeted with the sight of food and the singing of the teakettle  i can offer you brandy brother said the little hostess as a medicine  thankee mollynot even as a medicine said the captain with a benignant look tea is better in the circumstances  i can speak from a vast amount of experience  but of course i speak only for myself  i dont know what jeffs principles  my principles interrupted the coastguardsman are to leave every man to judge for himself  my judgment for myself is that as i dont require strong drink im much better without it  my principles go much further than that said miss millet who was an enthusiastic total abstainer  the bible justifies me in denying myself the use of wine and all spirituous liquors for my brothers sake so that i may set him an example and also have more weight when i reason with him and try to get him to adopt my views  why molly to hear you talk like that about giving up drink for your brothers sake one would think that i had bin a tippler all my life  you know that i refer to my brotherman brother  ah of courseof course and also your sisterwoman i suppose cried the captain seizing the loaf and beginning to cut it into inchandahalf slices  whats your opinion rosebud on the drink question  rose whose cheeks emulated her namesake flower replied that never having tasted wine or spirits in her life or thought upon the drink question at all she had no opinion to express  long may you continue in that innocent and humble state of mind my rosebud cried the captain with a laugh which caused him to choke on his first mouthful of tea  after recovering himself and wiping his eyes he said  now moll i must tell you all about the wreck on which he launched out into a graphic description of what the reader already knows  you may be sure that he did not underrate the services and heroism of jeff who sat wonderfully silent during the recital and only acknowledged references to himself with a faint smile  but brother exclaimed miss millet with sudden energy when he had finished what will the consequences of this wreck be  the consequences my dear will be that the owners will lose a good many thousand pounds for neither ship nor cargo were insured  an it sarves em right for the vessel was not fit to go to sea an they knew it but were too graspin to go to the expense o refittin  besides theyve bin what they call so lucky in past years that they thought i fancy there was no fear o their luck departin  but i was not thinking of the owners brother i was thinking of the consequences to yourself  why as to that molly as ive lost my ship im pretty safe to lose my situation for from what i know of the owners they are sure to lay all the blame they can upon my shoulders so that i wont find it easy to get another ship  worse than all i had made a little private adventure of my own which was very successful and the result o which i was bringin home in golddust and now every nugget o that is at the bottom o the sea  so you see molly its loss an disaster everywherenothin but a black horizon all round  jeff glanced quickly at miss millet  this seemed to bear somewhat on their recent discussions  miss millet as quickly returned the glance  i know what you are thinking jeff she said with an intelligent look  well auntie returned the youth it does seem hard to think that any good can come out of all thisdoesnt it  young man said the captain regarding jeff with an almost stern look if a savage were taken into a factory and shown the whirling wheels and bands and rollers working in all directions and saw filthy old rags boiled and mixed up with grass and evilsmelling substances and torn to shreds and reduced to pulp in the midst of dirt and clattering noise and apparent confusion and if that savage were to say surely nothin good can come out of all this wouldnt youknowin that great rolls of fair and spotless paper were to come out of itpronounce that savage a fool or at least a presumptuous fellow  true captain i accept the rebuke said jeff with a short laugh and a swift glance at rose who however was gazing demurely at her teacup as if lost in the contemplation of its pattern  possibly she was thinking of the absurdity of taking tea at all at such an hour  well then jeff continued the captain dont you go and judge unfinished work  perfect men and women are in this world only in process of manufacture  when you see them finished youll be better able to judge of the process  jeff did not quite agree with his friend for gazing at rose he could not help feeling that at least one woman had to his mind been almost perfectly finished even here  however he said nothing  at this point the conversation was turned by miss millet suddenly recalling to mind her brothers generous friend in china  you have no idea dick how much good i have been able to do with that money  of course it could not pay for the swimmingbath or the church or but here i have a note of it all  she pulled a soiled red notebook from her pocket and was about to refer to it when she was arrested by the grave sad expression that had overspread her brothers countenance  ah molly he said dear clara nibsworth was dying when i last saw her and i fear her father wont survive her long  you remember i told you the poor girl was delicate and her father old and the excitement and exertion of that night of the fire was too much for both of them when i arrived this time in china i took a run up to their place to see them and found clara almost at the point of death  i had little time to spare and meant to have returned the next day but the poor brokendown father entreated me so earnestly to remain that i at last agreed to spend three days wi them  durin that time i read the bible a good deal to the poor girl and found that she had got her feet firm on the rock of ages  she was very grateful poor thing and i never saw one so unselfish  she had little thought about herself although dyin and in great sufferin  her chief anxiety was about her old father and what he would do when she was gone  it was impossible for me to stay to the end for no one could guess how long the poor thing would hold out  i did my best to comfort the father and then i left bringing away a kind message to you my poor rosebud  she seems to have loved you dearly and said you were very kind to her at school  rose had covered her face with her hands and with difficulty restrained her tears  but you said the doctors had some hope father didnt you she asked  no darling the doctors had noneno more had i  it was her poor father who hoped against hope  death was written on her sweet face and it could not be far off  i doubt not she is now with the lord  when i was leaving she gave me a small packet for you but that with everything else in the north star has gone to the bottom  but we must be goin now continued the captain rising  i see jeff is gettin weariedan no wonder  besides it wont do to keep you two up here talkin till daylight  jeff protested that he was not wearythat in such company it was impossible for him to tire but rose was too much distressed by her fathers narrative to observe the compliment  still in spite of his protest there was something in our heros manner and look which belied his words and when he returned to the coastguard station that day and was about to lie down for muchneeded repose his friend and mate david bowers was surprised to see him turn deadly pale stagger and fall on his bed in a state of insensibility  hallo  jeff whats wrong exclaimed bowers starting up seizing his friends arm and giving him a shake for he was much puzzled  to see a man knocked into a state of insensibility was nothing new or unfamiliar to bowers but to see a powerful young fellow like jeff go off in a fainting fit like a woman was quite out of his experience  jeff however remained deaf to his mates hallo and when at last a doctor was fetched it was found that he had been seriously injured insomuch that the medical man stood amazed when he heard how he had walked several miles and sat up for several hours after his exertions and accident at the wreck  that medical man you see happened to be an old bachelor and probably did not know what love can accomplish  i very much fear he said to captain millet after inspecting his patient that the poor fellow has received some bad internal injuries the mast or whatever it was must have struck him a tremendous blow for his side is severely bruised and two of his ribs are broken  pretty tough ribs to break too remarked the captain with a look of profound distress  you are right returned the doctor remarkably tough but not quite fitted to withstand such a powerful batteringram as the mainmast of a sixhundredton barque  now doctor whats to be done with him  you see the poor young fellow is not only my friend but he has saved my life so i feel bound to look well after him and this isnt quite the sort o place to be ill in he added looking round the somewhat bare apartment whose walls were adorned with carbines and cutlasses  the wisest thing for him to do is to go into hospital where he will receive the best of medical treatment and careful nursing  wouldnt the nursing of an old lady that loves him like a mother and a comfortable cottage do as well  no doubt it would said the doctor with a smile if he also had proper medical attendance  just so  well thats all settled then interrupted the captain ill have him removed at once and youll attend him doctorwho betterthat is if you can spare the time  the doctor was quite ready to spare the time and the captain bustled off to tell his sister what was in store for her and to order rosebud to pack up and return to school without delay so as to make room for the patient  great was his astonishment that his rosebud burst into tears on receiving the news  my bud my darling dont cry he said tenderly drawing the fair head to his rugged bosom  i know it must be a great disappointment to have a week cut off your holidays but ill go down to folkestone with you an take a lodging there an you an i will have a jolly time of it togethertill i get another ship  oh father its not that exclaimed poor rose almost indignantly itsits  not being able to explain exactly what it was that ailed her she took refuge in another flood of tears  oh she thought to herself if i might only stay and nurse him but she blushed at the very thought for she was well aware that she knew no more about scientific nursing than a tortoiseshell cat  three months of the most tender and careful nursing by miss millet failed however to set jeffrey benson on his legs  he was very patient and courageous hope was strong and he listened with approval and gratitude to his nurses teachings  there came a day however which tried him  you think me not much better doctor he asked somewhat anxiously  not much returned the doctor in a low tender tone and i fear that you must make up your mind never again to be quite the same man you were  never again exclaimed the youth in startled surprise  the doctor said nothing but his look wasnever again    chapter six  good news to the captainalso to jeff  there is a period probably in the life of every man when a feeling akin to despair creeps over him and the natural tendency of his heart to rebel against his maker becomes unquestionable  there may be some on whom this epoch descends gentlyothers perhaps who may even question whether they have met with it at all but there must be many of whom jeff was one on whom it comes like a thunderbolt scathing for a time all the finer qualities of heart and mind  if it had only come at a later period of life or in some other form auntie he said one day as he lay on a sofa at the open window of the cottage looking out upon the sea but to be bowled over at my age when the world was all before me and i was so well ablephysically at leastto fight my way  it is terrible and seems so outrageous  what good can possibly come of rendering a young man helplessa strong capable machine that might do so much good in the world useless  he spoke in an almost querulous tone and looked inquiringly in his nurses face  it did not occur to the youth as he looked at her that the weakbodied soft and gentle creature herself had been and still was doing more good to the world than a hundred young men such as he  miss millets face was a wholesome one to look into  she did not shake her head and look solemn or shocked  neither did she laugh at his petulance  she merely said with the sweetest of little smiles you may live jeff to be a very useful machine yet if not quite as strong as you werethough even that is uncertain for doctors are fallible you know  never forget that jeffdoctors are fallible besides your living at all shows that god has something for you to do for him  nonsense auntie  if that is true of me it is just as true of hundreds of men who live and die without making the smallest attempt to accomplish any work for god  yet he lets them live for many years  quite true returned miss millet and god has work for all these men to do though many of them refuse to do it  but i feel sure that that wont be your case jeff  he finds work just suited to our capacitiesat the time we need it too if we are only willing  why in my own very case has he not sent you to me to be nursed just as i had finished organising the new nightclasses for the usherboys and i was puzzledabsolutely puzzledas to what i should do next and here you step in requiring my assistance and giving me full employment  thats itthats it returned jeff hastily  i am without means and a burden on you and captain millet  oh it is hardvery hard  yes indeed it is hard to bear  of course that is what you mean for as god has done it we cannot suppose anything that he does is really hard  if your illness had been the result of dissipation now or through your own fault you could not have said exactly it was gods doing but when it was the result of noble selfsacrifice  come come auntie dont make me more vain than i am  im bad enough as it is andandim very weary  the poor youths head fell back on the pillow and he sighed deeply as his nurse brought him some strengthening food  he needed it much for he was reduced to a mere shadow of his former self  his fine eyes had become quite awful in their size and solemnity  his once ruddy cheeks were hollow  his wellformed nose had become pinched and his garments hung on rather than clothed a huge skeleton  during all jeffs illness captain millet was unremitting in his attentions insomuch that a certain careworn expression began to take up its settled abode on his countenance  but this was not altogether owing to sympathy with his friend it was partly the consequence of his financial affairs  having lost his situation as he had expected he found it difficult to procure another and was under the necessity of living on the small capital which he had accumulated in the course of laborious years  had his own subsistence been all his care he would have had little trouble but rose had to be supported and educated his sister had to be assisted his charities had to be kept up and now jeff benson had to be maintained and his doctor paid  the worst of it all was that he could not talk on the subject to any of the three which to a sympathetic soul was uncommonly hardbut unavoidable  yes quite unavoidable he muttered to himself one evening when alone in his lodging  they think im a rich old fellow but i darent say a word  if i did jeff would refuse to eat another bite an that would kill him  if i told rosebud it could do no good and would only make her miserable  if i told molly ii really dont know what shed do shed founder i think  no i must go on sailin under false colours its a comfort anyhow to know that the funds will last some little time yet even at the present rate of expenditure but its perplexin very  he shook his head wrinkled his brows and then rising took a wellworn pocketbible from a shelf and sought consolation therein  some time after that captain millet was seated in the same room about the same hour meditating on the same subject with a few additional wrinkles on his brow when he received a letter  from hong kong he muttered opening it and putting on his glasses  the changes in his expressive face as he read were striking and might have been instructive  sadness firstthen surprisethen blazing astonishmentthen a pursing of the mouth and a prolonged whistle followed by an expressive slap on the thigh  then crumpling the letter into his pocket he put on his glazed hat sallied forth and took the way to his sisters cottage  at that cottage about the same time a great change had taken place in jeff bensonspiritually not physically though even in the latter respect he was at all events not worse than usual  having gone from bad to worse in his rebellion he had at last reached that lowest depth wherein he not only despaired of the doctors power to cure him and his own power of constitution but began silently and in his own mind to charge his maker with having made a complete failure in his creation  life is a muddle auntie altogether he exclaimed when he reached this point  it was the lowest ebbhopeless despair alike of himself and his god  a muddle jeff said the little woman raising her eyebrows slightly how can that be possible in the work of a perfect creator and a perfect saviour who redeems from all evilyour supposed muddle included  our young coastguardsman was silent  it was probably the great turningpoint when the holy spirit opened his eyes to see jesus and all things in relation to him  for a long time he did not speak  the lips of his nurse were also silent but her heart was not so  at last jeff spoke  it must be so  perfection is bound to work out perfection  this apparent evil must be for good  he doeth all things well  surely i have read that somewhere  in a low clear voice his nurse said    he doeth all things well   we say it now with tears   but we shall sing it with those we love   through bright eternal years  i think the light is dawning auntie  i am sure it is jeff  again they were silent and thus they remained while the natural light faded until the western sky and sea were dyed in crimson  the first thing that diverted their thoughts was a quick step outside then a thunderous knock at the door and next moment the captain stood before them beaming with excitement panting heavily and quite unable for some minutes to talk coherently  sister said he at last sit down an listen  jeff open your ears  he drew a crumpled letter from his pocket spread it on his knee put on his glasses and read as follows  my dear captain millet  you will i know be grieved though not surprised to hear that your old friend nibsworth is dead  poor fellow his end came much as you and i had anticipated when we last parted  he followed his dear clara about two months after her death  i suppose you know that she died three days after you left their house  my object in writing just now however is to convey to you a piece of good news namely that nibsworth has left you the whole of his property which altogether cannot amount to less i should think than eighty thousand pounds  at this point the captain paused and looked over his glasses at his sister who with wideopen eyes exclaimed  brother he must be joking  sister returned the captain my friend never jokes except when in extremely congenial society and then his jokes are badso bad as to be unworthy of repetition  wonderful exclaimed miss millet  singular murmured jeff whose thoughts seemed to be engaged with some faroff prospect  he goes on continued the captain reading i am left the sole executor of his affairs  pray therefore write as to what you wish done  i am not at present conversant with the precise duties of an executor but of course i will get the best advice possible in the circumstances and do the best i can  i would recommend you to do the same at your end of the world and let me have your instructions as soon as possible  the enclosed statement will show you the nature of your property  the greater part you will observe is in hard cash  i may add that the house and grounds here would sell well at present if you feel inclined to dispose of them  in conclusion allow me to congratulate you on this piece of good fortuneperhaps knowing your character so well i should have written this good gift from god  ay my friend said the captain folding the letter you might have written this unexpected and undeserved gift from god  but now molly what think ye of it all  wonderful exclaimed the good lady in reply and beyond this word she seemed unable to go for a time save that after a strong mental effort she varied it to amazing  suddenly she seemed to recover and said with a quick earnest look  dick what are you going to do  do exclaimed captain millet smiting his knee and looking from his sister to jeff with a broad smile  ill run up to london an take a mansion in the west end call at long acre in passing and buy a carriage and four  then ill run down to folkestone an buy a villa there or a castle if they have one in stock if not ill order one o the newest pattern with gas water electricity and steam laid on after that ill buy a steamyacht and take a trip round the world so as to calm my brain and think over it  of course ill drop in at hong kong in passing to have a look at my property and then  hush brother dont run on with such nonsense when we ought to be only filled with serious thoughts  how can a man be filled with serious thoughts molly when a sort of arabian nights affair has tumbled on him all of a suddentook him aback like a white squall and thrown him on his beamends  and what a selfish fellow you are too said jeff not one word in all you propose to do about anybody except yourselfno mention even of rosebud  pooh  jeff are you so green as not to know that a wise man never puts his best foot foremost  dont you know that it is usual when a man makes a speech to keep tumblin out one point after anotherclinkin em all as he goes alonguntil he comes to the last but not least point  if you had let me alone molly i was comin to rosebud and yourself too but as youve been so unmannerly ill keep these points till another time  by the way when you write to rosebud not a word about all this  it might unsettle the darlin with her lessons  an that reminds me that one o my first businesses will be to have her supplied wi the best of teachersfrench italian spanish german mastersgreek an hebrew an dutch ones too if the dear child wants emto say nothin o dancin an drawin an calisthenics an mathematics an the use o the globes an conundrums o that sort  really brother if you go on like this ill begin to think your good fortune as you call it has turned your brain  never fear molly when i come to say what im going to do about the little church an the nightclasses an the soupkitchens and the modelhouses and the swimmingbath youll whistle another tune  but come jeff its time to ask how you are gettin along  you look better my boy  i am better captainmuch much better returned the youth with a flushed cheek and sparkling eye for i too have got news this morning of a fortune which exceeds yours in value and the security is better  the captain was puzzled  a fortune jeff  yes but my news will keep  you are too much excited to hear about it just now  enough to say that i am much better  now if you are wise you will go without delay and take some steps about this affair  youre right lad returned the captain rising quietly and clapping on his hat so goodbye to ee both  ill soon be back  at present im off to consult mymysolicitor though i dont know who he is yet more than the man in the moon    chapter seven  an unquiet adventurous morning in the shellcave  i think said jeff benson one fine morning as he got up and stretched himself that i feel well enough today to get down to the shore without assistance  you know auntie i shall never be able to walk alone if i give way to laziness and lean so much on others  im like the babies now and must be encouraged to try it on my own hook  he looked at miss millet with a halfpitiful smile for there was something woefully true in his words and his good little nurse found it necessary to go in search of the household keys for a minute or so before answering  well jeff perhaps you are right and the day is splendidsunny calm and warmso you wont be likely to catch cold  only dont go far for you might become tired out  so promise that you wont go far and then i will let you go  jeff promised but of course he did not do exactly as his nurse wished for in such circumstances the word far has a wonderfully varied significance  at first leaning on his stick and pausing frequently to recover strength he made his way to the shore but when there the invigorating air and the exhilarating sound of ripples on the sand and a rest on the rocks made him feel so much better that he thought he might walk the length of the shellcave without breaking his promise  he tried and succeeded but was so fatigued when at length he threw himself on the soft sand at the caves mouth that he felt uneasy about getting home again  the shellcave was a favourite nook in a lonely part of the cliffs which jeff had been wont to frequent in his coastguard days especially at that particular time when he seemed to expect the revival of the smuggling traffic near miss millets cottage  he had frequently spoken of it to rose as a beautiful spot where innumerable seashells were to be found and had once taken her to see it  it was as we have said a lonely spot far removed from the fishing town and was sought out by jeff because he did not yet feel strong enough to hold much intercourse with his friends and former matesnone of whom had seen him since his illness began  but the poor invalid was doomed to several interruptions that day  the first comer was his comrade wilson of the coastguard whose place he had taken on the eventful night of the wreck  on rounding the point of rock and coming suddenly on our hero that worthy was struck dumb and motionless for at least a minute while his eyes gradually opened wide with surprise and his mouth partially followed suit  not jeff benson said wilson at last in quite a solemn tone  whats left of him answered jeff with a faint smile  an it aint much returned wilson with a kind of gasp as he approached softly  not much more than the bones an clothes said jeff with a laugh at his friends expression also he added more seriously a good deal of the spirit thank god  how are all the lads wilson  the man tried to answer but could not  the sight of his old stalwart chum so reduced was too much for him  he could only go down on one knee and take the thin large hand in his  seeing this jeff returned his squeeze and relieved him by saying  you can beat me now wilson but i could squeeze till i made you howl once and mayhap ill do it againwho knows  but you must not think me unkind if i ask you to leave me wilson  the doctor is always insisting that i must keep quiet so goodday to you my boy an remember me kindly to my comrades  the next visitor who appeared half an hour later was the terrier dog of the station  bounce belonged of right to david bowers but being amiable it acknowledged the partownership of all the men  on suddenly beholding jeff it rushed at him with a mingled bark and squeal of joy and thereafter for full two minutes danced round him a mass of wriggling hair from tip of tail to snout in uncontrollable ecstasy mingled misery and surprise at jeffs sudden and unaccountable disappearance prolonged agonies of disappointed expectation the sickness of heart resulting from hope long deferred all were forgotten in that supreme moment of joy at reunion with his longlost human friend  jeff had to rise and sit down on a shelf of rock to escape some of bounces overwhelming affection  presently bounces owner appeared and went through something of a similar performancehumanised however and with more of dignity  i cant tell ee how glad i am to see you again jeff said bowers sitting down beside him and grasping his hand  but oh man how thin  the huge coastguardsman choked at this point as wilson had done before him but being more ready of resource he turned it into a cough and declared sternly that nightwork must have given him a cold or suthin o that sort  after which he made a great demonstration of clearing his throat and blowing his nose  but youll soon be yoursat least somethin like your old self before long jeff  the doctor told us that the last time he was at the station  if god wills returned jeff softly i am in his hands and willing to be what he chooses  you remember david the talk we once had about miss millets argument that god brings good out of evil  i didnt believe it then i believe it now  ive bin to school since i last saw you david and ive learned a good lesson for i can say from my heart it has been good for me that i was afflicted  bowers did not reply but looked at his friend with an expression of puzzled surprise  yes continued jeff with rising enthusiasm i have lost my health the doctor thinks permanently  ive lost the strength that i used to be so proud of and with it the hope of being able to make a living in any active line of life and ive lost much more besides  but what i have found in my saviour far more than makes up for it all  in the much more besides poor jeff mentally referred to his loss of all hope of ever gaining the hand of rose millet for if his chance seemed small before how immeasurably was it reduced now that his health was shattered and his power even of supporting himself gone  no he felt that that door was closedthat he must avoid the girl as much as possible in future and above all be particularly careful not to fall in love with her  of course it was only a passing fancy as yet and like fruit would never ripen unless the sun shone  he would avoid the sunshine  meanwhile of all these rapidly fleeting thoughts he said never a word to his friend david bowers but after a little more conversation begged him also to go away and let him rest  all very good friend jeff but what if the sun should shine in spite of you  just about that time in the course of his eager and somewhat erratic wanderings among solicitors and other men of business captain millet made a sudden pause and by way of taking breath rushed down to folkestone brought rose up to cranby hired a dogcart and drove along the sands at low tide in the direction of his sisters cottage  i think it probable that you may see him today rosebud he said though im not quite sure for the doctor is afraid of a relapse and friends are not yet allowed to visit him  to be sure bein only a little girl you probably wouldnt disturb him at allspecially if you didnt speak  anyhow youll see auntie which will be more to the purpose  father said rose whose name seemed remarkably appropriate at that moment i should like to get down here and walk the rest of the way by the time i arrive youll have had a little talk with poor jeff and auntie  besides there is a pretty cave that i used to gather shells in when i was last here  i would like so much to pay it a visit in passing  of course the captain had no objection and thus it came to pass that jeffs fourth visitor on that unquiet morning was the rosebud  how feeble are written words to convey ideas at times  if you could have obtained one glance of rose and jeff at that moment reader words would not be required  no peony ever blushed like that roseto say nothing of the blank amazement in those wide blue eyes  jeff still seated on the rock became petrified  recovering first as women always do rose hurried forward withim so glad mr  but there she stopped abruptly for the unexpected sight of that stalwart coastguardsman reduced to a big skeleton with pale face hollow cheeks cavernous eyes and an oldman stoop was too much for her  she covered her face with her hands and burst into tears  what could jeff do  he forgot his prudent resolves  he forgot his weakness because his strength seemed to have suddenly returned  he sprang up intending to comfort the poor girl in a brotherly sort of way  somehowhe never could clearly remember howhe had her seated on the rock beside him with his arm round her waist and her head on his shoulder  a few moments laterhe never could tell how manythe wickedness of his conduct came down upon jeff like a thunderbolt  he removed his arm drew away from her about three inches and looked in her surprised face with a solemn selfcondemned expression  forgive me rose he said in the deep hollow voice which had become natural to him since his illness began my love for you proved too strong to be restrained just now but believe me i had fully made up my mind never to open my lips to you on the subject for what right have i a helpless and i fear hopeless invalid to dare to aspire  there must have been something peculiar in the very slight almost pathetic smile which overspread the tearful face of rose at that moment for the arm was suddenly replaced the three inches were reduced to nothing the fair head again rested on the once stalwart shoulder and thus they remained until the cavern was filled with the sounds  hi  ho  hallo  roserosebud ahoy  that girl would worry any man to death  where are you  hi  ship ahoy  hallooo  we need scarcely remark that rose did not wait for the last stentorian halloo  bounding from her lovers side she ran to meet her fatherred at first and then paleexclaiming oh father ive found him  found who child  jeffi mean mister  not dead exclaimed the captain interrupting with awful solemnity  he was answered by the invalid himself coming out of the cavern and wishing him goodmorning with a confused and guilty air  well now said captain millet after a moments pause while he glanced from the one to the other this beats the polar regions all to sticks and stivers  rose my dear you go round the pint an wait by the dogcart till i come to ee  so young man he said turning sternly to jeff youve bin cruisin after my little girl without leave  i am guilty captain millet said jeff humbly but not intentionally so  long ago when i learned that there was no hope of recovering my old strength i had determined to give up all thoughts of dear rose but i was taken by surprise this morningwas off my guardand i confess wickedly took advantage of my opportunity to tell her how dearly i loved her  yet it was done under a sudden irresistible impulse  i do not excuse myself  i would give worlds to undo the evil i may have done but after all it may be undone  rose may have mistaken her extreme sympathy and pity for love  if so she will not suffer much or long indeed now i think of it she wont suffer at all except regret at having been led to raise false hopes in my breast  the mere thought of this was so depressing that jeff who was already almost worn out with excitement leaned heavily on his stick for support  jeff returned the captain severely how could you do it  i hardly know rejoined jeff feeling something of the old adam rising in his breast but my intentions were honourable whatever my conduct may have been under impulse and strong temptation  perhaps i might appeal to your own experience  have you never done that which you did not mean to under the power of impulse  youve hit me there boy below the waterline said the captain relaxing a little for i not only put the question to my old woman without leave but carried her off with flyin colours against orders but it came all right at last though i didnt deserve it  however jeff youve no need to look so blue  my little girl has raised no false hopes in your breast  moreover let me tell you for your comfort that i saw the doctor this morning and he says that your constitution is so strong that youre in a fair way to pull through in spite of him and that youll be fit for good service yetthough not exactly what you were before  so keep up your heart jeff  never say die and you shall wed my rosebud yet as sure as my names dick millet  there was need for these words of comfort for the poor youth was obliged to sit down on the sand for a few minutes to recover strength  ive had a pretty stiff morning altogether captain he said apologetically but im thankfulvery thankfulfor the succession of events that have brought me to this happy hour  and yet jeff said the captain sitting down beside him you and i thought these eventsthe wreck and the loss of employment and the overturning o the lifeboat and the thump on the ribs and the long illnessnothing but misfortunes and full of evil at first  there im not goin to draw no moral  i never was good at that  come now if youve rested enough well up anchor and away  ive got a dogcart beatin off an on round the pint there an my rosebud will be gettin impatient  this was truerose was becoming not only impatient but anxious  when however she saw her father and lover approach all her anxieties vanished    chapter eight  conclusion of the whole matter  the wonderworking power of time is proverbial  behold jeffrey benson once again looking like his old self at the hospitable board of miss millet  it is an occasion of importance  opposite to her sits her brother  jeff is on her right hand  on the left sits roseprettier brighter and more womanly than ever  a gold circlet on one of the fingers of her left hand proclaims a great fact  a happy smile on her face proves that her confidence has not been misplaced  jeff is nearly as stout and strong as he ever was of his severe illness scarcely a trace remains  the doctor does not know what it was and it is not to be expected that we should know  sufficient for us to state the fact that it is gone  but our hero is not now a coastguardsman  listen and the captain will explain why  molly my dear another cup of your superb tea to web my whistle before i begin  it ought to be good for i know the man that grew it and the firm through which it came  well now both you and rosebud will natrally want to know about the situation which ive obtained for jeff  youll be surprised to hear that he is now secretary of state to king richard longpurse  in other words interrupted jeff with a laugh your brother thinks  if you think sir interrupted the captain in his turn that king richard cannot explain matters in his own words you had better say so at once and i will abdicate in your favour  go on sirei submit said jeff  well then molly i was about to say when my secretary interrupted me that he and i have at last come to an agreement  after much explanation i have got him to understand that a king cannot possibly manage all his own affairs with his own hands and that i am forced to have a secretary who can at least do the three rs pretty well  you see although my edication has not been neglected it still remains a fact that i cant read without specs that in cipherin i am slowslow though sureand that in the matter of penmanship i am neither swift nor legible  therefore seein that in such things i dont differ much from other kings and great men jeff has generously consented to refuse the lucrative sitooation under goverment with nothin partiklar to do which has been offered to him and to accept the secretary of stateship now at the disposal of king richard who will give him at least as good a salary as government and at the same time keep his nose closer to the grindstone  oh  jeff said rosebud at this point shaking her finger at her husband i knew there was something in the wind  my child remarked the captain there is always something in the wind  according to the best authorities you may count on findin oxygen nitrogen and carbonicacid gases in itnot to mention foreign substances at times such as dust leaves bits of old newspaper and the like except at sea where it is always pure and good  but with plenty of salt in it interposed miss millet though not enough to cure you of bad habits brother  come now tell us really what you mean  well sister what i really mean is this that the fortune which has been sent to me is far too big for one pair of hands and one brain to manage so my soninlaw has agreed to help meand the labourer you know is worthy of his hire  surely i dont need to explain the meaning of that text to you  since we last conversed in this room on the disposal of my surplus funds jeff and i have had many a long talk and walk together  moreover i have kept the young secretarys nose so tight to the grindstone for some months past that he has produced results which will i think interestit may be even surpriseyou  before going further continued the captain pushing in his cup lets have some more o that brew to wet my whistle  well you will be pleased to hear that i have changed my mind about the carriage and four and the mansion in belgravia and the castle at folkestone and the steamyachtgiven em all up and decided to come here an live quietly beside you sister  are you in earnest brother asked miss millet with sparkling eyes  never more in earnest in my life but get out your plans an papers secretary an explain em  jeff rose left the room and returned with a businesslike bundle of papers which he untied and arranged on the table before him  taking up one he said  this is a list of the poor people in cranby in whom miss millet has been accustomed to take special interest  the first on the list is old susan jenkins  my dear old woman who has been bedridden so long and in such terrible poverty asked miss millet  the same answered jeff  captain millet has succeeded in getting her admission into the hospital for incurables  we have only just received intimation of the appointment and as the old woman does not know of it yet we thought it best to let you be the bearer of the news  oh brother exclaimed miss millet clasping her hands in delight she knew now that the captain was in earnest for he would sooner have cut off his own hand than trifle with her feelings  go on secretary cried the captain taking a considerable swig of tea an dont you interrupt molly else well never get through  the next name is martha brand  what ragged little martha exclaimed miss millet  the same  a new rigout has been ordered for martha and she is to be sent to school  joe puncheon better known as vagabond joe has been apprenticed to a carpenterby his own special desireand goes to work on monday next in a suit of suitable clothes  come sir none o that in business hours cried the captain and heave that list overboard  it would take us half the night to get through with it  come to the plans sir open the plans  putting aside the list the obedient secretary took up a large document and unfolding it spread it on the table  this said jeff with businesslike gravity is a plan of the cranby swimming bath  the coast near the town being rocky and in many ways inconvenient for bathing seawater is to be pumped into this bath daily by a steamengine  a professor of swimming is appointed to give gratuitous instruction in his art  the bath is to be in two partsone for ladies one for gentlemenand will have dressingboxes all round besides divingboards and every sort of convenience  at certain hours of the morning and evening it will be open free of charge to all comers so that there will be no excuse for any man woman or child in cranby being dirty or unable to swim  what a blessing it would be exclaimed the enthusiastic miss millet if such baths existed all over the kingdom  it is a disgrace to the kingdom said jeff that a bath such as this does not exist in every town of the kingdom  a mere tithe of the money wasted on drink and tobacco and tea muttered the captain pushing in his cup for more would suffice to do it  come jeff clap a stopper on your longwinded lectures and go ahead wi the next plan said the captain and dont moralise if you can help it  but brother can you afford all this asked miss millet  afford it  of course i can  its wonderful molly what men can afford when theyre willing to spend  why ive known a man myself who was so uncommon willin to spend that he ruined his baker an butcher an greengrocer before he had done spendin  if thats so with them as hasnt got money to spend surely its for a man like me to do so whos rollin in four thousand a year more or less  besides im goin to invest some o the capital in a way thatll pay back three or four hundred per cent interest  im not goin to leave it all to my rosebud a reasonable provision she shall havenot more  you see molly im of opinion that whatever a man haswhether he makes it by the use of his talents or inherits it from his father or has it sent to him unexpected like minehe holds it all in trust to be used for the glory of god and the good of men  now cut along secretary  this said jeff is the plan of the peoples free library  the purchase of the site was effected last week and the building is to be commenced next month  ay and the prince of wales is coming to lay the foundation stone cried the captain leastwise ive asked him to do it and no doubt hell come if hes got time  but look here molly he added becoming impatient and opening out all the plans at oncehere youve got the lecturehall an the gymnasium an the church an the ragged school all shipshapean what dye think this is  explain it secretary  this is a plan of two cottages exactly the shape and size of this one in which we sit but with a few more rooms and outhouses behind  the empty space between them represents the site of this cottage  the one on the right is intended for captain millet  that on the left for  for the secretary and his wife cried the captain again taking up the discourse  an look here what dye think the double lines in pencil tween your cottage an mine means  a washhouse perhaps  a washus repeated the captain with contempt  no thats a passage from one house to the other so as you an i can visit comfortably in wet weather  theres a door in the middle with two locks one on each side so that if either of us should chance to be in the dumps weve got only to turn the key on our own side  but the passage aint in the plan you see  its only a suggestion  then rosebud what dye think that thing is atop of my cottage  itit looks like aa pepperbox replied rose with some hesitation  pepperbox repeated the captain in disgust why its a plateglass outlook where i can sweep the horizon with my glass all round an smoke my pipe in peace and comfort and sometimes have you up my girl to have a chat about old times  but thats not all molly  heres a letter which you can put in your pocket an read at your leisure  it says that the tin mine in which you have shares has become so prosperous that you could sell at ten or twenty times the price of your original shares soyou see you are independent of me altogether as to your livelihood  now old girl what dye think of all that  the captain threw himself back in his chair wiped his brow and looked at his sister with an air of thorough satisfaction  i think returned miss millet slowly that god has been very good to us all  he has sister he has and yet the beginning of it all did not seem very promising  the captain cast a glance at jeff as he spoke  the youth met the glance with a candid smile  i know what you think father he said  you and i are agreed on that point now  i admit that what appears to be evil may be made to work for good  true jeff returned the captain but i have lived long enough to see also that the opposite holds goodthat things which are questionably good in themselves sometimes work out what appears to be evil  for instance i have known a poor respectable man become suddenly and unexpectedly rich and the result was that he went in for extravagant expenditure and dissipation which ended in his ruin  but that said miss millet quickly was because he did not accept the gift as from god to be used in his service but misused it  true molly true and such will be my fate if i am not kept by the holy spirit from misusing what has been given to me  the rosebud opened not her lips only her ears while this conversation was going on but the next day seated on a stool at jeffs feet with her fair little hands clasped on his knee and looking up in his kind manly face she said  i wonder jeff what auntie would say if instead of working out such pleasant consequences to us all these things had ended only in what we term disaster and bad luck and poverty and deathas happens so often to many people  i wonder too my rosebud returned jeff  suppose we go and put the question to her  accordingly they went and found the quiet old lady busy as usual knitting socks for the poor  now auntie said jeff after stating the question if everything had turned out apparently ill for usaccording to what men usually call illwould you still hold that everything had really turned out well  certainly i would jeff on the simple ground that god is good and cannot err though he has many and strange methods of bringing about his ends  you can prove it by taking an extreme case  go to one of the early martyrs who lost not only property and health and friends and liberty but finally his life at the stake  the unbelievers view would be that everything had gone against him his own view that god had put on him great honour in counting him worthy to suffer and die for jesus and you could not doubt his sincerity when you heard his hymns of praise on the way to the stakeay even in the fire  then whatever happensgood or badauntie said rose you would say all is well  i would believe it dear whether i had courage to say it or not  if strength were given i would certainly acquiesce and say thy will be done  amen  long may we live to say that molly said captain millet entering the cottage at that moment  and the captains prayer was granted for he and mollyand the excoastguardsman with his rosebud lived many a year after that to see the completion of the swimmingbath and the peoples library and the gymnasium and the evening classes and the model houses etcetera and to experience the truth of that blessed word which tells us that all things work together for good to them that love god  the end
