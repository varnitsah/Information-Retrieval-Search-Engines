63259287	pygmalion  bernard shaw  1912  transcribers note in the printed version of this text all apostrophes for contractions such as cant wouldnt and hed were omitted to read as cant wouldnt and hed this etext edition restores the omitted apostrophes      preface to pygmalion  a professor of phonetics  as will be seen later on pygmalion needs not a preface but a sequel which i have supplied in its due place the english have no respect for their language and will not teach their children to speak it they spell it so abominably that no man can teach himself what it sounds like it is impossible for an englishman to open his mouth without making some other englishman hate or despise him german and spanish are accessible to foreigners english is not accessible even to englishmen the reformer england needs today is an energetic phonetic enthusiast that is why i have made such a one the hero of a popular play there have been heroes of that kind crying in the wilderness for many years past when i became interested in the subject towards the end of the eighteenseventies melville bell was dead but alexander j ellis was still a living patriarch with an impressive head always covered by a velvet skull cap for which he would apologize to public meetings in a very courtly manner he and tito pagliardini another phonetic veteran were men whom it was impossible to dislike henry sweet then a young man lacked their sweetness of character he was about as conciliatory to conventional mortals as ibsen or samuel butler his great ability as a phonetician he was i think the best of them all at his job would have entitled him to high official recognition and perhaps enabled him to popularize his subject but for his satanic contempt for all academic dignitaries and persons in general who thought more of greek than of phonetics once in the days when the imperial institute rose in south kensington and joseph chamberlain was booming the empire i induced the editor of a leading monthly review to commission an article from sweet on the imperial importance of his subject when it arrived it contained nothing but a savagely derisive attack on a professor of language and literature whose chair sweet regarded as proper to a phonetic expert only the article being libelous had to be returned as impossible and i had to renounce my dream of dragging its author into the limelight when i met him afterwards for the first time for many years i found to my astonishment that he who had been a quite tolerably presentable young man had actually managed by sheer scorn to alter his personal appearance until he had become a sort of walking repudiation of oxford and all its traditions it must have been largely in his own despite that he was squeezed into something called a readership of phonetics there the future of phonetics rests probably with his pupils who all swore by him but nothing could bring the man himself into any sort of compliance with the university to which he nevertheless clung by divine right in an intensely oxonian way i daresay his papers if he has left any include some satires that may be published without too destructive results fifty years hence he was i believe not in the least an illnatured man very much the opposite i should say but he would not suffer fools gladly  those who knew him will recognize in my third act the allusion to the patent shorthand in which he used to write postcards and which may be acquired from a four and sixpenny manual published by the clarendon press the postcards which mrs higgins describes are such as i have received from sweet i would decipher a sound which a cockney would represent by zerr and a frenchman by seu and then write demanding with some heat what on earth it meant sweet with boundless contempt for my stupidity would reply that it not only meant but obviously was the word result as no other word containing that sound and capable of making sense with the context existed in any language spoken on earth that less expert mortals should require fuller indications was beyond sweets patience therefore though the whole point of his current shorthand is that it can express every sound in the language perfectly vowels as well as consonants and that your hand has to make no stroke except the easy and current ones with which you write m n and u l p and q scribbling them at whatever angle comes easiest to you his unfortunate determination to make this remarkable and quite legible script serve also as a shorthand reduced it in his own practice to the most inscrutable of cryptograms his true objective was the provision of a full accurate legible script for our noble but illdressed language but he was led past that by his contempt for the popular pitman system of shorthand which he called the pitfall system the triumph of pitman was a triumph of business organization there was a weekly paper to persuade you to learn pitman there were cheap textbooks and exercise books and transcripts of speeches for you to copy and schools where experienced teachers coached you up to the necessary proficiency sweet could not organize his market in that fashion he might as well have been the sybil who tore up the leaves of prophecy that nobody would attend to the four and sixpenny manual mostly in his lithographed handwriting that was never vulgarly advertized may perhaps some day be taken up by a syndicate and pushed upon the public as the times pushed the encyclopaedia britannica but until then it will certainly not prevail against pitman i have bought three copies of it during my lifetime and i am informed by the publishers that its cloistered existence is still a steady and healthy one i actually learned the system two several times and yet the shorthand in which i am writing these lines is pitmans and the reason is that my secretary cannot transcribe sweet having been perforce taught in the schools of pitman therefore sweet railed at pitman as vainly as thersites railed at ajax his raillery however it may have eased his soul gave no popular vogue to current shorthand pygmalion higgins is not a portrait of sweet to whom the adventure of eliza doolittle would have been impossible still as will be seen there are touches of sweet in the play with higginss physique and temperament sweet might have set the thames on fire as it was he impressed himself professionally on europe to an extent that made his comparative personal obscurity and the failure of oxford to do justice to his eminence a puzzle to foreign specialists in his subject i do not blame oxford because i think oxford is quite right in demanding a certain social amenity from its nurslings heaven knows it is not exorbitant in its requirements for although i well know how hard it is for a man of genius with a seriously underrated subject to maintain serene and kindly relations with the men who underrate it and who keep all the best places for less important subjects which they profess without originality and sometimes without much capacity for them still if he overwhelms them with wrath and disdain he cannot expect them to heap honors on him  of the later generations of phoneticians i know little among them towers the poet laureate to whom perhaps higgins may owe his miltonic sympathies though here again i must disclaim all portraiture but if the play makes the public aware that there are such people as phoneticians and that they are among the most important people in england at present it will serve its turn  i wish to boast that pygmalion has been an extremely successful play all over europe and north america as well as at home it is so intensely and deliberately didactic and its subject is esteemed so dry that i delight in throwing it at the heads of the wiseacres who repeat the parrot cry that art should never be didactic it goes to prove my contention that art should never be anything else  finally and for the encouragement of people troubled with accents that cut them off from all high employment i may add that the change wrought by professor higgins in the flower girl is neither impossible nor uncommon the modern concierges daughter who fulfils her ambition by playing the queen of spain in ruy blas at the theatre francais is only one of many thousands of men and women who have sloughed off their native dialects and acquired a new tongue but the thing has to be done scientifically or the last state of the aspirant may be worse than the first an honest and natural slum dialect is more tolerable than the attempt of a phonetically untaught person to imitate the vulgar dialect of the golf club and i am sorry to say that in spite of the efforts of our academy of dramatic art there is still too much sham golfing english on our stage and too little of the noble english of forbes robertson    act i  covent garden at 1115 pm torrents of heavy summer rain cab whistles blowing frantically in all directions pedestrians running for shelter into the market and under the portico of st pauls church where there are already several people among them a lady and her daughter in evening dress they are all peering out gloomily at the rain except one man with his back turned to the rest who seems wholly preoccupied with a notebook in which he is writing busily  the church clock strikes the first quarter  the daughter in the space between the central pillars close to the one on her left im getting chilled to the bone what can freddy be doing all this time hes been gone twenty minutes  the

collision with a flower girl who is hurrying in for shelter knocking her basket out of her hands a blinding flash of lightning followed instantly by a rattling peal of thunder orchestrates the incident  the flower girl nah then freddy look wh y gowin deah  freddy sorry he rushes off  the flower girl picking up her scattered flowers and replacing them in the basket theres menners f yer teoo banches o voylets trod into the mad she sits down on the plinth of the column sorting her flowers on the ladys right she is not at all an attractive person she is perhaps eighteen perhaps twenty hardly older she wears a little sailor hat of black straw that has long been exposed to the dust and soot of london and has seldom if ever been brushed her hair needs washing rather badly its mousy color can hardly be natural she wears a shoddy black coat that reaches nearly to her knees and is shaped to her waist she has a brown skirt with a coarse apron her boots are much the worse for wear she is no doubt as clean as she can afford to be but compared to the ladies she is very dirty her features are no worse than theirs but their condition leaves something to be desired and she needs the

demonstrating against police espionage course they could what business is it of yours you mind your own affairs he wants promotion he does taking down peoples words girl never said a word to him what

struggles with her emotion  the bystander he aint a tec hes a blooming busybody thats what he is i tell you look at his boots  the note taker turning on him genially and how are all your people down

how tiresome she follows angrily  all the rest have gone except the note taker the gentleman and the flower girl who sits arranging her basket and still pitying herself in murmurs  the flower girl poor girl hard enough for her to live without being worrited and chivied  the gentleman returning to his former place on the note takers left how do you do it if i may ask  the note taker simply phonetics the science of speech thats my profession also my hobby happy is the man who can make a living by his hobby you can spot an irishman or a yorkshireman by his brogue i can place any man within six miles i can place him within two miles in london sometimes within two streets  the flower girl ought to be ashamed of himself unmanly coward  the gentleman but is there a living in that

give themselves away every time they open their mouths now i can teach them  the flower girl let him mind his own business and leave a poor girl  the note taker explosively woman cease this detestable boohooing instantly or else seek the shelter of some other place of worship  the flower girl with feeble defiance ive a right to be here if i like same as you  the note taker a woman who utters such depressing and disgusting sounds has no right to be anywhereno right to live remember that you are a human being with a soul and the divine gift of articulate speech that your native language is the language of shakespear and milton and the bible and dont sit there crooning like a bilious pigeon  the flower girl quite overwhelmed and looking up at him in mingled wonder and deprecation without daring to raise her head ahahahowowoo  the note taker whipping out his book heavens what a sound he writes then holds out the book and reads reproducing her vowels exactly ahahahowowowoo  the flower girl tickled by the performance and laughing in spite of herself garn  the note taker you see this creature with her kerbstone english the english that will keep her in the gutter to the end of her days well sir in three months i could pass that girl off as a duchess at an ambassadors garden party i could even get her a place as ladys maid or shop assistant which requires better english thats the sort of thing i do for commercial millionaires and on the profits of it i do genuine scientific work in phonetics and a little as a poet on miltonic lines  the gentleman i am myself a student of indian dialects and  the note taker eagerly are you do you know colonel pickering the author of spoken sanscrit  the gentleman i am colonel pickering who are you  the note taker henry higgins author

you ought to be stuffed with nails you ought flinging the basket at his feet take the whole blooming basket for sixpence  the church clock strikes the second quarter  higgins hearing in it the voice of god rebuking him for his pharisaic want of charity to the poor girl a reminder he raises his hat solemnly then throws a handful of money into the basket and follows pickering  the flower girl picking up a halfcrown ahowooh picking up a couple of florins aaahowooh picking up several coins aaaaaahowooh picking up a halfsovereign aasaaaaaaaaahowooh  freddy springing out of a taxicab got one

with grandeur never you mind young man im going home in a taxi she sails off to the cab the driver puts his hand behind him and holds the door firmly shut against her quite understanding his mistrust she shows him her handful of money eightpence aint no object to me charlie he grins and opens the door angel court drury lane round the corner of micklejohns oil shop lets see how fast you can make her hop it she gets in and pulls the door to with a slam as the taxicab starts  freddy well im dashed    act ii  next day at 11 am  higginss laboratory in wimpole street it is a room on the first floor looking on the street and was meant for the drawingroom the double doors are in the middle of the back hall and persons entering find in the corner to their right two tall file cabinets at right angles to one another against the walls in this corner stands a flat writingtable on which are a phonograph a laryngoscope a row of tiny organ pipes with a bellows a set of lamp chimneys for singing flames with burners attached to a gas plug in the wall by an indiarubber tube several tuningforks of different sizes a lifesize image of half a human head showing in section the vocal organs and a box containing a supply of wax cylinders for the phonograph  further down the room on the same side is a fireplace with a comfortable leathercovered easychair at the side of the hearth nearest the door and a coalscuttle there is a clock on the mantelpiece between the fireplace and the phonograph table is a stand for newspapers  on the other side of the central door to the left of the visitor is a cabinet of shallow drawers on it is a telephone and the telephone directory the corner beyond and most of the side wall is occupied by a grand piano with the keyboard at the end furthest from the door and a bench for the player extending the full length of the keyboard on the piano is a dessert dish heaped with fruit and sweets mostly chocolates  the middle of the room is clear besides the easy chair the piano bench and two chairs at the phonograph table there is one stray chair it stands near the fireplace on the walls engravings mostly piranesis and mezzotint portraits no paintings  pickering is seated at the table putting down some cards and a tuningfork which he has been using higgins is standing up near him closing two or three file drawers which are hanging out he appears in the morning light as a robust vital appetizing sort of man of forty or thereabouts dressed in a professionallooking black frockcoat with a white linen collar and black silk tie he is of the energetic scientific type heartily even violently interested in everything that can be studied as a scientific subject and careless about himself and other people including their feelings he is in fact but for his years and size rather like a very impetuous baby taking notice eagerly and loudly and requiring almost as much watching to keep him out of unintended mischief his manner varies from genial bullying when he is in a good humor to stormy petulance when anything goes wrong but he is so entirely frank and void of malice that he remains likeable even in his least reasonable moments  higgins as he shuts the last drawer well i think thats the whole show  pickering its really amazing i havent taken half of it in you know  higgins would you like to go over any of it again  pickering rising and coming to the fireplace where he plants himself with his back to the fire no thank you not now im quite done up for this morning  higgins following him and standing beside him on his left tired of listening to sounds  pickering yes its a fearful strain i rather fancied myself because i can pronounce twentyfour distinct vowel sounds but your hundred and thirty beat me i cant hear a bit of difference between most of them  higgins chuckling and going over to the piano to eat sweets oh that comes with practice you hear no difference at first but you keep on listening and presently you find theyre all as different as a from b mrs pearce looks in she is higginss housekeeper whats the matter  mrs pearce hesitating evidently perplexed a young woman wants to see you sir  higgins a young woman what does she want  mrs pearce well sir she says youll be glad to see her when you know what shes come about shes quite a common girl sir very common indeed i should have sent her away only i thought perhaps you wanted her to talk into your machines i hope ive not done wrong but really you see such queer people sometimesyoull excuse me im sure sir  higgins oh thats all right mrs pearce has she an interesting accent  mrs pearce oh something dreadful sir really i dont know how you can take an interest in it  higgins to pickering lets have her up show her up mrs pearce he rushes across to his working table and picks out a cylinder to use on the phonograph  mrs pearce only half resigned to it very well sir its for you to say she goes downstairs  higgins this is rather a bit of luck ill show you how i make records well set her talking and ill take it down first in bells visible speech then in broad romic and then well get her on the phonograph so that you can turn her on as often as you like with the written transcript before you  mrs pearce returning this is the young woman sir  the flower girl enters in state she has a hat with three ostrich feathers orange skyblue and red she has a nearly clean apron and the shoddy coat has been tidied a little the pathos of this deplorable figure with its innocent vanity and consequential air touches pickering who has already straightened himself in the presence of mrs pearce but as to higgins the only distinction he makes between men and women is that when he is neither bullying nor exclaiming to the heavens against some featherweight cross he coaxes women as a child coaxes its nurse when it wants to get anything out of her  higgins brusquely recognizing her with unconcealed disappointment and at once babylike making an intolerable grievance of it why this is the girl i jotted down last night shes no use ive got all the records i want of the lisson grove lingo and im not going to waste another cylinder on it to the girl be off with you i dont want you  the flower girl dont you be so saucy you aint heard what i come for yet to mrs pearce who is waiting at the door for further instruction did you tell him i come in a taxi  mrs pearce nonsense girl what do you think a gentleman like mr higgins cares what you came in  the flower girl oh we are proud he aint above giving lessons not him i heard him say so well i aint come here to ask for any compliment and if my moneys not good enough i can go elsewhere  higgins good enough for what  the flower girl good enough for yeoo now you know dont you im come to have lessons i am and to pay for em too make no mistake  higgins stupent well recovering his breath with a gasp what do you expect me to say to you  the flower girl well if you was a gentleman you might ask me to sit down i think dont i tell you im bringing you business  higgins pickering shall we ask this baggage to sit down or shall we throw her out of the window  the flower girl running away in terror to the piano where she turns at bay ahahahowowowoo wounded and whimpering i wont be called a baggage when ive offered to pay like any lady  motionless the two men stare at her from the other side of the room amazed  pickering gently what is it you want my girl  the flower girl i want to be a lady in a flower shop stead of selling at the corner of tottenham court road but they wont take me unless i can talk more genteel he said he could teach me well here i am ready to pay himnot asking any favorand he treats me as if i was dirt  mrs pearce how can you be such a foolish ignorant girl as to think you could afford to pay mr higgins  the flower girl why shouldnt i i know what lessons cost as well as you do and im ready to pay  higgins how much  the flower girl coming back to him triumphant now youre talking i thought youd come off it when you saw a chance of getting back a bit of what you chucked at me last night confidentially youd had a drop in hadnt you  higgins peremptorily sit down  the flower girl oh if youre going to make a compliment of it  higgins thundering at her sit down  mrs pearce severely sit down girl do as youre told she places the stray chair near the hearthrug between higgins and pickering and stands behind it waiting for the girl to sit down  the flower girl ahahahowowoo she stands half rebellious half bewildered  pickering very courteous wont you sit down  liza coyly dont mind if i do she sits down pickering returns to the hearthrug  higgins whats your name  the flower girl liza doolittle  higgins declaiming gravely eliza elizabeth betsy and bess they went to the woods to get a birds nes pickering they found a nest with four eggs in it higgins   they took one apiece and left three in it  they laugh heartily at their own wit  liza oh dont be silly  mrs pearce you mustnt speak to the gentleman like that  liza well why wont he speak sensible to me  higgins come back to business how much do you propose to pay me for the lessons  liza oh i know whats right a lady friend of mine gets french lessons for eighteenpence an hour from a real french gentleman well you wouldnt have the face to ask me the same for teaching me my own language as you would for french so i wont give more than a shilling take it or leave it  higgins walking up and down the room rattling his keys and his cash in his pockets you know pickering if you consider a shilling not as a simple shilling but as a percentage of this girls income it works out as fully equivalent to sixty or seventy guineas from a millionaire  pickering how so  higgins figure it out a millionaire has about 150 pounds a day she earns about halfacrown  liza haughtily who told you i only  higgins continuing she offers me twofifths of her days income for a lesson twofifths of a millionaires income for a day would be somewhere about 60 pounds its handsome by george its enormous its the biggest offer i ever had  liza rising terrified sixty pounds what are you talking about i

am she sits down again with an attempt at dignity  higgins you shall remain so eliza under the care of mrs pearce and you shall marry an officer in the guards with a beautiful moustache the son of a marquis who will disinherit him for marrying you but will relent when he sees your beauty and goodness  pickering excuse me higgins but i really must interfere mrs pearce is quite right if this girl is to put herself in your hands for six months for an experiment in teaching she must understand thoroughly what shes doing  higgins how can she shes incapable of understanding anything besides do any of us understand what we are doing if we did would we ever do it  pickering very clever higgins but not sound sense to eliza miss doolittle  liza overwhelmed ahahowoo  higgins there thats all you get out of eliza ahahowoo no use explaining as a military man you ought to know that give her her orders thats what she wants eliza you are to live here for the next six months learning how to speak beautifully like a lady in a florists shop if youre good and do whatever youre told you shall sleep in a proper bedroom and have lots to eat and money to buy chocolates and take rides in taxis if youre naughty and idle you will sleep in the back kitchen among the black beetles and be walloped by mrs pearce with a broomstick at the end of six months you shall go to buckingham palace in a carriage beautifully dressed if the king finds out youre not a lady you will be taken by the police to the tower of london where your head will be cut off as a warning to other presumptuous flower girls if you are not found out you shall have a present of sevenandsixpence to start life with as a lady in a shop if you refuse this offer you will be a most ungrateful and wicked girl and the angels will weep for you to pickering now are you satisfied pickering to mrs pearce can i put it more plainly and fairly mrs pearce  mrs pearce patiently i think youd better let me speak to the girl properly in private i dont know that i can take charge of her or consent to the arrangement at all of course i know you dont mean her any harm but when you get what you call interested in peoples accents you never think or care what may happen to them or you come with me eliza  higgins thats all right thank you mrs pearce bundle her off to the bathroom  liza rising reluctantly and suspiciously youre a great bully you are i wont stay here if i dont like i wont let nobody wallop me i never asked to go to bucknam palace i didnt i was never in trouble with the police not me im a good girl  mrs pearce dont answer back girl you dont understand the gentleman come with me she leads the way to the door and holds it open for eliza  liza as she goes out well what i say is right i wont go near the king not if im going to have my head cut off if id known what i was letting myself in for i wouldnt have come here i always been a good girl and i never offered to say a word to him and i dont owe him nothing and i dont care and i wont be put upon and i have my feelings the same as anyone else  mrs pearce shuts the door and elizas plaints are no longer audible pickering comes from the hearth to the chair and sits astride it with his arms on the back  pickering excuse the straight question higgins are you a man of good character where women are concerned  higgins moodily have you ever met a man of good character where women are concerned  pickering yes very frequently  higgins dogmatically lifting himself on his hands to the level of the piano and sitting on it with a bounce well i havent i find that the moment i let a woman make friends with me she becomes jealous exacting suspicious and a damned nuisance i find that the moment i let myself make friends with a woman i become selfish and tyrannical women upset everything when you let them into your life you find that the woman is driving at one thing and youre driving at another  pickering at what for example  higgins coming off the piano restlessly oh lord knows i suppose the woman wants to live her own life and the man wants to live his and each tries to drag the other on to the wrong track one wants to go north and the other south and the result is that both have to go east though they both hate the east wind he sits down on the bench at the keyboard so here i am a confirmed old bachelor and likely to remain so  pickering rising and standing over him gravely come higgins you know what i mean if im to be in this business i shall feel responsible for that girl i hope its understood that no advantage is to be taken of her position  higgins what that thing sacred i assure you rising to explain you see shell be a pupil and teaching would be impossible unless pupils were sacred ive taught scores of american millionairesses how to speak english the best looking women in the world im seasoned they might as well be blocks of wood i might as well be a block of wood its  mrs pearce opens the door she has elizas hat in her hand pickering retires to the easychair at the hearth and sits down  higgins eagerly well mrs pearce is it all right  mrs pearce at the door i just wish to trouble you with a word if i may mr higgins  higgins yes certainly come in she comes forward dont burn that mrs pearce ill keep it as a curiosity he takes the hat  mrs pearce handle it carefully sir please i had to promise her not to burn it but i had better put it in the oven for a while  higgins putting it down hastily on the piano oh thank you well what have you to say to me  pickering am i in the way  mrs pearce not at all sir mr higgins will you please be very particular what you say before the girl  higgins sternly of course im always particular about what i say why do you say this to me  mrs pearce unmoved no sir youre not at all particular when youve mislaid anything or when you get a little impatient now it doesnt matter before me im used to it but you really must not swear before the girl  higgins indignantly i swear most emphatically i never swear i detest the habit what the devil do you mean  mrs pearce stolidly thats what i mean sir you swear a great deal too much i dont mind your damning and blasting and what the devil and where the devil and who the devil  higgins really mrs pearce this language from your lips  mrs pearce not to be put offbut there is a certain word i must ask you not to use the girl has just used it herself because the bath was too hot it begins with the same letter as bath she knows no better she learnt it at her mothers knee but she must not hear it from your lips  higgins loftily i cannot charge myself with having ever uttered it mrs pearce she looks at him steadfastly he adds hiding an uneasy conscience with a judicial air except perhaps in a moment of extreme and justifiable excitement  mrs pearce only this morning sir you applied it to your boots to the butter and to the brown bread  higgins oh that mere alliteration mrs pearce natural to a poet  mrs pearce well sir whatever you choose to call it i beg you not to let the girl hear you repeat it  higgins oh very well very well is that all  mrs pearce no sir we shall have to be very particular with this girl as to personal cleanliness  higgins certainly quite right most important  mrs pearce i mean not to be slovenly about her dress or untidy in leaving things about  higgins going to her solemnly just so i intended to call your attention to that he passes on to pickering who is enjoying the conversation immensely it is these little things that matter pickering take care of the pence and the pounds will take care of themselves is as true of personal habits as of money he comes to anchor on the hearthrug with the air of a man in an unassailable position  mrs pearce yes sir then might i ask you not to come down to breakfast in your dressinggown or at any rate not to use it as a napkin to the extent you do sir and if you would be so good as not to eat everything off the same plate and to remember not to put the porridge saucepan out of your hand on the clean tablecloth it would be a better example to the girl you know you nearly choked yourself with a fishbone in the jam only last week  higgins routed from the hearthrug and drifting back to the piano i may do these things sometimes in absence of mind but surely i dont do them habitually angrily by the way my dressinggown smells most damnably of benzine  mrs pearce no doubt it does mr higgins but if you will wipe your fingers  higgins yelling oh very well very well ill wipe them in my hair in future  mrs pearce i hope youre not offended mr higgins  higgins shocked at finding himself thought capable of an unamiable sentiment not at all not at all youre quite right mrs pearce i shall be particularly careful before the girl is that all  mrs pearce no sir might she use some of those japanese dresses you brought from abroad i really cant put her back into her old things  higgins certainly anything you like is that all  mrs pearce thank you sir thats all she goes out  higgins you know pickering that woman has the most extraordinary ideas about me here i am a shy diffident sort of man ive never been able to feel really grownup and tremendous like other chaps and yet shes firmly persuaded that im an arbitrary overbearing bossing kind of person i cant account for it  mrs pearce returns  mrs pearce if you please sir the troubles beginning already theres a dustman downstairs alfred doolittle wants to see you he says you have his daughter here  pickering rising phew i say he retreats to the hearthrug  higgins promptly send the blackguard up  mrs pearce oh very well sir she goes out  pickering he may not be a blackguard higgins  higgins nonsense of course hes a blackguard  pickering whether he is or not im afraid we shall have some trouble with him  higgins confidently oh no i think not if theres any trouble he shall have it with me not i with him and we are sure to get something interesting out of him  pickering about the girl  higgins no i mean his dialect  pickering oh  mrs pearce at the door doolittle sir she admits doolittle and retires  alfred doolittle is an elderly but vigorous dustman clad in the costume of his profession including a hat with a back brim covering his neck and shoulders he has well marked and rather interesting features and seems equally free from fear and conscience he has a remarkably expressive voice the result of a habit of giving vent to his feelings without reserve his present pose is that of wounded honor and stern resolution  doolittle at the door uncertain which of the two gentlemen is his man professor higgins  higgins here good morning sit down  doolittle morning governor he sits down magisterially i come about a very serious matter governor  higgins to pickering brought up in hounslow mother welsh i should think doolittle opens his mouth amazed higgins continues what do you want doolittle  doolittle menacingly i want my daughter thats what i want see  higgins of course you do youre her father arent you you dont suppose anyone else wants her do you im glad to see you have some spark of family feeling left shes upstairs take her away at once  doolittle rising fearfully taken aback what  higgins take her away do you suppose im going to keep your daughter for you  doolittle remonstrating now now look here governor  is this reasonable is it fair to take advantage of a man like this the girl belongs to me you got her where do i come in he sits down again  higgins your daughter had the audacity to come to my house and ask me to teach her how to speak properly so that she could get a place in a flowershop this gentleman and my housekeeper have been here all the time bullying him how dare you come here and attempt to blackmail me you sent her here on purpose  doolittle protesting no governor  higgins you must have how else could you possibly know that she is here  doolittle dont take a man up like

doolittle have i asked you for a brass farthing i leave it to the gentleman here have i said a word about money  higgins throwing the book aside and marching down on doolittle with a poser what else did you come for  doolittle sweetly well what would a man come for be human governor  higgins disarmed alfred did you put her up to it  doolittle so help me governor i never did i take my bible oath i aint seen the girl these two months past  higgins then how did you know she was here  doolittle most musical most melancholy ill tell you governor if youll only let me get a word in im willing to tell you im wanting to tell you im waiting to tell you  higgins pickering this chap has a certain natural gift of rhetoric observe the rhythm of his native woodnotes wild im willing to tell you im wanting to tell you im waiting to tell you sentimental rhetoric thats the welsh strain in him it also accounts for his mendacity and dishonesty  pickering oh please higgins im west country myself to doolittle how did you know the girl was here if you didnt send her  doolittle it was like this governor the girl took a boy in the taxi to give him a jaunt son of her landlady he is he hung about on the chance of her giving him another ride home well she sent him back for her luggage when she heard you was willing for her to stop here i met the boy at the corner of long acre and endell street  higgins public house yes  doolittle the poor mans club governor why shouldnt i  pickering do let him tell his story higgins  doolittle he told me what was up and i ask you what was my feelings and my duty as a father i says to the boy you bring me the luggage i says  pickering why didnt you go for it yourself  doolittle landlady wouldnt have trusted me with it governor shes that kind of woman you know i had to give the boy a penny afore he trusted me with it the little swine i brought it to her just to oblige you like and make myself agreeable thats all  higgins how much luggage  doolittle musical instrument governor a few pictures a trifle of jewelry and a birdcage she said she didnt want no clothes what was i to think from that governor i ask you as a parent what was i to think  higgins so you came to rescue her from worse than death eh  doolittle appreciatively relieved at being understood just so governor thats right  pickering but why did you bring her luggage if you intended to take her away  doolittle have i said a word about taking her away have i now  higgins determinedly youre going to take her away double quick he crosses to the hearth and rings the bell  doolittle rising no governor dont say that im not the man to stand in my girls light heres a career opening for her as you might say and  mrs pearce opens the door and awaits orders  higgins mrs pearce this is elizas father he has come to take her away give her to him he goes back to the piano with an air of washing his hands of the whole affair  doolittle no this is a misunderstanding listen here  mrs pearce he cant take her away mr higgins how can he you told me to burn her clothes  doolittle thats right i cant carry the girl through the streets like a blooming monkey can i i put it to you  higgins you have

mrs pearce i am the housekeeper if you please i have sent for some clothes for your girl when they come you can take her away you can wait in the kitchen this way please  doolittle much troubled accompanies her to the door then hesitates finally turns confidentially to higgins  doolittle listen here governor you and me is men of the world aint we  higgins oh men of the world are we youd better go mrs pearce  mrs pearce i think so indeed sir she goes with dignity  pickering the floor is yours mr doolittle  doolittle to pickering i thank you governor to higgins who takes refuge on the piano bench a little overwhelmed by the proximity of his visitor for doolittle has a professional flavor of dust about him well the truth is ive taken a sort of fancy to you governor and if you want the girl im not so set on having her back home again but what i might be open to an arrangement regarded in the light of a young woman shes a fine handsome girl as a daughter shes not worth her keep and so i tell you straight all i ask is my rights as a father and youre the last man alive to expect me to let her go for nothing for i can see youre one of the straight sort governor well whats a five pound note to you and whats eliza to me he returns to his chair and sits down judicially  pickering i think you ought to know doolittle that mr higginss intentions are entirely honorable  doolittle course they are governor if i thought they wasnt id ask fifty  higgins revolted do you mean to say you callous rascal that you would sell your daughter for 50 pounds  doolittle not in a general way i wouldnt but to oblige a gentleman like you id do a good deal i do assure you  pickering have you no morals man  doolittle unabashed cant afford them governor neither could you if you was as poor as me not that i mean any harm you know but if liza is going to have a bit out of this why not me too  higgins troubled i dont know what to do pickering there can be no question that as a matter of morals its a positive crime to give this chap a farthing and yet i feel a sort of rough justice in his claim  doolittle thats it governor thats all i say a fathers heart as it were  pickering well i know the feeling but really it seems hardly right  doolittle dont say that governor dont look at it that way what am i governors both i ask you what am i im one of the undeserving poor thats what i am think of what that means to a man it means that hes up agen middle class morality all the time if theres anything going and i put in for a bit of it its always the same story youre undeserving so you cant have it but my needs is as great as the most deserving widows that ever got money out of six different charities in one week for the death of the same husband i dont need less than a deserving man i need more i dont eat less hearty than him and i drink a lot more i want a bit of amusement cause im a thinking man i want cheerfulness and a song and a band when i feel low well they charge me just the same for everything as they charge the deserving what is middle class morality just an excuse for never giving me anything therefore i ask you as two gentlemen not to play that game on me im playing straight with you i aint pretending to be deserving im undeserving and i mean to go on being undeserving i like it and thats the truth will you take advantage of a mans nature to do him out of the price of his own daughter what hes brought up and fed and clothed by the sweat of his brow until shes growed big enough to be interesting to you two gentlemen is five pounds unreasonable i put it to you and i leave it to you  higgins rising and going over to pickering pickering if we were to take this man in hand for three months he could choose between a seat in the cabinet and a popular pulpit in wales  pickering what do you say to that doolittle  doolittle not me governor thank you kindly ive heard all the preachers and all the prime ministersfor im a thinking man and game for politics or religion or social reform same as all the other amusementsand i tell you its a dogs life anyway you look at it undeserving poverty is my line taking one station in society with another itsitswell its the only one that has any ginger in it to my taste  higgins i suppose we must give him a fiver  pickering hell make a bad use of it im afraid  doolittle not me governor so help me i wont dont you be afraid that ill save it and spare it and live idle on it there wont be a penny of it left by monday ill have to go to work same as if id never had it it wont pauperize me you bet just one good spree for myself and the missus giving pleasure to ourselves and employment to others and satisfaction to you to think its not been throwed away you couldnt spend it better  higgins taking out his pocket book and coming between doolittle and the piano this is irresistible lets give him ten he offers two notes to the dustman  doolittle no governor she wouldnt have the heart to spend ten and perhaps i shouldnt neither ten pounds is a lot of money it makes a man feel prudent like and then goodbye to happiness you give me what i ask you governor not a penny more and not a penny less  pickering why dont you marry that missus of yours i rather draw the line at encouraging that sort of immorality  doolittle tell her so governor tell her so im willing its me that suffers by it ive no hold on her i got to be agreeable to her i got to give her presents i got to buy her clothes something sinful im a slave to that woman governor just because im not her lawful husband and she knows it too catch her marrying me take my advice governor marry eliza while shes young and dont know no better if you dont youll be sorry for it after if you do shell be sorry for it after but better you than her because youre a man and shes only a woman and dont know how to be happy anyhow  higgins pickering if we listen to this man another minute we shall have no convictions left to doolittle five pounds i think you said  doolittle thank you kindly governor  higgins youre sure you wont take ten  doolittle not now another time governor  higgins handing him a fivepound note here you are  doolittle thank you governor good morning  he hurries to the door anxious to get away with his booty when he opens it he is confronted with a dainty and exquisitely clean young japanese lady in a simple blue cotton kimono printed cunningly with small white jasmine blossoms mrs pearce is with her he gets out of her way deferentially and apologizes beg pardon miss  the japanese lady

pearce says youre going to give me some to wear in bed at night different to what i wear in the daytime but it do seem a waste of money when you could get something to show besides i never could fancy changing into cold things on a winter night  mrs pearce coming back now eliza the new things have come for you to try on  liza ahowooooh she rushes out  mrs pearce following her oh dont rush about like that girl she shuts the door behind her  higgins pickering we have taken on a stiff job  pickering with conviction higgins we have    act iii  it is mrs higginss athome day nobody has yet arrived her drawingroom in a flat on chelsea embankment has three windows looking on the river and the ceiling is not so lofty as it would be in an older house of the same pretension the windows are open giving access to a balcony with flowers in pots if you stand with your face to the windows you have the fireplace on your left and the door in the righthand wall close to the corner nearest the windows  mrs higgins was brought up on morris and burne jones and her room which is very unlike her sons room in wimpole street is not crowded with furniture and little tables and nicknacks in the middle of the room there is a big ottoman and this with the carpet the morris wallpapers and the morris chintz window curtains and brocade covers of the ottoman and its cushions supply all the ornament and are much too handsome to be hidden by odds and ends of useless things a few good oilpaintings from the exhibitions in the grosvenor gallery thirty years ago the burne jones not the whistler side of them are on the walls the only landscape is a cecil lawson on the scale of a rubens there is a portrait of mrs higgins as she was when she defied fashion in her youth in one of the beautiful rossettian costumes which when caricatured by people who did not understand led to the absurdities of popular estheticism in the eighteenseventies  in the corner diagonally opposite the door mrs higgins now over sixty and long past taking the trouble to dress out of the fashion sits writing at an elegantly simple writingtable with a bell button within reach of her hand there is a chippendale chair further back in the room between her and the window nearest her side at the other side of the room further forward is an elizabethan chair roughly carved in the taste of inigo jones on the same side a piano in a decorated case the corner between the fireplace and the window is occupied by a divan cushioned in morris chintz  it is between four and five in the afternoon  the door is opened violently and higgins enters with his hat on  mrs higgins dismayed henry scolding him what are you doing here today it is my at home day you promised not to come as he bends to kiss her she takes his hat off and presents it to him  higgins oh bother he throws the hat down on the table  mrs higgins go home at once  higgins kissing her i know mother i came on purpose  mrs higgins but you mustnt im serious henry you offend all my friends they stop coming whenever they meet you  higgins nonsense i know i have no small talk but people dont mind he sits on the settee  mrs higgins oh dont

said it was  higgins not your part of it ive picked up a girl  mrs higgins does that mean that some girl has picked you up  higgins not at all i dont mean a love affair  mrs higgins what a pity  higgins why  mrs higgins well you never fall in love with anyone under fortyfive when will you discover that there are some rather nicelooking young women about  higgins oh i cant be bothered with young women my idea of a loveable woman is something as like you as possible i shall never get into the way of seriously liking young women some habits lie too deep to be changed rising abruptly and walking about jingling his money and his keys in his trouser pockets besides theyre all idiots  mrs higgins do you know what you would do if you really loved me henry  higgins oh bother what marry i suppose  mrs higgins no stop fidgeting and take your hands out of your pockets with a gesture of despair he obeys and sits down again thats a good boy now tell me about the girl  higgins shes coming to see you  mrs higgins i dont remember asking her  higgins you didnt i asked her if youd known her you wouldnt have asked her  mrs higgins indeed why  higgins well its like this shes a common flower girl i picked her off the kerbstone  mrs higgins and invited her to my athome  higgins rising and coming to her to coax her oh thatll be all right ive taught her to speak properly and she has strict orders as to her behavior shes to keep to two subjects the weather and everybodys healthfine day and how do you do you knowand not to let herself go on things in general that will be safe  mrs higgins safe to talk about our health about our insides perhaps about our outsides how could you be so silly henry  higgins impatiently well she must talk about something he controls himself and sits down again oh shell be all right dont you fuss pickering is in it with me ive a sort of bet on that ill pass her off as a duchess in six months i started on her some months ago and shes getting on like a house on fire i shall win my bet she has a quick ear and shes been easier to teach than my middleclass pupils because shes had to learn a complete new language she talks english almost as you talk french  mrs higgins thats satisfactory at all events  higgins well it is and it isnt  mrs higgins what does that mean  higgins you see ive got her pronunciation all right but you have to consider not only how a girl pronounces but what she pronounces and thats where  they are interrupted by the parlormaid announcing guests  the parlormaid mrs and miss eynsford hill she withdraws  higgins oh lord he rises snatches his hat from the table and makes for the door but before he reaches it his mother introduces him  mrs and miss eynsford hill are the mother and daughter who sheltered from the rain in covent garden the mother is well bred quiet and has the habitual anxiety of straitened means the daughter has acquired a gay air of being very much at home in society the bravado of genteel poverty  mrs eynsford hill to mrs higgins how do you do they shake hands  miss eynsford hill how dyou do she shakes  mrs higgins introducing my son henry  mrs eynsford hill your celebrated son i have so longed to meet you professor higgins  higgins glumly making no movement in her direction delighted he backs against the piano and bows brusquely  miss eynsford hill going to him with confident

which with his back to the company he contemplates the river and the flowers in battersea park on the opposite bank as if they were a frozen dessert  the parlormaid returns ushering in pickering  the parlormaid colonel pickering she withdraws  pickering how do you do mrs higgins  mrs higgins so glad youve come do you know mrs eynsford hillmiss eynsford hill exchange of bows the colonel brings the chippendale chair a little forward between mrs hill and mrs higgins and sits down  pickering has henry told you what weve come for  higgins over his shoulder we were interrupted damn it  mrs higgins

side of it  higgins well here we are anyhow he sits down on the ottoman next mrs eynsford hill on her left and now what the devil are we going to talk about until eliza comes  mrs higgins henry you

miss eynsford hill who considers higgins quite eligible matrimonially i sympathize i havent any small talk if people would only be frank and say what they really think  higgins relapsing into gloom lord forbid  mrs eynsford hill taking up her daughters cue but why  higgins what they think they ought to think is bad enough lord knows but what they really think would break up the whole show do you suppose it would be really agreeable if i were to come out now with what i really think  miss eynsford hill gaily is it so very cynical  higgins cynical who the dickens said it was cynical i mean it wouldnt be decent  mrs eynsford hill seriously oh im sure you dont mean that mr higgins  higgins you see were all savages more or less were supposed to be civilized and culturedto know all about poetry and philosophy and art and science and so on but how many of us know even the meanings of these names to miss hill what do you know of poetry to mrs hill what do you know of science indicating freddy what does he know of art or science or anything else what the devil do you imagine i know of philosophy  mrs higgins warningly or of manners henry  the parlormaid opening the door miss doolittle she withdraws  higgins rising hastily and running to mrs higgins here she is mother he stands on tiptoe and makes signs over his mothers head to eliza to indicate to her which lady is her hostess  eliza who is exquisitely dressed produces an impression of such remarkable distinction and beauty as she enters that they all rise quite flustered guided by higginss signals she comes to mrs higgins with studied grace  liza speaking with pedantic correctness of pronunciation and great beauty of tone how do you do mrs higgins she gasps slightly in making sure of the h in higgins but is quite successful mr higgins told me i might come  mrs higgins cordially quite right im very glad indeed to see you  pickering how do you do miss doolittle  liza shaking hands with him colonel pickering is it not  mrs eynsford hill i feel sure we have met before miss doolittle i remember your eyes  liza how do you do she sits down on the ottoman gracefully in the place just left vacant by higgins  mrs eynsford hill introducing my daughter clara  liza how do you do  clara impulsively how do you do she sits down on the ottoman beside eliza devouring her with her eyes  freddy coming to their side of the ottoman ive certainly had the pleasure  mrs eynsford hill introducing my son freddy  liza how do you do  freddy bows and sits down in the elizabethan chair infatuated  higgins suddenly by george yes it all comes back to me they stare at him covent garden lamentably what a damned thing  mrs higgins henry please he is about to sit on the edge of the table dont sit on my writingtable youll break it  higgins sulkily sorry  he goes to the divan stumbling into the fender and over the fireirons on his way extricating himself with muttered imprecations and finishing his disastrous journey by throwing himself so impatiently on the divan that he almost breaks it mrs higgins looks at him but controls herself and says nothing  a long and painful pause ensues  mrs higgins at last conversationally will it rain do you think  liza the shallow depression in the west of these islands is likely to move slowly in an easterly direction there are no indications of any great change in the barometrical situation  freddy ha ha how awfully funny  liza what is wrong with that young man i bet i got it right  freddy killing  mrs eynsford hill im sure i hope it wont turn cold theres so much influenza about it runs right through our whole family regularly every spring  liza darkly my aunt died of influenza so they said  mrs eynsford hill clicks her tongue sympathetically  liza in the same tragic tone but its my belief they done the old woman in  mrs higgins puzzled done her in  liza yeeees lord love you why should she die of influenza she come through diphtheria right enough the year before i saw her with my own eyes fairly blue with it she was they all thought she was dead but my father he kept ladling gin down her throat til she came to so sudden that she bit the bowl off the spoon  mrs eynsford hill startled dear me  liza piling up the indictment what call would a woman with that strength in her have to die of influenza what become of her new straw hat that

in means to kill them  mrs eynsford hill to eliza horrified you surely dont believe that your aunt was killed  liza do i not them she lived with would have killed her for a hatpin let alone a hat  mrs eynsford hill but it cant have been right for your father to pour spirits down her throat like that it might have killed her  liza not her gin was mothers milk to her besides hed poured so much down his own throat that he knew the good of it  mrs eynsford hill do you mean that he drank  liza drank my word something chronic  mrs eynsford hill how dreadful for you  liza not a bit it never did him no harm what i could see but then he did not keep it up regular cheerfully on the burst as you might say from time to time and always more agreeable when he had a drop in when he was out of work my mother used to give him fourpence and tell him to go out and not come back until hed drunk himself cheerful and lovinglike theres lots of women has to make their husbands drunk to make them fit to live with now quite at her ease you see its like this if a man has a bit of a conscience it always takes him when hes sober and then it makes him lowspirited a drop of booze just takes that off and

eynsford hill suffering from shock well i really cant get used to the new ways  clara throwing herself discontentedly into the elizabethan chair oh its all right mamma quite right people will think we never go anywhere or see anybody if you are so oldfashioned  mrs eynsford hill i daresay i am very oldfashioned but i do hope you wont begin using that expression clara i have got accustomed to hear you talking about men as rotters and calling everything filthy and beastly though i do think it horrible and unladylike but this last is really too much dont you think so colonel pickering  pickering dont ask me ive been away in india for several years and manners have changed so much that i sometimes dont know whether im at a respectable dinnertable or in a ships forecastle  clara its all a matter of habit theres no right or wrong in it nobody means anything by it and its so quaint and gives such a smart emphasis to things that are not in themselves very witty i find the new small talk

meant for him to hear discreetly joins higgins at the window were so poor and she gets so few parties poor child she doesnt quite know mrs higgins seeing that her eyes are moist takes her hand sympathetically and goes with her to the door but the boy is nice dont you think so  mrs higgins oh quite nice i shall always be delighted to see him  mrs eynsford hill thank you dear goodbye she goes out  higgins eagerly well is eliza presentable he swoops on his mother and drags her to the ottoman where she sits down in elizas place with her son on her left  pickering returns to his chair on her right  mrs higgins you silly boy of course shes not presentable shes a triumph of your art and of her dressmakers but if you suppose for a moment that she doesnt give herself away in every sentence she utters you must be perfectly cracked about her  pickering but dont you think something might be done i mean something to eliminate the sanguinary element from her conversation  mrs higgins not as long as she is in henrys hands  higgins aggrieved do you mean that my language is improper  mrs higgins no dearest it would be quite propersay on a canal barge but it would not be proper for her at a garden party  higgins deeply injured well i must say  pickering interrupting him come higgins you must learn to know yourself i havent heard such language as yours since we used to review the volunteers in hyde park twenty years ago  higgins sulkily oh well if you say so i suppose i dont always talk like a bishop  mrs higgins quieting henry with a touch colonel pickering will you tell me what is the exact state of things in wimpole street  pickering cheerfully as if this completely changed the subject well i have come to live there with henry we work together at my indian dialects and we think it more convenient  mrs higgins quite so i know all about that its an excellent arrangement but where does this girl live  higgins with us of course where would she live  mrs higgins but on what terms is she a servant if not what is she  pickering slowly i think i know what you mean mrs higgins  higgins well dash me if i do ive had to work at the girl every day for months to get her to her present pitch besides shes useful she knows where my things are and remembers my appointments and so forth  mrs higgins how does your housekeeper get on with her  higgins mrs pearce oh shes jolly glad to get so much taken off her hands for before eliza came she had to have to find things and remind me of my appointments but shes got some silly bee in her bonnet about eliza she keeps saying you dont think sir doesnt she pick  pickering yes thats the formula you dont think sir thats the end of every conversation about eliza  higgins as if i ever stop thinking about the girl and her confounded vowels and consonants im worn out thinking about her and watching her lips and her teeth and her tongue not to mention her soul which is the quaintest of the lot  mrs higgins you certainly are a pretty pair of babies playing with your live doll  higgins playing the hardest job i ever tackled make no mistake about that mother but you have no idea how frightfully interesting it is to take a human being and change her into a quite different human being by creating a new speech for her its filling up the deepest gulf that separates class from class and soul from soul  pickering drawing his chair closer to mrs higgins and bending over to her eagerly yes its enormously interesting i assure you mrs higgins we take eliza very seriously every weekevery day almostthere is some new change closer again we keep records of every stagedozens of gramophone disks and photographs  higgins assailing her at the other ear yes by george its the most absorbing experiment i ever tackled she regularly fills our lives up doesnt she pick  pickering were always talking eliza  higgins teaching eliza  pickering dressing eliza  mrs higgins what  higgins inventing new elizas  higgins and pickering speaking together    higgins    you know she has the most extraordinary quickness of ear   pickering  i assure you my dear mrs higgins that girl   higgins    just like a parrot ive tried her with every   pickering  is a genius she can play the piano quite beautifully   higgins    possible sort of sound that a human being can make   pickering  we have taken her to classical concerts and to music   higgins    continental dialects african dialects hottentot   pickering  halls and its all the same to her she plays everything   higgins    clicks things it took me years to get hold of and   pickering  she hears right off when she comes home whether its   higgins    she picks them up like a shot right away as if she had   pickering  beethoven and brahms or lehar and lionel morickton   higgins    been at it all her life   pickering  though six months ago shed never as much as touched               a piano  mrs higgins putting her fingers in her ears as they are by this time shouting one another down with an intolerable noise shshshsh they stop  pickering i beg your pardon he draws his chair back apologetically  higgins sorry when pickering starts shouting nobody can get a word in edgeways  mrs higgins be quiet henry colonel pickering dont you realize that when eliza walked into wimpole street something walked in with her  pickering her father did but henry soon got rid of him  mrs higgins it would have been more to the point if her mother had but as her mother didnt something else did  pickering but what  mrs higgins unconsciously dating herself by the word a problem  pickering oh i see the problem of how to pass her off as a lady  higgins ill solve that problem ive half solved it already  mrs higgins no you two infinitely stupid male creatures the problem of what is to be done with her afterwards  higgins i dont see anything in that she can go her own way with all the advantages i have given her  mrs higgins the advantages of that poor woman who was here just now the manners and habits that disqualify a fine lady from earning her own living without giving her a fine ladys income is that what you mean  pickering indulgently being rather bored oh that will be all right mrs higgins he rises to go  higgins rising also well find her some light employment  pickering shes happy enough dont you worry about her goodbye he shakes hands as if he were consoling a frightened child and makes for the door  higgins anyhow theres no good bothering now the things done goodbye mother he kisses her and follows pickering  pickering turning for a final consolation there are plenty of openings well do whats right goodbye  higgins to pickering as they go out together lets take her to the shakespear exhibition at earls court  pickering yes lets her remarks will be delicious  higgins shell mimic all the people for us when we get home  pickering ripping both are heard laughing as they go downstairs  mrs higgins rises with an impatient bounce and returns to her work at the writingtable she sweeps a litter of disarranged papers out of her way snatches a sheet of paper from her stationery case and tries resolutely to write at the third line she gives it up flings down her pen grips the table angrily and exclaims oh men men men    act iv  the wimpole street laboratory midnight nobody in the room the clock on the mantelpiece strikes twelve the fire is not alight it is a summer night  presently higgins and pickering are heard on the stairs  higgins calling down to pickering i say pick lock up will you i shant be going out again  pickering right can mrs pearce go to bed we dont want anything more do we  higgins lord no  eliza opens the door and is seen on the lighted landing in opera cloak brilliant evening dress and diamonds with fan flowers and all accessories she comes to the hearth and switches on the electric lights there she is tired her pallor contrasts strongly with her dark eyes and hair and her expression is almost tragic she takes off her cloak puts her fan and flowers on the piano and sits down on the bench brooding and silent higgins in evening dress with overcoat and hat comes in carrying a smoking jacket which he has picked up downstairs he takes off the hat and overcoat throws them carelessly on the newspaper stand disposes of his coat in the same way puts on the smoking jacket and throws himself wearily into the easychair at the hearth pickering similarly attired comes in he also takes off his hat and overcoat and is about to throw them on higginss when he hesitates  pickering i say mrs pearce will row if we leave these things lying about in the drawingroom  higgins oh chuck them over the bannisters into the hall shell find them there in the morning and put them away all right shell think we were drunk  pickering we are slightly are there any letters  higgins i didnt look pickering takes the overcoats and hats and goes down stairs higgins begins half singing half yawning an air from la fanciulla del golden west suddenly he stops and exclaims i wonder where the devil my slippers are  eliza looks at him darkly then leaves the room  higgins yawns again and resumes his song pickering returns with the contents of the letterbox in his hand  pickering only circulars and this coroneted billetdoux for you he throws the circulars into the fender and posts himself on the hearthrug with his back to the grate  higgins glancing at the billetdoux moneylender he throws the letter after the circulars  eliza returns with a pair of large downatheel slippers she places them on the carpet before higgins and sits as before without a word  higgins yawning again oh lord what an evening what a crew what a silly tomfoollery he raises his shoe to unlace it and catches sight of the slippers he stops unlacing and looks at them as if they had appeared there of their own accord oh theyre there are they  pickering stretching himself well i feel a bit tired its been a long day the garden party a dinner party and the opera rather too much of a good thing but youve won your bet higgins eliza did the trick and something to spare eh  higgins fervently thank god its over  eliza flinches violently but they take no notice of her and she recovers herself and sits stonily as before  pickering were you nervous at the garden party i was eliza didnt seem a bit nervous  higgins oh she wasnt nervous i knew shed be all right no its the strain of putting the job through all these months that has told on me it was interesting enough at first while we were at the phonetics but after that i got deadly sick of it if i hadnt backed myself to do it i should have chucked the whole thing up two months ago it was a silly notion the whole thing has been a bore  pickering oh come the garden party was frightfully exciting my heart began beating like anything  higgins yes for the first three minutes but when i saw we were going to win hands down i felt like a bear in a cage hanging about doing nothing the dinner was worse sitting gorging there for over an hour with nobody but a damned fool of a fashionable woman to talk to i tell you pickering never again for me no more artificial duchesses the whole thing has been simple purgatory  pickering youve never been broken in properly to the social routine strolling over to the piano i rather enjoy dipping into it occasionally myself it makes me feel young again anyhow it was a great success an immense success i was quite frightened once or twice because eliza was doing it so well you see lots of the real people cant do it at all theyre such fools that they think style comes by nature to people in their position and so they never learn theres always something professional about doing a thing superlatively well  higgins yes thats what drives me mad the silly people dont know their own silly business rising however its over and done with and now i can go to bed at last without dreading tomorrow  elizas beauty becomes murderous  pickering i think i shall turn in too still its been a great occasion a triumph for you goodnight he goes  higgins following him goodnight over his shoulder at the door put out the lights eliza and tell mrs pearce not to make coffee for me in the morning ill take tea he goes out  eliza tries to control herself and feel indifferent as she rises and walks across to the hearth to switch off the lights by the time she gets there she is on the point of screaming she sits down in higginss chair and holds on hard to the arms finally she gives way and flings herself furiously on the floor raging  higgins in despairing wrath outside what the devil have i done with my slippers he appears at the door  liza snatching up the slippers and hurling them at him one after the other with all her force there are your slippers and there take your slippers and may you never have a days luck with them  higgins astounded what on earth he comes to her whats the matter get up he pulls her up anything wrong  liza breathless nothing wrongwith you ive won your bet for you havent i thats enough for you i dont matter i suppose  higgins you won my bet you presumptuous insect i won it what did you throw those slippers at me for  liza because i wanted to smash your face id like to kill you you selfish brute why didnt you leave me where you picked me out ofin the gutter you thank god its all over and that now you can throw me back again there do you she crisps her fingers frantically  higgins looking at her in cool wonder the creature is nervous after all  liza gives a suffocated scream of fury and instinctively darts her nails at his face  higgins catching her wrists ah would you claws in you cat how dare you show your temper to me sit down and be quiet he throws her roughly into the easychair  liza crushed by superior strength and weight whats to become of me whats to become of me  higgins how the devil do i know whats to become of you what does it matter what becomes of you  liza you dont care i know you dont care you wouldnt care if i was dead im nothing to younot so much as them slippers  higgins thundering those slippers  liza with bitter submission those slippers i didnt think it made any difference now  a pause eliza hopeless and crushed higgins a little uneasy  higgins in his loftiest manner why have you begun going on like this may i ask whether you complain of your treatment here  liza no  higgins has anybody behaved badly to you colonel pickering mrs pearce any of the servants  liza no  higgins i presume you dont pretend that i have treated you badly  liza no  higgins i am glad to hear it he moderates his tone perhaps youre tired after the strain of the day will you have a glass of champagne he moves towards the door  liza no recollecting her manners thank you  higgins goodhumored again this has been coming on you for some days i suppose it was natural for you to be anxious about the garden party but thats all over now he pats her kindly on the shoulder she writhes theres nothing more to worry about  liza no nothing more for you to worry about she suddenly rises and gets away from him by going to the piano bench where she sits and hides her face oh god i wish i was dead  higgins staring after her in sincere surprise why in heavens name why reasonably going to her listen to me eliza all this irritation is purely subjective  liza i dont understand im too ignorant  higgins its only imagination low spirits and nothing else nobodys hurting you nothings wrong you go to bed like a good girl and sleep it off have a little cry and say your prayers that will make you comfortable  liza i heard your prayers thank god its all over  higgins impatiently well dont you thank god its all over now you are free and can do what you like  liza pulling herself together in desperation what am i fit for what have you left me fit for where am i to go what am i to do whats to become of me  higgins enlightened but not at all impressed oh thats whats worrying you is it he thrusts his hands into his pockets and walks about in his usual manner rattling the contents of his pockets as if condescending to a trivial subject out of pure kindness i shouldnt bother about it if i were you i should imagine you wont have much difficulty in settling yourself somewhere or other though i hadnt quite realized that you were going away she looks quickly at him he does not look at her but examines the dessert stand on the piano and decides that he will eat an apple you might marry you know he bites a large piece out of the apple and munches it noisily you see eliza all men are not confirmed old bachelors like me and the colonel most men are the marrying sort poor devils and youre not badlooking its quite a pleasure to look at you sometimesnot now of course because youre crying and looking as ugly as the very devil but when youre all right and quite yourself youre what i should call attractive that is to the people in the marrying line you understand you go to bed and have a good nice rest and then get up and look at yourself in the glass and you wont feel so cheap  eliza again looks at him speechless and does not stir  the look is quite lost on him he eats his apple with a dreamy expression of happiness as it is quite a good one  higgins a genial afterthought occurring to him i daresay my mother could find some chap or other who would do very well  liza we were above that at the corner of tottenham court road  higgins waking up what do you mean  liza i sold flowers i didnt sell myself now youve made a lady of me im not fit to sell anything else i wish youd left me where you found me  higgins slinging the core of the apple decisively into the grate tosh eliza dont you insult human relations by dragging all this cant about buying and selling into it you neednt marry the fellow if you dont like him  liza what else am i to do  higgins oh lots of things what about your old idea of a florists shop pickering could set you up in one hes lots of money chuckling hell have to pay for all those togs you have been wearing today and that with the hire of the jewellery will make a big hole in two hundred pounds why six months ago you would have thought it the millennium to have a flower shop of your own come youll be all right i must clear off to bed im devilish sleepy by the way i came down for something i forget what it was  liza your slippers  higgins oh yes of course you shied them at me he picks them up and is going out when she rises and speaks to him  liza before you go sir  higgins dropping the slippers in his surprise at her calling him sir eh  liza do my clothes belong to me or to colonel pickering  higgins coming back into the room as if her question were the very climax of unreason what the devil use would they be to pickering  liza he might want them for the next girl you pick up to experiment on  higgins shocked and hurt is that the way you feel towards us  liza i dont want to hear anything more about that all i want to know is whether anything belongs to me my own clothes were burnt  higgins but what does it matter why need you start bothering about that in the middle of the night  liza i want to know what i may take away with me i dont want to be accused of stealing  higgins now deeply wounded stealing you shouldnt have said that eliza that shows a want of feeling  liza im sorry im only a common ignorant girl and in my station i have to be careful there cant be any feelings between the like of you and the like of me please will you tell me what belongs to me and what doesnt  higgins very sulky you may take the whole damned houseful if you like except the jewels theyre hired will that satisfy you he turns on his heel and is about to go in extreme dudgeon  liza drinking in his emotion like nectar and nagging him to provoke a further supply stop please she takes off her jewels will you take these to your room and keep them safe i dont want to run the risk of their being missing  higgins furious hand them over she puts them into his hands if these belonged to me instead of to the jeweler id ram them down your ungrateful throat he perfunctorily thrusts them into his pockets unconsciously decorating himself with the protruding ends of the chains  liza taking a ring off this ring isnt the jewelers its the one you bought me in brighton i dont want it now higgins dashes the ring violently into the fireplace and turns on her so threateningly that she crouches over the piano with her hands over her face and exclaims dont you hit me  higgins hit you you infamous creature how dare you accuse me of such a thing it is you who have hit me you have wounded me to the heart  liza thrilling with hidden joy im glad ive got a little of my own back anyhow  higgins with dignity in his finest professional style you have caused me to lose my temper a thing that has hardly ever happened to me before i prefer to say nothing more tonight i am going to bed  liza pertly youd better leave a note for mrs pearce about the coffee for she wont be told by me  higgins formally damn mrs pearce and damn the coffee and damn you and damn my own folly in having lavished my hardearned knowledge and the treasure of my regard and intimacy on a heartless guttersnipe he goes out with impressive decorum and spoils it by slamming the door savagely  eliza smiles for the first time expresses her feelings by a wild pantomime in which an imitation of higginss exit is confused with her own triumph and finally goes down on her knees on the hearthrug to look for the ring    act v  mrs higginss drawingroom she is at her writingtable as before the parlormaid comes in  the parlormaid at the door  mr henry mam is downstairs with colonel pickering  mrs higgins well show them up  the parlormaid theyre using the telephone mam telephoning to the police i think  mrs higgins what  the parlormaid coming further in and lowering her voice mr henrys in a state mam i thought id better tell you  mrs higgins if you had told me that mr henry was not in a state it would have been more surprising tell them to come up when theyve finished with the police i suppose hes lost something  the parlormaid yes mam going  mrs higgins go upstairs and tell miss doolittle that mr henry and the colonel are here ask her not to come down till i send for her  the parlormaid yes mam  higgins bursts in he is as the parlormaid has said in a state  higgins look here mother heres a confounded thing  mrs higgins yes dear goodmorning he checks his impatience and kisses her whilst the parlormaid goes out what is it  higgins elizas bolted  mrs higgins calmly continuing her writing you must have frightened her  higgins frightened her nonsense she was left last night as usual to turn out the lights and all that and instead of going to bed she changed her clothes and went right off her bed wasnt slept in she came in a cab for her things before seven this morning and that fool mrs pearce let her have them without telling me a word about it what am i to do  mrs higgins do without im afraid henry the girl has a perfect right to leave if she chooses  higgins wandering distractedly across the room but i cant find anything i dont know what appointments ive got im pickering comes in mrs higgins puts down her pen and turns away from the writingtable  pickering shaking hands goodmorning mrs higgins has henry told you he sits down on the ottoman  higgins what does that ass of an inspector say have you offered a reward  mrs higgins rising in indignant amazement you dont mean to say you have set the police after eliza  higgins of course what are the police for what else could we do he sits in the elizabethan chair  pickering the inspector made a lot of difficulties i really think he suspected us of some improper purpose  mrs higgins well of course he did what right have you to go to the police and give the girls name as if she were a thief or a lost umbrella or something really she sits down again deeply vexed  higgins but we want to find her  pickering we cant let her go like this you know mrs higgins what were we to do  mrs higgins you have no more sense either of you than two children why  the parlormaid comes in and breaks off the conversation  the parlormaid mr henry a gentleman wants to see you very particular hes been sent on from wimpole street  higgins oh bother i cant see anyone now who is it  the parlormaid a mr doolittle sir  pickering doolittle do you mean the dustman  the parlormaid dustman oh no sir a gentleman  higgins springing up excitedly by george pick its some relative of hers that shes gone to somebody we know nothing about to the parlormaid send him up quick  the parlormaid yes sir she goes  higgins eagerly going to his mother genteel relatives now we shall hear something he sits down in the chippendale chair  mrs higgins do you know any of her people  pickering only her father the fellow we told you about  the parlormaid announcing mr doolittle she withdraws  doolittle enters he is brilliantly dressed in a new fashionable frockcoat with white waistcoat and grey trousers a flower in his buttonhole a dazzling silk hat and patent leather shoes complete the effect he is too concerned with the business he has come on to notice mrs higgins he walks straight to higgins and accosts him with vehement reproach  doolittle indicating his own person see here do you see this you done this  higgins done what man  doolittle this i tell you look at it look at this hat look at this coat  pickering has eliza been buying you clothes  doolittle eliza not she not half why would she buy me clothes  mrs higgins goodmorning mr doolittle wont you sit down  doolittle taken aback as he becomes conscious that he has forgotten his hostess asking your pardon maam he approaches her and shakes her proffered hand thank you he sits down on the ottoman on pickerings right i am that full of what has happened to me that i cant think of anything else  higgins what the dickens has happened to you  doolittle i shouldnt mind if it had only happened to me anything might happen to anybody and nobody to blame but providence as you might say but this is something that you done to me yes you henry higgins  higgins have you found eliza thats the point  doolittle have you lost her  higgins yes  doolittle you have all the luck you have i aint found her but shell find me quick enough now after what you done to me  mrs higgins but what has my son done to you mr doolittle  doolittle done to me ruined me destroyed my happiness tied me up and delivered me into the hands of middle class morality  higgins rising intolerantly and standing over doolittle youre raving youre drunk youre mad i gave you five pounds after that i had two conversations with you at halfacrown an hour ive never seen you since  doolittle oh drunk am i mad am i tell me this did you or did you not write a letter to an old blighter in america that was giving five millions to found moral reform societies all over the world and that wanted you to invent a universal language for him  higgins what ezra d wannafeller hes dead he sits down again carelessly  doolittle yes hes dead and im done for now did you or did you not write a letter to him to say that the most original moralist at present in england to the best of your knowledge was alfred doolittle a common dustman  higgins oh after your last visit i remember making some silly joke of the kind  doolittle ah you may well call it a silly joke it put the lid on me right enough just give him the chance he wanted to show that americans is not like us that they recognize and respect merit in every class of life however humble them words is in his blooming will in which henry higgins thanks to your silly joking he leaves me a share in his predigested cheese trust worth three thousand a year on condition that i lecture for his wannafeller moral reform world league as often as they ask me up to six times a year  higgins the devil he does whew brightening suddenly what a lark  pickering a safe thing for you doolittle they wont ask you twice  doolittle it aint the lecturing i mind ill lecture them blue in the face i will and not turn a hair its making a gentleman of me that i object to who asked him to make a gentleman of me i was happy i was free i touched pretty nigh everybody for money when i wanted it same as i touched you henry higgins now i am worrited tied neck and heels and everybody touches me for money its a fine thing for you says my solicitor is it says i you mean its a good thing for you i says when i was a poor man and had a solicitor once when they found a pram in the dust cart he got me off and got shut of me and got me shut of him as quick as he could same with the doctors used to shove me out of the hospital before i could hardly stand on my legs and nothing to pay now they finds out that im not a healthy man and cant live unless they looks after me twice a day in the house im not let do a hands turn for myself somebody else must do it and touch me for it a year ago i hadnt a relative in the world except two or three that wouldnt speak to me now ive fifty and not a decent weeks wages among the lot of them i have to live for others and not for myself thats middle class morality you talk of losing eliza dont you be anxious i bet shes on my doorstep by this she that could support herself easy by selling flowers if i wasnt respectable and the next one to touch me will be you henry higgins ill have to learn to speak middle class language from you instead of speaking proper english thats where youll come in and i daresay thats what you done it for  mrs higgins but my dear mr doolittle you need not suffer all this if you are really in earnest nobody can force you to accept this bequest you can repudiate it isnt that so colonel pickering  pickering i believe so  doolittle softening his manner in deference to her sex thats the tragedy of it maam its easy to say chuck it but i havent the nerve which one of us has were all intimidated intimidated maam thats what we are what is there for me if i chuck it but the workhouse in my old age i have to dye my hair already to keep my job as a dustman if i was one of the deserving poor and had put by a bit i could chuck it but then why should i acause the deserving poor might as well be millionaires for all the happiness they ever has they dont know what happiness is but i as one of the undeserving poor have nothing between me and the paupers uniform but this here blasted three thousand a year that shoves me into the middle class excuse the expression maam youd use it yourself if you had my provocation theyve got you every way you turn its a choice between the skilly of the workhouse and the char bydis of the middle class and i havent the nerve for the workhouse intimidated thats what i am broke bought up happier men than me will call for my dust and touch me for their tip and ill look on helpless and envy them and thats what your son has brought me to he is overcome by emotion  mrs higgins well im very glad youre not going to do anything foolish mr doolittle for this solves the problem of elizas future you can provide for her now  doolittle with melancholy resignation yes maam im expected to provide for everyone now out of three thousand a year  higgins jumping up nonsense he cant provide for her he shant provide for her she doesnt belong to him i paid him five pounds for her doolittle either youre an honest man or a rogue  doolittle tolerantly a little of both henry like the rest of us a little of both  higgins well you took that money for the girl and you have no right to take her as well  mrs higgins henry dont be absurd if you really want to know where eliza is she is upstairs  higgins amazed upstairs then i shall jolly soon fetch her downstairs he makes resolutely for the door  mrs higgins rising and following him be quiet henry sit down  higgins i  mrs higgins sit down dear and listen to me  higgins oh very well very well very well he throws himself ungraciously on the ottoman with his face towards the windows but i think you might have told me this half an hour ago  mrs higgins eliza came to me this morning she passed the night partly walking about in a rage partly trying to throw herself into the river and being afraid to and partly in the carlton hotel she told me of the brutal way you two treated her  higgins bounding up again what  pickering rising also my dear mrs higgins shes been telling you stories we didnt treat her brutally we hardly said a word to her and we parted on particularly good terms turning on higgins higgins did you bully her after i went to bed  higgins just the other way about she threw my slippers in my face she behaved in the most outrageous way i never gave her the slightest provocation the slippers came bang into my face the moment i entered the roombefore i had uttered a word and used perfectly awful language  pickering astonished but why what did we do to her  mrs higgins i think i know pretty well what you did the girl is naturally rather affectionate i think isnt she mr doolittle  doolittle very tenderhearted maam takes after me  mrs higgins just so she had become attached to you both she worked very hard for you henry i dont think you quite realize what anything in the nature of brain work means to a girl like that well it seems that when the great day of trial came and she did this wonderful thing for you without making a single mistake you two sat there and never said a word to her but talked together of how glad you were that it was all over and how you had been bored with the whole thing and then you were surprised because she threw your slippers at you i should have thrown the fireirons at you  higgins we said nothing except that we were tired and wanted to go to bed did we pick  pickering shrugging his shoulders that was all  mrs higgins ironically quite sure  pickering absolutely really that was all  mrs higgins you didnt thank her or pet her or admire her or tell her how splendid shed been  higgins impatiently but she knew all about that we didnt make speeches to her if thats what you mean  pickering conscience stricken perhaps we were a little inconsiderate is she very angry  mrs higgins returning to her place at the writingtable well im afraid she wont go back to wimpole street especially now that mr doolittle is able to keep up the position you have thrust on her but she says she is quite willing to meet you on friendly terms and to let bygones be bygones  higgins furious is she by george ho  mrs higgins if you promise to behave yourself henry ill ask her to come down if not go home for you have taken up quite enough of my time  higgins oh all right very well pick you behave yourself let us put on our best sunday manners for this creature that we picked out of the mud he flings himself sulkily into the elizabethan chair  doolittle remonstrating now now henry higgins have some consideration for my feelings as a middle class man  mrs higgins remember your promise henry she presses the bellbutton on the writingtable mr doolittle will you be so good as to step out on the balcony for a moment i dont want eliza to have the shock of your news until she has made it up with these two gentlemen would you mind  doolittle as you wish lady anything to help henry to keep her off my hands he disappears through the window  the parlormaid answers the bell pickering sits down in doolittles place  mrs higgins ask miss doolittle to come down please  the parlormaid yes mam she goes out  mrs higgins now henry be good  higgins i am behaving myself perfectly  pickering he is doing his best mrs higgins  a pause higgins throws back his head stretches out his legs and begins to whistle  mrs higgins henry dearest you dont look at all nice in that attitude  higgins pulling himself together i was not trying to look nice mother  mrs higgins it doesnt matter dear i only wanted to make you speak  higgins why  mrs higgins because you cant speak and whistle at the same time  higgins groans another very trying pause  higgins springing up out of patience where the devil is that girl are we to wait here all day  eliza enters sunny selfpossessed and giving a staggeringly convincing exhibition of ease of manner she carries a little workbasket and is very much at home pickering is too much taken aback to rise  liza how do you do professor higgins are you quite well  higgins choking am i he can say no more  liza but of course you are you are never ill so glad to see you again colonel pickering he rises hastily and they shake hands quite chilly this morning isnt it she sits down on his left he sits beside her  higgins dont you dare try this game on me i taught it to you and it doesnt take me in get up and come home and dont be a fool  eliza takes a piece of needlework from her basket and begins to stitch at it without taking the least notice of this outburst  mrs higgins very nicely put indeed henry no woman could resist such an invitation  higgins you let her alone mother let her speak for herself you will jolly soon see whether she has an idea that i havent put into her head or a word that i havent put into her mouth i tell you i have created this thing out of the squashed cabbage leaves of covent garden and now she pretends to play the fine lady with me  mrs higgins placidly yes dear but youll sit down wont you  higgins sits down again savagely  liza to pickering taking no apparent notice of higgins and working away deftly will you drop me altogether now that the experiment is over colonel pickering  pickering oh dont you mustnt think of it as an experiment it shocks me somehow  liza oh im only a squashed cabbage leaf  pickering impulsively no  liza continuing quietlybut i owe so much to you that i should be very unhappy if you forgot me  pickering its very kind of you to say so miss doolittle  liza its not because you paid for my dresses i know you are generous to everybody with money but it was from you that i learnt really nice manners and that is what makes one a lady isnt it you see it was so very difficult for me with the example of professor higgins always before me i was brought up to be just like him unable to control myself and using bad language on the slightest provocation and i should never have known that ladies and gentlemen didnt behave like that if you hadnt been there  higgins well  pickering oh thats only his way you know he doesnt mean it  liza oh i didnt mean it either when i was a flower girl it was only my way but you see i did it and thats what makes the difference after all  pickering no doubt still he taught you to speak and i couldnt have done that you know  liza trivially of course that is his profession  higgins damnation  liza continuing it was just like learning to dance in the fashionable way there was nothing more than that in it but do you know what began my real education  pickering what  liza stopping her work for a moment your calling me miss doolittle that day when i first came to wimpole street that was the beginning of selfrespect for me she resumes her stitching and there were a hundred little things you never noticed because they came naturally to you things about standing up and taking off your hat and opening doors  pickering oh that was nothing  liza yes things that showed you thought and felt about me as if i were something better than a scullerymaid though of course i know you would have been just the same to a scullerymaid if she had been let in the drawingroom you never took off your boots in the dining room when i was there  pickering you mustnt mind that higgins takes off his boots all over the place  liza i know i am not blaming him it is his way isnt it but it made such a difference to me that you didnt do it you see really and truly apart from the things anyone can pick up the dressing and the proper way of speaking and so on the difference between a lady and a flower girl is not how she behaves but how shes treated i shall always be a flower girl to professor higgins because he always treats me as a flower girl and always will but i know i can be a lady to you because you always treat me as a lady and always will  mrs higgins please dont grind your teeth henry  pickering well this is really very nice of you miss doolittle  liza i should like you to call me eliza now if you would  pickering thank you eliza of course  liza and i should like professor higgins to call me miss doolittle  higgins ill see you damned first  mrs higgins henry henry  pickering laughing why dont you slang back at him dont stand it it would do him a lot of good  liza i cant i could have done it once but now i cant go back to it last night when i was wandering about a girl spoke to me and i tried to get back into the old way with her but it was no use you told me you know that when a child is brought to a foreign country it picks up the language in a few weeks and forgets its own well i am a child in your country i have forgotten my own language and can speak nothing but yours thats the real breakoff with the corner of tottenham court road leaving wimpole street finishes it  pickering much alarmed oh but youre coming back to wimpole street arent you youll forgive higgins  higgins rising forgive will she by george let her go let her find out how she can get on without us she will relapse into the gutter in three weeks without me at her elbow  doolittle appears at the centre window with a look of dignified reproach at higgins he comes slowly and silently to his daughter who with her back to the window is unconscious of his approach  pickering hes incorrigible eliza you wont relapse will you  liza no not now never again i have learnt my lesson i dont believe i could utter one of the old sounds if i tried doolittle touches her on her left shoulder she drops her work losing her selfpossession utterly at the spectacle of her fathers splendor aaaaaahowooh  higgins with a crow of triumph aha just so aaaaahowooh aaaaahowooh  aaaaahowooh victory victory he throws himself on the divan folding his arms and spraddling arrogantly  doolittle can you blame the girl dont look at me like that eliza it aint my fault ive come into money  liza  you must have touched a millionaire this time dad  doolittle i have but im dressed something special today im going to st georges hanover square your stepmother is going to marry me  liza angrily youre going to let yourself down to marry that low common woman  pickering quietly he ought to eliza to doolittle why has she changed her mind  doolittle sadly intimidated governor intimidated middle class morality claims its victim wont you put on your hat liza and come and see me turned off  liza if the colonel says i must iill almost sobbing ill demean myself and get insulted for my pains like enough  doolittle dont be afraid she never comes to words with anyone now poor woman respectability has broke all the spirit out of her  pickering squeezing elizas elbow gently be kind to them eliza make the best of it  liza forcing a little smile for him through her vexation oh well just to show theres no ill feeling ill be back in a moment she goes out  doolittle sitting down beside pickering i feel uncommon nervous about the ceremony colonel i wish youd come and see me through it  pickering but youve been through it before man you were married to elizas mother  doolittle who told you that colonel  pickering well nobody told me but i concluded naturally  doolittle no that aint the natural way colonel its only the middle class way my way was always the undeserving way but dont say nothing to eliza she dont know i always had a delicacy about telling her  pickering quite right well leave it so if you dont mind  doolittle and youll come to the church colonel and put me through straight  pickering with pleasure as far as a bachelor can  mrs higgins may i come mr doolittle i should be very sorry to miss your wedding  doolittle i should indeed be honored by your condescension maam and my poor old woman would take it as a tremenjous compliment shes been very low thinking of the happy days that are no more  mrs higgins rising ill order the carriage and get ready the men rise except higgins i shant be more than fifteen minutes as she goes to the door eliza comes in hatted and buttoning her gloves im going to the church to see your father married eliza you had better come in the brougham with me colonel pickering can go on with the bridegroom  mrs higgins goes out eliza comes to the middle of the room between the centre window and the ottoman pickering joins her  doolittle bridegroom what a word it makes a man realize his position somehow he takes up his hat and goes towards the door  pickering before i go eliza do forgive him and come back to us  liza i dont think papa would allow me would you dad  doolittle sad but magnanimous they played you off very cunning eliza them two sportsmen if it had been only one of them you could have nailed him but you see there was two and one of them chaperoned the other as you might say to pickering it was artful of you colonel but i bear no malice i should have done the same myself i been the victim of one woman after another all my life and i dont grudge you two getting the better of eliza i shant interfere its time for us to go colonel so long henry see you in st georges eliza he goes out  pickering coaxing do stay with us eliza he follows doolittle  eliza goes out on the balcony to avoid being alone with higgins he rises and joins her there she immediately comes back into the room and makes for the door but he goes along the balcony quickly and gets his back to the door before she reaches it  higgins well eliza youve had a bit of your own back as you call it have you had enough and are you going to be reasonable or do you want any more  liza you want me back only to pick up your slippers and put up with your tempers and fetch and carry for you  higgins i havent said i wanted you back at all  liza oh indeed then what are we talking about  higgins about you not about me if you come back i shall treat you just as i have always treated you i cant change my nature and i dont intend to change my manners my manners are exactly the same as colonel pickerings  liza thats not true he treats a flower girl as if she was a duchess  higgins and i treat a duchess as if she was a flower girl  liza i see she turns away composedly and sits on the ottoman facing the window the same to everybody  higgins just so  liza like father  higgins grinning a little taken down without accepting the comparison at all points eliza its quite true that your father is not a snob and that he will be quite at home in any station of life to which his eccentric destiny may call him seriously the great secret eliza is not having bad manners or good manners or any other particular sort of manners but having the same manner for all human souls in short behaving as if you were in heaven where there are no thirdclass carriages and one soul is as good as another  liza amen you are a born preacher  higgins irritated the question is not whether i treat you rudely but whether you ever heard me treat anyone else better  liza with sudden sincerity i dont care how you treat me i dont mind your swearing at me i dont mind a black eye ive had one before this but standing up and facing him i wont be passed over  higgins then get out of my way for i wont stop for you you talk about me as if i were a motor bus  liza so you are a motor bus all bounce and go and no consideration for anyone but i can do without you dont think i cant  higgins i know you can i told you you could  liza wounded getting away from him to the other side of the ottoman with her face to the hearth i know you did you brute you wanted to get rid of me  higgins liar  liza thank you she sits down with dignity  higgins you never asked yourself i suppose whether i could do without you  liza earnestly dont you try to get round me youll have to do without me  higgins arrogant i can do without anybody i have my own soul my own spark of divine fire but with sudden humility i shall miss you eliza he sits down near her on the ottoman i have learnt something from your idiotic notions i confess that humbly and gratefully and i have grown accustomed to your voice and appearance i like them rather  liza well you have both of them on your gramophone and in your book of photographs when you feel lonely without me you can turn the machine on its got no feelings to hurt  higgins i cant turn your soul on leave me those feelings and you can take away the voice and the face they are not you  liza oh you are a devil you can twist the heart in a girl as easy as some could twist her arms to hurt her mrs pearce warned me time and again she has wanted to leave you and you always got round her at the last minute and you dont care a bit for her and you dont care a bit for me  higgins i care for life for humanity and you are a part of it that has come my way and been built into my house what more can you or anyone ask  liza i wont care for anybody that doesnt care for me  higgins commercial principles eliza like reproducing her covent garden pronunciation with professional exactness syollin voylets selling violets isnt it  liza dont sneer at me its mean to sneer at me  higgins i have never sneered in my life sneering doesnt become either the human face or the human soul i am expressing my righteous contempt for commercialism i dont and wont trade in affection you call me a brute because you couldnt buy a claim on me by fetching my slippers and finding my spectacles you were a fool i think a woman fetching a mans slippers is a disgusting sight did i ever fetch your slippers i think a good deal more of you for throwing them in my face no use slaving for me and then saying you want to be cared for who cares for a slave if you come back come back for the sake of good fellowship for youll get nothing else youve had a thousand times as much out of me as i have out of you and if you dare to set up your little dogs tricks of fetching and carrying slippers against my creation of a duchess eliza ill slam the door in your silly face  liza what did you do it for if you didnt care for me  higgins heartily why because it was my job  liza you never thought of the trouble it would make for me  higgins would the world ever have been made if its maker had been afraid of making trouble making life means making trouble theres only one way of escaping trouble and thats killing things cowards you notice are always shrieking to have troublesome people killed  liza im no preacher i dont notice things like that i notice that you dont notice me  higgins jumping up and walking about intolerantly eliza youre an idiot i waste the treasures of my miltonic mind by spreading them before you once for all understand that i go my way and do my work without caring twopence what happens to either of us i am not intimidated like your father and your stepmother so you can come back or go to the devil which you please  liza what am i to come back for  higgins bouncing up on his knees on the ottoman and leaning over it to her for the fun of it thats why i took you on  liza with averted face and you may throw me out tomorrow if i dont do everything you want me to  higgins yes and you may walk out tomorrow if i dont do everything you want me to  liza and live with my stepmother  higgins yes or sell flowers  liza oh if i only could go back to my flower basket i should be independent of both you and father and all the world why

henry but never mind dear ill buy you the tie and gloves  higgins sunnily oh dont bother shell buy em all right enough goodbye  they kiss mrs higgins runs out higgins left alone rattles his cash in his pocket chuckles and disports himself in a highly selfsatisfied manner                        the rest of the story need not be shown in action and indeed would hardly need telling if our imaginations were not so enfeebled by their lazy dependence on the readymakes and reachmedowns of the ragshop in which romance keeps its stock of happy endings to misfit all stories now the history of eliza doolittle though called a romance because of the transfiguration it records seems exceedingly improbable is common enough such transfigurations have been achieved by hundreds of resolutely ambitious young women since nell gwynne set them the example by playing queens and fascinating kings in the theatre in which she began by selling oranges nevertheless people in all directions have assumed for no other reason than that she became the heroine of a romance that she must have married the hero of it this is unbearable not only because her little drama if acted on such a thoughtless assumption must be spoiled but because the true sequel is patent to anyone with a sense of human nature in general and of feminine instinct in particular  eliza in telling higgins she would not marry him if he asked her was not coquetting she was announcing a wellconsidered decision when a bachelor interests and dominates and teaches and becomes important to a spinster as higgins with eliza she always if she has character enough to be capable of it considers very seriously indeed whether she will play for becoming that bachelors wife especially if he is so little interested in marriage that a determined and devoted woman might capture him if she set herself resolutely to do it her decision will depend a good deal on whether she is really free to choose and that again will depend on her age and income if she is at the end of her youth and has no security for her livelihood she will marry him because she must marry anybody who will provide for her but at elizas age a goodlooking girl does not feel that pressure she feels free to pick and choose she is therefore guided by her instinct in the matter elizas instinct tells her not to marry higgins it does not tell her to give him up it is not in the slightest doubt as to his remaining one of the strongest personal interests in her life it would be very sorely strained if there was another woman likely to supplant her with him but as she feels sure of him on that last point she has no doubt at all as to her course and would not have any even if the difference of twenty years in age which seems so great to youth did not exist between them  as our own instincts are not appealed to by her conclusion let us see whether we cannot discover some reason in it when higgins excused his indifference to young women on the ground that they had an irresistible rival in his mother he gave the clue to his inveterate oldbachelordom the case is uncommon only to the extent that remarkable mothers are uncommon if an imaginative boy has a sufficiently rich mother who has intelligence personal grace dignity of character without harshness and a cultivated sense of the best art of her time to enable her to make her house beautiful she sets a standard for him against which very few women can struggle besides effecting for him a disengagement of his affections his sense of beauty and his idealism from his specifically sexual impulses this makes him a standing puzzle to the huge number of uncultivated people who have been brought up in tasteless homes by commonplace or disagreeable parents and to whom consequently literature painting sculpture music and affectionate personal relations come as modes of sex if they come at all the word passion means nothing else to them and that higgins could have a passion for phonetics and idealize his mother instead of eliza would seem to them absurd and unnatural nevertheless when we look round and see that hardly anyone is too ugly or disagreeable to find a wife or a husband if he or she wants one whilst many old maids and bachelors are above the average in quality and culture we cannot help suspecting that the disentanglement of sex from the associations with which it is so commonly confused a disentanglement which persons of genius achieve by sheer intellectual analysis is sometimes produced or aided by parental fascination  now though eliza was incapable of thus explaining to herself higginss formidable powers of resistance to the charm that prostrated freddy at the first glance she was instinctively aware that she could never obtain a complete grip of him or come between him and his mother the first necessity of the married woman to put it shortly she knew that for some mysterious reason he had not the makings of a married man in him according to her conception of a husband as one to whom she would be his nearest and fondest and warmest interest even had there been no motherrival she would still have refused to accept an interest in herself that was secondary to philosophic interests had mrs higgins died there would still have been milton and the universal alphabet landors remark that to those who have the greatest power of loving love is a secondary affair would not have recommended landor to eliza put that along with her resentment of higginss domineering superiority and her mistrust of his coaxing cleverness in getting round her and evading her wrath when he had gone too far with his impetuous bullying and you will see that elizas instinct had good grounds for warning her not to marry her pygmalion  and now whom did eliza marry for if higgins was a predestinate old bachelor she was most certainly not a predestinate old maid well that can be told very shortly to those who have not guessed it from the indications she has herself given them  almost immediately after eliza is stung into proclaiming her considered determination not to marry higgins she mentions the fact that young mr frederick eynsford hill is pouring out his love for her daily through the post now freddy is young practically twenty years younger than higgins he is a gentleman or as eliza would qualify him a toff and speaks like one he is nicely dressed is treated by the colonel as an equal loves her unaffectedly and is not her master nor ever likely to dominate her in spite of his advantage of social standing eliza has no use for the foolish romantic tradition that all women love to be mastered if not actually bullied and beaten when you go to women says nietzsche take your whip with you sensible despots have never confined that precaution to women they have taken their whips with them when they have dealt with men and been slavishly idealized by the men over whom they have flourished the whip much more than by women no doubt there are slavish women as well as slavish men and women like men admire those that are stronger than themselves but to admire a strong person and to live under that strong persons thumb are two different things the weak may not be admired and heroworshipped but they are by no means disliked or shunned and they never seem to have the least difficulty in marrying people who are too good for them they may fail in emergencies but life is not one long emergency it is mostly a string of situations for which no exceptional strength is needed and with which even rather weak people can cope if they have a stronger partner to help them out accordingly it is a truth everywhere in evidence that strong people masculine or feminine not only do not marry stronger people but do not show any preference for them in selecting their friends when a lion meets another with a louder roar the first lion thinks the last a bore the man or woman who feels strong enough for two seeks for every other quality in a partner than strength  the converse is also true weak people want to marry strong people who do not frighten them too much and this often leads them to make the mistake we describe metaphorically as biting off more than they can chew they want too much for too little and when the bargain is unreasonable beyond all bearing the union becomes impossible it ends in the weaker party being either discarded or borne as a cross which is worse people who are not only weak but silly or obtuse as well are often in these difficulties  this being the state of human affairs what is eliza fairly sure to do when she is placed between freddy and higgins will she look forward to a lifetime of fetching higginss slippers or to a lifetime of freddy fetching hers there can be no doubt about the answer unless freddy is biologically repulsive to her and higgins biologically attractive to a degree that overwhelms all her other instincts she will if she marries either of them marry freddy  and that is just what eliza did  complications ensued but they were economic not romantic freddy had no money and no occupation his mothers jointure a last relic of the opulence of largelady park had enabled her to struggle along in earlscourt with an air of gentility but not to procure any serious secondary education for her children much less give the boy a profession a clerkship at thirty shillings a week was beneath freddys dignity and extremely distasteful to him besides his prospects consisted of a hope that if he kept up appearances somebody would do something for him the something appeared vaguely to his imagination as a private secretaryship or a sinecure of some sort to his mother it perhaps appeared as a marriage to some lady of means who could not resist her boys niceness fancy her feelings when he married a flower girl who had become declassee under extraordinary circumstances which were now notorious  it is true that elizas situation did not seem wholly ineligible her father though formerly a dustman and now fantastically disclassed had become extremely popular in the smartest society by a social talent which triumphed over every prejudice and every disadvantage rejected by the middle class which he loathed he had shot up at once into the highest circles by his wit his dustmanship which he carried like a banner and his nietzschean transcendence of good and evil at intimate ducal dinners he sat on the right hand of the duchess and in country houses he smoked in the pantry and was made much of by the butler when he was not feeding in the diningroom and being consulted by cabinet ministers but he found it almost as hard to do all this on four thousand a year as mrs eynsford hill to live in earlscourt on an income so pitiably smaller that i have not the heart to disclose its exact figure he absolutely refused to add the last straw to his burden by contributing to elizas support  thus freddy and eliza now mr and mrs eynsford hill would have spent a penniless honeymoon but for a wedding present of 500 pounds from the colonel to eliza it lasted a long time because freddy did not know how to spend money never having had any to spend and eliza socially trained by a pair of old bachelors wore her clothes as long as they held together and looked pretty without the least regard to their being many months out of fashion still 500 pounds will not last two young people for ever and they both knew and eliza felt as well that they must shift for themselves in the end she could quarter herself on wimpole street because it had come to be her home but she was quite aware that she ought not to quarter freddy there and that it would not be good for his character if she did  not that the wimpole street bachelors objected when she consulted them higgins declined to be bothered about her housing problem when that solution was so simple elizas desire to have freddy in the house with her seemed of no more importance than if she had wanted an extra piece of bedroom furniture pleas as to freddys character and the moral obligation on him to earn his own living were lost on higgins he denied that freddy had any character and declared that if he tried to do any useful work some competent person would have the trouble of undoing it a procedure involving a net loss to the community and great unhappiness to freddy himself who was obviously intended by nature for such light work as amusing eliza which higgins declared was a much more useful and honorable occupation than working in the city when eliza referred again to her project of teaching phonetics higgins abated not a jot of his violent opposition to it he said she was not within ten years of being qualified to meddle with his pet subject and as it was evident that the colonel agreed with him she felt she could not go against them in this grave matter and that she had no right without higginss consent to exploit the knowledge he had given her for his knowledge seemed to her as much his private property as his watch eliza was no communist besides she was superstitiously devoted to them both more entirely and frankly after her marriage than before it  it was the colonel who finally solved the problem which had cost him much perplexed cogitation he one day asked eliza rather shyly whether she had quite given up her notion of keeping a flower shop she replied that she had thought of it but had put it out of her head because the colonel had said that day at mrs higginss that it would never do the colonel confessed that when he said that he had not quite recovered from the dazzling impression of the day before they broke the matter to higgins that evening the sole comment vouchsafed by him very nearly led to a serious quarrel with eliza it was to the effect that she would have in freddy an ideal errand boy  freddy himself was next sounded on the subject he said he had been thinking of a shop himself though it had presented itself to his pennilessness as a small place in which eliza should sell tobacco at one counter whilst he sold newspapers at the opposite one but he agreed that it would be extraordinarily jolly to go early every morning with eliza to covent garden and buy flowers on the scene of their first meeting a sentiment which earned him many kisses from his wife he added that he had always been afraid to propose anything of the sort because clara would make an awful row about a step that must damage her matrimonial chances and his mother could not be expected to like it after clinging for so many years to that step of the social ladder on which retail trade is impossible  this difficulty was removed by an event highly unexpected by freddys mother clara in the course of her incursions into those artistic circles which were the highest within her reach discovered that her conversational qualifications were expected to include a grounding in the novels of mr hg wells she borrowed them in various directions so energetically that she swallowed them all within two months the result was a conversion of a kind quite common today a modern acts of the apostles would fill fifty whole bibles if anyone were capable of writing it  poor clara who appeared to higgins and his mother as a disagreeable and ridiculous person and to her own mother as in some inexplicable way a social failure had never seen herself in either light for though to some extent ridiculed and mimicked in west kensington like everybody else there she was accepted as a rational and normalor shall we say inevitablesort of human being at worst they called her the pusher but to them no more than to herself had it ever occurred that she was pushing the air and pushing it in a wrong direction still she was not happy she was growing desperate her one asset the fact that her mother was what the epsom greengrocer called a carriage lady had no exchange value apparently it had prevented her from getting educated because the only education she could have afforded was education with the earlscourt green grocers daughter it had led her to seek the society of her mothers class and that class simply would not have her because she was much poorer than the greengrocer and far from being able to afford a maid could not afford even a housemaid and had to scrape along at home with an illiberally treated general servant under such circumstances nothing could give her an air of being a genuine product of largelady park and yet its tradition made her regard a marriage with anyone within her reach as an unbearable humiliation commercial people and professional people in a small way were odious to her she ran after painters and novelists but she did not charm them and her bold attempts to pick up and practise artistic and literary talk irritated them she was in short an utter failure an ignorant incompetent pretentious unwelcome penniless useless little snob and though she did not admit these disqualifications for nobody ever faces unpleasant truths of this kind until the possibility of a way out dawns on them she felt their effects too keenly to be satisfied with her position  clara had a startling eyeopener when on being suddenly wakened to enthusiasm by a girl of her own age who dazzled her and produced in her a gushing desire to take her for a model and gain her friendship she discovered that this exquisite apparition had graduated from the gutter in a few months time it shook her so violently that when mr h g wells lifted her on the point of his puissant pen and placed her at the angle of view from which the life she was leading and the society to which she clung appeared in its true relation to real human needs and worthy social structure he effected a conversion and a conviction of sin comparable to the most sensational feats of general booth or gypsy smith claras snobbery went bang life suddenly began to move with her without knowing how or why she began to make friends and enemies some of the acquaintances to whom she had been a tedious or indifferent or ridiculous affliction dropped her others became cordial to her amazement she found that some quite nice people were saturated with wells and that this accessibility to ideas was the secret of their niceness people she had thought deeply religious and had tried to conciliate on that tack with disastrous results suddenly took an interest in her and revealed a hostility to conventional religion which she had never conceived possible except among the most desperate characters they made her read galsworthy and galsworthy exposed the vanity of largelady park and finished her it exasperated her to think that the dungeon in which she had languished for so many unhappy years had been unlocked all the time and that the impulses she had so carefully struggled with and stifled for the sake of keeping well with society were precisely those by which alone she could have come into any sort of sincere human contact in the radiance of these discoveries and the tumult of their reaction she made a fool of herself as freely and conspicuously as when she so rashly adopted elizas expletive in mrs higginss drawingroom for the newborn wellsian had to find her bearings almost as ridiculously as a baby but nobody hates a baby for its ineptitudes or thinks the worse of it for trying to eat the matches and clara lost no friends by her follies they laughed at her to her face this time and she had to defend herself and fight it out as best she could  when freddy paid a visit to earlscourt which he never did when he could possibly help it to make the desolating announcement that he and his eliza were thinking of blackening the largelady scutcheon by opening a shop he found the little household already convulsed by a prior announcement from clara that she also was going to work in an old furniture shop in dover street which had been started by a fellow wellsian this appointment clara owed after all to her old social accomplishment of push she had made up her mind that cost what it might she would see mr wells in the flesh and she had achieved her end at a garden party she had better luck than so rash an enterprise deserved mr wells came up to her expectations age had not withered him nor could custom stale his infinite variety in half an hour his pleasant neatness and compactness his small hands and feet his teeming ready brain his unaffected accessibility and a certain fine apprehensiveness which stamped him as susceptible from his topmost hair to his tipmost toe proved irresistible clara talked of nothing else for weeks and weeks afterwards and as she happened to talk to the lady of the furniture shop and that lady also desired above all things to know mr wells and sell pretty things to him she offered clara a job on the chance of achieving that end through her  and so it came about that elizas luck held and the expected opposition to the flower shop melted away the shop is in the arcade of a railway station not very far from the victoria and albert museum and if you live in that neighborhood you may go there any day and buy a buttonhole from eliza  now here is a last opportunity for romance would you not like to be assured that the shop was an immense success thanks to elizas charms and her early business experience in covent garden alas the truth is the truth the shop did not pay for a long time simply because eliza and her freddy did not know how to keep it true eliza had not to begin at the very beginning she knew the names and prices of the cheaper flowers and her elation was unbounded when she found that freddy like all youths educated at cheap pretentious and thoroughly inefficient schools knew a little latin it was very little but enough to make him appear to her a porson or bentley and to put him at his ease with botanical nomenclature unfortunately he knew nothing else and eliza though she could count money up to eighteen shillings or so and had acquired a certain familiarity with the language of milton from her struggles to qualify herself for winning higginss bet could not write out a bill without utterly disgracing the establishment freddys power of stating in latin that balbus built a wall and that gaul was divided into three parts did not carry with it the slightest knowledge of accounts or business colonel pickering had to explain to him what a cheque book and a bank account meant and the pair were by no means easily teachable freddy backed up eliza in her obstinate refusal to believe that they could save money by engaging a bookkeeper with some knowledge of the business how they argued could you possibly save money by going to extra expense when you already could not make both ends meet but the colonel after making the ends meet over and over again at last gently insisted and eliza humbled to the dust by having to beg from him so often and stung by the uproarious derision of higgins to whom the notion of freddy succeeding at anything was a joke that never palled grasped the fact that business like phonetics has to be learned  on the piteous spectacle of the pair spending their evenings in shorthand schools and polytechnic classes learning bookkeeping and typewriting with incipient junior clerks male and female from the elementary schools let me not dwell there were even classes at the london school of economics and a humble personal appeal to the director of that institution to recommend a course bearing on the flower business he being a humorist explained to them the method of the celebrated dickensian essay on chinese metaphysics by the gentleman who read an article on china and an article on metaphysics and combined the information he suggested that they should combine the london school with kew gardens eliza to whom the procedure of the dickensian gentleman seemed perfectly correct as in fact it was and not in the least funny which was only her ignorance took his advice with entire gravity but the effort that cost her the deepest humiliation was a request to higgins whose pet artistic fancy next to miltons verse was calligraphy and who himself wrote a most beautiful italian hand that he would teach her to write he declared that she was congenitally incapable of forming a single letter worthy of the least of miltons words but she persisted and again he suddenly threw himself into the task of teaching her with a combination of stormy intensity concentrated patience and occasional bursts of interesting disquisition on the beauty and nobility the august mission and destiny of human handwriting eliza ended by acquiring an extremely uncommercial script which was a positive extension of her personal beauty and spending three times as much on stationery as anyone else because certain qualities and shapes of paper became indispensable to her she could not even address an envelope in the usual way because it made the margins all wrong  their commercial school days were a period of disgrace and despair for the young couple they seemed to be learning nothing about flower shops at last they gave it up as hopeless and shook the dust of the shorthand schools and the polytechnics and the london school of economics from their feet for ever besides the business was in some mysterious way beginning to take care of itself they had somehow forgotten their objections to employing other people they came to the conclusion that their own way was the best and that they had really a remarkable talent for business the colonel who had been compelled for some years to keep a sufficient sum on current account at his bankers to make up their deficits found that the provision was unnecessary the young people were prospering it is true that there was not quite fair play between them and their competitors in trade their weekends in the country cost them nothing and saved them the price of their sunday dinners for the motor car was the colonels and he and higgins paid the hotel bills mr f hill florist and greengrocer they soon discovered that there was money in asparagus and asparagus led to other vegetables had an air which stamped the business as classy and in private life he was still frederick eynsford hill esquire not that there was any swank about him nobody but eliza knew that he had been christened frederick challoner eliza herself swanked like anything  that is all that is how it has turned out it is astonishing how much eliza still manages to meddle in the housekeeping at wimpole street in spite of the shop and her own family and it is notable that though she never nags her husband and frankly loves the colonel as if she were his favorite daughter she has never got out of the habit of nagging higgins that was established on the fatal night when she won his bet for him she snaps his head off on the faintest provocation or on none he no longer dares to tease her by assuming an abysmal inferiority of freddys mind to his own he storms and bullies and derides but she stands up to him so ruthlessly that the colonel has to ask her from time to time to be kinder to higgins and it is the only request of his that brings a mulish expression into her face nothing but some emergency or calamity great enough to break down all likes and dislikes and throw them both back on their common humanityand may they be spared any such trialwill ever alter this she knows that higgins does not need her just as her father did not need her the very scrupulousness with which he told her that day that he had become used to having her there and dependent on her for all sorts of little services and that he should miss her if she went away it would never have occurred to freddy or the colonel to say anything of the sort deepens her inner certainty that she is no more to him than them slippers yet she has a sense too that his indifference is deeper than the infatuation of commoner souls she is immensely interested in him she has even secret mischievous moments in which she wishes she could get him alone on a desert island away from all ties and with nobody else in the world to consider and just drag him off his pedestal and see him making love like any common man we all have private imaginations of that sort but when it comes to business to the life that she really leads as distinguished from the life of dreams and fancies she likes freddy and she likes the colonel and she does not like higgins and mr doolittle galatea never does quite like pygmalion his relation to her is too godlike to be altogether agreeable
