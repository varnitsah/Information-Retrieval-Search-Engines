13846800	the reverberator   by henry james     i  i guess my daughters in here the old man said leading the way into the little salon de lecture he was not of the most advanced age but that is the way george flack considered him and indeed he looked older than he was george flack had found him sitting in the court of the hotelhe sat a great deal in the court of the hoteland had gone up to him with characteristic directness and asked him for miss francina poor mr dosson had with the greatest docility disposed himself to wait on the young man he had as a matter of course risen and made his way across the court to announce to his child that she had a visitor he looked submissive almost servile as he preceded the visitor thrusting his head forward in his quest but it was not in mr flacks line to notice that sort of thing he accepted the old gentlemans good offices as he would have accepted those of a waiter conveying no hint of an attention paid also to himself an observer of these two persons would have assured himself that the degree to which mr dosson thought it natural any one should want to see his daughter was only equalled by the degree to which the young man thought it natural her father should take trouble to produce her there was a superfluous drapery in the doorway of the salon de lecture which mr dosson pushed aside while george flack stepped in after him  the readingroom of the hotel de lunivers et de cheltenham was none too ample and had seemed to mr dosson from the first to consist principally of a highlypolished floor on the bareness of which it was easy for a relaxed elderly american to slip it was composed further to his perception of a table with a green velvet cloth of a fireplace with a great deal of fringe and no fire of a window with a great deal of curtain and no light and of the figaro which he couldnt read and the new york herald which he had already read a single person was just now in possession of these conveniencesa young lady who sat with her back to the window looking straight before her into the conventional room she was dressed as for the street her empty hands rested upon the arms of her chairshe had withdrawn her long gloves which were lying in her lapand she seemed to be doing nothing as hard as she could her face was so much in shadow as to be barely distinguishable nevertheless the young man had a disappointed cry as soon as he saw her why it aint miss francieits miss delia  well i guess we can fix that said mr dosson wandering further into the room and drawing his feet over the floor without lifting them whatever he did he ever seemed to wander he had an impermanent transitory air an aspect of weary yet patient nonarrival even when he sat as he was capable of sitting for hours in the court of the inn as he glanced down at the two newspapers in their desert of green velvet he raised a hopeless uninterested glass to his eye delia dear wheres your little sister  delia made no movement whatever nor did any expression so far as could be perceived pass over her large young face she only ejaculated why mr flack where did you drop from  well this is a good place to meet her father remarked as if mildly and as a mere passing suggestion to deprecate explanations  any place is good where one meets old friends said george flack looking also at the newspapers he examined the date of the american sheet and then put it down well how do you like paris he subsequently went on to the young lady  we quite enjoy it but of course were familiar now  well i was in hopes i could show you something mr flack said  i guess theyve seen most everything mr dosson observed  well weve seen more than you exclaimed his daughter  well ive seen a good dealjust sitting there  a person with delicate ear might have suspected mr dosson of a tendency to setting but he would pronounce the same word in a different manner at different times  well in paris you can see everything said the young man im quite enthusiastic about paris  havent you been here before miss delia asked  oh yes but its ever fresh and how is miss francie  shes all right she has gone upstairs to get something i guess were going out again  its very attractive for the young mr dosson pleaded to the visitor  well then im one of the young do you mind if i go with you mr flack continued to the girl  itll seem like old times on the deck she replied were going to the bon marche  why dont you go to the louvre thats the place for you  weve just come from there weve had quite a morning  well its a good place the visitor a trifle dryly opined  its good for some things but it doesnt come up to my idea for others  oh theyve seen everything said mr dosson then he added i guess ill go and call francie  well tell her to hurry miss delia returned swinging a glove in each hand  she knows my pace mr flack remarked  i should think she would the way you raced the girl returned with memories of the umbria i hope you dont expect to rush round paris that way  i always rush i live in a rush thats the way to get through  well i am through i guess said mr dosson philosophically  well i aint his daughter declared with decision  well you must come round often he continued to their friend as a leavetaking  oh ill come round ill have to rush but ill do it  ill send down francie and francies father crept away  and please give her some more money her sister called after him  does she keep the money george flack enquired  keep it mr dosson stopped as he pushed aside the portiere oh you innocent young man  i guess its the first time you were ever called innocent cried delia left alone with the visitor  well i wasbefore i came to paris  well i cant see that it has hurt us we aint a speck extravagant  wouldnt you have a right to be  i dont think any one has a right to be miss dosson returned incorruptibly  the young man who had seated himself looked at her a moment  thats the way you used to talk  well i havent changed  and miss franciehas she  well youll see said delia dosson beginning to draw on her gloves  her companion watched her leaning forward with his elbows on the arms of his chair and his hands interlocked at last he said interrogatively bon marche  no i got them in a little place i know  well theyre paris anyway  of course theyre paris but you can get gloves anywhere  you must show me the little place anyhow mr flack continued sociably and he observed further and with the same friendliness the old gentleman seems all there  oh hes the dearest of the dear  hes a real gentlemanof the old stamp said george flack  well what should you think our father would be  i should think hed be delighted  well he is when we carry out our plans  and what are theyyour plans asked the young man  oh i never tell them  how then does he know whether you carry them out  well i guess hed know it if we didnt said the girl  i remember how secretive you were last year you kept everything to yourself  well i know what i want the young lady pursued  he watched her button one of her gloves deftly using a hairpin released from some mysterious office under her bonnet there was a moments silence after which they looked up at each other ive an idea you dont want me said george flack  oh yes i doas a friend  of all the mean ways of trying to get rid of a man thats the meanest he rang out  wheres the meanness when i suppose youre not so ridiculous as to wish to be anything more  more to your sister do you meanor to yourself  my sister is myselfi havent got any other said delia dosson  any other sister  dont be idiotic are you still in the same business the girl went on  well i forget which one i was in  why something to do with that newspaperdont you remember  yes but it isnt that paper any moreits a different one  do you go round for newsin the same way  well i try to get the people what they want its hard work said the young man  well i suppose if you didnt some one else would they will have it wont they  yes they will have it the wants of the people however appeared at the present moment to interest mr flack less than his own he looked at his watch and remarked that the old gentleman didnt seem to have much authority  what do you mean by that the girl asked  why with miss francie shes taking her time or rather i mean shes taking mine  well if you expect to do anything with her you must give her plenty of that delia returned  all right ill give her all i have and miss dossons interlocutor leaned back in his chair with folded arms as to signify how much if it came to that she might have to count with his patience but she sat there easy and empty giving no sign and fearing no future he was the first indeed to turn again to restlessness at the end of a few moments he asked the young lady if she didnt suppose her father had told her sister who it was  do you think thats all thats required she made answer with cold gaiety but she added more familiarly probably thats the reason shes so shy  oh yesshe used to look it  no thats her peculiarity that she never looks it and yet suffers everything  well you make it up for her then miss delia the young man ventured to declare you dont suffer much  no for francie im all there i guess i could act for her  he had a pause you act for her too much if it wasnt for you i think i could do something  well youve got to kill me first delia dosson replied  ill come down on you somehow in the reverberator he went on  but the threat left her calm oh thats not what the people want  no unfortunately they dont care anything about my affairs  well we do were kinder than most francie and i said the girl but we desire to keep your affairs quite distinct from ours  oh youryours if i could only discover what they are cried george flack and during the rest of the time that they waited the young journalist tried to find out if an observer had chanced to be present for the quarter of an hour that elapsed and had had any attention to give to these vulgar young persons he would have wondered perhaps at there being so much mystery on one side and so much curiosity on the otherwondered at least at the elaboration of inscrutable projects on the part of a girl who looked to the casual eye as if she were stolidly passive fidelia dosson whose name had been shortened was twentyfive years old and had a large white face in which the eyes were far apart her forehead was high but her mouth was small her hair was light and colourless and a certain inelegant thickness of figure made her appear shorter than she was elegance indeed had not been her natural portion and the bon marche and other establishments had to make up for that to a casual sisters eye they would scarce have appeared to have acquitted themselves of their office but even a woman wouldnt have guessed how little fidelia cared she always looked the same all the contrivances of paris couldnt fill out that blank and she held them for herself in no manner of esteem it was a plain clean round pattern face marked for recognition among so many only perhaps by a small figure the sprig on a china plate that might have denoted deep obstinacy and yet with its settled smoothness it was neither stupid nor hard it was as calm as a room kept dusted and aired for candid earnest occasions the meeting of unanimous committees and the discussion of flourishing businesses if she had been a young manand she had a little the head of oneit would probably have been thought of her that she was likely to become a doctor or a judge  an observer would have gathered further that mr flacks acquaintance with mr dosson and his daughters had had its origin in his crossing the atlantic eastward in their company more than a year before and in some slight association immediately after disembarking but that each party had come and gone a good deal since thencome and gone however without meeting again it was to be inferred that in this interval miss dosson had led her father and sister back to their native land and had then a second time directed their course to europe this was a new departure said mr flack or rather a new arrival he understood that it wasnt as he called it the same old visit she didnt repudiate the accusation launched by her companion as if it might have been embarrassing of having spent her time at home in boston and even in a suburban quarter of it she confessed that as bostonians they had been capable of that but now they had come abroad for longerever so much what they had gone home for was to make arrangements for a european stay of which the limits were not to be told so far as this particular future opened out to her she freely acknowledged it it appeared to meet with george flacks approvalhe also had a big undertaking on that side and it might require years so that it would be pleasant to have his friends right there he knew his way round in parisor any place like thatmuch better than round boston if they had been poked away in one of those clever suburbs they would have been lost to him  oh well youll see as much as you want of usthe way youll have to take us delia dosson said which led the young man to ask which that way was and to guess he had never known but one way to take anythingwhich was just as it came oh well youll see what youll make of it the girl returned and she would give for the present no further explanation of her somewhat chilling speech in spite if it however she professed an interest in mr flacks announced undertakingan interest springing apparently from an interest in the personage himself the man of wonderments and measurements we have smuggled into the scene would have gathered that miss dossons attention was founded on a conception of mr flacks intrinsic brilliancy would his own impression have justified thatwould he have found such a conception contagious i forbear to ridicule the thought for that would saddle me with the care of showing what right our officious observer might have had to his particular standard let us therefore simply note that george flack had grounds for looming publicly large to an uninformed young woman he was connected as she supposed with literature and wasnt a sympathy with literature one of the many engaging attributes of her so generally attractive little sister if mr flack was a writer francie was a reader hadnt a trail of forgotten tauchnitzes marked the former line of travel of the party of three the elder girl grabbed at them on leaving hotels and railwaycarriages but usually found that she had brought odd volumes she considered however that as a family they had an intellectual link with the young journalist and would have been surprised if she had heard the advantage of his acquaintance questioned  mr flacks appearance was not so much a property of his own as a prejudice or a fixed liability of those who looked at him whoever they might be what they saw mainly in him was that they had seen him before and oddly enough this recognition carried with it in general no ability to rememberthat is to recallhim you couldnt conveniently have prefigured him and it was only when you were conscious of him that you knew you had already somehow paid for it to carry him in your mind you must have liked him very much for no other sentiment not even aversion would have taught you what distinguished him in his group aversion in especial would have made you aware only of what confounded him he was not a specific person but had beyond even delia dosson in whom we have facially noted it the quality of the sample or advertisement the air of representing a line of goods for which there is a steady popular demand you would scarce have expected him to be individually designated a number like that of the days newspaper would have served all his or at least all your purpose and you would have vaguely supposed the number highsomewhere up in the millions as every copy of the newspaper answers to its name miss dossons visitor would have been quite adequately marked as young commercial american let me add that among the accidents of his appearance was that of its sometimes striking other young commercial americans as fine he was twentyseven years old and had a small square head a light grey overcoat and in his right forefinger a curious natural crook which might have availed under pressure to identify him but for the convenience of society he ought always to have worn something conspicuousa green hat or a yellow necktie his undertaking was to obtain material in europe for an american societypaper  if it be objected to all this that when francie dosson at last came in she addressed him as if she easily placed him the answer is that she had been notified by her fatherand more punctually than was indicated by the manner of her response well the way you do turn up she said smiling and holding out her left hand to him in the other hand or the hollow of her slim right arm she had a lumpish parcel though she had made him wait she was clearly very glad to see him there and she as evidently required and enjoyed a great deal of that sort of indulgence her sisters attitude would have told you so even if her own appearance had not there was that in her manner to the young mana perceptible but indefinable shadewhich seemed to legitimate the oddity of his having asked in particular for her asked as if he wished to see her to the exclusion of her father and sister the note of a special pleasure which might have implied a special relation and yet a spectator looking from mr george flack to miss francie dosson would have been much at a loss to guess what special relation could exist between them the girl was exceedingly extraordinarily pretty all exempt from traceable likeness to her sister and there was a brightness in hera still and scattered radiancewhich was quite distinct from what is called animation rather tall than short fine slender erect with an airy lightness of hand and foot she yet gave no impression of quick movement of abundant chatter of excitable nerves and irrepressible lifeno hint of arriving at her typical american grace in the most usual way she was pretty without emphasis and as might almost have been said without point and your fancy that a little stiffness would have improved her was at once qualified by the question of what her softness would have made of it there was nothing in her however to confirm the implication that she had rushed about the deck of a cunarder with a newspaperman she was as straight as a wand and as true as a gem her neck was long and her grey eyes had colour and from the ripple of her dark brown hair to the curve of her unaffirmative chin every line in her face was happy and pure she had a weak pipe of a voice and inconceivabilities of ignorance  delia got up and they came out of the little readingroomthis young lady remarking to her sister that she hoped she had brought down all the things well i had a fiendish hunt for themweve got so many francie replied with a strange want of articulation there were a few dozens of the pockethandkerchiefs i couldnt find but i guess ive got most of them and most of the gloves  well what are you carting them about for george flack enquired taking the parcel from her you had better let me handle them do you buy pockethandkerchiefs by the hundred  well it only makes fifty apiece francie yieldingly smiled they aint really nicewere going to change them  oh i wont be mixed up with thatyou cant work that game on these frenchmen the young man stated  oh with francie theyll take anything back delia dosson declared they just love her all over  well theyre like me then said mr flack with friendly cheer ill take her back if shell come  well i dont think im ready quite yet the girl replied but i hope very much we shall cross with you again  talk about crossingits on these boulevards we want a lifepreserver delia loudly commented they had passed out of the hotel and the wide vista of the rue de la paix stretched up and down there were many vehicles  wont this thing do ill tie it to either of you george flack said holding out his bundle i suppose they wont kill you if they love you he went on to the object of his preference  well youve got to know me first she answered laughing and looking for a chance while they waited to pass over  i didnt know you when i was struck he applied his disengaged hand to her elbow and propelled her across the street she took no notice of his observation and delia asked her on the other side whether their father had given her that money she replied that he had given her loadsshe felt as if he had made his will which led george flack to say that he wished the old gentleman was his father  why you dont mean to say you want to be our brother francie prattled as they went down the rue de la paix  i should like to be miss delias if you can make that out he laughed  well then suppose you prove it by calling me a cab miss delia returned i presume you and francie dont take this for a promenadedeck  dont she feel rich george flack demanded of francie but we do require a cart for our goods and he hailed a little yellow carriage which presently drew up beside the pavement the three got into it and still emitting innocent pleasantries proceeded on their way while at the hotel de lunivers et de cheltenham mr dosson wandered down into the court again and took his place in his customary chair     ii  the court was roofed with glass the april air was mild the cry of women selling violets came in from the street and mingling with the rich hum of paris seemed to bring with it faintly the odour of the flowers there were other odours in the place warm succulent and parisian which ranged from fried fish to burnt sugar and there were many things besides little tables for the postprandial coffee piles of luggage inscribed after the initials or frequently the name r p scudamore or d jackson hodge philadelphia pa or st louis mo rattles of unregarded bells flittings of traybearing waiters conversations with the secondfloor windows of admonitory landladies arrivals of young women with coffinlike bandboxes covered with black oilcloth and depending from a strap sallyingsforth of persons staying and arrivals just afterwards of other persons to see them together with vague prostrations on benches of tired heads of american families it was to this last element that mr dosson himself in some degree contributed but it must be added that he had not the extremely bereft and exhausted appearance of certain of his fellows there was an air of ruminant resignation of habitual accommodation in him but you would have guessed that he was enjoying a holiday rather than aching for a truce and he was not so enfeebled but that he was able to get up from time to time and stroll through the porte cochere to have a look at the street  he gazed up and down for five minutes with his hands in his pockets and then came back that appeared to content him he asked for little and had no restlessness that these small excursions wouldnt assuage he looked at the heapedup luggage at the tinkling bells at the young women from the lingere at the repudiated visitors at everything but the other american parents something in his breast told him that he knew all about these its not upon each other that the animals in the same cage in a zoological collection most turn their eyes there was a silent sociability in him and a superficial fineness of grain that helped to account for his daughter francies various delicacies he was fair and spare and had no figure you would have seen in a moment that the question of how he should hold himself had never in his life occurred to him he never held himself at all providence held him ratherand very looselyby an invisible string at the end of which he seemed gently to dangle and waver his face was so smooth that his thin light whiskers which grew only far back scarcely seemed native to his cheeks they might have been attached there for some harmless purpose of comedy or disguise he looked for the most part as if he were thinking over without exactly understanding it something rather droll that had just occurred if his eyes wandered his attention rested just as it hurried quite as little his feet were remarkably small and his clothes in which light colours predominated were visibly the work of a french tailor he was an american who still held the tradition that it is in paris a man dresses himself best his hat would have looked odd in bond street or the fifth avenue and his necktie was loose and flowing  mr dosson it may further be noted was a person of the simplest composition a character as cipherable as a sum of two figures he had a native financial faculty of the finest order a gift as direct as a beautiful tenor voice which had enabled him without the aid of particular strength of will or keenness of ambition to build up a large fortune while he was still of middle age he had a genius for happy speculation the quick unerring instinct of a good thing and as he sat there idle amused contented on the edge of the parisian street he might very well have passed for some rare performer who had sung his song or played his trick and had nothing to do till the next call and he had grown rich not because he was ravenous or hard but simply because he had an ear not to term it a nose he could make out the tune in the discord of the marketplace he could smell success far up the wind the second factor in his little addition was that he was an unassuming father he had no tastes no acquirements no curiosities and his daughters represented all society for him he thought much more and much oftener of these young ladies than of his bankshares and railwaystock they crowned much more his sense of accumulated property he never compared them with other girls he only compared his present self with what he would have been without them his view of them was perfectly simple delia had a greater direct knowledge of life and francie a wider acquaintance with literature and art mr dosson had not perhaps a full perception of his younger daughters beauty he would scarcely have pretended to judge of that more than he would of a valuable picture or vase but he believed she was cultivated up to the eyes he had a recollection of tremendous schoolbills and in later days during their travels of the way she was always leaving books behind her moreover wasnt her french so good that he couldnt understand it  the two girls at any rate formed the breeze in his sail and the only directing determinant force he knew when anything happenedand he was under the impression that things did happenthey were there for it to have happened to without them in short as he felt he would have been the tail without the kite the wind rose and fell of course there were lulls and there were gales there were intervals during which he simply floated in quiet waterscast anchor and waited this appeared to be one of them now but he could be patient knowing that he should soon again inhale the brine and feel the dip of his prow when his daughters were out for any time the occasion affected him as a weatherbreederthe wind would be then as a kind of consequence going to rise but their now being out with a remarkably bright young man only sweetened the temporary calm that belonged to their superior life and mr dosson never doubted that george m flack was remarkably bright he represented the newspaper and the newspaper for this man of genial assumptions representedwell all other representations whatever to know delia and francie thus attended by an editor or a correspondent was really to see them dancing in the central glow this is doubtless why mr dosson had slightly more than usual his air of recovering slowly from a pleasant surprise the vision to which i allude hung before him at a convenient distance and melted into other bright confused aspects reminiscences of mr flack in other relationson the ship on the deck at the hotel at liverpool and in the cars whitney dosson was a loyal father but he would have thought himself simple had he not had two or three strong convictions one of which was that the children should never go out with a gentleman they hadnt seen before the sense of their having and his having seen mr flack before was comfortable to him now it made mere placidity of his personally foregoing the young mans society in favour of delia and francie he had not hitherto been perfectly satisfied that the streets and shops the general immensity of paris were just the safest place for young ladies alone but the company of a helpful gentleman ensured safetya gentleman who would be helpful by the fact of his knowing so much and having it all right there if a big newspaper told you everything there was in the world every morning that was what a big newspaperman would have to know and mr dosson had never supposed there was anything left to know when such voices as mr flacks and that of his organ had daily been heard in the absence of such happy chancesand in one way or another they kept occurringhis girls might have seemed lonely which was not the way he struck himself they were his company but he scarcely theirs it was as if they belonged to him more than he to them  they were out a long time but he felt no anxiety as he reflected that mr flacks very profession would somehow make everything turn out to their profit the bright french afternoon waned without bringing them back yet mr dosson still revolved about the court till he might have been taken for a valet de place hoping to pick up custom the landlady smiled at him sometimes as she passed and repassed and even ventured to remark disinterestedly that it was a pity to waste such a lovely day indoorsnot to take a turn and see what was going on in paris but mr dosson had no sense of waste that came to him much more when he was confronted with historical monuments or beauties of nature or art which affected him as the talk of people naming others naming friends of theirs whom he had never heard of then he was aware of a degree of waste for the others as if somebody lost somethingbut never when he lounged in that simplifying yet so comprehensive way in the court it wanted but a quarter of an hour to dinnerthat historic fact was not beyond his measurewhen delia and francie at last met his view still accompanied by mr flack and sauntering in at a little distance from each other with a jaded air which was not in the least a tribute to his possible solicitude they dropped into chairs and joked with each other mingling sociability and languor on the subject of what they had seen and donea question into which he felt as yet the delicacy of enquiring but they had evidently done a good deal and had a good time an impression sufficient to rescue mr dosson personally from the consciousness of failure wont you just step in and take dinner with us he asked of the young man with a friendliness to which everything appeared to minister  well thats a handsome offer george flack replied while delia put it on record that they had each eaten about thirty cakes  well i wondered what you were doing so long but never mind your cakes its twenty minutes past six and the table dhotes on time  you dont mean to say you dine at the table dhote mr flack cried  why dont you like thatand francies candour of appeal to their comrades taste was celestial  well it isnt what you must build on when you come to paris too many flowerpots and chickens legs  well would you like one of these restaurants asked mr dosson i dont careif you show us a good one  oh ill show you a good onedont you worry mr flacks tone was ever that of keeping the poor gentleman mildly but firmly in his place  well youve got to order the dinner then said francie  well youll see how i could do it he towered over her in the pride of this feat  he has got an interest in some place delia declared he has taken us to ever so many stores where he gets his commission  well id pay you to take them round said mr dosson and with much agreeable trifling of this kind it was agreed that they should sally forth for the evening meal under mr flacks guidance  if he had easily convinced them on this occasion that that was a more original proceeding than worrying those old bones as he called it at the hotel he convinced them of other things besides in the course of the following month and by the aid of profuse attentions what he mainly made clear to them was that it was really most kind of a young man who had so many big things on his mind to find sympathy for questions for issues he used to call them that could occupy the telegraph and the press so little as theirs he came every day to set them in the right path pointing out its charms to them in a way that made them feel how much they had been in the wrong it made them feel indeed that they didnt know anything about anything even about such a matter as ordering shoesan art in which they had vaguely supposed themselves rather strong he had in fact great knowledge which was wonderfully various and he knew as many people as they knew few he had appointmentsvery often with celebritiesfor every hour of the day and memoranda sometimes in shorthand on tablets with elastic straps with which he dazzled the simple folk at the hotel de lunivers et de cheltenham whose social life of narrow range consisted mainly in reading the lists of americans who registered at the bankers and at galignanis delia dosson in particular had a trick of poring solemnly over these records which exasperated mr flack who skimmed them and found what he wanted in the flash of an eye she kept the others waiting while she satisfied herself that mr and mrs d s rosenheim and miss cora rosenheim and master samuel rosenheim had left for brussels  mr flack was wonderful on all occasions in finding what he wantedwhich as we know was what he believed the public wantedand delia was the only one of the party with whom he was sometimes a little sharp he had embraced from the first the idea that she was his enemy and he alluded to it with almost tiresome frequency though always in a humorous fearless strain even more than by her fashion of hanging over the registers she provoked him by appearing to find their little party not sufficient to itself by wishing as he expressed it to work in new stuff he might have been easy however for he had sufficient chance to observe how it was always the fate of the dossons to miss their friends they were continually looking out for reunions and combinations that never came off hearing that people had been in paris only after they had gone away or feeling convinced that they were there but not to be found through their not having registered or wondering whether they should overtake them if they should go to dresden and then making up their minds to start for dresden only to learn at the eleventh hour through some accident that the hunted game had left for biarritz even as the rosenheims for brussels we know plenty of people if we could only come across them delia had more than once observed she scanned the continent with a wondering baffled gaze and talked of the unsatisfactory way in which friends at home would write out that other friends were somewhere in europe she expressed the wish that such correspondents as that might be in a place that was not at all vague two or three times people had called at the hotel when they were out and had left cards for them without an address and superscribed with some mocking dash of the pencilso sorry to miss you or off tomorrow the girl sat looking at these cards handling them and turning them over for a quarter of an hour at a time she produced them days afterwards brooding upon them afresh as if they were a mystic clue george flack generally knew where they were the people who were somewhere in europe such knowledge came to him by a kind of intuition by the voices of the air by indefinable and unteachable processes but he held his peace on purpose he didnt want any outsiders he thought their little party just right mr dossons place in the scheme of providence was to go with delia while he himself went with francie and nothing would have induced george flack to disfigure that equation the young man was professionally so occupied with other peoples affairs that it should doubtless be mentioned to his praise that he still managed to have affairsor at least an affairof his own that affair was francie dosson and he was pleased to perceive how little she cared what had become of mr and mrs rosenheim and master samuel and miss cora he counted all the things she didnt care abouther soft inadvertent eyes helped him to do that and they footed up so as he would have said that they gave him the rich sense of a free field if she had so few interests there was the greater possibility that a young man of bold conceptions and cheerful manners might become one she had usually the air of waiting for something with a pretty listlessness or an amused resignation while tender shy indefinite little fancies hummed in her brain thus she would perhaps recognise in him the reward of patience george flack was aware that he exposed his friends to considerable fatigue he brought them back pale and taciturn from suburban excursions and from wanderings often rather aimless and casual among the boulevards and avenues of the town he regarded them at such times with complacency however for these were hours of diminished resistance he had an idea that he should be able eventually to circumvent delia if he only could catch her some day sufficiently that is physically prostrate he liked to make them all feel helpless and dependent and this was not difficult with people who were so modest and artless so unconscious of the boundless power of wealth sentiment in our young man was not a scruple nor a source of weakness but he thought it really touching the little these good people knew of what they could do with their money they had in their hands a weapon of infinite range and yet were incapable of firing a shot for themselves they had a sort of social humility it appeared never to have occurred to them that added to their loveliness their money gave them a value this used to strike george flack on certain occasions when he came back to find them in the places where he had dropped them while he rushed off to give a turn to one of his screws they never played him false never wearied of waiting always sat patient and submissive usually at a cafe to which he had introduced them or in a row of chairs on the boulevard on the level expanse of the tuileries or in the champs elysees  he introduced them to many cafes in different parts of paris being careful to choose those which in his view young ladies might frequent with propriety and there were two or three in the neighbourhood of their hotel where they became frequent and familiar figures as the late spring days grew warmer and brighter they mainly camped out on the terrace amid the array of small tables at the door of the establishment where mr flack on the return could descry them from afar at their post and in the very same postures to which he had appointed them they complained of no satiety in watching the manycoloured movement of the parisian streets and if some of the features in the panorama were base they were only so in a version that the social culture of our friends was incapable of supplying george flack considered that he was rendering a positive service to mr dosson wouldnt the old gentleman have sat all day in the court anyway and wasnt the boulevard better than the court it was his theory too that he nattered and caressed miss francies father for there was no one to whom he had furnished more copious details about the affairs the projects and prospects of the reverberator he had left no doubt in the old gentlemans mind as to the race he himself intended to run and mr dosson used to say to him every day the first thing well where have you got to nowquite as if he took a real interest george flack reported his interviews that is his reportings to which delia and francie gave attention only in case they knew something of the persons on whom the young emissary of the reverberator had conferred this distinction whereas mr dosson listened with his tolerant interposition of is that so and well thats good just as submissively when he heard of the celebrity in question for the first time  in conversation with his daughters mr flack was frequently the theme though introduced much more by the young ladies than by himself and especially by delia who announced at an early period that she knew what he wanted and that it wasnt in the least what she wanted she amplified this statement very soonat least as regards her interpretation of mr flacks designs a certain mystery still hung about her own which as she intimated had much more to recommend them delias vision of the danger as well as the advantage of being a pretty girl was closely connected as was natural with the idea of an engagement this idea was in a manner complete in itselfher imagination failed in the oddest way to carry it into the next stage she wanted her sister to be engaged but wanted her not at all to be married and had clearly never made up her mind as to how francie was to enjoy both the peril and the shelter it was a secret source of humiliation to her that there had as yet to her knowledge been no one with whom her sister had exchanged vows if her conviction on this subject could have expressed itself intelligibly it would have given you a glimpse of a droll state of minda dim theory that a bright girl ought to be able to try successive aspirants delias conception of what such a trial might consist of was strangely innocent it was made up of calls and walks and buggydrives and above all of being in the light of these exhibitions the theme of tongues and subject to the great imputation it had never in life occurred to her withal that a succession of lovers or just even a repetition of experiments may have anything to say to a young ladys delicacy she felt herself a born old maid and never dreamed of a lover of her ownhe would have been dreadfully in her way but she dreamed of love as something in its nature essentially refined all the same she discriminated it did lead to something after all and she desired that for francie it shouldnt lead to a union with mr flack she looked at such a union under the influence of that other view which she kept as yet to herself but was prepared to produce so soon as the right occasion should come up giving her sister to understand that she would never speak to her again should this young man be allowed to suppose which was where she always paused plunging again into impressive reticence  to suppose what francie would ask as if she were totally unacquaintedwhich indeed she really waswith the suppositions of young men  well youll seewhen he begins to say things you wont like this sounded ominous on delias part yet her anxiety was really but thin otherwise she would have risen against the custom adopted by mr flack of perpetually coming round she would have given her attentionthough it struggled in general unsuccessfully with all this side of their lifeto some prompt means of getting away from paris she expressed to her father what in her view the correspondent of the reverberator was after but without it must be added gaining from him the sense of it as a connexion in which he could be greatly worked up this indeed was not of importance thanks to her inner faith that francie would never really do anythingthat is would never really like anythingher nearest relatives didnt like her sisters docility was a great comfort to delia the more that she herself taking it always for granted was the first to profit by it she liked and disliked certain things much more than her junior did either and francie cultivated the convenience of her reasons having so few of her own they serveddelias reasonsfor mr dosson as well so that francie was not guilty of any particular irreverence in regarding her sister rather than her father as the controller of her fate a fate was rather an unwieldy and terrible treasure which it relieved her that some kind person should undertake to administer delia had somehow got hold of hers firstbefore even her father and ever so much before mr flack and it lay with delia to make any change she couldnt have accepted any gentleman as a party to an engagementwhich was somehow as far as her imagination wentwithout reference to delia any more than she could have done up her hair without a glass the only action taken by mr dosson on his elder daughters admonitions was to convert the general issue as mr flack would have called it to a theme for daily pleasantry he was fond in his intercourse with his children of some small usual joke some humorous refrain and what could have been more in the line of true domestic sport than a little gentle but unintermitted raillery on francies conquest mr flacks attributive intentions became a theme of indulgent parental chaff and the girl was neither dazzled nor annoyed by the freedom of all this tribute well he has told us about half we know she used to reply with an air of the judicious that the undetected observer i am perpetually moved to invoke would have found indescribably quaint  among the items of knowledge for which they were indebted to him floated the fact that this was the very best time in the young ladys life to have her portrait painted and the best place in the world to have it done well also that he knew a lovely artist a young american of extraordinary talent who would be delighted to undertake the job he led his trio to this gentlemans studio where they saw several pictures that opened to them the strange gates of mystification francie protested that she didnt want to be done in that style and delia declared that she would as soon have her sister shown up in a magic lantern they had had the fortune not to find mr waterlow at home so that they were free to express themselves and the pictures were shown them by his servant they looked at them as they looked at bonnets and confections when they went to expensive shops as if it were a question among so many specimens of the style and colour they would choose mr waterlows productions took their place for the most part in the category of those creations known to ladies as frights and our friends retired with the lowest opinion of the young american master george flack told them however that they couldnt get out of it inasmuch as he had already written home to the reverberator that francie was to sit they accepted this somehow as a kind of supernatural sign that she would have to for they believed everything they ever heard quoted from a newspaper moreover mr flack explained to them that it would be idiotic to miss such an opportunity to get something at once precious and cheap for it was well known that impressionism was going to be the art of the future and charles waterlow was a rising impressionist it was a new system altogether and the latest improvement in art they didnt want to go back they wanted to go forward and he would give them an article that would fetch five times the money in about five yearswhich somehow as he put it seemed a very short time though it would have seemed immense for anything else they were not in search of a bargain but they allowed themselves to be inoculated with any reason they thought would be characteristic of informed people and he even convinced them after a little that when once they had got used to impressionism they would never look at anything else mr waterlow was the man among the young and he had no interest in praising him because he was not a personal friend his reputation was advancing with strides and any one with any sense would want to secure something before the rush     iii  the young ladies consented to return to the avenue des villiers and this time they found the celebrity of the future he was smoking cigarettes with a friend while coffee was served to the two gentlemenit was just after luncheonon a vast divan covered with scrappy oriental rugs and cushions it looked francie thought as if the artist had set up a carpetshop in a corner he struck her as very pleasant and it may be mentioned without circumlocution that the young lady ushered in by the vulgar american reporter whom he didnt like and who had already come too often to his studio to pick up glimpses the painter wondered how in the world he had picked her up this charming candidate for portraiture rose on the spot before charles waterlow as a precious model she made it may further be declared quite the same impression on the gentleman who was with him and who never took his eyes off her while her own rested afresh on several finished and unfinished canvases this gentleman asked of his friend at the end of five minutes the favour of an introduction to her in consequence of which francie learned that his nameshe thought it singularwas gaston probert mr probert was a kindeyed smiling youth who fingered the points of his moustache he was represented by mr waterlow as an american but he pronounced the american languageso at least it seemed to francieas if it had been french  after she had quitted the studio with delia and mr flackher father on this occasion not being of the partythe two young men falling back on their divan broke into expressions of aesthetic rapture gave it to each other that the girl had qualitiesoh but qualities and a charm of line they remained there an hour studying these rare properties through the smoke of their cigarettes you would have gathered from their conversationthough as regards much of it only perhaps with the aid of a grammar and dictionarythat the young lady had been endowed with plastic treasures that is with physical graces of the highest order of which she was evidently quite unconscious before this however mr waterlow had come to an understanding with his visitorsit had been settled that miss francina should sit for him at his first hour of leisure unfortunately that hour hovered before him as still rather distanthe was unable to make a definite appointment he had sitters on his hands he had at least three portraits to finish before going to spain he adverted with bitterness to the journey to spaina little excursion laid out precisely with his friend probert for the last weeks of the spring the first of the southern summer the time of the long days and the real light gaston probert reechoed his regrets for though he had no business with miss francina whose name he yet liked he also wanted to see her again they halfagreed to give up spainthey had after all been there beforeso that waterlow might take the girl in hand without delay the moment he had knocked off his present work this amendment broke down indeed for other considerations came up and the artist resigned himself to the arrangement on which the young women had quitted him he thought it so characteristic of their nationality that they should settle a matter of that sort for themselves this was simply that they should come back in the autumn when he should be comparatively free then there would be a margin and they might all take their time at present before longby the time he should be readythe question of the pretty ones leaving paris for the summer would be sure to rise and that would be a tiresome interruption the pretty one clearly liked paris she had no plans for the autumn and only wanted a reason to come back about the twentieth of september mr waterlow remarked humorously that she evidently bossed the shop meanwhile before starting for spain he would see her as often as possiblehis eye would take possession of her  his companion envied his eye even expressed jealousy of his eye it was perhaps as a step towards establishing his right to jealousy that mr probert left a card upon the miss dossons at the hotel de lunivers et de cheltenham having first ascertained that such a proceeding would not by the young american sisters be regarded as an unwarrantable liberty gaston probert was an american who had never been in america and was obliged to take counsel on such an emergency as that he knew that in paris young men didnt call at hotels on blameless maids but he also knew that blameless maids unattended by a parent didnt visit young men in studios and he had no guide no light he could trustnone save the wisdom of his friend waterlow which was for the most part communicated to him in a derisive and misleading form waterlow who was after all himself an ornament of the french and the very french school jeered at the others want of native instinct at the way he never knew by which end to take hold of a compatriot poor probert was obliged to confess to his terrible paucity of practice and that in the great medley of aliens and brothersand even more of sistershe couldnt tell which was which he would have had a country and countrymen to say nothing of countrywomen if he could but that matter had never been properly settled for him and its one theres ever a great difficulty in a gentlemans settling for himself born in paris he had been brought up altogether on french lines in a family that french society had irrecoverably absorbed his father a carolinian and a catholic was a gallomaniac of the old american type his three sisters had married frenchmen and one of them lived in brittany while the others were ostensibly seated in touraine his only brother had fallen during the terrible year in defence of their adopted country yet gaston though he had had an old legitimist marquis for godfather was not legally one of its children his mother had on her deathbed extorted from him the promise that he wouldnt take service in its armies she considered after the death of her elder songaston in 1870 had been a boy of tenthat the family had sacrificed enough on the altar of sympathy  the young man therefore between two stools had no clear sittingplace he wanted to be as american as he could and yet not less french than he was he was afraid to give up the little that he was and find that what he might be was lesshe shrank from a flying leap which might drop him in the middle of the sea at the same time he thought himself sure that the only way to know how it feels to be an american is to try it and he had had many a purpose of making the pious pilgrimage his family however had been so completely gallicised that the affairs of each member of it were the affairs of all the rest and his father his sisters and his brothersinlaw had not yet begun sufficiently to regard this scheme as their own for him to feel it substantially his it was a family in which there was no individual but only a collective property meanwhile he tried as i say by affronting minor perils and especially by going a good deal to see charles waterlow in the avenue de villiers whom he believed to be his dearest friend formed for his affection by monsieur carolus he had an idea that in this manner he kept himself in touch with his countrymen and he had never pitched his endeavour so high as in leaving that card on the misses dosson he was in search of freshness but he neednt have gone far he would have had but to turn his lantern on his own young breast to find a considerable store of it like many of his dawdling coaevals he gave much attention to art lived as much as possible in that more select world where it is a positive duty not to bustle to make up for his want of talent he espoused the talent of othersthat is of severaland was as sensitive and conscientious about them as he might have been about himself he defended certain of waterlows purples and greens as he would have defended his own honour and there was a genius or two not yet fully acclaimed by the vulgar in regard to whom he had convictions that belonged almost to the undiscussable part of life he had not for himself any very high sense of performance but what kept it down particularly was his untractable hand the fact that such as they were waterlows purples and greens for instance were far beyond him if he hadnt failed there other failures wouldnt have mattered not even that of not having a country and it was on the occasion of his friends agreement to paint that strange lovely girl whom he liked so much and whose companions he didnt like that he felt supremely without a vocation freshness was in her at least if he had only been organised for catching it he prayed earnestly in relation to such a triumph for a providential reenforcement of waterlows sense of that source of charm if waterlow had a fault it was that his freshnesses were sometimes too crude  he avenged himself for the artists profanation of his first attempt to approach miss francie by indulging at the end of another week in a second he went about six oclock when he supposed she would have returned from her days wanderings and his prudence was rewarded by the sight of the young lady sitting in the court of the hotel with her father and sister mr dosson was new to gaston probert but the young man might have been a naturalist visiting a rank country with a net of such narrow meshes as to let no creature of the air escape the little party was as usual expecting mr flack at any moment and they had collected downstairs so that he might pick them up easily they had on the first floor an expensive parlour decorated in white and gold with sofas of crimson damask but there was something lonely in that grandeur and the place had become mainly a receptacle for their tall trunks with a halfemptied paper of chocolates or marrons glaces on every table after young proberts first call his name was often on the lips of the simple trio and mr dosson grew still more jocose making nothing of a secret of his perception that francie hit the bullseye every time mr waterlow had returned their visit but that was rather a matter of course since it was they who had gone after him they had not gone after the other one it was he who had come after them when he entered the hotel as they sat there this pursuit and its probable motive became startlingly vivid  delia had taken the matter much more seriously than her father she said there was ever so much she wanted to find out she mused upon these mysteries visibly but with no great advance and she appealed for assistance to george flack with a candour which he appreciated and returned if he really knew anything he ought to know at least who mr probert was and she spoke as if it would be in the natural course that as soon as he should find out he would put it for them somehow into his paper mr flack promised to nose round he said the best plan would be that the results should come back to her in the reverberator it might have been gathered from him that the people over therein other words the mass of their compatriotswouldnt be unpersuadable that they wanted about a column on mr probert his researches were to prove none the less fruitless for in spite of the vivid fact the girl was able to give him as a startingpoint the fact that their new acquaintance had spent his whole life in paris the young journalist couldnt scare up a single person who had even heard of him he had questioned up and down and all over the place from the rue scribe to the far end of chaillot and he knew people who knew others who knew every member of the american colony that select settled body which haunted poor delias imagination glittered and reechoed there in a hundred tormenting roundabout glimpses that was where she wanted to get francie as she said to herself she wanted to get her right in there she believed the members of this society to constitute a little kingdom of the blest and she used to drive through the avenue gabriel the rue de marignan and the wide vistas which radiate from the arch of triumph and are always changing their names on purpose to send up wistful glances to the windowsshe had learned that all this was the happy quarterof the enviable but unapproachable colonists she saw these privileged mortals as she supposed in almost every victoria that made a languid lady with a pretty head dash past her and she had no idea how little honour this theory sometimes did her expatriated countrywomen her plan was already made to be on the field again the next winter and take it up seriously this question of getting francie in  when mr flack remarked that young proberts net couldnt be either the rose or anything near it since they had shed no petal at any general shake on the path of the oldest inhabitant delia had a flash of inspiration an intellectual flight that she herself didnt measure at the time she asked if that didnt perhaps prove on the contrary quite the oppositethat they were just the cream and beyond all others wasnt there a kind of inner very far in circle and wouldnt they be somewhere about the centre of that george flack almost quivered at this weird hit as from one of the blind for he guessed on the spot that delia dosson had as he would have said got there  why do you mean one of those families that have worked down so far you cant find where they went inthat was the phrase in which he recognised the truth of the girls grope delias fixed eyes assented and after a moment of cogitation george flack broke out thats the kind of family we want to handle  well perhaps they wont want to be handled delia had returned with a still wilder and more remarkable play of inspiration you had better find out she had added  the chance to find out might have seemed to present itself after mr probert had walked in that confiding way into the hotel for his arrival had been followed a quarter of an hour later by that of the representative of the reverberator gaston had liked the way they treated himthough demonstrative it was not artificial mr dosson had said they had been hoping he would come round again and delia had remarked that she supposed he had had quite a journeyparis was so big and had urged his acceptance of a glass of wine or a cup of tea mentioning that that wasnt the place where they usually receivedshe liked to hear herself talk of receivingshe led the party up to her whiteandgold saloon where they should be so much more private she liked also to hear herself talk of privacy they sat on the red silk chairs and she hoped mr probert would at least taste a sugared chestnut or a chocolate and when he declined pleading the imminence of the dinnerhour she sighed well i suppose youre so used to themto the bestliving so long over here the allusion to the dinnerhour led mr dosson to the frank hope that he would go round and dine with them without ceremony they were expecting a friendhe generally settled it for themwho was coming to take them round  and then were going to the circus francie said speaking for the first time  if she had not spoken before she had done something still more to the purpose she had removed any shade of doubt that might have lingered in the young mans spirit as to her charm of line he was aware that the education of paris acting upon a natural aptitude had opened him muchrendered him perhaps even morbidly sensitiveto impressions of this order the society of artists the talk of studios the attentive study of beautiful works the sight of a thousand forms of curious research and experiment had produced in his mind a new sense the exercise of which was a conscious enjoyment and the supreme gratification of which on several occasions had given him as many indelible memories he had once said to his friend waterlow i dont know whether its a confession of a very poor life but the most important things that have happened to me in this world have been simply half a dozen visual impressionsthings that happened through my eyes  ah malheureux youre lost the painter had exclaimed in answer to this and without even taking the trouble to explain his ominous speech gaston probert however had not been frightened by it and he continued to be thankful for the sensitive plate that nature had lodged in his brain and that culture had brought to so high a polish the experience of the eye was doubtless not everything but it was so much gained so much saved in a world in which other treasures were apt to slip through ones fingers and above all it had the merit that so many things gave it and that nothing could take it away he had noted in a moment how straight francie dosson gave it and now seeing her a second time he felt her promote it in a degree which made acquaintance with her one of those important facts of which he had spoken to charles waterlow it was in the case of such an accident as this that he felt the value of his parisian education it made him revel in his modern sense  it was therefore not directly the prospect of the circus that induced him to accept mr dossons invitation nor was it even the charm exerted by the girls appearing in the few words she uttered to appeal to him for herself it was his feeling that on the edge of the glittering ring her type would attach him to her to her only and that if he knew it was rare she herself didnt he liked to be intensely conscious but liked others not to be it seemed to him at this moment after he had told mr dosson he should be delighted to spend the evening with them that he was indeed trying hard to measure how it would feel to recover the national tie he had jumped on the ship he was pitching away to the west he had led his sister mme de brecourt to expect that he would dine with hershe was having a little party so that if she could see the people to whom without a scruple with a quick sense of refreshment and freedom he now sacrificed her he knew who was coming to his sisters in the place beauvau mme doutreville and m de grospre old m courageau mme de drives lord and lady trantum mile de saintonge but he was fascinated by the idea of the contrast between what he preferred and what he gave up his life had long been wantingpainfully wantingin the element of contrast and here was a chance to bring it in he saw it come in powerfully with mr flack after miss dosson had proposed they should walk off without their initiator her father didnt favour this suggestion he said we want a double good dinner today and mr flack has got to order it upon this delia had asked the visitor if he couldnt ordera frenchman like him and francie had interrupted before he could answer the question well are you a frenchman thats just the point aint it gaston probert replied that he had no wish but to be a citizen of her country and the elder sister asked him if he knew many americans in paris he was obliged to confess he knew almost none but hastened to add he was eager to go on now he had taken such a charming start  oh we aint anythingif you mean that delia said if you go on youll go on beyond us  we aint anything here my dear but were a good deal at home mr dosson jocosely interjected  i think were very nice anywhere francie exclaimed upon which gaston probert declared that they were as delightful as possible it was in these amenities that george flack found them engaged but there was none the less a certain eagerness in his greeting of the other guest as if he had it in mind to ask him how soon he could give him half an hour i hasten to add that with the turn the occasion presently took the correspondent of the reverberator dropped the conception of making the young man talk for the benefit of the subscribers to that journal they all went out together and the impulse to pick up something usually so irresistible in george flacks mind suffered an odd check he found himself wanting to handle his fellow visitor in a sense other than the professional mr probert talked very little to francie but though mr flack didnt know that on a first occasion he would have thought this aggressive even rather brutal he knew it was for francie and francie alone that the fifth member of the party was there he said to himself suddenly and in perfect sincerity that it was a mean class anyway the people for whom their own country wasnt good enough he didnt go so far however when they were seated at the admirable establishment of m durand in the place de la madeleine as to order a bad dinner to spite his competitor nor did he to spoil this gentlemans amusement take uncomfortable seats at the pretty circus in the champs elysees to which at halfpast eight oclock the company was conveyedit was a drive of but five minutesin a couple of cabs the occasion therefore was superficially smooth and he could see that the sense of being disagreeable to an american newspaperman was not needed to make his nondescript rival enjoy it that gentleman did indeed hate his crude accent and vulgar laugh and above all the lamblike submission to him of their friends mr flack was acute enough for an important observation he cherished it and promised himself to bring it to the notice of his clinging charges their imperturbable guest professed a great desire to be of service to the young ladiesto do what would help them to be happy in paris but he gave no hint of the intention that would contribute most to such a result the bringing them in contact with the other members especially with the female members of his family george flack knew nothing about the matter but he required for purposes of argument that mr proberts family should have female members and it was lucky for him that his assumption was just he grasped in advance the effect with which he should impress it on francie and deliabut notably on delia who would then herself impress it on franciethat it would be time for their french friend to talk when he had brought his mother round but he never wouldthey might bet their pile on that he never did in the strange sequelhaving poor young man no mother to bring moreover he was quite mumas delia phrased it to herselfabout mme de brecourt and mme de cliche such miss dosson learned from charles waterlow were the names of his two sisters who had houses in parisgleaning at the same time the information that one of these ladies was a marquise and the other a comtesse she was less exasperated by their nonappearance than mr flack had hoped and it didnt prevent an excursion to dine at saintgermain a week after the evening spent at the circus which included both the new admirers it also as a matter of course included mr flack for though the party had been proposed in the first instance by charles waterlow who wished to multiply opportunities for studying his future sitter mr dosson had characteristically constituted himself host and administrator with the young journalist as his deputy he liked to invite people and to pay for them and disliked to be invited and paid for he was never inwardly content on any occasion unless a great deal of money was spent and he could be sure enough of the large amount only when he himself spent it he was too simple for conceit or for pride of purse but always felt any arrangements shabby and sneaking as to which the expense hadnt been referred to him he never named what he paid for anything also delia had made him understand that if they should go to saintgermain as guests of the artist and his friend mr flack wouldnt be of the company she was sure those gentlemen wouldnt rope him in in fact she was too sure for though enjoying him not at all charles waterlow would on this occasion have made a point of expressing by an act of courtesy his sense of obligation to a man who had brought him such a subject delias hint however was allsufficient for her father he would have thought it a gross breach of friendly loyalty to take part in a festival not graced by mr flacks presence his idea of loyalty was that he should scarcely smoke a cigar unless his friend was there to take another and he felt rather mean if he went round alone to get shaved as regards saintgermain he took over the project while george flack telegraphed for a table on the terrace at the pavilion henri quatre mr dosson had by this time learned to trust the european manager of the reverberator to spend his money almost as he himself would     iv  delia had broken out the evening they took mr probert to the circus she had apostrophised francie as they each sat in a reddamask chair after ascending to their apartments they had bade their companions farewell at the door of the hotel and the two gentlemen had walked off in different directions but upstairs they had instinctively not separated they dropped into the first places and sat looking at each other and at the highlydecorated lamps that burned night after night in their empty saloon well i want to know when youre going to stop delia said to her sister speaking as if this remark were a continuation which it was not of something they had lately been saying  stop what asked francie reaching forward for a marron  stop carryingon the way you dowith mr flack  francie stared while she consumed her marron then she replied in her small flat patient voice why delia dosson how can you be so foolish  father i wish youd speak to her francie i aint foolish delia submitted  what do you want me to say to her mr dosson enquired i guess ive said about all i know  well thats in fun i want you to speak to her in earnest  i guess theres no one in earnest but you francie remarked these aint so good as the last  no and there wont be if you dont look out theres something you can do if youll just keep quiet if you cant tell difference of style well i can delia cried  whats the difference of style asked mr dosson but before this question could be answered francie protested against the charge of carryingon quiet wasnt she as quiet as a quaker meeting delia replied that a girl wasnt quiet so long as she didnt keep others so and she wanted to know what her sister proposed to do about mr flack why dont you take him and let francie take the other mr dosson continued  thats just what im afterto make her take the other said his elder daughter  take himhow do you mean francie returned  oh you know how  yes i guess you know how mr dosson laughed with an absence of prejudice that might have been deplored in a parent  do you want to stay in europe or not thats what i want to know delia pursued to her sister if you want to go bang home youre taking the right way to do it  what has that got to do with it mr dosson audibly wondered  should you like so much to reside at that placewhere is itwhere his papers published thats where youll have to pull up sooner or later delia declaimed  do you want to stay right here in europe father francie said with her small sweet weariness  it depends on what you mean by staying right here i want to go right home some time  well then youve got to go without mr probert delia made answer with decision if you think he wants to live over there  why delia he wants dreadfully to gohe told me so himself francie argued with passionless pauses  yes and when he gets there hell want to come back i thought you were so much interested in paris  my poor child i am interested smiled francie aint i interested father  well i dont know how you could act differently to show it  well i do then said delia and if you dont make mr flack understand i will  oh i guess he understandshes so bright francie vaguely pleaded  yes i guess he doeshe is bright said mr dosson goodnight chickens he added and wandered off to a couch of untroubled repose  his daughters sat up half an hour later but not by the wish of the younger girl she was always passive however always docile when delia was as she said on the warpath and though she had none of her sisters insistence she was courageous in suffering she thought delia whipped her up too much but there was that in her which would have prevented her ever running away she could smile and smile for an hour without irritation making even pacific answers though all the while it hurt her to be heavily exhorted much as it would have done to be violently pushed she knew delia loved hernot loving herself meanwhile a bitas no one else in the world probably ever would but there was something funny in such plans for herplans of ambition which could only involve a fuss the real answer to anything to everything her sister might say at these hours of urgency was oh if you want to make out that people are thinking of me or that they ever will you ought to remember that no one can possibly think of me half as much as you do therefore if theres to be any comfort for either of us we had both much better just go on as we are she didnt however on this occasion meet her constant companion with that syllogism because a formidable force seemed to lurk in the great contention that the star of matrimony for the american girl was now shining in the eastin england and france and italy they had only to look round anywhere to see it what did they hear of every day in the week but of the engagement of somebody no better than they to some count or some lord delia dwelt on the evident truth that it was in that vast vague section of the globe to which she never alluded save as over here that the american girl was now called upon to play under providence her part when francie made the point that mr probert was neither a count nor a lord her sister rejoined that she didnt care whether he was or not to this francie replied that she herself didnt care but that delia ought to for consistency  well hes a prince compared with mr flack delia declared  he hasnt the same ability not half  he has the ability to have three sisters who are just the sort of people i want you to know  what good will they do me francie asked theyll hate me before they could turn round i should do somethingin perfect innocencethat theyd think monstrous  well what would that matter if he liked you  oh but he wouldnt then hed hate me too  then all youve got to do is not to do it delia concluded  oh but i shouldevery time her sister went on  delia looked at her a moment what are you talking about  yes what am i its disgusting and francie sprang up  im sorry you have such thoughts said delia sententiously  its disgusting to talk about a gentlemanand his sisters and his society and everything elsebefore he has scarcely looked at you  its disgusting if he isnt just dying but it isnt if he is  well ill make him skip francie went on with a sudden approach to sharpness  oh youre worse than father her sister cried giving her a push as they went to bed  they reached saintgermain with their companions nearly an hour before the time it had been agreed they had best dine the purpose of this being to enable them to enjoy with what remained of daylight a stroll on the celebrated terrace and a study of the magnificent view the evening was splendid and the atmosphere favourable to these impressions the grass was vivid on the broad walk beside the parapet the park and forest were fresh and leafy and the prettiest golden light hung over the curving seine and the farspreading city the hill which forms the terrace stretched down among the vineyards with the poles delicate yet in their bareness to the river and the prospect was spotted here and there with the red legs of the little sauntering soldiers of the garrison how it came after delias warning in regard to her carryingonespecially as she hadnt failed to feel the weight of her sisters wisdomfrancie couldnt have told herself certain it is that before ten minutes had elapsed she became aware first that the evening wouldnt pass without mr flacks taking in some way and for a certain time peculiar possession of her and then that he was already doing so that he had drawn her away from the others who were stopping behind to appreciate the view that he made her walk faster and that he had ended by interposing such a distance that she was practically alone with him this was what he wanted but it was not all she saw he now wanted a great many other things the large perspective of the terrace stretched away before themmr probert had said it was in the grand styleand he was determined to make her walk to the end she felt sorry for his ideasshe thought of them in the light of his striking energy they were an idle exercise of a force intrinsically fine and she wanted to protest to let him know how truly it was a sad misuse of his free bold spirit to count on her she was not to be counted on she was a vague soft negative being who had never decided anything and never would who had not even the merit of knowing how to flirt and who only asked to be let alone she made him stop at last telling him while she leaned against the parapet that he walked too fast and she looked back at their companions whom she expected to see under pressure from delia following at the highest speed but they were not following they still stood together there only looking attentively enough at the couple who had left them delia would wave a parasol beckon her back send mr waterlow to bring her francie invoked from one moment to another some such appeal as that but no appeal came none at least but the odd spectacle presently of an agitation of the group which evidently under delias direction turned round and retraced its steps francie guessed in a moment what was meant by that it was the most definite signal her sister could have given it made her feel that delia counted on her but to such a different end just as poor mr flack did just as delia wished to persuade her that mr probert did the girl gave a sigh looking up with troubled eyes at her companion and at the figure of herself as the subject of contending policies such a thankless bored evasive little subject as she felt herself what delia had said in turning away wasyes im watching you and i depend on you to finish him up stay there with him go off with himill allow you half an hour if necessary only settle him once for all its very kind of me to give you this chance and in return for it i expect you to be able to tell me this evening that he has his answer shut him up  francie didnt in the least dislike mr flack interested as i am in presenting her favourably to the reader i am yet obliged as a veracious historian to admit that she believed him as bright as her father had originally pronounced him and as any young man she was likely to meet she had no other measure for distinction in young men but their brightness she had never been present at any imputation of ability or power that this term didnt seem to cover in many a girl so great a kindness might have been fanned to something of a flame by the breath of close criticism i probably exaggerate little the perversity of pretty girls in saying that our young woman might at this moment have answered her sister with no i wasnt in love with him but somehow since youre so very disgusted i foresee that i shall be if he presses me it is doubtless difficult to say more for francies simplicity of character than that she felt no need of encouraging mr flack in order to prove to herself that she wasnt bullied she didnt care whether she were bullied or not and she was perfectly capable of letting delia believe her to have carried mildness to the point of giving up a man she had a secret sentiment for in order to oblige a relative who fairly brooded with devotion she wasnt clear herself as to whether it mightnt be so her pride what she had of it lay in an undistributed inert form quite at the bottom of her heart and she had never yet thought of a dignified theory to cover her want of uppishness she felt as she looked up at mr flack that she didnt care even if he should think she sacrificed him to a childish docility his bright eyes were hard as if he could almost guess how cynical she was and she turned her own again toward her retreating companions theyre going to dinner we oughtnt to be dawdling here she said  well if theyre going to dinner theyll have to eat the napkins i ordered it and i know when itll be ready george flack answered besides theyre not going to dinner theyre going to walk in the park dont you worry we shant lose them i wish we could the young man added in his boldest gayest manner  you wish we could  i should like to feel you just under my particular protection and no other  well i dont know what the dangers are said francie setting herself in motion again she went after the others but at the end of a few steps he stopped her again  you wont have confidence i wish youd believe what i tell you  you havent told me anything and she turned her back to him looking away at the splendid view i do love the scenery she added in a moment  well leave it alone a littleit wont run away i want to tell you something about myself if i could flatter myself youd take any interest in it he had thrust the raised point of his cane into the low wall of the terrace and he leaned on the knob screwing the other end gently round with both hands  ill take an interest if i can understand said francie  you can understand right enough if youll try i got today some news from america he went on that i like awfully the reverberator has taken a jump  this was not what francie had expected but it was better taken a jump  it has gone straight up its in the second hundred thousand  hundred thousand dollars said francie  no miss francie copies thats the circulation but the dollars are footing up too  and do they all come to you  precious few of them i wish they did its a sweet property  then it isnt yours she asked turning round to him it was an impulse of sympathy that made her look at him now for she already knew how much he had the success of his newspaper at heart he had once told her he loved the reverberator as he had loved his first jackknife  mine you dont mean to say you suppose i own it george flack shouted the light projected upon her innocence by his tone was so strong that the girl blushed and he went on more tenderly its a pretty sight the way you and your sister take that sort of thing for granted do you think property grows on you like a moustache well it seems as if it had on your father if i owned the reverberator i wouldnt be stumping round here id give my attention to another branch of the business that is id give my attention to all but i wouldnt go round with the deliverycart still im going to capture the blamed thing and i want you to help me the young man went on thats just what i wanted to speak to you about its a big proposition as it stands but i mean to make it bigger the most universal societypaper the world has seen thats where the future lies and the man who sees it first is the man wholl make his pile its a field for enlightened enterprise that hasnt yet begun to be worked he continued glowing as if on a sudden with his idea and one of his knowing eyes halfclosed itself for an emphasis habitual with him when he talked consecutively the effect of this would have been droll to a listener the note of the prospectus mingling with the question of his more intimate hope but it was not droll to francie she only thought it or supposed it a proof of the way mr flack saw everything on a stupendous scale there are ten thousand things to do that havent been done and im going to do them the societynews of every quarter of the globe furnished by the prominent members themselvesoh they can be fixed youll seefrom day to day and from hour to hour and served up hot at every breakfasttable in the united states thats what the american people want and thats what the american people are going to have i wouldnt say it to every one but i dont mind telling you that i consider my guess as good as the next mans on whats going to be required in future over there im going for the inside view the choice bits the chronique intime as they say here what the people wants just what aint told and im going to tell it oh theyre bound to have the plums thats about played out anyway the idea of sticking up a sign of private and hands off and no thoroughfare and thinking you can keep the place to yourself you aint going to be able any longer to monopolise any fact of general interest and it aint going to be right you should it aint going to continue to be possible to keep out anywhere the light of the press now what im going to do is to set up the biggest lamp yet made and make it shine all over the place well see whos private then and whose hands are off and wholl frustrate the peoplethe people that wants to know thats a sign of the american people that they do want to know and its the sign of george p flack the young man pursued with a rising spirit that hes going to help them but ill make the touchy folks crowd in themselves with their information and as i tell you miss francie its a job in which you can give me a lovely lift  well i dont see how said francie candidly i havent got any choice bits or any facts of general interest she spoke gaily because she was relieved she thought she had in truth a glimpse of what he wanted of her it was something better than she had feared since he didnt own the great newspaperher view of such possibilities was of the dimmesthe desired to possess himself of it and she sufficiently grasped the idea that money was needed for that she further seemed to make out that he presented himself to her that he hovered about her and pressed on her as moneyless and that this brought them round by a vague but comfortable transition to a helpful remembrance that her father was not the remaining divination silently achieved was quick and happy she should acquit herself by asking her father for the sum required and by just passing it on to mr flack the grandeur of his enterprise and the force of his reasoning appeared to overshadow her as they stood there this was a delightful simplification and it didnt for the moment strike her as positively unnatural that her companion should have a delicacy about appealing to mr dosson directly for financial aid though indeed she would have been capable of thinking that odd had she meditated on it there was nothing simpler to francie than the idea of putting her hand into her fathers pocket and she felt that even delia would be glad to appease their persecutor by this casual gesture i must add unfortunately that her alarm came back to her from his look as he replied do you mean to say you dont know after all ive done  im sure i dont know what youve done  havent i triedall i knowto make you like me  oh dear i do like you cried francie but how will that help you  it will help me if youll understand how i love you  well i wont understand replied the girl as she walked off  he followed her they went on together in silence and then he said do you mean to say you havent found that out  oh i dont find things outi aint an editor francie gaily quavered  you draw me out and then you gibe at me mr flack returned  i didnt draw you out why couldnt you see me just strain to get away  dont you sympathise then with my ideas  of course i do mr flack i think your ideas splendid said francie who hadnt in the least taken them in  well then why wont you work with me your affection your brightness your faithto say nothing of your matchless beautywould be everything to me  im very sorry but i cant i cant she protested  you could if you would quick enough  well then i wont and as soon as these words were spoken as if to mitigate something of their asperity she made her other point you must remember that i never said i wouldnor anything like it not one little wee mite i thought you just wanted me to speak to poppa  of course i supposed youd do that he allowed  i mean about your paper  about my paper  so as he could give you the moneyto do what you want  lord youre too sweet george flack cried with an illumined stare do you suppose id ever touch a cent of your fathers moneya speech not rankly hypocritical inasmuch as the young man who made his own discriminations had never been guilty and proposed to himself never to be of the indelicacy of tugging at his potential fatherinlaws pursestrings with his own hand he had talked to mr dosson by the hour about his masterplan of making the touchy folks themselves fall into line but had never dreamed this man would subsidise him as an interesting struggler the only character in which he could expect it would be that of francies accepted suitor and then the liberality would have francie and not himself for its object this reasoning naturally didnt lessen his impatience to take on the happy character so that his love of his profession and his appreciation of the girl at his side now ached together in his breast with the same disappointment she saw that her words had touched him like a lash they made him for a moment flush to his eyes this caused her own colour to riseshe could scarcely have said whyand she hurried along again he kept close to her he argued with her he besought her to think it over assuring her he had brains heart and material proofs of a college education to this she replied that if he didnt leave her alone she should cryand how would he like that to bring her back in such a state to the others he answered damn the others but it didnt help his case and at last he broke out will you just tell me this thenis it because youve promised miss delia francie returned that she hadnt promised miss delia anything and her companion went on of course i know what she has got in her head she wants to get you into the smart setthe grand monde as they call it here but i didnt suppose youd let her fix your life for you you were very different before he turned up  she never fixed anything for me i havent got any life and i dont want to have any francie veraciously pleaded and i dont know who youre talking about either  the man without a country hell pass you inthats what your sister wants  you oughtnt to abuse him because it was you that presented him the girl pronounced  i never presented him id like to kick him  we should never have seen him if it hadnt been for you she maintained  thats a fact but it doesnt make me love him any better hes the poorest kind there is  i dont care anything about his kind  thats a pity if youre going to marry him right off how could i know that when i took you up there  goodbye mr flack said francie trying to gain ground from him  this attempt was of course vain and after a moment he resumed will you keep me as a friend  why mr flack of course i will cried the easy creature  all right he replied and they presently overtook their companions     v  gaston probert made his plan confiding it only to his friend waterlow whose help indeed he needed to carry it out these revelations cost him something for the ornament of the merciless school as it might have been called found his predicament amusing and made no scruple of showing it gaston was too much in love however to be upset by a bad joke or two this fact is the more noteworthy as he knew that waterlow scoffed at him for a purposehad a view of the good to be done him by throwing him on the defensive the french tradition or a grimacing ghost of it was in waterlows manner but it had not made its mark on his view of the relations of a young man of spirit with parents and pastors he mixed his colours as might have been said with the general sense of france but his early american immunities and serenities could still swell his sail in any vital discussion with a friend in whose life the principle of authority played so large a part he accused probert of being afraid of his sisters which was an effective wayand he knew itof alluding to the rigidity of the conception of the family among people who had adopted and had even to waterlows sense as the phrase is improved upon the latin ideal that did injusticeand this the artist also knewto the delicate nature of the bond uniting the different members of the house of probert who were each for all and all for each family feeling among them was not a tyranny but a religion and in regard to mesdames de brecourt de cliche and de douves what gaston most feared was that he might seem to them not to love them enough none the less charles waterlow who thought he had charming parts held that the best way hadnt been taken to make a man of him and the zeal with which the painter appeared to have proposed to repair that mistake was founded in esteem though it sometimes flowered in freedom waterlow combined in odd fashion many of the forms of the parisian studio with the moral and social ideas of brooklyn long island where the seeds of his strictness had been sown  gaston probert desired nothing better than to be a man what worried himand it is perhaps a proof that his instinct was gravely at faultwas a certain vagueness as to the constituents of that character he should approximate more nearly as it seemed to him to the brute were he to sacrifice in such an effort the decencies and pietiesholy things all of themin which he had been reared it was very well for waterlow to say that to be a real man it was necessary to be a little of a brute his friend was willing in theory to assent even to that the difficulty was in application in practiceas to which the painter declared that all would be easy if such account hadnt to be taken of the marquise the comtesse andwhat was the other onethe princess these young amenities were exchanged between the pairwhile gaston explained almost as eagerly as if he were scoring a point that the other one was only a baronneduring that brief journey to spain of which mention has already been made during the later weeks of the summer after their return the friends then spent a fortnight together on the coast of brittany and above all during the autumn when they were settled in paris for the winter when mr dosson had reappeared according to the engagement with his daughters when the sittings for the portrait had multiplied the painter was unscrupulous as to the number he demanded and the work itself born under a happy star seemed to take more and more the turn of a great thing it was at granada that gaston had really broken out there one balmy night he had dropped into his comrades ear that he would marry francina dosson or would never marry at all the declaration was the more striking as it had come after such an interval many days had elapsed since their separation from the young lady and many new and beautiful objects appealed to them it appeared that the smitten youth had been thinking of her all the while and he let his friend know that it was the dinner at saintgermain that had finished him what she had been there waterlow himself had seen he wouldnt controvert the lucid proposition that she showed a cutting equal to any greek gem  in november in parisit was months and weeks before the artist began to please himselfgaston came often to the avenue de villiers toward the end of a sitting and till it was finished not to disturb the lovely model cultivated conversation with the elder sister the representative of the proberts was capable of that delia was always there of course but mr dosson had not once turned up and the newspaperman happily appeared to have faded from view the new aspirant learned in fact from miss dosson that a crisis in the history of his journal had recalled mr flack to the seat of that publication when the young ladies had goneand when he didnt go with them he accompanied them not rarelythe visitor was almost lyrical in his appreciation of his friends work he had no jealousy of the act of appropriation that rendered possible in its turn such an act of handing over of which the canvas constituted the field he was sure waterlow painted the girl too well to be in love with her and that if he himself could have dealt with her in that fashion he mightnt have wanted to deal in any other she bloomed there on the easel with all the purity of life and the artist had caught the very secret of her beauty it was exactly the way in which her lover would have chosen to see her shown and yet it had required a perfectly independent hand gaston mused on this mystery and somehow felt proud of the picture and responsible for it though it was no more his property as yet than the young lady herself when in december he put before waterlow his plan of campaign the latter made a comment ill do anything in the world you likeanything you think will help youbut it passes me my dear fellow why in the world you dont go to them and say ive seen a girl who is as good as cake and pretty as fire she exactly suits me ive taken time to think of it and i know what i want therefore i propose to make her my wife if you happen to like her so much the better if you dont be so good as to keep it to yourselves thats much the most excellent way why in the name of goodness all these mysteries and machinations  oh you dont understand you dont understand sighed gaston who had never pulled so long a face one cant break with ones traditions in an hour especially when theres so much in them that one likes i shant love her more if they like her but i shall love them more and i care about that you talk as a man who has nothing to consider ive everything to considerand im glad i have my pleasure in marrying her will be double if my father and my sisters accept her and i shall greatly enjoy working out the business of bringing them round  there were moments when charles waterlow resented the very vocabulary of his friend he hated to hear a man talk about the acceptance by any one but himself of the woman he loved ones own acceptanceof ones blissin such a case ended the matter and the effort to bring round those who gave her the cold shoulder was scarcely consistent with the highest spirit young probert explained that of course he felt his relatives would only have to know francina to like her to delight in her yet also that to know her they would first have to make her acquaintance this was the delicate point for social commerce with such malheureux as mr dosson and delia was not in the least in their usual line and it was impossible to disconnect the poor girl from her appendages therefore the whole question must be approached by an oblique movementit would never do to march straight up the wedge should have a narrow end which gaston now made sure he had found his sister susan was another name for this subtle engine he would break her in first and she would help him to break in the others she was his favourite relation his intimate friendthe most modern the most parisian and inflammable member of the family she had no suite dans les idees but she had perceptions had imagination and humour and was capable of generosity of enthusiasm and even of blind infatuation she had in fact taken two or three plunges of her own and ought to allow for those of others she wouldnt like the dossons superficially any better than his father or than margaret or than janehe called these ladies by their english names but for themselves their husbands their friends and each other they were suzanne marguerite and jeanne but there was a good chance of his gaining her to his side she was as fond of beauty and of the arts as hethis was one of their bonds of union she appreciated highly charles waterlows talent and there had been talk of her deciding to sit to him it was true her husband viewed the project with so much colder an eye that it had not been carried out  according to gastons plan she was to come to the avenue de villiers to see what the artist had done for miss francie her brother was to have worked upon her in advance by his careful rhapsodies bearing wholly on the achievement itself the dazzling example of waterlows powers and not on the young lady whom he was not to let her know at first that he had so much as seen just at the last just before her visit he was to mention to her that he had met the girlat the studioand that she was as remarkable in her way as the picture seeing the picture and hearing this mme de brecourt as a disinterested lover of charming impressions and above all as an easy prey at all times to a rabid curiosity would express a desire also to enjoy a sight of so rare a creature on which waterlow might pronounce it all arrangeable if she would but come in some day when miss francie should sit he would give her two or three dates and gaston would see that she didnt let the opportunity pass she would return alonethis time he wouldnt go with herand she would be as taken as could be hoped or needed everything much depended on that but it couldnt fail the girl would have to take her but the girl could be trusted especially if she didnt know who the demonstrative french lady was with her fine plain face her hair so blond as to be nearly white her vividly red lips and protuberant lightcoloured eyes their host was to do no introducing and to reveal the visitors identity only after she had gone that was a condition indeed this participant grumbled at he called the whole business an odious comedy though his friend knew that if he undertook it he would acquit himself honourably after mme de brecourt had been captivatedthe question of how francie would be affected received in advance no considerationher brother would throw off the mask and convince her that she must now work with him another meeting would be managed for her with the girlin which each would appear in her proper character and in short the plot would thicken  gastons forecast of his difficulties showed how finely he could analyse but that was not rare enough in any french connexion to make his friend stare he brought suzanne de brecourt she was enchanted with the portrait of the little american and the rest of the drama began to follow in its order mme de brecourt raved to waterlows faceshe had no opinions behind peoples backsabout his mastery of his craft she could dispose the floral tributes of homage with a hand of practice all her own she was the reverse of egotistic and never spoke of herself her success in life sprang from a much wiser adoption of pronouns waterlow who liked her and had long wanted to paint her uglinessit was a goldmine of charmhad two opinions about her one of which was that she knew a hundred times less than she thought and even than her brother thought of what she talked about and the other that she was after all not such a humbug as she seemed she passed in her family for a rank radical a bold bohemian she picked up expressions out of newspapers and at the petits theatres but her hands and feet were celebrated and her behaviour was not that of her sisters as well had never been disastrously exposed  but she must be charming your young lady she said to gaston while she turned her head this way and that as she stood before francies image shes a little renaissance statuette cast in silver something of jean goujon or germain pilon the young men exchanged a glance for this struck them as the happiest comparison and gaston replied in a detached way that the girl was well worth seeing  he went in to have a cup of tea with his sister on the day he knew she would have paid her second visit to the studio and the first words she greeted him with were but shes admirablevotre petiteadmirable admirable there was a lady calling in the place beauvau at the momentold mme doutrevillewho naturally asked for news of the object of such enthusiasm gaston suffered susan to answer all questions and was attentive to her account of the new beauty she described his young friend almost as well as he would have done from the point of view of her type her graces her plastic value using various technical and critical terms to which the old lady listened in silence solemnly rather coldly as if she thought such talk much of a galimatias she belonged to the oldfashioned school and held a pretty person sufficiently catalogued when it had been said she had a dazzling complexion or the finest eyes in the world  questce que cest que cette merveille she enquired to which mme de brecourt made answer that it was a little american her brother had somewhere dug up and what do you propose to do with it may one ask mme doutreville demanded looking at gaston with an eye that seemed to read his secret and that brought him for half a minute to the point of breaking out i propose to marry itthere but he contained himself only pleading for the present his wish to ascertain the uses to which she was adapted meanwhile he added there was nothing he so much liked as to look at her in the measure in which she would allow him ah that may take you far their visitor cried as she got up to go and the young man glanced at his sister to see if she too were ironic but she seemed almost awkwardly free from alarm if she had been suspicious it would have been easier to make his confession when he came back from accompanying their old friend outreville to her carriage he asked her if waterlows charming sitter had known who she was and if she had been frightened mme de brecourt stared she evidently thought that kind of sensibility implied an initiationand into dangerswhich a little american accidentally encountered couldnt possibly have why should she be frightened she wouldnt be even if she had known who i was much less therefore when i was nothing for her  oh you werent nothing for her the brooding youth declared and when his sister rejoined that he was trop aimable he brought out his lurking fact he had seen the lovely creature more often than he had mentioned he had particularly wished that she should see her now he wanted his father and jane and margaret to do the same and above all he wanted them to like her even as she susan liked her he was delighted she had been takenhe had been so taken himself mme de brecourt protested that she had reserved her independence of judgement and he answered that if she thought miss dosson repulsive he might have expressed it in another way when she begged him to tell her what he was talking about and what he wanted them all to do with the child he said i want you to treat her kindly tenderly for such as you see her im thinking of bringing her into the family  mercy on usyou havent proposed for her cried mme de brecourt  no but ive sounded her sister as to their dispositions and she tells me that if i present myself there will be no difficulty  her sisterthe awful little woman with the big head  her heads rather out of drawing but it isnt a part of the affair shes very inoffensive she would be devoted to me  for heavens sake then keep quiet shes as common as a dressmakers bill  not when you know her besides that has nothing to do with francie you couldnt find words enough a moment ago to express that francies exquisite and now youll be so good as to stick to that comefeel it all since you have such a free mind  do you call her by her little name like that mme de brecourt asked giving him another cup of tea  only to you shes perfectly simple its impossible to imagine anything better and think of the delight of having that charming object before ones eyesalways always it makes a different lookout for life  mme brecourts lively head tossed this argument as high as if she had carried a pair of horns my poor child what are you thinking of you cant pick up a wife like thatthe first little american that comes along you know i hoped you wouldnt marry at allwhat a pity i think it for a man at any rate if you expect us to like misswhats her namemiss fancy all i can say is we wont we cant do that sort of thing  i shall marry her then the young man returned without your leave given  very good but if she deprives you of our approvalyouve always had it youre used to it and depend on it its a part of your lifeyoull hate her like poison at the end of a month  i dont care then i shall have always had my month  and shepoor thing  poor thing exactly youll begin to pity her and that will make you cultivate charity and cultivate her with it which will then make you find out how adorable she is then youll like her then youll love her then youll see what a perfect sense for the right thing the right thing for me ive had and we shall all be happy together again  but how can you possibly know with such people mme de brecourt demanded what youve got hold of  by having a feeling for whats really whats delicately good and charming you pretend to have it and yet in such a case as this you try to be stupid give that up you might as well first as last for the girls an exquisite fact shell prevail and it will be better to accept her than to let her accept you  mme de brecourt asked him if miss dosson had a fortune and he said he knew nothing about that her father certainly must be rich but he didnt mean to ask for a penny with her american fortunes moreover were the last things to count upon a truth of which they had seen too many examples to this his sister had replied papa will never listen to that  listen to what  to your not finding out to your not asking for settlementscomme cela se fait  pardon me papa will find out for himself and hell know perfectly whether to ask or whether to leave it alone thats the sort of thing he does know and he knows quite as well that im very difficult to place  youll be difficult my dear if we lose you mme de brecourt laughed to replace  always at any rate to find a wife for im neither fish nor flesh ive no country no career no future i offer nothing i bring nothing what position under the sun do i confer theres a fatuity in our talking as if we could make grand terms you and the others are well enough qui prend mari prend pays and youve names about which your husbands take a great stand but papa and ii ask you  as a family nous sommes tresbien said mme de brecourt you know what we areit doesnt need any explanation were as good as anything there is and have always been thought so you might do anything you like  well i shall never like to marrywhen it comes to thata frenchwoman  thank you my dearand mme de brecourt tossed her head  no sister of mines really french returned the young man  no brother of mines really mad marry whomever you like susan went on only let her be the best of her kind let her be at least a gentlewoman trust me ive studied life thats the only thing thats safe  francies the equal of the first lady in the land  with that sisterwith that hat nevernever  whats the matter with her hat  the sisters told a story it was a documentit described them it classed them and such a patois as they speak  my dear her english is quite as good as yours you dont even know how bad yours is the young man went on with assurance  well i dont say parus and i never asked an englishman to marry me you know what our feelings are his companion as ardently pursued our convictions our susceptibilities we may be wrong we may be hollow we may be pretentious we maynt be able to say on what it all rests but there we are and the facts insurmountable its simply impossible for us to live with vulgar people its a defect no doubt its an immense inconvenience and in the days we live in its sadly against ones interest but were made like that and we must understand ourselves its of the very essence of our nature and of yours exactly as much as of mine or of that of the others dont make a mistake about ityoull prepare for yourself a bitter future i know what becomes of us we suffer we go through tortures we die  the accent of passionate prophecy was in this ladys voice but her brother made her no immediate answer only indulging restlessly in several turns about the room at last he took up his hat i shall come to an understanding with her tomorrow and the next day about this hour i shall bring her to see you meanwhile please say nothing to any one  mme de brecourts eyes lingered on him he had grasped the knob of the door what do you mean by her fathers being certainly rich thats such a vague term what do you suppose his fortune to be  ah thats a question she would never ask her brother cried as he left her     vi   the next morning he found himself seated on one of the redsatin sofas beside mr dosson in this gentlemans private room at the hotel de lunivers et de cheltenham delia and francie had established their father in the old quarters they expected to finish the winter in paris but had not taken independent apartments for they had an idea that when you lived that way it was grand but lonelyyou didnt meet people on the staircase the temperature was now such as to deprive the good gentleman of his usual resource of sitting in the court and he had not yet discovered an effective substitute for this recreation without mr flack at the cafes he felt too much a nonconsumer but he was patient and ruminant young probert grew to like him and tried to invent amusements for him took him to see the great markets the sewers and the bank of france and put him with the lushest disinterestedness in the way of acquiring a beautiful pair of horses which mr dosson little as he resembles a sporting character found it a great resource on fine afternoons to drive with a highly scientific hand and from a smart americaine in the bois de boulogne there was a readingroom at the bankers where he spent hours engaged in a manner best known to himself and he shared the great interest the constant topic of his daughtersthe portrait that was going forward in the avenue de villiers  this was the subject round which the thoughts of these young ladies clustered and their activity revolved it gave free play to their faculty for endless repetition for monotonous insistence for vague and aimless discussion on leaving mme de brecourt francies lover had written to delia that he desired half an hours private conversation with her father on the morrow at halfpast eleven his impatience forbade him to wait for a more canonical hour he asked her to be so good as to arrange that mr dosson should be there to receive him and to keep francie out of the way delia acquitted herself to the letter  well sir what have you got to show asked francies father leaning far back on the sofa and moving nothing but his head and that very little toward his interlocutor gaston was placed sidewise a hand on each knee almost facing him on the edge of the seat  to show sirwhat do you mean  what do you do for a living how do you subsist  oh comfortably enough of course it would be remiss in you not to satisfy yourself on that point my incomes derived from three sources first some property left me by my dear mother second a legacy from my poor brotherhe had inherited a small fortune from an old relation of ours who took a great fancy to him he went to america to see her which he divided among the four of us in the will he made at the time of the war  the warwhat war asked mr dosson  why the francogerman  oh that old war and mr dosson almost laughed well he mildly continued  then my fathers so good as to make me a decent allowance and some day i shall have morefrom him  mr dosson appeared to think these things over why you seem to have fixed it so you live mostly on other folks  i shall never attempt to live on you sir this was spoken with some vivacity by our young man he felt the next moment that he had said something that might provoke a retort but his companion showed no sharpness  well i guess there wont be any trouble about that and what does my daughter say  i havent spoken to her yet  havent spoken to the person most interested  i thought it more orthodox to break ground with you first  well when i was after mrs dosson i guess i spoke to her quick enough francies father just a little dryly stated there was an element of reproach in this and gaston was mystified for the question about his means a moment before had been in the nature of a challenge  how will you feel if she wont have you after youve exposed yourself this way to me mr dosson went on  well ive a sort of confidence it may be vain but god grant not i think she likes me personally but what im afraid of is that she may consider she knows too little about me she has never seen my peopleshe doesnt know what may be before her  do you mean your familythe folks at home said mr dosson dont you believe that delia has moused aroundshe has found out delias thorough  well were very simple kindly respectable people as youll see in a day or two for yourself my father and sisters will do themselves the honour to wait upon you the young man announced with a temerity the sense of which made his voice tremble  we shall be very happy to see them sir his host cheerfully returned well now lets see the good gentleman socially mused dont you expect to embrace any regular occupation  gaston smiled at him as from depths have you anything of that sort sir  well you have me there mr dosson resignedly sighed it doesnt seem as if i required anything im looked after so well the fact is the girls support me  i shall not expect miss francie to support me said gaston probert  youre prepared to enable her to live in the style to which shes accustomed and his friend turned on him an eye as of quite patient speculation  well i dont think shell miss anything that is if she does shell find other things instead  i presume shell miss delia and even me a little it occurred to mr dosson to mention  oh its easy to prevent that the young man threw off  well of course we shall be on hand after which mr dosson continued to follow the subject as at the same respectful distance youll continue to reside in paris  ill live anywhere in the world she likes of course my people are herethats a great tie im not without hope that it maywith timebecome a reason for your daughter gaston handsomely wound up  oh any reasonll do where paris is concerned take some lunch mr dosson added looking at his watch  they rose to their feet but before they had gone many stepsthe meals of this amiable family were now served in an adjoining roomthe young man stopped his companion i cant tell you how kind i think itthe way you treat me and how im touched by your confidence you take me just as i am with no recommendation beyond my own word  well mr probert said his host if we didnt like you we wouldnt smile on you recommendations in that case wouldnt be any good and since we do like you there aint any call for them either i trust my daughters if i didnt id have stayed at home and if i trust them and they trust you its the same as if i trusted you aint it  i guess it is gaston delightedly smiled  his companion laid a hand on the door but paused a moment now are you very sure  i thought i was but you make me nervous  because there was a gentleman here last yearid have put my money on him  gaston wondered a gentlemanlast year  mr flack you met him surely a very fine man i thought he rather hit it off with her  seigneur dieu gaston probert murmured under his breath  mr dosson had opened the door he made his companion pass into the small diningroom where the table was spread for the noonday breakfast where are the chickens he disappointedly asked his visitor at first supposed him to have missed a customary dish from the board but recognised the next moment his usual designation of his daughters these young ladies presently came in but francie looked away from the suitor for her hand the suggestion just dropped by her father had given him a shockthe idea of the newspapermans personal success with so rare a creature was inconceivablebut her charming way of avoiding his eye convinced him he had nothing to really fear from mr flack  that nightit had been an exciting daydelia remarked to her sister that of course she could draw back upon which as francie repeated the expression with her so markedly looser grasp you can send him a note saying you wont delia explained  wont marry him  gracious no wont go to see his sister you can tell him its her place to come to see you first  oh i dont care said francie wearily  delia judged this with all her weight is that the way you answered him when he asked you  im sure i dont know he could tell you best  if you were to speak to me that way i guess id have said oh well if you dont want it any more than that  well i wish it was you said francie  that mr probert was me  nothat you were the one hes after  francie dosson are you thinking of mr flack her sister suddenly broke out  no not much  well then whats the matter  youve ideas and opinions you know whose place it is and whats due and what aint you could meet them all francie opined  but delia was indifferent to this tribute why how can you say when thats just what im trying to find out  it doesnt matter anyway it will never come off francie went on  what do you mean by that  hell give me up in a few weeks ill be sure to do something  do something  well that will break the charm francie sighed with the sweetest feeblest fatalism  if you say that again i shall think you do it on purpose delia declared are you thinking of george flack she repeated in a moment  oh do leave him alone francie answered in one of her rare irritations  then why are you so queer  oh im tiredand the girl turned impatiently away and this was the simple truth she was tired of the consideration her sister saw fit to devote to the question of gastons not having since their return to paris brought the old folks as they used to say at home to see them she was overdone with delias theories on this subject which varied from the view that he was keeping his intercourse with his american friends unguessed by them because they were uncompromising in their grandeur to the presumption that that grandeur would descend some day upon the hotel de lunivers et de cheltenham and carry francie away in a blaze of glory sometimes delia played in her earnest way with the idea that they ought to make certain of gastons omissions the ground of a challenge at other times she gave her reasons for judging that they ought to take no notice of them francie in this connexion had neither doctrine nor instinct of her own and now she was all at once happy and uneasy all at once in love and in doubt and in fear and in a state of native indifference her lover had dwelt to her but little on his domestic circle and she had noticed this circumstance the more because of a remark dropped by charles waterlow to the effect that he and his father were great friends the word seemed to her odd in that application she knew he saw that gentleman and the types of high fashion as she supposed mr proberts daughters very often and she therefore took for granted that they knew he saw her but the most he had done was to say they would come and see her like a shot if once they should believe they could trust her she had wanted to know what he meant by their trusting her and he had explained that it would seem to them too good to be truethat she should be kind to him something exactly of that sort was what they dreamed of for him but they had dreamed before and been disappointed and were now on their guard from the moment they should feel they were on solid ground they would join hands and dance round her francies answer to this ingenuity was that she didnt know what he was talking about and he indulged in no attempt on that occasion to render his meaning more clear the consequence of which was that he felt he bore as yet with an insufficient mass he cut to be plain a poor figure his uneasiness had not passed away for many things in truth were dark to him he couldnt see his father fraternising with mr dosson he couldnt see margaret and jane recognising an alliance in which delia was one of the allies he had answered for them because that was the only thing to do and this only just failed to be criminally reckless what saved it was the hope he founded upon mme de brecourt and the sense of how well he could answer to the others for francie he considered that susan had in her first judgement of his young lady committed herself she had really taken her in and her subsequent protest when she found what was in his heart had been a denial which he would make her in turn deny the girls slow sweetness once acting she would come round a simple interview with francie would suffice for this resultby the end of half an hour she should be an enthusiastic convert by the end of an hour she would believe she herself had invented the matchhad discovered the pearl he would pack her off to the others as the author of the plan she would take it all upon herself would represent him even as hanging a little back she would do nothing of that sort but would boast of her superior flair and would so enjoy the comedy as to forget she had resisted him even a moment the young man had a high sense of honour but was ready in this forecast for fifty fibs     vii  it may as well be said at once that his prevision was soon made good and that in the course of a fortnight old mr probert and his daughters alighted successively at the hotel de lunivers et de cheltenham francies visit with her intended to mme de brecourt bore exactly the fruit her admirer had foretold and was followed the very next day by a call from this lady she took the girl out with her in her carriage and kept her the whole afternoon driving her half over paris chattering with her kissing her delighting in her telling her they were already sisters paying her compliments that made francie envy her art of saying things as she had never heard things saidfor the excellent reason among many that she had never known such things could be after she had dropped her charge this critic rushed off to her fathers reflecting with pleasure that at that hour she should probably find her sister marguerite there mme de cliche was with their parent in factshe had three days in the week for coming to the cours la reine she sat near him in the firelight telling him presumably her troubles for maxime de cliche having proved not quite the pearl they had originally supposed mme de brecourt knew what marguerite did whenever she took that little ottoman and drew it close to the paternal chair she gave way to her favourite vice that of dolefulness which lengthened her long face more it was unbecoming if she only knew it the family was intensely united as we see but that didnt prevent mme de brecourts having a certain sympathy for maxime he too was one of themselves and she asked herself what she would have done had she been a wellconstituted man with a wife whose cheeks were like decks in a high sea it was the twilight hour in the winter days before the lamps that especially brought her out then she began her long stories about her complicated cares to which her father listened with angelic patience mme de brecourt liked his particular room in the old house in the cours la reine it reminded her of her mothers life and her young days and her dead brother and the feelings connected with her first going into the world alphonse and she had had an apartment by her fathers kindness under the roof that covered in associations as the door of a linencloset preserves herbaceous scents so that she continued to pop in and out full of her fresh impressions of society just as she had done when she was a girl she broke into her sisters confidences now she announced her trouvaille and did battle for it bravely  five days laterthere had been lively work in the meantime gaston turned so pale at moments that she feared it would all result in a mortal illness for him and marguerite shed gallons of tearsmr probert went to see the dossons with his son mme de brecourt paid them another visit a real official affair as she deemed it accompanied by her husband and the baron de douves and his wife written to by gaston by his father and by margaret and susan came up from the country full of anxious participation m de douves was the person who took the family all round most seriously and who most deprecated any sign of crude or precipitate action he was a very small black gentleman with thick eyebrows and high heelsin the country and the mud he wore sabots with straw in themwho was suspected by his friends of believing that he looked like louis xiv it is perhaps a proof that something of the quality of this monarch was really recognised in him that no one had ever ventured to clear up this point by a question la famille cest moi appeared to be his tacit formula and he carried his umbrellahe had very bad ones gaston thoughtwith something of a sceptral air mme de brecourt went so far as to believe that his wife in confirmation of this took herself for a species of mme de maintenon she had lapsed into a provincial existence as she might have harked back to the seventeenth century the world she lived in seemed about as far away she was the largest heaviest member of the family and in the vendee was thought majestic despite the old clothes she fondly affected and which added to her look of having come down from a remote past or reverted to it she was at bottom an excellent woman but she wrote roy and foy like her husband and the action of her mind was wholly restricted to questions of relationship and alliance she had extraordinary patience of research and tenacity of grasp for a clue and viewed people solely in the light projected upon them by others that is not as good or wicked ugly or handsome wise or foolish but as grandsons nephews uncles and aunts brothers and sistersinlaw cousins and second cousins you might have supposed to listen to her that human beings were susceptible of no attribute but that of a dwindling or thickening consanguinity there was a certain expectation that she would leave rather formidable memoirs in mme de brecourts eyes this pair were very shabby they didnt payer de minethey fairly smelt of their province but for the reality of the thing she often said to herself theyre worth all of us were diluted and theyre pure and any one with an eye would see it the thing was the legitimist principle the ancient faith and even a little the right the unconscious grand air  the marquis de cliche did his duty with his wife who mopped the decks as susan said for the occasion and was entertained in the redsatin drawingroom by mr dosson delia and francie mr dosson had wanted and proposed to be somewhere else when he heard of the approach of gastons relations and the fond youth had to instruct him that this wouldnt do the apartment in question had had a range of vision but had probably never witnessed stranger doings than these laudable social efforts gaston was taught to feel that his family had made a great sacrifice for him but in a very few days he said to himself that now they knew the worst he was safe they made the sacrifice they definitely agreed to it but they thought proper he should measure the full extent of it gaston must never never never be allowed to forget what weve done for him mme de brecourt told him that marguerite de cliche had expressed herself in that sense at one of the family conclaves from which he was absent these high commissions sat for several days with great frequency and the young man could feel that if there was help for him in discussion his case was promising he flattered himself that he showed infinite patience and tact and his expenditure of the latter quality in particular was in itself his only reward for it was impossible he should tell francie what arts he had to practise for her he liked to think however that he practised them successfully for he held that it was by such arts the civilised man is distinguished from the savage what they cost him was made up simply in thisthat his private irritation produced a degree of adoptive heat in regard to mr dosson and delia whom he could neither justify nor coherently account for nor make people like but whom he had ended after so many days of familiar intercourse by liking extremely himself the way to get on with themit was an immense simplificationwas just to love them one could do that even if one couldnt converse with them he succeeded in making mme de brecourt seize this nuance she embraced the idea with her quick inflammability yes she said we must insist on their positive not on their negative merits their infinite generosity their untutored their intensely native and instinctive delicacy ah their charming primitive instinctswe must work those and the brother and sister excited each other magnanimously to this undertaking sometimes it must be added they exchanged a look that seemed to sound with a slight alarm the depth of their responsibility  on the day mr probert called at the hotel de lunivers et de cheltenham with his son the pair walked away together back to the cours la reine without immediate comments the only words uttered were three or four of mr proberts with gastons rejoinder as they crossed the place de la concorde  we should have to have them to dinner the young man noted his fathers conditional as if his assent to the strange alliance were not yet complete but he guessed all the same that the sight of them had not made a difference for the worse they had let the old gentleman down more easily than was to have been feared the call had had above all the immense luck that it hadnt been noisya confusion of underbred sounds which was very happy for mr probert was particular in this he could bear french noise but couldnt for the life of him bear american as for english he maintained that there was no such thing england was a country with the straw down in all the thoroughfares of talk mr dosson had scarcely spoken and yet had remained perfectly placid which was exactly what gaston would have chosen no hauteur could have matched ithe had gone so little out of his way francies lover knew moreoverthough he was a little disappointed that no charmed exclamation should have been dropped as they quitted the hotelthat the girls rare spell had worked it was impossible the old man shouldnt have liked her  ah do ask them and let it be very soon he replied theyll like it so much  and whom can they meetwho can meet them  only the familyall of us au complet other people we can have later  all of us au completthat makes eight and the three of them said mr probert then he added poor creatures the fine ironic humane sound of it gave gaston much pleasure he passed his hand into his fathers arm it promised well it made the intelligent the tender allowance for the dear little dossons confronted with a row of fierce french critics judged by standards they had never even heard of the meeting of the two parents had not made the problem of their commerce any more clear but our youth was reminded afresh by his elders hinted pity his breathed charity of the latent liberality that was really what he had built on the dear old governor goodness knew had prejudices and superstitions but if they were numerous and some of them very curious they were not rigid he had also such nice inconsistent feelings such irrepressible indulgences such humorous deviations and they would ease everything off he was in short an old darling and with an old darling in the long run one was always safe when they reached the house in the cours la reine mr probert said i think you told me youre dining out  yes with our friends  our friends comme vous y allez come in and see me then on your return but not later than halfpast ten  from this the young man saw he had swallowed the dose if he had found it refuse to go down he would have cried for relief without delay this reflexion was highly agreeable for gaston perfectly knew how little he himself would have enjoyed a struggle he would have carried it through but he couldnt bear to think of that and the sense of the further arguments he was spared made him feel at peace with all the world the dinner at the hotel became the gayest of banquets in honour of this state of things especially as francie and delia raved as they said about his poppa  well i expected something nice but he goes far beyond delia declared thats my idea of a real gentleman  ah for that said gaston  hes too sweet for anything im not a bit afraid of him francie contributed  why in the world should you be  well i am of you the girl professed  much you show it her lover returned  yes i am she insisted at the bottom of all  well thats what a lady should beafraid of her lord and master  well i dont know im more afraid than that youll see  i wish you were afraid of talking nonsense said happy gaston  mr dosson made no observation whatever about their grave bland visitor he listened in genial unprejudiced silence it was a sign of his prospective soninlaws perfect comprehension of him that gaston knew this silence not to be in any degree restrictive it didnt at all mean he hadnt been pleased mr dosson had nothing to say because nothing had been given him he hadnt like his so differentlyappointed young friend a sensitive plate for a brain and the important events of his life had never been personal impressions his mind had had absolutely no history with which anything occurring in the present connexion could be continuous and mr proberts appearance had neither founded a state nor produced a revolution if the young man had asked him how he liked his father he would have said at the most oh i guess hes all right but what was more touchingly candid even than this in gastons view was the attitude of the good gentleman and his daughters toward the others mesdames de douves de brecourt and de cliche and their husbands who had now all filed before them they believed the ladies and the gentlemen alike to have covered them with frank endearments to have been artlessly and gushingly glad to make their acquaintance they had not in the least seen what was manner the minimum of decent profession and what the subtle resignation of old races who have known a long historical discipline and have conventional forms and tortuous channels and grimacing masks for their impulsesforms resembling singularly little the feelings themselves francie took people at their word when they told her that the whole maniere detre of her family inspired them with an irresistible sympathy that was a speech of which mme de cliche had been capable speaking as if for all the proberts and for the old noblesse of france it wouldnt have occurred to the girl that such things need have been said as for mere frilling and finish her lover whose life affected her as a picture of high price in itself but set in a frame too big and too heavy for it and who therefore might have taken for granted any amount of gilding yet made his reflexions on it now he noticed how a manner might be a very misleading symbol might cover pitfalls and bottomless gulfs when it had reached that perfection and corresponded so little to fact what he had wanted was that his people should be as easy as they could see their way to being but with such a high standard of compliment where after all was sincerity and without sincerity how could people get on together when it came to their settling down to common life then the dossons might have surprises and the surprises would be painful in proportion as their present innocence was great as to the high standard itself there was no manner of doubt there ought to be preserved examples of that perfection     viii  when on coming home again this evening meanwhile he complied with his fathers request by returning to the room in which the old man habitually sat mr probert laid down his book and kept on his glasses of course youll continue to live with me youll understand that i dont consent to your going away youll have the rooms occupied at first by susan and alphonse  gaston noted with pleasure the transition from the conditional to the future tense and also the circumstance that his father had been lost in a book according to his now confirmed custom of evening ease this proved him not too much off the hinge he read a great deal and very serious books works about the origin of thingsof man of institutions of speech of religion this habit he had taken up more particularly since the circle of his social life had contracted he sat there alone turning his pages softly contentedly with the lamplight shining on his refined old head and embroidered dressinggown he had used of old to be out every night in the weekgaston was perfectly aware that to many dull people he must even have appeared a little frivolous he was essentially a social creature and indeedexcept perhaps poor jane in her damp old castle in brittanythey were all social creatures that was doubtless part of the reason why the family had acclimatised itself in france they had affinities with a society of conversation they liked general talk and old high salons slightly tarnished and dim containing precious relics where winged words flew about through a circle round the fire and some clever person before the chimneypiece held or challenged the others that figure gaston knew especially in the days before he could see for himself had very often been his father the lightest and most amiable specimen of the type that enjoyed easy possession of the hearthrug people left it to him he was so transparent like a glass screen and he never triumphed in debate his word on most subjects was not felt to be the last it was usually not more conclusive than a shrugging inarticulate resignation an ah you know what will you have but he had been none the less a part of the very prestige of some dozen good houses most of them over the river in the conservative faubourg and several today profaned shrines cold and desolate hearths these had made up mr proberts pleasant worlda world not too small for him and yet not too large though some of them supposed themselves great institutions gaston knew the succession of events that had helped to make a difference the most salient of which were the death of his brother the death of his mother and above all perhaps the demise of mme de marignac to whom the old boy used still to go three or four evenings out of the seven and sometimes even in the morning besides gaston fully measured the place she had held in his fathers life and affection and the terms on which they had grown up togetherher people had been friends of his grandfather when that fine old southern worthy came a widower with a young son and several negroes to take his pleasure in paris in the time of louis philippeand the devoted part she had played in marrying his sisters he was quite aware that her friendship and all its exertions were often mentioned as explaining their position so remarkable in a society in which they had begun after all as outsiders but he would have guessed even if he had not been told what his father said to that to offer the proberts a position was to carry water to the fountain they hadnt left their own behind them in carolina it had been large enough to stretch across the sea as to what it was in carolina there was no need of being explicit this adoptive parisian was by nature presupposing but he was admirably urbanethat was why they let him talk so before the fire he was the oracle persuasive the conciliatory voiceand after the death of his wife and of mme de marignac who had been her friend too the young mans mothers he was gentler if more detached than before gaston had already felt him to care in consequence less for everythingexcept indeed for the true faith to which he drew still closerand this increase of indifference doubtless helped to explain his present charming accommodation  we shall be thankful for any rooms you may give us his son said we shall fill out the house a little and wont that be rather an improvement shrunken as you and i have become  youll fill it out a good deal i suppose with mr dosson and the other girl  ah francie wont give up her father and sister certainly and what should you think of her if she did but theyre not intrusive theyre essentially modest people they wont put themselves upon us they have great natural discretion gaston declared  do you answer for that susan does shes always assuring one of it mr probert said the father has so much that he wouldnt even speak to me  he didnt poor dear man know what to say  how then shall i know what to say to him  ah you always know gaston smiled  how will that help us if he doesnt know what to answer  youll draw him out hes full of a funny little shade of bonhomie  well i wont quarrel with your bonhomme said mr probertif hes silent there are much worse faults nor yet with the fat young lady though shes evidently vulgareven if you call it perhaps too a funny little shade its not for ourselves im afraid its for them theyll be very unhappy  never never said gaston theyre too simple theyll remain so theyre not morbid nor suspicious and dont you like francie you havent told me so he added in a moment  she talks about parus my dear boy  ah to susan too that seemed the great barrier but she has got over it i mean susan has got over the barrier we shall make her speak french she has a real disposition for it her french is already almost as good as her english  that oughtnt to be difficult what will you have of course shes very pretty and im sure shes good but i wont tell you she is a marvel because you must rememberyou young fellows think your own point of view and your own experience everythingthat ive seen beauties without number ive known the most charming women of our timewomen of an order to which miss francie con rispetto parlando will never begin to belong im difficult about womenhow can i help it therefore when you pick up a little american girl at an inn and bring her to us as a miracle feel how standards alter jai vu mieux que ca mon cher however i accept everything today as you know when once one has lost ones enthusiasm everythings the same and one might as well perish by the sword as by famine  i hoped shed fascinate you on the spot gaston rather ruefully remarked  fascinatethe language you fellows use how many times in ones life is one likely to be fascinated  well shell charm you yet  shell never know at least that she doesnt ill engage for that said mr probert handsomely  ah be sincere with her fathershes worth it his son broke out  when the elder man took that tone the tone of vast experience and a fastidiousness justified by ineffable recollections our friend was more provoked than he could say though he was also considerably amused for he had a good while since made up his mind about the element of rather stupid convention in it it was fatuous to miss so little the fine perceptions one didnt have so far from its showing experience it showed a sad simplicity not to feel francie dosson he thanked god she was just the sort of imponderable infinite quantity such as there were no stupid terms for that he did feel he didnt know what old frumps his father might have frequentedthe style of 1830 with long curls in front a vapid simper a scotch plaid dress and a corsage in a point suggestive of twenty whalebones coming down to the kneesbut he could remember mme de marignacs tuesdays and thursdays and fridays with sundays and other days thrown in and the taste that prevailed in that milieu the books they admired the verses they read and recited the pictures great heaven they thought good and the three busts of the lady of the house in different corners as a diana a druidess and a croyante her shoulders were supposed to make up for her head effigies the public ridicule attaching to which today wouldeven the least bad canovasmake their authors burrow in holes for shame  and what else is she worth mr probert asked after a momentary hesitation  how do you mean what else  her immense prospects thats what susan has been putting forward susans insistence on them was mainly what brought over jane do you mind my speaking of them  gaston was obliged to recognise privately the importance of janes having been brought over but he hated to hear it spoken of as if he were under an obligation to it to whom sir he asked  oh only to you  you cant do less than mr dosson as i told you he waived the question of money and he was splendid we cant be more mercenary than he  he waived the question of his own you mean said mr probert  yes and of yours but it will be all right the young man flattered himself that this was as near as he was willing to go to any view of pecuniary convenience  well its your affairor your sisters his father returned  its their idea that we see where we are and that we make the best of it  its very good of them to make the best of it and i should think theyd be tired of their own chatter gaston impatiently sighed  mr probert looked at him a moment in vague surprise but only said i think they are however the period of discussions closed weve taken the jump he then added as to put the matter a little less dryly alphonse and maxime are quite of your opinion  of my opinion  that shes charming  confound them then im not of theirs the form of this rejoinder was childishly perverse and it made mr probert stare again but it belonged to one of the reasons for which his children regarded him as an old darling that gaston could suppose him after an instant to embrace it the old man said nothing but took up his book and his son who had been standing before the fire went out of the room his abstention from protest at gastons petulance was the more generous as he was capable for his part of feeling it to make for a greater amenity in the whole connexion that ces messieurs should like the little girl at the hotel gaston didnt care a straw what it made for and would have seen himself in bondage indeed had he given a second thought to the question this was especially the case as his fathers mention of the approval of two of his brothersinlaw appeared to point to a possible disapproval on the part of the third francies lover cared as little whether she displeased m de brecourt as he cared whether she pleased maxime and raoul mr probert continued to read and in a few moments gaston was with him again he had expressed surprise just before at the wealth of discussion his sisters had been ready to expend in his interest but he managed to convey now that there was still a point of a certain importance to be made it seems rather odd to me that you should all appear to accept the step im about to take as a necessity disagreeable at the best when i myself hold that ive been so exceedingly fortunate  mr probert lowered his book accommodatingly and rested his eyes on the fire you wont be content till were enthusiastic she seems an amiable girl certainly and in that youre fortunate  i dont think you can tell me what would be betterwhat youd have preferred the young man said  what i should have preferred in the first place you must remember that i wasnt madly impatient to see you married  i can imagine that and yet i cant imagine that as things have turned out you shouldnt be struck with my felicity to get something so charming and to get it of our own species gaston explained  of our own species tudieu said his father looking up  surely its infinitely fresher and more amusing for me to marry an american theres a sad want of freshnesstheres even a provincialityin the way weve gallicised  against americans ive nothing to say some of them are the best thing the world contains thats precisely why one can choose theyre far from doing all like that  like what dear father  comme ces gensla you know that if they were french being otherwise what they are one wouldnt look at them  indeed one would they would be such rare curiosities  well perhaps theyll do for queer fish said mr probert with a little conclusive sigh  yes let them pass at that theyll surprise you  not too much i hope cried the old man opening his volume again  the complexity of things among the proberts it neednt nevertheless startle us to learn was such as to make it impossible for gaston to proceed to the celebration of his nuptial with all the needful circumstances of material preparation and social support before some three months should have expired he chafed however but moderately under this condition for he remembered it would give francie time to endear herself to his whole circle it would also have advantages for the dossons it would enable them to establish by simple but effective arts some modus vivendi with that rigid body it would in short help every one to get used to everything mr dossons designs and delias took no articulate form what was mainly clear to gaston was that his future wifes relatives had as yet no sense of disconnexion he knew that mr dosson would do whatever delia liked and that delia would like to start her sisterthis whether or no she expected to be present at the rest of the race mr probert notified mr dosson of what he proposed to do for his son and mr dosson appeared more quietly amused than anything else at the news he announced in return no intentions in regard to francie and his strange silence was the cause of another convocation of the house of probert here mme de brecourts bold front won another victory she maintained as she let her brother know that it was too late for any policy but a policy of confidence lord help us is that what they call confidence the young man gasped guessing the way they all had looked at each other and he wondered how they would look next at poor mr dosson himself fortunately he could always fall back for reassurance on the perfection of their forms though indeed he thoroughly knew that these forms would never appear so striking as on the dayshould such a day fatally comeof their meddling too much  mr proberts property was altogether in the united states he resembled other discriminating persons for whom the only good taste in america was the taste of invested and paying capital the provisions he was engaging to make for his sons marriage rendered advisable some attention on the spot to interests with the management of which he was acquainted only by report it had long been his conviction that his affairs beyond the sea needed looking into they had gone on and on for years too far from the masters eye he had thought of making the journey in the cause of that vigilance but now he was too old and too tired and the effort had become impossible there was nothing therefore but for gaston to go and go quickly though the time so little fostered his absence from paris the duty was none the less laid upon him and the question practically faced then everything yielded to the consideration that he had best wait till after his marriage when he might be so auspiciously accompanied by his wife francie would be in many ways so propitious an introducer this abatement would have taken effect had not a call for an equal energy on mr dossons part suddenly appeared to reach and to move that gentleman he had business on the other side he announced to attend to though his starting for new york presented difficulties since he couldnt in such a situation leave his daughters alone not only would such a proceeding have given scandal to the proberts but gaston learned with much surprise and not a little amusement that delia in consequence of changes now finely wrought in her personal philosophy wouldnt have felt his doing so square with propriety the young man was able to put it to her that nothing would be simpler than in the interval for francie to go and stay with susan or margaret she herself in that case would be free to accompany her father but delia declared at this that nothing would induce her to budge from paris till she had seen her sister through and gaston shrank from proposing that she too should spend five weeks in the place beauvau or the rue de lille there was moreover a slight element of the mystifying for him in the perverse unsociable way in which francie took up a position of marked disfavour as yet to any visiting after if he liked but not till then and she wouldnt at the moment give the reasons of her refusal it was only very positive and even quite passionate  all this left her troubled suitor no alternative but to say to mr dosson im not my dear sir such a fool as i look if youll coach me properly and trust me why shouldnt i rush across and transact your business as well as my fathers strange as it appeared francie offered herself as accepting this separation from her lover which would last six or seven weeks rather than accept the hospitality of any member of his family mr dosson on his side was grateful for the solution he remarked well sir youve got a big brain at the end of a morning they spent with papers and pencils and on this gaston made his preparations to sail before he left paris francie to do her justice confided to him that her objection to going in such an intimate way even to mme de brecourts had been founded on a fear that in close quarters she might do something that would make them all despise her gaston replied in the first place ardently that this was the very delirium of delicacy and that he wanted to know in the second if she expected never to be at close quarters with tous les siens ah yes but then it will be safer she pleaded then we shall be married and by so much shant we be beyond harm in rejoinder to which he had simply kissed her the passage taking place three days before her lover took ship what further befell in the brief interval was that stopping for a last word at the hotel de lunivers et the cheltenham on his way to catch the night express to londonhe was to sail from liverpoolgaston found mr george flack sitting in the redsatin saloon the correspondent of the reverberator had come back     ix  mr flacks relations with his old friends didnt indeed after his return take on the familiarity and frequency of their intercourse a year before he was the first to refer to the marked change in the situation they had got into the high set and they didnt care about the past he alluded to the past as if it had been rich in mutual vows in pledges now repudiated  whats the matter all the same wont you come round there with us some day mr dosson asked not having perceived for himself any reason why the young journalist shouldnt be a welcome and easy presence in the cours la reine  delia wanted to know what mr flack was talking about didnt he know a lot of people that they didnt know and wasnt it natural they should have their own society the young mans treatment of the question was humorous and it was with delia that the discussion mainly went forward when he maintained that the dossons had shamelessly shed him mr dosson returned well i guess youll grow again and francie made the point that it was no use for him to pose as a martyr since he knew perfectly well that with all the celebrated people he saw and the way he flew round he had the most enchanting time she was aware of being a good deal less accessible than the previous spring for mesdames de brecourt and de clichethe former indeed more than the latteroccupied many of her hours in spite of her having held off to gaston from a premature intimacy with his sisters she spent whole days in their companythey had so much to tell her of how her new life would shape and it seemed mostly very pleasantand she thought nothing could be nicer than that in these intervals he should give himself to her father and even to delia as had been his wont  but the flaw of a certain insincerity in mr flacks nature was suggested by his present tendency to rare visits he evidently didnt care for her father in himself and though this mild parent always took what was set before him and never made fusses she is sure he felt their old companion to have fallen away there were no more wanderings in public places no more tryings of new cafes mr dosson used to look sometimes as he had looked of old when george flack located them somewhereas if he expected to see their heated benefactor rush back to them with his drab overcoat flying in the wind but this appearance usually and rather touchingly subsided he at any rate missed gaston because gaston had this winter so often ordered his dinner for him and his society was not to make it up sought by the count and the marquis whose mastery of english was small and their other distractions great mr probert it was true had shown something of a conversible spirit he had come twice to the hotel since his sons departure and had said smiling and reproachful you neglect us you neglect us my dear sir the good man had not understood what was meant by this till delia explained after the visitor had withdrawn and even then the remedy for the neglect administered two or three days later had not borne any copious fruit mr dosson called alone instructed by his daughter in the cours la reine but mr probert was not at home he only left a card on which delia had superscribed in advance almost with the legibility of print the words so sorry her father had told her he would give in the card if she wanted but would have nothing to do with the writing there was a discussion as to whether mr proberts remark was an allusion to a deficiency of politeness on the article of his sonsinlaw oughtnt mr dosson perhaps to call personally and not simply through the medium of the visits paid by his daughters to their wives on messieurs de brecourt and de cliche once when this subject came up in george flacks presence the old man said he would go round if mr flack would accompany him all right well go right along mr flack had responded and this inspiration had become a living fact qualified only by the mercy to delia dosson that the other two gentlemen were not at home suppose they should get in she had said lugubriously to her sister  well what if they do francie had asked  why the count and the marquis wont be interested in mr flack  well then perhaps hell be interested in them he can write something about them theyll like that  do you think they would delia had solemnly weighed it  why yes if he should say fine things  they do like fine things delia had conceded they get off so many themselves only the way mr flack does its a different style  well people like to be praised in any style  thats so delia had continued to brood  one afternoon coming in about three oclock mr flack found francie alone she had expressed a wish after luncheon for a couple of hours of independence intending to write to gaston and having accidentally missed a post she had determined her letter should be of double its usual length her companions had respected her claim for solitude mr dosson taking himself off to his daily session in the readingroom of the american bank and deliathe girls had now at their command a landau as massive as the coach of an ambassadordriving away to the dressmakers a frequent errand to superintend and urge forward the progress of her sisters weddingclothes francie was not skilled in composition she wrote slowly and had in thus addressing her lover much the same sense of sore tension she supposed she should have in standing at the altar with him her father and delia had a theory that when she shut herself up that way she poured forth pages that would testify to her costly culture when george flack was ushered in at all events she was still bent over her blottingbook at one of the gilded tables and there was an inkstain on her pointed forefinger it was no disloyalty to gaston but only at the most an echo as of the sweetness of recess time in old school mornings that made her glad to see her visitor  she hadnt quite known how to finish her letter in the infinite of the bright propriety of her having written it but mr flack seemed to set a practical human limit  i wouldnt have ventured he observed on entering to propose this but i guess i can do with it now its come  what can you do with she asked wiping her pen  well this happy chance just you and me together  i dont know what its a chance for  well for me to be a little less miserable for a quarter of an hour it makes me so to see you look so happy  it makes you miserablefrancie took it gaily but guardedly  you ought to understandwhen i say something so noble and settling himself on the sofa mr flack continued well how do you get on without mr probert  very well indeed thank you the tone in which the girl spoke was not an encouragement to free pleasantry so that if he continued his enquiries it was with as much circumspection as he had perhaps ever in his life recognised himself as having to apply to a given occasion he was eminently capable of the sense that it wasnt in his interest to strike her as indiscreet and profane he only wanted still to appear a real reliable gentleman friend at the same time he was not indifferent to the profit for him of her noticing in him a sense as of a good fellow once badly sold which would always give him a certain pull on what he called to himself her lovely character well youre in the real grand old monde now i suppose he resumed at last not with an air of undue derisionrather with a kind of contemporary but detached wistfulness  oh im not in anything im just where ive always been  im sorry i hoped youd tell me a good lot about it said mr flack not with levity  you think too much of that what do you want to know so much about it for  well he took some trouble for his reason dear miss francie a poor devil of a journalist who has to get his living by studyingup things has to think too much sometimes in order to think or at any rate to do enough we find out what we canas we can you see  she did seem to catch in it the note of pathos what do you want to studyup  everything i take in everything it all depends on my opportunity i try and learni try and improve every one has something to tellor to sell and i listen and watchwell for what i can drink in or can buy i hoped youd have something to tellfor im not talking now of anything but that i dont believe but what youve seen a good deal of new life you wont pretend they aint working you right in charming as you are  do you mean if theyve been kind and sweet to me theyve been very kind and sweet francie mid they want to do even more than ill let them  ah why wont you let them george flack asked almost coaxingly  well i do when it comes to anything the girl went on you cant resist them really theyve got such lovely ways  i should like to hear you talk right out about their ways her companion observed after a silence  oh i could talk out right enough if once i were to begin but i dont see why it should interest you  dont i care immensely for everything that concerns you didnt i tell you that oncehe put it very straight  well you were foolish ever and youd be foolish to say it again francie replied  oh i dont want to say anything ive had my lesson but i could listen to you all day francie gave an exclamation of impatience and incredulity and mr flack pursued dont you remember what you told me that time we had that talk at saintgermain on the terrace you said i might remain your friend  well thats all right said the girl  then aint we interested in the development of our friendsin their impressions their situations and adventures especially a person like me who has got to know life whether he wants to or nowho has got to know the world  do you mean to say i could teach you about life francie beautifully gaped  about some kinds certainly you know a lot of people its difficult to get at unless one takes some extraordinary measures as youve done  what do you mean what measures have i done  well they haveto get right hold of youand its the same thing pouncing on you to secure you firsti call that energetic and dont you think i ought to know smiled mr flack with much meaning i thought i was energetic but they got in ahead of me theyre a society apart and they must be very curious  yes theyre very curious francie admitted with a resigned sigh then she said do you want to put them in the paper  george flack cast aboutthe air of the question was so candid suggested so complete an exemption from prejudice oh im very careful about what i put in the paper i want everything as i told you dont you remember the sketch i gave you of my ideals but i want it in the right way and of the right brand if i cant get it in the shape i like it i dont want it at all firstrate firsthand information straight from the tap is what im after i dont want to hear what some one or other thinks that some one or other was told that some one or other believed or said and above all i dont want to print it theres plenty of that flowing in and the best part of the jobs to keep it out people just yearn to come in they make love to me for it all over the place theres the biggest crowd at the door but i say to them youve got to do something first then ill see or at any rate youve got to be something  we sometimes see the reverberator youve some fine pieces francie humanely replied  sometimes only dont they send it to the old gentlemanthe weekly edition i thought i had fixed that said george flack  i dont know its usually lying round but delia reads it more than i she reads pieces aloud i like to read books i read as many as i can  well its all literature said mr flack its all the press the great institution of our time some of the finest books have come out first in the papers its the history of the age  i see youve got the same aspirations francie remarked kindly  the same aspirations  those you told me about that day at saintgermain  oh i keep forgetting that i ever broke out to you that way everythings so changed  are you the proprietor of the paper now the girl went on determined not to catch this sentimental echo  what do you care it wouldnt even be delicate in me to tell you for i do remember the way you said youd try and get your father to help me dont say youve forgotten it because you almost made me cry anyway that isnt the sort of help i want now and it wasnt the sort of help i meant to ask you for then i want sympathy and interest i want some one to say to me once in a while keep up your old heart mr flack youll come out all right you see im a workingman and i dont pretend to be anything else francies companion went on i dont live on the accumulations of my ancestors what i have i earnwhat i am ive fought for im a real old travailleur as they say here i rejoice in it but theres one dark spot in it all the same  and whats that francie decided not quite at once to ask  that it makes you ashamed of me  oh how can you say and she got up as if a sense of oppression of vague discomfort had come over her her visitor troubled such peace as she had lately arrived at  you wouldnt be ashamed to go round with me  round where  well anywhere just to have one more walk the very last george flack had got up too and stood there looking at her with his bright eyes his hands in the pockets of his overcoat as she hesitated he continued then im not such a friend after all  she rested her eyes a moment on the carpet then raising them where would you like to go  you could render me a servicea real servicewithout any inconvenience probably to yourself isnt your portrait finished  yes but he wont give it up  who wont give it up  why mr waterlow he wants to keep it near him to look at it in case he should take a fancy to change it but i hope he wont change itits so lovely as it is francie made a mild joke of saying  i hear its magnificent and i want to see it said george flack  then why dont you go  ill go if youll take me thats the service you can render me  why i thought you went everywhereinto the palaces of kings francie cried  i go where im welcome not where i aint i dont want to push into that studio alone he doesnt want me round oh you neednt protest the young man went on if a fellows made sensitive he has got to stay so i feel those things in the shade of a tone of voice he doesnt like newspapermen some people dont you know i ought to tell you that frankly  francie considered again but looking this time at her visitor why if it hadnt been for you im afraid she said hadnt have beenid never have sat to him  mr flack smiled at her in silence for a little if it hadnt been for me i think youd never have met your future husband  perhaps not said francie and suddenly she blushed red rather to her companions surprise  i only say that to remind you that after all ive a right to ask you to show me this one little favour let me drive with you tomorrow or next day or any day to the avenue de villiers and i shall regard myself as amply repaid with you i shant be afraid to go in for youve a right to take any one you like to see your picture thats the rule here  oh the day youre afraid mr flack francie laughed without fear she had been much struck by his reminder of what they all owed him for he truly had been their initiator the instrument under providence that had opened a great new interest to them and as she was more listless about almost anything than at the sight of a person wronged she winced at his describing himself as disavowed or made light of after the prize was gained her mind had not lingered on her personal indebtedness to him for it was not in the nature of her mind to linger but at present she was glad to spring quickly at the first word into the attitude of acknowledgement it had the effect of simplification after too multiplied an appealit brought up her spirits  of course i must be quite square with you the young man said in a tone that struck her as higher somehow than any she had ever heard him use if i want to see the picture its because i want to write about it the whole thing will go bang into the reverberator you must understand that in advance i wouldnt write about it without seeing it we dont do thatand mr flack appeared to speak proudly again for his organ  jespere bien said francie who was getting on famously with her french of course if you praise him mr waterlow will like it  i dont know that he cares for my praise and i dont care much whether he likes it or not for you to like its the principal thingwe must do with that  oh i shall be awfully proud  i shall speak of you personallyi shall say youre the prettiest girl that has ever come over  you may say what you like francie returned it will be immense fun to be in the newspapers come for me at this hour day after tomorrow  youre too kind said george flack taking up his hat he smoothed it down a moment with his glove then he said i wonder if youll mind our going alone  alone  i mean just you and me  oh dont you be afraid father and delia have seen it about thirty times  thatll be firstrate and it will help me to feel more than anything else could make me do that were still old friends i couldnt bear the end of that ill come at 315 mr flack went on but without even yet taking his departure he asked two or three questions about the hotel whether it were as good as last year and there were many people in it and they could keep their rooms warm then pursued suddenly on a different plane and scarcely waiting for the girls answer and now for instance are they very bigoted thats one of the things i should like to know  very bigoted  aint they tremendous catholicsalways talking about the holy father what they call here the throne and the altar and dont they want the throne too i mean mr probert the old gentleman mr flack added and those grand ladies and all the rest of them  theyre very religious said francie theyre the most religious people i ever saw they just adore the holy father they know him personally quite well theyre always going down to rome  and do they mean to introduce you to him  how do you mean to introduce me  why to make you a catholic to take you also down to rome  oh were going to rome for our voyage de noces said francie gaily just for a peep  and wont you have to have a catholic marriage if they wont consent to a protestant one  were going to have a lovely one just like one that mme de brecourt took me to see at the madeleine  and will it be at the madeleine too  yes unless we have it at notre dame  and how will your father and sister like that  our having it at notre dame  yes or at the madeleine your not having it at the american church  oh delia wants it at the best place said francie simply then she added and you know poppa aint much on religion  well now thats what i call a genuine fact the sort i was talking about mr flack replied whereupon he at last took himself off repeating that he would come in two days later at 315 sharp  francie gave an account of his visit to her sister on the return of the latter young lady and mentioned the agreement they had come to in relation to the drive delia brooded on it a while like a sitting hen so little did she know that it was right as it was right delia usually said that francie should be so intimate with other gentlemen after she was engaged  intimate you wouldnt think its very intimate if you were to see me francie cried with amusement  im sure i dont want to see you delia declaredthe sharpness of which made her sister suddenly strenuous  delia dosson do you realise that if it hadnt been for mr flack we would never have had that picture and that if it hadnt been for that picture i should never have got engaged  it would have been better if you hadnt if thats the way youre going to behave nothing would induce me to go with you  this was what suited francie but she was nevertheless struck by delias rigour im only going to take him to see mr waterlow  has he become all of a sudden too shy to go alone  well you know mr waterlow has a prejudice against him and has made him feel it you know gaston told us so  he told us he couldnt bear him thats what he told us said delia  all the more reason i should be kind to him why delia do realise francie went on  thats just what i do returned the elder girl but things that are very different from those you want me to you have queer reasons  ive others too that you may like better he wants to put a piece in the paper about it  about your picture  yes and about me all about the whole thing  delia stared a moment well i hope it will be a good one she said with a groan of oppression as from the crushing majesty of their fate     x  when francie two days later passed with mr flack into charles waterlows studio she found mme de cliche before the great canvas she enjoyed every positive sign that the proberts took an interest in her and this was a considerable symptom gastons second sisters coming all that wayshe lived over by the invalidesto look at the portrait once more francie knew she had seen it at an earlier stage the work had excited curiosity and discussion among the proberts from the first of their making her acquaintance when they went into considerations about it which had not occurred to the original and her companionsfrequently as to our knowledge these good people had conversed on the subject gaston had told her that opinions differed much in the family as to the merit of the work and that margaret precisely had gone so far as to say that it might be a masterpiece of tone but didnt make her look like a lady his father on the other hand had no objection to offer to the character in which it represented her but he didnt think it well painted regardezmoi ca et ca et ca je vous demande he had exclaimed making little dashes at the canvas with his glove toward mystifying spots on occasions when the artist was not at hand the proberts always fell into french when they spoke on a question of art poor dear papa he only understands le vieux jeu gaston had explained and he had still further to expound what he meant by the old game the brandnewness of charles waterlows game had already been a bewilderment to mr probert  francie remembered nowshe had forgotten itmargaret de cliches having told her she meant to come again she hoped the marquise thought by this time that on canvas at least she looked a little more like a lady mme de cliche smiled at her at any rate and kissed her as if in fact there could be no mistake she smiled also at mr flack on francies introducing him and only looked grave when after she had asked where the others werethe papa and the grande soeurthe girl replied that she hadnt the least idea her party consisted only of herself and mr flack then mme de cliches grace stiffened taking on a shade that brought back francies sense that she was the individual among all gastons belongings who had pleased her least from the first mme de douves was superficially more formidable but with her the second impression was comparatively comforting it was just this second impression of the marquise that was not there were perhaps others behind it but the girl hadnt yet arrived at them mr waterlow mightnt have been very much prepossessed with mr flack but he was none the less perfectly civil to him and took much trouble to show him the work he had in hand dragging out canvases changing lights moving him off to see things at the other end of the great room while the two gentlemen were at a distance mme de cliche expressed to francie the conviction that she would allow her to see her home on which francie replied that she was not going home but was going somewhere else with mr flack and she explained as if it simplified the matter that this gentleman was a big editor her sisterinlaw that was to be echoed the term and francie developed her explanation he was not the only big editor but one of the many big editors of an enormous american paper he was going to publish an articleas big as enormous as all the rest of the businessabout her portrait gaston knew him perfectly it was mr flack who had been the cause of gastons being presented to her mme de cliche looked across at him as if the inadequacy of the cause projected an unfavourable light upon an effect hitherto perhaps not exactly measured she appealed as to whether francie thought gaston would like her to drive about paris alone with one of ces messieurs im sure i dont know i never asked him said francie he ought to want me to be polite to a person who did so much for us soon after this mme de cliche retired with no fresh sign of any sense of the existence of mr flack though he stood in her path as she approached the door she didnt kiss our young lady again and the girl observed that her leavetaking consisted of the simple words adieu mademoiselle she had already noted that in proportion as the proberts became majestic they became articulately french she and mr flack remained in the studio but a short time longer and when they were seated in the carriage again at the doorthey had come in mr dossons open landauher companion said and now where shall we go he spoke as if on their way from the hotel he hadnt touched upon the pleasant vision of a little turn in the bois he had insisted then that the day was made on purpose the air full of spring at present he seemed to wish to give himself the pleasure of making his companion choose that particular alternative but she only answered rather impatiently  wherever you like wherever you like and she sat there swaying her parasol looking about her giving no order  au bois said george flack to the coachman leaning back on the soft cushions for a few moments after the carriage had taken its easy elastic start they were silent but he soon began again was that lady one of your new relatives  do you mean one of mr proberts old ones shes his sister  is there any particular reason in that why she shouldnt say goodmorning to me  she didnt want you to remain with me she doesnt like you to go round with me she wanted to carry me off  what has she got against me mr flack asked with a kind of portentous calm  francie seemed to consider a little oh its these funny french ideas  funny some of them are very base said george flack  his companion made no answer she only turned her eyes to right and left admiring the splendid day and shining city the great architectural vista was fair the tall houses with their polished shopfronts their balconies their signs with accented letters seemed to make a glitter of gilt and crystal as they rose in the sunny air the colour of everything was cool and pretty and the sound of everything gay the sense of a costly spectacle was everywhere well i like paris anyway francie exhaled at last with her little harmonising flatness  its lucky for you since youve got to live here  i havent got to theres no obligation we havent settled anything about that  hasnt that lady settled it for you  yes very likely she has said francie placidly enough i dont like her so well as the others  you like the others very much  of course i do so would you if they had made so much of you  that one at the studio didnt make much of me certainly mr flack declared  yes shes the most haughty francie allowed  well what is it all about her friend demanded who are they anyway  oh it would take me three hours to tell you the girl cheerfully sighed they go back a thousand years  well weve got a thousand yearsi mean three hours and george flack settled himself more on his cushions and inhaled the pleasant air i am getting something out of this drive miss francie he went on its many a day since ive been to the old bois i dont fool round much in woods  francie replied candidly that for her too the occasion was most agreeable and mr flack pursued looking round him with his hard smile irrelevantly but sociably yes these french ideas i dont see how you can stand them those they have about young ladies are horrid  well they tell me you like them better after youre married  why after theyre married theyre worsei mean the ideas every one knows that  well they can make you like anything the way they talk francie said  and do they talk a great deal  well i should think so they dont do much else and all about the queerest thingsthings i never heard of  ah that ill bet my life on mr flack returned with understanding  of course his companion obligingly proceeded ve had most conversation with mr probert  the old gentleman  no very little with him i mean with gaston but its not he that has told me mostits mme de brecourt shes great on life on their lifeits very interesting she has told me all their histories all their troubles and complications  complications mr flack threw off thats what she calls them it seems very different from america its just like a beautiful storythey have such strange feelings but there are things you can seewithout being told  what sort of things  well like mme de cliches but francie paused as if for a word  her friend was prompt with assistance do you mean her complications  yes and her husbands she has terrible ones thats why one must forgive her if shes rather peculiar shes very unhappy  do you mean through her husband  yes he likes other ladies better he flirts with mme de brives  mr flacks hand closed over it mme de brives  yes shes lovely said francie she aint very young but shes fearfully attractive and he used to go every day to have tea with mme de villepreux mme de cliche cant bear mme de villepreux  well he seems a kind of mean man george flack moralised  oh his mother was very bad that was one thing they had against the marriage  who hadagainst what marriage  when maggie probert became engaged  is that what they call hermaggie  her brother does but every one else calls her margot old mme de cliche had a horrid reputation every one hated her  except those i suppose who liked her too much mr flack permitted himself to guess and whos mme de villepreux he proceeded  shes the daughter of mme de marignac  and whos that old sinner the young man asked  oh i guess shes dead said francie she used to be a great friend of mr probertof gastons father  he used to go to tea with her  almost every day susan says he has never been the same since her death  the way they do come out with em mr flack chuckled and who the mischiefs susan  why mme de brecourt mr probert just loved mme de marignac mme de villepreux isnt so nice as her mother she was brought up with the proberts like a sister and now she carries on with maxime  with maxime  thats m de cliche  oh i seei see and george flack engulfed it they had reached the top of the champs elysees and were passing below the wondrous arch to which that gentle eminence forms a pedestal and which looks down even on splendid paris from its immensity and across at the vain mask of the tuileries and the rivermoated louvre and the twin towers of notre dame painted blue by the distance the confluence of carriagesa sounding stream in which our friends became engagedrolled into the large avenue leading to the bois de boulogne mr flack evidently enjoyed the scene he gazed about him at their neighbours at the villas and gardens on either hand he took in the prospect of the farstretching brown boskages and smooth alleys of the wood of the hour they had yet to spend there of the rest of francies pleasant prattle of the place near the lake where they could alight and walk a little even of the bench where they might sit down i see i see he repeated with appreciation you make me feel quite as if i were in the grand old monde     xi  one day at noon shortly before the time for which gaston had announced his return a note was brought francie from mme de brecourt it caused her some agitation though it contained a clause intended to guard her against vain fears please come to me the moment youve received thisive sent the carriage ill explain when you get here what i want to see you about nothing has happened to gaston we are all here the coupe from the place beauvau was waiting at the door of the hotel and the girl had but a hurried conference with her father and sisterif conference it could be called in which vagueness on the one side melted into blankness on the other its for something badsomething bad francie none the less said while she tied her bonnet though she was unable to think what it could be delia who looked a good deal scared offered to accompany her on which mr dosson made the first remark of a practical character in which he had indulged in relation to his daughters alliance  no you wontno you wont my dear they may whistle for francie but let them see that they cant whistle for all of us it was the first sign he had given of being jealous of the dignity of the dossons that question had never troubled him  i know what it is said delia while she arranged her sisters garments they want to talk about religion theyve got the priests theres some bishop or perhaps some cardinal they want to baptise you  then youd better take a waterproof francies father called after her as she flitted away  she wondered rolling toward the place beauvau what they were all there for that announcement balanced against the reassurance conveyed in the phrase about gaston she liked them individually but in their collective form they made her uneasy in their family parties there was always something of the tribunal mme de brecourt came out to meet her in the vestibule drawing her quickly into a small roomnot the salon francie knew it as her hostesss own room a lovely boudoirin which considerably to the girls relief the rest of the family were not assembled yet she guessed in a moment that they were near at handthey were waiting susan looked flushed and strange she had a queer smile she kissed her as if she didnt know she was doing it she laughed as she greeted her but her laugh was extravagant it was a different demonstration every way from any francie had hitherto had to reckon with by the time our young lady had noted these things she was sitting beside her on a sofa and mme de brecourt had her hand which she held so tight that it almost hurt her susans eyes were in their nature salient but on this occasion they seemed to have started out of her head  were upside downterribly agitated a thunderbolt has fallen on the house  whats the matterwhats the matter francie asked pale and with parted lips she had a sudden wild idea that gaston might have found out in america that her father had no money had lost it all that it had been stolen during their long absence but would he cast her off for that  you must understand the closeness of our union with you from our sending for you this waythe first the only personin a crisis our joys are your joys and our indignations are yours  what is the matter please the girl repeated their indignations opened up a gulf it flashed upon her with a shock of mortification for the belated idea that something would have come out a piece in the paper from mr flack about her portrait and even a little about herself but that was only more mystifying for certainly mr flack could only have published something pleasantsomething to be proud of had he by some incredible perversity or treachery stated that the picture was bad or even that she was she grew dizzy remembering how she had refused him and how little he had liked it that day at saintgermain but they had made that up over and over especially when they sat so long on a bench together the time they drove in the bois de boulogne  oh the most awful thing a newspaper sent this morning from america to my fathercontaining two horrible columns of vulgar lies and scandal about our family about all of us about you about your picture about poor marguerite calling her margot about maxime and leonie de villepreux saying hes her lover about all our affairs about gaston about your marriage about your sister and your dresses and your dimples about our darling father whose history it professes to relate in the most ignoble the most revolting terms papas in the most awful state and mme de brecourt panted to take breath she had spoken with the volubility of horror and passion youre outraged with us and you must suffer with us she went on but who has done it who has done it who has done it  why mr flackmr flack francie quickly replied she was appalled overwhelmed but her foremost feeling was the wish not to appear to disavow her knowledge  mr flack do you mean that awful person he ought to be shot he ought to be burnt alive maxime will kill him maximes in an unspeakable rage everythings at end weve been served up to the rabble we shall have to leave paris how could he know such thingsand they all so infamously false the poor woman poured forth her woe in questions contradictions lamentations she didnt know what to ask first against what to protest do you mean that wretch marguerite saw you with at mr waterlows oh francie what has happened she had a feeling then a dreadful foreboding she saw you afterwardswalking with himin the bois  well i didnt see her the girl said  you were talking with himyou were too absorbed thats what margot remembers oh francie francie wailed mme de brecourt whose distress was pitiful  she tried to interfere at the studio but i wouldnt let her hes an old frienda friend of poppasand i like him very much what my father allows thats not for others to criticise francie continued she was frightened extremely frightened at her companions air of tragedy and at the dreadful consequences she alluded to consequences of an act she herself didnt know couldnt comprehend nor measure yet but there was an instinct of bravery in her which threw her into blind defence defence even of george flack though it was a part of her consternation that on her too he should have practised a surpriseit would appear to be some selfseeking deception  oh how can you bear with such brutes how can your father what devil has he paid to tattle to him  you scare me awfullyyou terrify me the girl could but plead i dont know what youre talking about i havent seen it i dont understand it of course ive talked to mr flack  oh francie dont say itdont say it dear child you havent talked to him in that fashion vulgar horrors and such a language mme de brecourt came nearer took both her hands now drew her closer seemed to supplicate her for some disproof some antidote to the nightmare you shall see the paper theyve got it in the other roomthe most disgusting sheet margots reading it to her husband he cant read english if you can call it english such a style of the gutter papa tried to translate it to maxime but he couldnt he was too sick theres a quantity about mme de marignacimagine only and a quantity about jeanne and raoul and their economies in the country when they see it in brittanyheaven preserve us  francie had turned very white she looked for a minute at the carpet and what does it say about me  some trash about your being the great american beauty with the most odious details and your having made a match among the rare old exclusives and the strangest stuff about your fatherhis having gone into a store at the age of twelve and something about your poor sisterheaven help us and a sketch of our career in paris as they call it and the way weve pushed and got on and our ridiculous pretensions and a passage about blanche de douves raouls sister who had that diseasewhat do they call itthat she used to steal things in shops do you see them reading that and how did he know such a thing its ages ago its dead and buried  you told me you told me yourself said francie quickly she turned red the instant she had spoken  dont say its youdont dont my darling cried mme de brecourt who had stared and glared at her thats what i want thats what you must do thats what i see you this way for first alone ive answered for you you know you must repudiate the remotest connexion you must deny it up to the hilt margot suspects youshe has got that ideashe has given it to the others ive told them they ought to be ashamed that its an outrage to all we know you and love you for ive done everything for the last hour to protect you im your godmother you know and you mustnt disappoint me youre incapable and you must say so face to face to my father think of gaston cherie hell have seen it over there alone far from us all think of his horror and of his anguish and of his faith of what he would expect of you mme de brecourt hurried on and her companions bewilderment deepened to see how the tears had risen to her eyes and were pouring down her cheeks you must say to my father face to face that youre incapablethat youre stainless  stainless francie bleated it like a bewildered interrogative lamb but the sheepdog had to be faced of course i knew he wanted to write a piece about the pictureand about my marriage  about your marriageof course you knew then wretched girl youre at the bottom of all cried mme de brecourt flinging herself away falling back on the sofa prostrate there and covering her face with her hands  he told mehe told me when i went with him to the studio francie asseverated loud but he seems to have printed more  more i should think so and mme de brecourt rebounded standing before her and you let himabout yourself you gave him preposterous facts  i told himi told himi dont know what it was for his paperhe wants everything its a very fine paper said the girl  a very fine paper mme de brecourt flushed with parted lips have you seen have you touched the hideous sheet ah my brother my brother she quavered again turning away  if your brother were here you wouldnt talk to me this wayhed protect me gaston would cried francie on her feet seizing her little muff and moving to the door  go away go away or theyll kill you her friend went on excitedly after all ive done for youafter the way ive lied for you and she sobbed trying to repress her sobs  francie at this broke out into a torrent of tears ill go home poppa poppa she almost shrieked reaching the door  oh your fatherhe has been a nice father bringing you up in such ideas these words followed her with infinite scorn but almost as mme de brecourt uttered them struck by a sound she sprang after the girl seized her drew her back and held her a moment listening before she could pass out hushhushtheyre coming in here theyre too anxious denydeny itsay you know nothing your sister must have said thingsand such things say it all comes from her  oh you dreadfulis that what you do cried francie shaking herself free the door opened as she spoke and mme de brecourt walked quickly to the window turning her back mme de cliche was there and mr probert and m de brecourt and m de cliche they entered in silence and m de brecourt coming last closed the door softly behind him francie had never been in a court of justice but if she had had that experience these four persons would have reminded her of the jury filing back into their box with their verdict they all looked at her hard as she stood in the middle of the room mme de brecourt gazed out of the window wiping her tears mme de cliche grasped a newspaper crumpled and partly folded francie got a quick impression moving her eyes from one face to another that old mr probert was the worst his mild ravaged expression was terrible he was the one who looked at her least he went to the fireplace and leaned on the mantel with his head in his hands he seemed ten years older  ah mademoiselle mademoiselle mademoiselle said maxime de cliche slowly impressively in a tone of the most respectful but most poignant reproach  have you seen ithave they sent it to you his wife asked thrusting the paper toward her its quite at your service but as francie neither spoke nor took it she tossed it upon the sofa where as it opened falling the girl read the name of the reverberator mme de cliche carried her head very far aloft  she has nothing to do with itits just as i told youshes overwhelmed said mme de brecourt remaining at the window  youd do well to read itits worth the trouble alphonse de brecourt remarked going over to his wife francie saw him kiss her as he noted her tears she was angry at her own she choked and swallowed them they seemed somehow to put her in the wrong  have you had no idea that any such monstrosity would be perpetrated mme de cliche went on coming nearer to her she had a manner of forced calmnessas if she wished it to be understood that she was one of those who could be reasonable under any provocation though she were trembling withinwhich made francie draw back cest pourtant rempli de choseswhich we know you to have been told ofby what folly great heaven its right and leftno ones sparedits a deluge of the lowest insult my sister perhaps will have told you of the apprehensions i hadi couldnt resist them though i thought of nothing so awful as this god knowsthe day i met you at mr waterlows with your journalist  ive told her everythingdont you see shes aneantie let her go let her go cried mme de brecourt all distrustfully and still at the window  ah your journalist your journalist mademoiselle said maxime de cliche im very sorry to have to say anything in regard to any friend of yours that can give you so little pleasure but i promise myself the satisfaction of administering him with these hands a dressing he wont forget if i may trouble you so far as to ask you to let him know it  m de cliche fingered the points of his moustache he diffused some powerful scent his eyes were dreadful to francie she wished mr probert would say something kind to her but she had now determined to be strong they were ever so many against one gaston was far away and she felt heroic if you mean mr flacki dont know what you mean she said as composedly as possible to m de cliche mr flack has gone to london  at this m de brecourt gave a free laugh and his brotherinlaw replied ah its easy to go to london  they like such things there they do them more and more its as bad as america mme de cliche declared  why have you sent for mewhat do you all want me to do you might explainim only an american girl said francie whose being only an american girl didnt prevent her pretty head from holding itself now as high as mme de cliches  mme de brecourt came back to her quickly laying her hand on her arm youre very nervousyoud much better go home ill explain everything to themill make them understand the carriage is hereit had orders to wait  im not in the least nervous but ive made you all so francie brought out with the highest spirit  i defend you my dear young ladyi insist that youre only a wretched victim like ourselves m de brecourt remarked approaching her with a smile i see the hand of a woman in it you know he went on to the others for there are strokes of a vulgarity that a man doesnt sink tohe cant his very organisation prevents himeven if he be the dernier des goujats but please dont doubt that ive maintained that woman not to be you  the way you talk i dont know how to write francie impatiently quavered  my poor child when one knows you as i do murmured mme de brecourt with an arm round her  theres a lady who helps himmr flack has told me so the girl continued shes a literary ladyhere in parisshe writes what he tells her i think her names miss topping but she calls herself florineor dorine francie added  miss dosson youre too rare marguerite de cliche exclaimed giving a long moan of pain which ended in an incongruous laugh then youve been three to it she went on that accounts for its perfection  francie disengaged herself again from mme de brecourt and went to mr probert who stood looking down at the fire with his back to her mr probert im very sorry for what ive done to distress you i had no idea youd all feel so badly i didnt mean any harm i thought youd like it  the old man turned a little bending his eyes on her but without taking her hand as she had hoped usually when they met he kissed her he didnt look angry now he only looked very ill a strange inarticulate sound a chorus of amazement and mirth came from the others when she said she thought theyd like it and indeed poor francie was far from being able to measure the droll effect of that speech like itlike it said mr probert staring at her as if a little afraid of her  what do you mean she admitsshe admits mme de cliche exulted to her sister did you arrange it all that day in the boisto punish me for having tried to separate you she pursued to the poor child who stood gazing up piteously at the old man  i dont know what he has publishedi havent seen iti dont understand i thought it was only to be a piece about me she said to him  about me m de cliche repeated in english elle est divine he turned away raising his shoulders and hands and then letting them fall  mme de brecourt had picked up the newspaper she rolled it together saying to francie that she must take it home take it home immediatelythen shed see she only seemed to wish to get her out of the room but mr probert had fixed their flushed little guest with his sick stare you gave information for that you desired it  why i didnt desire itbut mr flack did  why do you know such ruffians where was your father the old man groaned  i thought hed just be nice about my picture and give pleasure to mr waterlow francie went on i thought hed just speak about my being engaged and give a little account so many people in america would be interested  so many people in americathats just the dreadful thought my dear said mme de brecourt kindly foyons put it in your muff and tell us what you think of it and she continued to thrust forward the scandalous journal  but francie took no notice of it she looked round from mr probert at the others i told gaston id certainly do something you wouldnt like  well hell believe it now cried mme de cliche  my poor child do you think hell like it any better asked mme de brecourt  francie turned upon her beautiful dilated eyes in which a world of new wonders and fears had suddenly got itself reflected hell see it over therehe has seen it now  oh my dear youll have news of him dont be afraid broke in high derision from mme de cliche  did he send you the paper her young friend went on to mr probert  it was not directed in his hand m de brecourt pronounced there was some stamp on the bandit came from the office  mr flackis that his hideous namemust have seen to that mme de brecourt suggested  or perhaps florine m de cliche interposed i should like to get hold of florine  i didi did tell him so francie repeated with all her fevered candour alluding to her statement of a moment before and speaking as if she thought the circumstance detracted from the offence  so did iso did we all said mme de cliche  and will he sufferas you suffer francie continued appealing to mr probert  suffer suffer hell die cried the old man however i wont answer for him hell tell you himself when he returns  hell die echoed francie with the eyes of a child at the pantomime who has found the climax turning to demons or monsters or too much gunpowder  hell never returnhow can he show himself said mme de cliche  thats not truehell come back to stand by me the girl flashed out  how couldnt you feel us to be the lastthe very last asked mr probert with great gentleness how couldnt you feel my poor son to be the last  cest un sens qui lui manque shrilled implacably mme de cliche  let her go papado let her go home mme de brecourt pleaded surely thats the only place for her today the elder sister continued  yes my childyou oughtnt to be here its your fatherhe ought to understand said mr probert  for gods sake dont send for himlet it all stop and mme de cliche made wild gestures  francie looked at her as she had never looked at any one in her life and then said goodbye mr probertgoodbye susan  give her your armtake her to the carriage she heard mme de brecourt growl to her husband she got to the door she hardly knew howshe was only conscious that susan held her once more long enough to kiss her poor susan wanted to comfort her that showed how badfeeling as she didshe believed the whole business would yet be it would be bad because gaston gaston francie didnt complete that thought yet only gaston was in her mind as she hurried to the carriage m de brecourt hurried beside her she wouldnt take his arm but he opened the door for her and as she got in she heard him murmur in the strangest and most unexpected manner youre charming mademoisellecharming charming     xii  her absence had not been long and when she reentered the familiar salon at the hotel she found her father and sister sitting there together as if they had timed her by their watches a prey both of them to curiosity and suspense mr dosson however gave no sign of impatience he only looked at her in silence through the smoke of his cigarhe profaned the red satin splendour with perpetual fumesas she burst into the room an irruption she made of her desired reappearance she rushed to one of the tables flinging down her muff and gloves while delia who had sprung up as she came in caught her closely and glared into her face with a francie dosson what have you been through francie said nothing at first only shutting her eyes and letting her sister do what she would with her she has been crying poppashe has delia almost shouted pulling her down upon a sofa and fairly shaking her as she continued will you please tell ive been perfectly wild yes you have you dreadful the elder girl insisted kissing her on the eyes they opened at this compassionate pressure and francie rested their troubled light on her father who had now risen to his feet and stood with his back to the fire  why chicken said mr dosson you look as if you had had quite a worry  i told you i shouldi told you i told you francie broke out with a trembling voice and now its come  you dont mean to say youve done anything cried delia very white  its all over its all over with which francies face braved denial  are you crazy francie delia demanded im sure you look as if you were  aint you going to be married childie asked mr dosson all considerately but coming nearer to her  francie sprang up releasing herself from her sister and threw her arms round him will you take me away poppa will you take me right straight away  of course i will my precious ill take you anywhere i dont want anythingit wasnt my idea and mr dosson and delia looked at each other while the girl pressed her face upon his shoulder  i never heard such trashyou cant behave that way has he got engaged to some one elsein america delia threw out  why if its over its over i guess its all right said mr dosson kissing his younger daughter ill go back or ill go on ill go anywhere you like  you wont have your daughters insulted i presume delia cried if you dont tell me this moment what has happened she pursued to her sister ill drive straight round there and make them  have they insulted you sweetie asked the old man bending over his child who simply leaned on him with her hidden face and no sound of tears francie raised her head turning round to their companion did i ever tell you anything elsedid i ever believe in it for an hour  oh well if youve done it on purpose to triumph over me we might as well go home certainly but i guess delia added you had better just wait till gaston comes  it will be worse when he comesif he thinks the same as they do  have they insulted youhave they mr dosson repeated while the smoke of his cigar curling round the question gave him the air of putting it with placidity  they think ive insulted themtheyre in an awful statetheyre almost dead mr flack has put it into the papereverything i dont know whatand they think its too wicked they were all there togetherall at me at once weeping and wailing and gnashing their teeth i never saw people so affected  delias face grew big with her stare so affected  ah yes i guess theres a good deal of that said mr dosson  its too realtoo terrible you dont understand its all printed therethat theyre immoral and everything about them everything thats private and dreadful francie explained  immoral is that so mr dosson threw off  and about me too and about gaston and my marriage and all sorts of personalities and all the names and mme de villepreux and everything its all printed there and theyve read it it says one of them steals  will you be so good as to tell me what youre talking about delia enquired sternly where is it printed and what have we got to do with it  some one sent it and i told mr flack  do you mean his paper oh the horrid ape delia cried with passion  do they mind so what they see in the papers asked mr dosson i guess they havent seen what ive seen why there used to be things about me  well it is about us tooabout every one they think its the same as if i wrote it francie ruefully mentioned  well you know what you could do and mr dosson beamed at her for common cheer  do you mean that piece about your picturethat you told me about when you went with him again to see it delia demanded  oh i dont know what piece it is i havent seen it  havent seen it didnt they show it to you  yes but i couldnt read it mme de brecourt wanted me to take itbut i left it behind  well thats like youlike the tauchnitzes littering up our track ill be bound id see it delia declared hasnt it come doesnt it always come  i guess we havent had the lastunless its somewhere round said mr dosson  poppa go out and get ityou can buy it on the boulevard delia continued francie what did you want to tell him  i didnt know i was just conversing he seemed to take so much interest francie pleaded  oh hes a deep one groaned delia  well if folks are immoral you cant keep it out of the papersand i dont know as you ought to want to mr dosson remarked if they are im glad to know it lovey and he gave his younger daughter a glance apparently intended to show that in this case he should know what to do  but francie was looking at her sister as if her attention had been arrested how do you meana deep one  why he wanted to break it off the fiend  francie stared then a deeper flush leapt to her face already mottled as with the fine footprints of the proberts dancing for pain to break off my engagement  yes just that but ill be hanged if he shall poppa will you allow that  allow what  why mr flacks vile interference you wont let him do as he likes with us i suppose will you  its all doneits all done said francie the tears had suddenly started into her eyes again  well hes so smart that it is likely hes too smart her father allowed but what did they want you to do about itthats what i want to know  they wanted me to say i knew nothing about itbut i couldnt  but you didnt and you dontif you havent even read it delia almost yelled  where is the dd thing their companion asked looking helplessly about him  on the boulevard at the very first of those kiosks you come to that old woman has itthe one who speaks englishshe always has it do go and get itdo and delia pushed him looked for his hat for him  i knew he wanted to print something and i cant say i didnt francie said i thought hed crack up my portrait and that mr waterlow would like that and gaston and every one and he talked to me about the paperhes always doing that and always wasand i didnt see the harm but even just knowing himthey think thats vile  well i should hope we can know whom we likeand delia bounced fairly round as from the force of her high spirit  mr dosson had put on his hathe was going out for the paper why he kept us alive last year he uttered in tribute  well he seems to have killed us now delia cried  well dont give up an old friend her father urged with his hand on the door and dont back down on anything youve done  lord what a fuss about an old newspaper delia went on in her exasperation it must be about two weeks old anyway didnt they ever see a societypaper before  they cant have seen much said mr dosson he paused still with his hand on the door dont you worrygaston will make it all right  gastonit will kill gaston  is that what they say delia demanded  gaston will never look at me again  well then hell have to look at me said mr dosson  do you mean that hell give you uphell be so crawling delia went on  they say hes just the one wholl feel it most but im the one who does that said francie with a strange smile  theyre stuffing you with liesbecause they dont like it hell be tender and true delia glared  when they hate menever and francie shook her head slowly still with her smile of softness thats what he cared for mostto make them like me  and isnt he a gentleman i should like to know asked delia  yes and thats why i wont marry himif ive injured him  shucks he has seen the papers over there you wait till he comes mr dosson enjoined passing out of the room  the girls remained there together and after a moment delia resumed well he has got to fix itthats one thing i can tell you  who has got to fix it  why that villainous man he has got to publish another piece saying its all false or all a mistake  yes youd better make him said francie with a weak laugh youd better go after himdown to nice  you dont mean to say hes gone down to nice  didnt he say he was going there as soon as he came back from londongoing right through without stopping  i dont know but he did said delia then she added the mean coward  why do you say that he cant hide at nicethey can find him there  are they going after him  they want to shoot himto stab him i dont know whatthose men  well i wish they would said delia  theyd better shoot me i shall defend him i shall protect him francie went on  how can you protect him you shall never speak to him again her sister engaged  francie had a pause i can protect him without speaking to him i can tell the simple truththat he didnt print a word but what i told him  id like to see him not delia fairly hooted when did he grow so particular he fixed it up she said with assurance they always do in the paperstheyd be ashamed if they didnt well now he has got to bring out a piece praising them uppraising them to the skies thats what he has got to do she wound up with decision  praising them up theyll hate that worse francie returned musingly  delia stared what on earth then do they want  francie had sunk to the sofa her eyes were fixed on the carpet she gave no reply to this question but presently said we had better go tomorrow the first hour thats possible  go where do you mean to nice  i dont care where anywhere to get away  before gaston comeswithout seeing him  i dont want to see him when they were all ranting and raving at me just now i wished he was therei told them so but now i dont feel like thati can never see him again  i dont suppose youre crazy are you delia returned  i cant tell him it wasnt mei cant i cant her companion went on  delia planted herself in front of her francie dosson if youre going to tell him youve done anything wrong you might as well stop before you begin didnt you hear how poppa put it  im sure i dont know francie said listlessly  dont give up an old friendtheres nothing on earth so mean now isnt gaston probert an old friend  it will be very simplehell give me up  then hell be worse than a worm  not in the leasthell give me up as he took me hed never have asked me to marry him if he hadnt been able to get them to accept me he thinks everything in life of them if they cast me off now hell do just the same hell have to choose between us and when it comes to that hell never choose me  hell never choose mr flack if thats what you meanif youre going to identify yourself so with him  oh i wish hed never been born francie wailed after which she suddenly shivered and then she added that she was sickshe was going to bed and her sister took her off to her room  mr dosson that afternoon sitting by his younger daughters bedside read the dreadful piece out to both his children from the copy of the reverberator he had secured on the boulevard it is a remarkable fact that as a family they were rather disappointed in this composition in which their curiosity found less to repay it than it had expected their resentment against mr flack less to stimulate it their fluttering effort to take the point of view of the proberts less to sustain it and their acceptance of the promulgation of francies innocent remarks as a natural incident of the life of the day less to make them reconsider it the letter from paris appeared lively chatty highly calculated to please and so far as the personalities contained in it were concerned mr dosson wanted to know if they werent aware over here of the charges brought every day against the most prominent men in boston if there was anything in that style they might talk he said and he scanned the effusion afresh with a certain surprise at not finding in it some imputation of pecuniary malversation the effect of an acquaintance with the text was to depress delia who didnt exactly see what there was in it to take back or explain away however she was aware there were some points they didnt understand and doubtless these were the scandalous placesthe things that had so worked up the proberts but why should they have minded if other people didnt understand the allusions these were peculiar but peculiarly incomprehensible any better than she did the whole thing struck francie herself as infinitely less lurid than mme de brecourts account of it and the part about her own situation and her beautiful picture seemed to make even less of the subject than it easily might have done it was scanty it was skimpy and if mr waterlow was offended it wouldnt be because they had published too much about him it was nevertheless clear to her that there were a lot of things she hadnt told mr flack as well as a great many she had perhaps those were the things that lady had put inflorine or dorinethe one she had mentioned at mme de brecourts  all the same if the communication in the reverberator let them down at the hotel more gently than had seemed likely and bristled so much less than was to have been feared with explanations of the anguish of the proberts this didnt diminish the girls sense of responsibility nor make the case a whit less grave it only showed how sensitive and fastidious the proberts were and therefore with what difficulty they would come round to condonation moreover francie made another reflexion as she lay therefor delia kept her in bed nearly three days feeling this to be for the moment at any rate an effectual reply to any absurd heroics about leaving paris perhaps they had got casehardened francie said to herself perhaps they had read so many such bad things that they had lost the delicacy of their palate as people were said to do who lived on food too violently spiced then very weak and vague and passive as she was now in the bedimmed room in the soft parisian bed and with delia treating her as much as possible like a sick person she thought of the lively and chatty letters they had always seen in the papers and wondered if they all meant a violation of sanctities a convulsion of homes a burning of smitten faces a rupture of girls engagements it was present to her as an agreeable negative i must add that her father and sister took no strenuous view of her responsibility or of their own they neither brought the matter home to her as a crime nor made her worse through her feeling them anxiously understate their blame there was a pleasant cheerful helplessness in her father on this head as on every other there could be no more discussion among them on such a question than there had ever been for none was needed to show that for these candid minds the newspapers and all they contained were a part of the general fatality of things of the recurrent freshness of the universe coming out like the sun in the morning or the stars at night or the wind and the weather at all times  the thing that worried francie most while delia kept her in bed was the apprehension of what her father might do but this was not a fear of what he might do to mr flack he would go round perhaps to mr proberts or to mme de brecourts and reprimand them for having made things so rough to his chicken it was true she had scarcely ever seen him reprimand any one for anything but on the other hand nothing like this had ever happened before to her or to delia they had made each other cry once or twice but no one else had ever made them and no one had ever broken out on them that way and frightened them half to death francie wanted her father not to go round she had a sense that those other people had somehow stores of comparison of propriety of superiority in any discussion which he couldnt command she wanted nothing done and no communication to passonly a proud unbickering silence on the part of the dossons if the proberts made a noise and they made none it would be they who would have the best appearance moreover now with each elapsing day she felt she did wish to see gaston about it her desire was to wait counting the hours so that she might just clearly explain saying two or three things perhaps these things wouldnt make it bettervery likely they wouldnt but at any rate nothing would have been done in the interval at least on her part and her fathers and delias to make it worse she told her father that she wouldnt as delia put it want to have him go round and was in some degree relieved at perceiving that he didnt seem very clear as to what it was open to him to say to their alienated friends he wasnt afraid but was uncertain his relation to almost everything that had happened to them as a family from a good while back was a sense of the absence of precedents and precedents were particularly absent now for he had never before seen a lot of people in a rage about a piece in the paper  delia also reassured her she said shed see to it that poppa didnt sneak round she communicated to her indeed that he hadnt the smallest doubt that gaston in a few days would blow them upall them down theremuch higher than they had blown her and that he was very sorry he had let her go down herself on that sort of summons it was for her and the rest to come to francie and to him and if they had anything practical to say theyd arrive in a body yet if mr dosson had the sense of his daughters having been roughly handled he derived some of the consolation of amusement from his persistent humorous view of the proberts as a body if they were consistent with their character or with their complaint they would move en masse upon the hotel and he hung about at home a good deal as if to wait for them delia intimated to her sister that this vision cheered them up as they sat they two in the red salon while francie was in bed of course it didnt exhilarate this young lady and she even looked for no brighter side now she knew almost nothing but her sharp little ache of suspense her presentiment of gastons horror which grew all the while delia remarked to her once that he would have seen lots of societypapers over there he would have become familiar but this only suggested to the girlshe had at present strange new moments and impulses of quick reasoningthat they would only prepare him to be disgusted not to be indifferent his disgust would be colder than anything she had ever known and would complete her knowledge of himmake her understand him properly for the first time she would just meet it as briefly as possible it would wind up the business close the incident and all would be over  he didnt write that proved it in advance there had now been two or three mails without a letter he had seen the paper in boston or in new york and it had simply struck him dumb it was very well for delia to say that of course he didnt write when he was on the ocean how could they get his letters even if he did there had been time beforebefore he sailed though delia represented that people never wrote then they were ever so much too busy at the last and were going to see their correspondents in a few days anyway the only missives that came to francie were a copy of the reverberator addressed in mr flacks hand and with a great inkmark on the margin of the fatal letter and three intense pages from mme de brecourt received fortyeight hours after the scene at her house this lady expressed herself as follows  my dear franciei felt very badly after you had gone yesterday morning and i had twenty minds to go and see you but weve talked it over conscientiously and it appears to us that weve no right to take any such step till gaston arrives the situation isnt exclusively ours but belongs to him as well and we feel we ought to make it over to him in as simple and compact a form as possible therefore as we regard it we had better not touch it its so delicate isnt it my poor child but leave it just as it is they think i even exceed my powers in writing you these simple lines and that once your participation has been constatee which was the only advantage of that dreadful scene everything should stop but ive liked you francie ive believed in you and i dont wish you to be able to say that in spite of the thunderbolt youve drawn down on us ive not treated you with tenderness its a thunderbolt indeed my poor and innocent but disastrous little friend were hearing more of it alreadythe horrible republican papers here have as we know already got hold of the unspeakable sheet and are preparing to reproduce the article that is such parts of it as they may put forward with innuendoes and sousentendus to eke out the rest without exposing themselves to a suit for defamation poor leonie de villepreux has been with us constantly and jeanne and her husband have telegraphed that we may expect them day after tomorrow they are evidently immensely emotionnes for they almost never telegraph they wish so to receive gaston we have determined all the same to be intensely quiet and that will be sure to be his view alphonse and maxime now recognise that its best to leave mr flack alone hard as it is to keep ones hands off him have you anything to lui faire direto my precious brother when he arrives but its foolish of me to ask you that for you had much better not answer this you will no doubt have an opportunity to say to himwhatever my dear francie you can say it will matter comparatively little that you may never be able to say it to your friend with every allowance suzanne de brecourt  francie looked at this letter and tossed it away without reading it delia picked it up read it to her father who didnt understand it and kept it in her possession poring over it as mr flack had seen her pore over the cards that were left while she was out or over the registers of american travellers they knew of gastons arrival by his telegraphing from havre he came back by the french line and he mentioned the hourabout dinnertimeat which he should reach paris delia after dinner made her father take her to the circus so that francie should be left alone to receive her intended who would be sure to hurry round in the course of the evening the girl herself expressed no preference whatever on this point and the idea was one of delias masterly ones her flashes of inspiration there was never any difficulty about imposing such conceptions on poppa but at halfpast ten when they returned the young man had not appeared and francie remained only long enough to say i told you so with a white face and march off to her room with her candle she locked herself in and her sister couldnt get at her that night it was another of delias inspirations not to try after she had felt that the door was fast she forbore in the exercise of a great discretion but she herself for the ensuing hours slept no wink nevertheless the next morning as early as ten oclock she had the energy to drag her father out to the bankers and to keep him out two hours it would be inconceivable now that gaston shouldnt turn up before dejeuner he did turn up about eleven oclock he came in and found francie alone she noticed for strangeness that he was very pale at the same time that he was sunburnt also that he didnt for an instant smile at her it was very certain there was no bright flicker in her own face and they had the most singular the most unnatural meeting he only said as he arrived i couldnt come last evening they made it impossible they were all there and we were up till three oclock this morning he looked as if he had been through terrible things and it wasnt simply the strain of his attention to so much business in america what passed next she couldnt remember afterwards it seemed but a few seconds before he said to her slowly holding her handbefore this he had pressed his lips to hers silentlyis it true francie what they say and they swear to it that you told that blackguard those horrors that that infamous letters only a report of your talk  i told him everythingits all me me me the girl replied exaltedly without pretending to hesitate an instant as to what he might mean  gaston looked at her with deep eyes then walked straight away to the window and remained there in silence she herself said nothing more at last the young man went on and i who insisted to them that there was no natural delicacy like yours  well youll never need to insist about anything any more she cried and with this she dashed out of the room by the nearest door when delia and mr dosson returned the red salon was empty and francie was again locked in her room but this time her sister forced an entrance     xiii  mr dosson as we know was almost more than anything else loosely contemplative and the present occasion could only minister to that side of his nature especially as so far at least as his observation of his daughters went it had not urged him into uncontrollable movement but the truth is that the intensity or rather the continuity of his meditations did engender an act not perceived by these young ladies though its consequences presently became definite enough while he waited for the proberts to arrive in a phalanx and noted that they failed to do so he had plenty of time to ask himselfand also to ask deliaquestions about mr flack so far as they were addressed to his daughter they were promptly answered for delia had been ready from the first as we have seen to pronounce upon the conduct of the young journalist her view of it was clearer every hour there was a difference however in the course of action which she judged this view to demand at first he was to have been blown up skyhigh for the mess he had got them intoprofitless as the process might be and vain the satisfaction he was to have been scourged with the sharpest lashes the sense of violated confidence could inflict at present he was not to be touched with a tenfoot pole but rather cut dead cast off and ignored let alone to his dying day delia quickly caught at this for the right grand way of showing displeasure such was the manner in which she characterised it in her frequent conversations with her father if that can be called conversation which consisted of his serenely smoking while she poured forth arguments that kept repetition abreast of variety the same cause will according to application produce effects without sameness as a mark of which truth the catastrophe that made delia express freely the hope she might never again see so much as the end of mr flacks nose had just the opposite action on her parent the best balm for his mystification would have been to let his eyes sociably travel over his young friends whole person this would have been to deal again with quantities and forces he could measure and in terms he could understand if indeed the difference had been pushed further the girl would have kept the field for she had the advantage of being able to motive her attitude to which mr dosson could have opposed but an indefensible in fact an inarticulate laxity she had touched on her deepest conviction in saying to francie that the correspondent of the reverberator had played them that trick on purpose to get them into such trouble with the proberts that he might see his own hopes bloom again in the heat of their disaster this had many of the appearances of a strained interpretation but that didnt prevent delia from placing it before her father several times an hour it mattered little that he should remark in return that he didnt see what good it could do mr flack that francieand he and delia for all he could guessshould be disgusted with him to mr dossons mind that was such a queer way of reasoning delia maintained that she understood perfectly though she couldnt explainand at any rate she didnt want the manoeuvring creature to come flying back from nice she didnt want him to know there had been a scandal that they had a grievance against him that any one had so much as heard of his article or cared what he published or didnt publish above all she didnt want him to know that the proberts had cooled off she didnt want him to dream he could have had such effects mixed up with this high rigour on miss dossons part was the oddest secret complacency of reflexion that in consequence of what mr flack had published the great american community was in a position to know with what fine folks francie and she were associated she hoped that some of the people who used only to call when they were off tomorrow would take the lesson to heart  while she glowed with this consolation as well as with the resentment for which it was required her father quietly addressed a few words by letter to their young friend in the south this communication was not of a minatory order it expressed on the contrary the loose sociability which was the essence of the good gentlemans nature he wanted to see mr flack to talk the whole thing over and the desire to hold him to an account would play but a small part in the interview it commended itself much more to him that the touchiness of the proberts should be a sign of a family of cranksso little did any experience of his own match itthan that a newspaperman had misbehaved in trying to turn out an attractive piece as the newspaperman happened to be the person with whom he had most consorted for some time back he felt drawn to him in presence of a new problem and somehow it didnt seem to mr dosson to disqualify him as a source of comfort that it was just he who had been the fountain of injury the injury wouldnt be there if the proberts didnt point to it with a thousand ringers moreover mr dosson couldnt turn his back at such short notice on a man who had smoked so many of his cigars ordered so many of his dinners and helped him so handsomely to spend his money such acts constituted a bond and when there was a bond people gave it a little jerk in time of trouble his letter to nice was the little jerk  the morning after francie had passed with such an air from gastons sight and left him planted in the salonhe had remained ten minutes to see if she would reappear and then had marched out of the hotelshe received by the first post a letter from him written the evening before it conveyed his deep regret that their meeting that day should have been of so painful so unnatural a character and the hope that she didnt consider as her strange behaviour had seemed to suggest that she had anything to complain of there was too much he wanted to say and above all too much he wanted to ask for him to consent to the indefinite postponement of a necessary interview there were explanations assurances de part et dautre with which it was manifestly impossible that either of them should dispense he would therefore propose that she should see him again and not be wanting in patience to that end late on the morrow he didnt propose an earlier moment because his hands were terribly full at home frankly speaking the state of things there was of the worst jane and her husband had just arrived and had made him a violent an unexpected scene two of the french newspapers had got hold of the article and had given the most perfidious extracts his father hadnt stirred out of the house hadnt put his foot inside a club for more than a week marguerite and maxime were immediately to start for england on an indefinite absence they couldnt face their life in paris for himself he was in the breach fighting hard and making on her behalf asseverations it was impossible for him to believe in spite of the dreadful defiant confession she had appeared to throw at him in the morning that she wouldnt virtually confirm he would come in as soon after nine as possible the day up to that time would be stiff in the cours la reine and he begged her in the meantime not to doubt of his perfect tenderness so far from her having caused it at all to shrink he had never yet felt her to have in his affection such a treasure of indulgence to draw upon  a couple of hours after the receipt of this manifesto francie lay on one of the satin sofas with her eyes closed and her hand clinched upon it in her pocket delia sat hard by with a needle in her fingers certain morsels of silk and ribbon in her lap several pins in her mouth and her attention turning constantly from her work to her sisters face the weather was now so completely vernal that mr dosson was able to haunt the court and he had lately resumed this practice in which he was presumably at the present moment absorbed delia had lowered her needle and was making sure if her companion were awakeshe had been perfectly still for so longwhen her glance was drawn to the door which she heard pushed open mr flack stood there looking from one to the other of the young ladies as to see which would be most agreeably surprised by his visit  i saw your father downstairshe says its all right said the journalist advancing with a brave grin he told me to come straight upi had quite a talk with him  all rightall right delia dosson repeated springing up yes indeedi should say so then she checked herself asking in another manner is that so poppa sent you up and then in still another well have you had a good time at nice  youd better all come right down and see its lovely down there if youll come down ill go right back i guess you want a change mr flack went on he spoke to delia but he looked at francie who showed she had not been asleep by the quick consciousness with which she raised herself on her sofa she gazed at the visitor with parted lips but uttered no word he barely faltered coming toward her with his conscious grimace and his hand out his knowing eyes were more knowing than ever but had an odd appearance of being smaller like penetrating points your father has told me all about it did you ever hear of anything so cheap  all about whatall about what said delia whose attempt to represent happy ignorance was menaced by an intromission of ferocity she might succeed in appearing ignorant but could scarcely succeed in appearing kind francie had risen to her feet and had suffered mr flack to possess himself for a moment of her hand but neither of them had asked the young man to sit down i thought you were going to stay a month at nice delia continued  well i was but your fathers letter started me up  fathers letter  he wrote me about the rowdidnt you know it then i broke you didnt suppose i was going to stay down there when there were such times up here  gracious delia panted  is it pleasant at nice is it very gay isnt it very hot now francie rather limply asked  oh its all right but i havent come up here to crow about nice have i  why not if we want you todelia spoke up  mr flack looked at her for a moment very hard in the whites of the eyes then he replied turning back to her sister anything you like miss francie with you one subjects as good as another cant we sit down cant we be comfortable he added  comfortable of course we can cried delia but she remained erect while francie sank upon the sofa again and their companion took possession of the nearest chair  do you remember what i told you once that the people will have the plums george flack asked with a hard buoyancy of the younger girl  she looked an instant as if she were trying to recollect what he had told her and then said more remotely did father write to you  of course he did thats why im here  poor father sometimes he doesnt know what to do delia threw in with violence  he told me the reverberator has raised a breeze i guessed that for myself when i saw the way the papers here were after it that thing will go the rounds youll see what brought me was learning from him that they have got their backs up  what on earth are you talking about delia dosson rang out  mr flack turned his eyes on her own as he had done a moment before francie sat there serious looking hard at the carpet what game are you trying miss delia it aint true you care what i wrote is it he pursued addressing himself again to francie  after a moment she raised her eyes did you write it yourself  what do you care what he wroteor what does any one care delia again interposed  it has done the paper more good than anythingevery ones so interested said mr flack in the tone of reasonable explanation and you dont feel youve anything to complain of do you he added to francie kindly  do you mean because i told you  why certainly didnt it all spring out of that lovely drive and that walk up in the bois we hadwhen you took me up to see your portrait didnt you understand that i wanted you to know that the public would appreciate a column or two about mr waterlows new picture and about you as the subject of it and about your being engaged to a member of the grand old monde and about what was going on in the grand old monde which would naturally attract attention through that why miss francie mr flack ever so blandly pursued you regularly talked as if you did  did i talk a great deal asked francie  why most freelyit was too lovely we had a real grand old jaw dont you remember when we sat there in the bois  oh rubbish delia panted  yes and mme de cliche passed  and you told me she was scandalised and we had to laugh he reminded herit struck us as so idiotic i said it was a high old pose and i knew what to think of it your father tells me shes scandalised nowshe and all the rest of themat the sight of their names at last in a real newspaper well now if you want to know its a bigger pose than ever and as i said just now its too damned cheap its thinthats what it is and if it were genuine it wouldnt count they pretend to be shocked because it looks exclusive but in point of fact they like it firstrate  are you talking about that old piece in the paper mercy wasnt that dead and buried days and days ago delia quavered afresh she hovered there in dismay as well as in displeasure upset by the news that her father had summoned mr flack to paris which struck her almost as a treachery since it seemed to denote a plan a plan and an uncommunicated plan on mr dossons part was unnatural and alarming and there was further provocation in his appearing to shirk the responsibility of it by not having come up at such a moment with his accomplice delia was impatient to know what he wanted anyway did he want to drag them down again to such commonnessah she felt the commonness noweven though it could hustle did he want to put mr flack forward with a feeble flourish that didnt answer one of their questions as a substitute for the alienated gaston if she hadnt been afraid that something still more uncanny than anything that had happened yet might come to pass between her two companions in case of her leaving them together she would have darted down to the court to appease her conjectures to challenge her father and tell him how particularly pleased she should be if he wouldnt put in his oar she felt liberated however the next moment for something occurred that struck her as a sure proof of the state of her sisters spirit  do you know the view i take of the matter according to what your father has told me mr flack enquired i dont mean it was he gave me the tip i guess ive seen enough over here by this time to have worked it out theyre scandalised all righttheyre blue with horror and have never heard of anything so dreadful miss francie her visitor roared that aint good enough for you and me they know whats in the papers every day of their lives and they know how it got there they aint like the fellow in the storywho was hewho couldnt think how the apples got into the dumplings theyre just grabbing a pretext to break becausebecause well they dont think youre blue blood theyre delighted to strike a pretext they can work and theyre all cackling over the egg it has taken so many hens of em to lay thats my diagnosis if you want to know  ohhow can you say such a thing francie returned with a tremor in her voice that struck her sister her eyes met delias at the same moment and this young womans heart bounded with the sense that she was safe mr flacks power to hustle presumed too farthough mr dosson had crude notions about the licence of the press she felt even as an untutored woman what a false step he was now takingand it seemed to her that francie who was not impressed the particular light in her eyes now showed it could be trusted to allow him no benefit  what does it matter what he says my dear she interposed do make him drop the subjecthes talking very wild im going down to see what poppa meansi never heard of anything so flat at the door she paused a moment to add mutely by mere facial force now just wipe him out mind it was the same injunction she had launched at her from afar that day a year before when they all dined at saintgermain and she could remember how effective it had then been the next moment she flirted out  as soon as she had gone mr flack moved nearer to francie now look here youre not going back on me are you  going back on youwhat do you mean  aint we together in this thing why sure were close together miss francie  togethertogether francie repeated with charming wan but not at all tender eyes on him  dont you remember what i said to youjust as straight as my course always isbefore we went up there before our lovely drive i stated to you that i feltthat i always feelmy great hearty hungry public behind me  oh yes i understoodit was all for you to work it up i told them so i never denied it francie brought forth  you told them so  when they were all crying and going on i told them i knew iti told them i gave you the tip as you call it  she felt mr flack fix her all alarmingly as she spoke these words then he was still nearer to herhe had taken her hand ah youre too sweet she disengaged her hand and in the effort she sprang up but he rising too seemed to press always nearershe had a sense it was disagreeable that he was demonstrativeso that she retreated a little before him they were all there roaring and raging trying to make you believe you had outraged them  all but young mr probert certainly they dont like it she said at her distance  the cowards george flack after a moment remarked and where was young mr probert he then demanded  he was awayive told youin america  ah yes your father told me but now hes back doesnt he like it either  i dont know mr flack francie answered with impatience  well i do then hes a coward toohell do what his poppa tells him and the countess and the duchess and his french brothersinlaw from whom he takes lessons hell just back down hell give you up  i cant talk with you about that said francie  why not why is he such a sacred subject when we are together you cant alter that her visitor insisted it was too lovely your standing up for meyour not denying me  you put in things i never said it seems to me it was very different she freely contended  everything is different when its printed what else would be the good of the papers besides it wasnt i it was a lady who helps me hereyouve heard me speak of her miss topping she wants so much to know youshe wants to talk with you  and will she publish that francie asked with unstudied effect  mr flack stared a moment lord how theyve worked on you and do you think its bad  do i think whats bad  why the letter were talking about  welli didnt see the point of so much  he waited a little interestedly do you think i took any advantage  she made no answer at first but after a moment said in a tone he had never heard from her why do you come here this way why do you ask me such questions  he hesitated after which he broke out because i love you dont you know that  oh please dont she almost moaned turning away  but he was launched now and he let himself go why wont you understand itwhy wont you understand the rest dont you see how it has worked roundthe heartless brutes theyve turned into and the way our life yours and mine is bound to be the same dont you see the damned sneaking scorn with which they treat you and that i only want to do anything in the world for you  francies white face very quiet now let all this pass without a sign of satisfaction her only response was presently to say why did you ask me so many questions that day  because i always ask questionsits my nature and my business to ask them havent you always seen me ask you and ask every one all i could dont you know theyre the very foundation of my work i thought you sympathised with my work so muchyou used to tell me you did  well i did she allowed  you put it in the dead past i see you dont then any more  if this remark was on her visitors part the sign of a rare assurance the girls cold mildness was still unruffled by it she considered she even smiled then she replied oh yes i doonly not so much  they have worked on you but i should have thought theyd have disgusted you i dont careeven a little sympathy will do whatever youve got left he paused looking at her but it was a speech she had nothing for so he went on there was no obligation for you to answer my questionsyou might have shut me up that day with a word  really she asked with all her grave good faith in her face i thought i had tofor fear i should appear ungrateful  ungrateful  why to youafter what you had done dont you remember that it was you who introduced us and she paused with a fatigued delicacy  not to those snobs who are screaming like frightened peacocks i beg your pardoni havent that on my conscience mr flack quite grandly declared  well you introduced us to mr waterlow and he introduced us toto his friends she explained colouring as if it were a fault for the inexactness caused by her magnanimity thats why i thought i ought to tell you what youd like  why do you suppose if id known where that first visit of ours to waterlow was going to bring you out id have taken you within fifty miles he stopped suddenly then in another tone jerusalem theres no one like you and you told them it was all you  never mind what i told them  miss francie said george flack if youll marry me ill never ask a question again ill go into some other business  then you didnt do it on purpose francie asked  on purpose  to get me into a quarrel with themso that i might be free again  well of all the blamed ideas the young man gasped your pure mind never gave birth to thatit was your sisters  wasnt it natural it should occur to me since if as you say youd never consciously have been the means  ah but i was the means mr flack interrupted we must go after all by what did happen  well i thanked you when i drove with you and let you draw me out so were square arent we the term francie used was a colloquialism generally associated with levity but her face as she spoke was none the less deeply seriousserious even to pain  were square he repeated  i dont think you ought to ask for anything more goodbye  goodbye never cried george flack who flushed with his defeat to a degree that spoke strangely of his hopes  something in the way she repeated her goodbye betrayed her impression of this and not a little withal that so much confidence left her unflattered do go away she broke out  well ill come back very soonand he took up his hat  please donti dont like it she had now contrived to put a wide space between them  oh you tormentress he groaned he went toward the door but before he reached it turned round  will you tell me this anyway are you going to marry the lotafter this  do you want to put that in the paper  of course i doand say you said it mr flack held up his head  they stood looking at each other across the large room well theni aint there  thats all right he said as he went out     xiv  when gaston probert came that evening he was received by dosson and delia and when he asked where francie might be was told by the latter that she would show herself in half an hour francie had instructed her sister that as their friend would have first of all information to give their father about the business he had transacted in america he wouldnt care for a lot of women in the room when delia reported this speech to mr dosson that gentleman protested that he wasnt in any hurry for the business what he wanted to find out most was whether mr probert had a good timewhether he had liked it over there gaston might have liked it but he didnt look as if he had had a very good time his face told of reverses of suffering and delia declared to him that if she hadnt received his assurance to the contrary she would have believed he was right down sick he allowed that he had been very sick at sea and was still feeling the effect of it but insisted that there was nothing the matter with him now he sat for some time with mr dosson and delia and never once alluded to the cloud that hung over their relations the girl had schooled her father to a waiting attitude on this point and the manner in which she had descended on him in the morning after mr flack had come upstairs was a lesson he wasnt likely soon to forget it had been impressed on him that she was indeed wiser than he could pretend to be and he was now mindful that he mustnt speak of the piece in the paper unless young probert should speak of it first when delia rushed down to him in the court she began by asking him categorically whom he had wished to do good to by sending mr flack up to their parlour to francie or to her why the way they felt then they detested his very name to mr flack himself why he had simply exposed him to the biggest snub he had ever got in his life  well hanged if i understand poor mr dosson had said i thought you liked the pieceyou think its so queer they dont like it they in the parlance of the dossons now never meant anything but the proberts in congress assembled  i dont think anythings queer but you delia had retorted and she had let her father know that she had left francie in the very act of handling mr flack  is that so the old gentleman had quavered in an impotence that made him wince with a sense of meannessmeanness to his bold initiator of so many parisian hours  francies visitor came down a few minutes later and passed through the court and out of the hotel without looking at them mr dosson had been going to call after him but delia checked him with a violent pinch the unsociable manner of the young journalists departure deepened mr dossons dull ache over the mystery of things i think this may be said to have been the only incident in the whole business that gave him a personal pang he remembered how many of his cigars he had smoked with mr flack and how universal a participant he had made him this haughtiness struck him as the failure of friendshipnot the publication of details about the proberts interwoven with mr dossons nature was the view that if these people had done bad things they ought to be ashamed of themselves and he couldnt pity them and that if they hadnt done them there was no need of making such a rumpus about other peoples knowing it was therefore in spite of the young mans rough exit still in the tone of american condonation that he had observed to delia he says thats what they like over there and that it stands to reason that if you start a paper youve got to give them what they like if you want the people with you youve got to be with the people  well there are a good many people in the world i dont think the proberts are with us much  oh he doesnt mean them said mr dosson  well i do cried delia  at one of the ormolu tables near a lamp with a pink shade gaston insisted on making at least a partial statement he didnt say that he might never have another chance but delia felt with despair that this idea was in his mind he was very gentle very polite but distinctly cold she thought he was intensely depressed and for half an hour uttered not the least little pleasantry there was no particular occasion for that when he talked about preferred bonds with her father this was a language delia couldnt translate though she had heard it from childhood he had a great many papers to show mr dosson records of the mission of which he had acquitted himself but mr dosson pushed them into the drawer of the ormolu table with the remark that he guessed they were all right now after the fact he appeared to attach but little importance to gastons achievementsan attitude which delia perceived to be slightly disconcerting to their visitor delia understood it she had an instinctive sense that her father knew a great deal more than gaston could tell him even about the work he had committed to him and also that there was in such punctual settlements an eagerness a literalism totally foreign to mr dossons domestic habits and to which he would even have imputed a certain pettifogging provincialitytreatable however with dry humour if gaston had cooled off he wanted at least to be able to say that he had rendered them services in america but now her father for the moment at least scarcely appeared to think his services worth speaking of an incident that left him with more of the responsibility for his cooling what mr dosson wanted to know was how everything had struck him over there especially the pickett building and the parlourcars and niagara and the hotels he had instructed him to go to giving him an introduction in two or three cases to the gentleman in charge of the office it was in relation to these themes that gaston was guilty of a want of spring as the girl phrased it to herself that he could produce no appreciative expression he declared however repeatedly that it was a most extraordinary countrymost extraordinary and far beyond anything he had had any conception of of course i didnt like everything he said any more than i like everything anywhere  well what didnt you like mr dosson enquired at this after a short silence  gaston probert made his choice well the light for instance  the lightthe electric  no the solar i thought it rather hard too much like the scratching of a slatepencil as mr dosson hereupon looked vague and rather as if the reference were to some enterprise a great lamp company of which he had not heardconveying a suggestion that he was perhaps staying away too long gaston immediately added i really think francie might come in i wrote to her that i wanted particularly to see her  ill go and call herill make her come said delia at the door she left her companions together and gaston returned to the subject of mr munster mr dossons former partner to whom he had taken a letter and who had shown him every sort of civility mr dosson was pleased at this nevertheless he broke out suddenly  look here you know if youve got anything to say that you dont think very acceptable you had better say it to me gaston changed colour but his reply was checked by delias quick return she brought the news that her sister would be obliged if he would go into the little diningroomhe would find her there she had something for his ear that she could mention only in private it was very comfortable there was a lamp and a fire well i guess she can take care of herself mr dosson at this commented with a laugh what does she want to say to him he asked when gaston had passed out  gracious knows she wont tell me but its too flat at his age to live in such terror  in such terror  why of your father youve got to choose  how to choose  why if theres a person you like and he doesnt like  you mean you cant choose your father said mr dosson thoughtfully  of course you cant  well then please dont like any one but perhaps i should like him he added faithful to his easier philosophy  i guess youd have to said delia  in the small salleamanger when gaston went in francie was standing by the empty table and as soon as she saw him she began  you cant say i didnt tell you i should do something i did nothing else from the firsti mean but tell you so you were warned again and again you knew what to expect  ah dont say that again if you knew how it acts on my nerves the young man groaned you speak as if you had done it on purposeto carry out your absurd threat  well what does it matter when its all over  its not all over would to god it were  the girl stared dont you know what i sent for you to come in here for to bid you goodbye  he held her an instant as if in unbelievable view and then francie what on earth has got into you he broke out what deviltry what poison it would have been strange and sad to an observer the opposition of these young figures so fresh so candid so meant for confidence but now standing apart and looking at each other in a wan defiance that hardened their faces  dont they despise medont they hate me you do yourself certainly youll be glad for me to break off and spare you decisions and troubles impossible to you  i dont understand its like some hideous dream gaston probert cried you act as if you were doing something for a wager and you make it worse by your talk i dont believe iti dont believe a word of it  what dont you believe she asked  that you told himthat you told him knowingly if youll take that back its too monstrous if youll deny it and give me your assurance that you were practised upon and surprised everything can still be arranged  do you want me to lie asked francie dosson i thought youd like pleasant words  oh francie francie moaned the wretched youth with tears in his eyes  what can be arranged what do you mean by everything she went on  why theyll accept it theyll ask for nothing more its your participation they cant forgive  they cant why do you talk to me of them im not engaged to them she said with a shrill little laugh  oh francie i am and its they who are buried beneath that filthy rubbish  she flushed at this characterisation of mr flacks epistle but returned as with more gravity im very sorryvery sorry indeed but evidently im not delicate  he looked at her helpless and bitter its not the newspapers in your country that would have made you so lord theyre too incredible and the ladies have them on their tables  you told me we couldnt herethat the paris ones are too bad said francie  bad they are god knows but theyve never published anything like thatpoured forth such a flood of impudence on decent quiet people who only want to be left alone  francie sank to a chair by the table as if she were too tired to stand longer and with her arms spread out on the lamplit plush she looked up at him was it there you saw it  he was on his feet opposite and she made at this moment the odd reflexion that she had never realised he had such fine lovely uplifted eyebrows yes a few days before i sailed i hated them from the moment i got therei looked at them very little but that was a chance i opened the paper in the hall of an hotelthere was a big marble floor and spittoonsand my eyes fell on that horror it made me ill  did you think it was me she patiently gaped  about as soon as i supposed it was my father but i was too mystified too tormented  then why didnt you write to me if you didnt think it was me  write to you i wrote to you every three days he cried  not after that  well i may have omitted a post at the lasti thought it might be delia gaston added in a moment  oh she didnt want me to do itthe day i went with him the day i told him she tried to prevent me francie insisted  would to god then she had he wailed  havent you told them shes delicate too she asked in her strange tone  he made no answer to this he only continued what power in heavens name has he got over you what spell has he worked  hes a gay old friendhe helped us ever so much when we were first in paris  but my dearest child what gaieties what friendswhat a man to know  if we hadnt known him we shouldnt have known you remember it was mr flack who brought us that day to mr waterlows  oh youd have come some other way said gaston who made nothing of that  not in the least we knew nothing about any other way he helped us in everythinghe showed us everything that was why i told himwhen he asked me i liked him for what he had done  gaston who had now also seated himself listened to this attentively i see it was a kind of delicacy  oh a kind she desperately smiled  he remained a little with his eyes on her face was it for me  of course it was for you  ah how strange you are he cried with tenderness such contradictionson sy perd i wish youd say that to them that way everything would be right  never never said the girl ive wronged them and nothing will ever be the same again it was fatal if i felt as they do i too would loathe the person who should have done such a thing it doesnt seem to me so badthe thing in the paper but you know best you must go back to them you know best she repeated  they were the last the last people in france to do it to the sense of desecration of pollution you seehe explained as if for conscience  oh you neednt tell mei saw them all there she answered  it must have been a dreadful scene but you didnt brave them did you  brave themwhat are you talking about to you that ideas incredible she then hopelessly sighed  but he wouldnt have this no noi can imagine cases he clearly had some vision of independence though he looked awful about it  but this isnt a case hey she demanded well then go back to themgo back she repeated at this he halfthrew himself across the table to seize her hands but she drew away and as he came nearer pushed her chair back springing up you know you didnt come here to tell me youre ready to give them up  to give them up he only echoed it with all his woe at first ive been battling with them till im ready to drop you dont know how they feelhow they must feel  oh yes i do all this has made me older every hour  it has made youso extraordinarilymore beautiful said gaston probert  i dont care nothing will induce me to consent to any sacrifice  some sacrifice there must be give me timegive me time ill manage it i only wish they hadnt seen you there in the bois  in the bois  that marguerite hadnt seen youwith that lying blackguard thats the image they cant get over  well it was as if it had been the thing she had got herself most prepared forso that she must speak accordingly i see you cant either gaston anyhow i was there and i felt it all right thats all i can say you must take me as i am said francie dosson  dontdont you infuriate me he pleaded frowning  she had seemed to soften but she was in a sudden flame again of course i do and i shall do it again were too terribly different everything makes you so you cant give them upever ever goodbyegoodbye thats all i wanted to tell you  ill go and throttle him the young man almost howled  very well go goodbye she had stepped quickly to the door and had already opened it vanishing as she had done the other time  francie francie he supplicated following her into the passage the door was not the one that led to the salon it communicated with the other apartments the girl had plunged into thesehe already heard her push a sharp bolt presently he went away without taking leave of mr dosson and delia  why he acts just like mr flack said the old man when they discovered that the interview in the diningroom had come to an end  the next day was a bad one for charles waterlow his work in the avenue de villiers being terribly interrupted gaston probert invited himself to breakfast at noon and remained till the time at which the artist usually went outan extravagance partly justified by the previous separation of several weeks during these three or four hours gaston walked up and down the studio while waterlow either sat or stood before his easel he put his host vastly out and acted on his nerves but this easy genius was patient with him by reason of much pity feeling the occasion indeed more of a crisis in the history of the troubled youth than the settlement of one question would make it waterlows compassion was slightly tinged with contempt for there was being settled above all it seemed to him and alas in the wrong sense the question of his poor friends character gaston was in a fever he broke out into passionate pleashe relapsed into gloomy silences he roamed about continually his hands in his pockets and his hair in a tangle he could take neither a decision nor a momentary rest it struck his companion more than ever before that he was after all essentially a foreigner he had the foreign sensibility the sentimental candour the need for sympathy the communicative despair a true young anglosaxon would have buttoned himself up in his embarrassment and been dry and awkward and capable and however conscious of a pressure unconscious of a drama whereas gaston was effusive and appealing and ridiculous and gracefulnatural above all and egotistical indeed a true young anglosaxon wouldnt have known the particular acuteness of such a quandary for he wouldnt have parted to such an extent with his freedom of spirit it was the fact of this surrender on his visitors part that excited waterlows secret scorn family feeling was all very well but to see it triumph as a superstition calling for the bloodsacrifice made him feel he would as soon be a blackamoor on his knees before a fetish he now measured for the first time the root it had taken in gastons nature to act like a man the hope of the proberts must pull up the root even if the operation should be terribly painful should be attended with cries and tears and contortions with baffling scruples and a sense of sacrilege the sense of siding with strangers against his own flesh and blood now and again he broke out and if you should see her as she looks just nowshes too lovely too touchingyoud see how right i was originally when i found her such a revelation of that rare type the french renaissance you know the one we talked about but he reverted with at least equal frequency to the oppression he seemed unable to throw off the idea of something done of cruel purpose and malice with a refinement of outrage such an accident to them of all people on earth the very last the least thinkable those who he verily believed would feel it more than any family in the world when waterlow asked what made them of so exceptionally fine a fibre he could only answer that they just happened to benot enviably if one would it was his fathers influence and example his very genius the worship of privacy and good manners a hatred of all the new familiarities and profanations the artist sought to know further at last and rather wearily what in two words was the practical question his friend desired he should consider whether he should be justified in throwing the girl overwas that the issue  gracious goodness no for what sort of sneak do you take me she made a mistake but any innocent young creature might do that its whether it strikes you i should be justified in throwing them over  it depends upon the sense you attach to justification  i mean should i be miserably unhappy would it be in their power to make me so  to trycertainly if theyre capable of anything so nasty the only fair play for them is to let you alone waterlow wound up  ah they wont do thatthey like me too much gaston ingenuously cried  its an odd way of liking the best way to show their love will be to let you marry where your affections and so many other charming things are involved  certainlyonly they question the charming things they feel she represents poor little dear such dangers such vulgarities such possibilities of doing other dreadful things that its upon themi mean on those thingsmy happiness would be shattered  well the elder man rather dryly said if you yourself have no secrets for persuading them of the contrary im afraid i cant teach you one  yes i ought to do it myself gaston allowed in the candour of his meditations then he went on in his torment of hesitation they never believed in her from the first my father was perfectly definite about it at heart they never accepted her they only pretended to do so because i guaranteed her instinctsthats what i did heaven help me and that she was incapable of doing a thing that could ever displease them then no sooner was my back turned than she perpetrated that  that was your folly waterlow remarked painting away  my follyto turn my back  no noto guarantee  my dear fellow wouldnt youand gaston stared  never in the world  youd have thought her capable  capabilissima and i shouldnt have cared  do you think her then capable of breaking out again in some new way thats as bad  i shouldnt care if she was thats the least of all questions  the least  ah dont you see wretched youth cried the artist pausing from his work and looking updont you see that the question of her possibilities is as nothing compared to that of yours shes the sweetest young thing i ever saw but even if she happened not to be i should still urge you to marry her in simple selfpreservation  gaston kept echoing in selfpreservation  to save from destruction the last scrap of your independence thats a much more important matter even than not treating her shabbily theyre doing their best to kill you morallyto render you incapable of individual life  gaston was immensely struck they arethey are he declared with enthusiasm  well then if you believe it for heavens sake go and marry her tomorrow waterlow threw down his implements and added and come out of thisinto the air  gaston however was planted in his path on the way to the door and if she goes again and does the very same  the very same waterlow thought  i mean something else as barbarous and as hard to bear  well said waterlow youll at least have got rid of your family  yes if she lets me in again i shall be glad theyre not there theyre right pourtant theyre right gaston went on passing out of the studio with his friend  theyre right  it was unimaginable that she should  yes thank heaven it was the finger of providenceprovidence taking you off your guard to give you your chance this was ingenious but though he could glow for a moment in response to it francies loverif lover he may in his so infirm aspect be calledlooked as if he mistrusted it thought it slightly sophistical what really shook him however was his companions saying to him in the vestibule when they had taken their hats and sticks and were on the point of going out lord man how can you be so impenetrably dense dont you see that shes really of the softest finest material that breathes that shes a perfect flower of plasticity that everything you may have an apprehension about will drop away from her like the dead leaves from a rose and that you may make of her any perfect and enchanting thing you yourself have the wit to conceive  ah my dear friendand poor gaston with another of his revulsions panted for gratitude  the limit will be yours not hers waterlow added  no no ive done with limits his friend ecstatically cried  that evening at ten oclock gaston presented himself at the hotel de lunivers et de cheltenham and requested the german waiter to introduce him into the diningroom attached to mr dossons apartments and then go and tell miss francina he awaited her there  oh youll be better there than in the zalontheyve villed it with their luccatch said the man who always addressed him in an intention of english and wasnt ignorant of the tie that united the visitor to the amiable american family or perhaps even of the modifications it had lately undergone  with their luggage  they leave tomorrow morningach i dont think they themselves know for where sir  please then say to miss francina that ive called on the most urgent business and am extraordinarily pressed  the special ardour possessing gaston at that moment belonged to the order of the communicative but perhaps the vividness with which the waiter placed this exhibition of it before the young lady is better explained by the fact that her lover slipped a fivefranc piece into his hand she at any rate entered his place of patience sooner than gaston had ventured to hope though she corrected her promptitude a little by stopping short and drawing back when she saw how pale he was and how he looked as if he had been crying  ive chosenive chosen he said expressively smiling at her in denial of these indications  youve chosen  ive had to give them up but i like it so better than having to give you up i took you first with their assent that was well enoughit was worth trying for but now i take you without it we can live that way too  ah im not worth it you give up too much francie returned were going awayits all over she averted herself quickly as if to carry out her meaning but he caught her more quickly still and held herheld her fast and long she had only freed herself when her father and sister broke in from the salon attracted apparently by the audible commotion  oh i thought you had at least knocked over the lamp delia exclaimed  you must take me with you if youre going away mr dosson gaston said ill start whenever you like  all rightwhere shall we go that amiable man asked  hadnt you decided that  well the girls said theyd tell me  we were going home francie brought out  no we werentnot a wee mite delia professed  oh not there gaston murmured with a look of anguish at francie  well when youve fixed it you can take the tickets mr dosson observed with detachment  to some place where there are no newspapers darling gaston went on  i guess youll have hard work to find one mr dosson pursued  dear me we neednt read them any more we wouldnt have read that one if your family hadnt forced us delia said to her prospective brotherinlaw  well i shall never be forcedi shall never again in my life look at one he very gravely declared  youll see siryoull have to mr dosson cheerfully persisted  no youll tell us enough  francie had kept her eyes on the ground the others were all now rather unnaturally smiling wont they forgive me ever she asked looking up  yes perfectly if you can persuade me not to stick to you but in that case what good will their forgiveness do you  well perhaps its better to pay for it the girl went on  to pay for it  by suffering something for it was dreadful she solemnly gloomily said  oh for all youll suffer gaston protested shining down on her  it was for youonly for you as i told you francie returned  yes dont tell me againi dont like that explanation i ought to let you know that my father now declines to do anything for me the young man added to mr dosson  to do anything for you  to make me any allowance  well that makes me feel better we dont want your fathers money you know this more soothable parent said with his mild sturdiness  therell be enough for all especially if we economise in newspapersdelia carried it elegantly off  well i dont know after allthe reverberator came for nothing her father as gaily returned  dont you be afraid hell ever send it now she shouted in her return of confidence  im very sorrybecause they were all lovely francie went on to gaston with sad eyes  let us wait to say that till they come back to us he answered somewhat sententiously he really cared little at this moment whether his relatives were lovely or not  im sure you wont have to wait long delia remarked with the same cheerfulness  till they come back mr dosson repeated ah they cant come back now sir we wont take them in the words fell from his lips with a fine unexpected austerity which imposed itself producing a momentary silence and it is a sign of gastons complete emancipation that he didnt in his heart resent this image of eventual favours denied his race the resentment was rather delias but she kept it to herself for she was capable of reflecting with complacency that the key of the house would after all be hers so that she could open the door for the proberts if the proberts should knock now that her sisters marriage was really to take place her consciousness that the american people would have been resoundingly told so was still more agreeable the party left the hotel de lunivers et de cheltenham on the morrow but it appeared to the german waiter as he accepted another fivefranc piece from the happy and now reckless gaston that they were even yet not at all clear as to where they were going
