friendship      xiv the herne game       xv a matter of principle      xvi the first place game     xvii kens day    xviii breaking training     i  the varsity captain   ken ward had not been at the big university many days before he realized the miserable lot of a freshman  at first he was sorely puzzled college was so different from what he had expected at the high school of his home town which being the capital of the state was no village he had been somebody then his summer in arizona with its wild adventures had given him a selfappreciation which made his present situation humiliating  there were more than four thousand students at the university ken felt himself the youngest the smallest the one of least consequence he was lost in a shuffle of superior youths in the forestry department he was a mere boy and he soon realized that a freshman there was the same as anywhere the fact that he weighed nearly one hundred and sixty pounds and was no stripling despite his youth made not one whit of difference  unfortunately his first overture of what he considered goodfellowship had been made to an upperclassman and had been a grievous mistake ken had not yet recovered from its reception he grew careful after that then shy and finally began to struggle against disappointment and loneliness  outside of his department on the campus and everywhere he ventured he found things still worse there was something wrong with him with his fresh complexion with his hair with the way he wore his tie with the cut of his clothes in fact there was nothing right about him he had been so beset that he could not think of anything but himself one day while sauntering along a campus path with his hands in his pockets he met two students coming toward him they went to right and left and jerking his hands from his pockets roared in each ear how dare you walk with your hands in your pockets  another day on the library step he encountered a handsome bareheaded youth with a fine cleancut face and keen eyes who showed the true stamp of the great university  here he said sharply arent you a freshman  whyyes confessed ken  i see you have your trousers turned up at the bottom  yesso i have for the life of him ken could not understand why that simple fact seemed a crime but so it was  turn them down ordered the student  ken looked into the stern face and flashing eyes of his tormentor and then meekly did as he had been commanded  boy ive saved your life we murder freshmen here for that said the student and then passed on up the steps  in the beginning it was such incidents as these that had bewildered ken he passed from surprise to anger and vowed he would have something to say to these upperclassmen but when the opportunity came ken always felt so little and mean that he could not retaliate this made him furious he had not been in college two weeks before he could distinguish the sophomores from the seniors by the look on their faces he hated the sneering sophs and felt rising in him the desire to fight but he both feared and admired seniors they seemed so aloof so far above him he was in awe of them and had a hopeless longing to be like them and as for the freshmen it took no second glance for ken to pick them out they were of two kindsthose who banded together in crowds and went about yelling and running away from the sophs and those who sneaked about alone with timid step and furtive glance  ken was one of these lonesome freshmen he was pining for companionship but he was afraid to open his lips once he had dared to go into carlton hall the magnificent clubhouse which had been given to the university by a famous graduate the club was for all studentsken had read that on the card sent to him and also in the papers but manifestly the upperclassmen had a different point of view ken had gotten a glimpse into the immense readingroom with its open fireplace and huge chairs its air of quiet study and repose he had peeped into the brilliant billiardhall and the gymnasium and he had been so impressed and delighted with the marble swimmingtank that he had forgotten himself and walked too near the pool several students accidentally bumped him into it it appeared the students were so eager to help him out that they crowded him in again when ken finally got out he learned the remarkable fact that he was the sixteenth freshman who had been accidentally pushed into the tank that day  so ken ward was in a state of revolt he was homesick he was lonely for a friend he was constantly on the lookout for some trick his confidence in himself had fled his opinion of himself had suffered a damaging change he hardly dared call his soul his own  but that part of his time spent in study or attending lectures more than made up for the other ken loved his subject and was eager to learn he had a free hour in the afternoon and often he passed this in the library sometimes in the different exhibition halls he wanted to go into carlton club again but his experience there made him refrain  one afternoon at this hour ken happened to glance into a lectureroom it was a large amphitheatre full of noisy students the benches were arranged in a circle running up from a small pit seeing safety in the number of students who were passing in ken went along he thought he might hear an interesting lecture it did not occur to him that he did not belong there the university had many departments and he felt that any lectureroom was open to him still caution had become a habit with him and he stepped down the steep aisle looking for an empty bench  how steep the aisle was the benches appeared to be on the side of a hill ken slipped into an empty one there was something warm and pleasant in the close contact of so many students in the ripple of laughter and the murmur of voices ken looked about him with a feeling that he was glad to be there  it struck him suddenly that the room had grown strangely silent even the shuffling steps of the incoming students had ceased ken gazed upward with a queer sense of foreboding perhaps he only imagined that all the students above were looking down at him hurriedly he glanced below a sea of faces in circular rows was turned his way  there was no mistake about it he was the attraction at the same instant when he prayed to sink through the bench out of sight a burning anger filled his breast what on earth had he done now he knew it was something he felt it that quiet moment seemed an age then the waiting silence burst  fresh on fifth yelled a student in one of the lower benches  fresh on fifth bawled another at the top of his lungs  kens muddled brain could make little of the matter he saw he was in the fifth row of benches and that all the way around on either side of him the row was empty the four lower rows were packed and above him students were scattered all over he had the fifth row of benches to himself  fresh on fifth  again the call rang up from below it was repeated now from the left of the pit and then from the right a student yelled it from the first row and another from the fourth it banged back and forth not a word came from the upper part of the room  ken sat up straight with a very red face it was his intention to leave the bench but embarrassment that was developing into resentment held him fast what a senseless lot these students were why could they not leave him in peace how foolish of him to go wandering about in strange lecturerooms  a hand pressed kens shoulder he looked back to see a student bending down toward him  hang freshie this fellow whispered  whats it all about asked ken what have i done anyway i never was in here before  all sophs down there they dont allow freshmen to go below the sixth row thereve been several rushes this term and the big ones coming hang freshie were all with you  fresh on fifth the tenor of the cry had subtly changed goodhumored warning had changed to challenge it pealed up from many lusty throats and became general all along the four packed rows  hang freshie bellowed a freshman from the topmost row it was acceptance of the challenge the battlecry flung down to the sophs a roar arose from the pit the freshmen outnumbering the sophomores drowned the roar in a hoarser one then both sides settled back in ominous waiting  ken thrilled in all his being the freshmen were with him that roar told him of united strength all in a moment he had found comrades and he clenched his fingers into the bench vowing he would hang there until hauled away  fresh on fifth shouted a soph in ringing voice he stood up in the pit and stepped to the back of the second bench fresh on fifth watch me throw him out  he was a sturdily built young fellow and balanced himself gracefully on the backs of the benches stepping up from one to the other there was a bold gleam in his eyes and a smile on his face he showed goodnatured contempt for a freshman and an assurance that was close to authority  ken sat glued to his seat in mingled fear and wrath was he to be the butt of those overbearing sophomores he thought he could do nothing but hang on with all his might the ascending student jumped upon the fourth bench and reaching up laid hold of ken with no gentle hands his grip was so hard that ken had difficulty in stifling a cry of pain this however served to dispel his panic and make him angry clear through  the sophomore pulled and tugged with all his strength yet he could not dislodge ken the freshmen howled gleefully for him to hang hang  then two more sophomores leaped up to help the leader a blank silence followed this move and all the freshmen leaned forward breathlessly there was a sharp ripping of cloth half of kens coat appeared in the hands of one of his assailants  suddenly ken let go his hold pushed one fellow violently then swung his fists it might have been unfair for the sophomores were beneath him and balancing themselves on the steep benches but ken was too angry to think of that the fellow he pushed fell into the arms of the students below the second slid out of sight and the third who had started the fray plunged with a crash into the pit  the freshmen greeted this with a wild yell the sophomores answered likewise like climbing tumbling apes the two classes spilled themselves up and down the benches and those nearest ken laid hold of him pulling him in opposite directions  then began a fierce fight for possession of luckless ken both sides were linked together by gripping hands ken was absolutely powerless his clothes were torn to tatters in a twinkling they were soon torn completely off leaving only his shoes and socks not only was he in danger of being seriously injured but students of both sides were handled as fiercely a heavy trampling roar shook the amphitheatre as they surged up and down the steep room benches were split in the beginning the sophomores had the advantage and the tugofwar raged near the pit and all about it but the superior numbers of the freshmen began to tell the web of closelocked bodies slowly mounted up the room smashing the benches swaying downward now and then yet irresistibly gaining ground the yells of the freshmen increased with the assurance of victory there was one more prolonged straining struggle then ken was pulled away from the sophomores the wide swinging doors of the room were knocked flat to let out the stream of wild freshmen they howled like fiends it was first blood for the freshman class the first tug won that year  ken ward came to his senses out in the corridor surrounded by an excited beaming and disreputable crowd of freshmen badly as he was hurt he had to laugh some of them looked happy in nothing but torn underclothes others resembled a lot of ragamuffins coats were minus sleeves vests were split shirts were collarless blood and bruises were much in evidence  some one helped ken into a long ulster  say it was great said this worthy do you know who that fellow wasthe first one who tried to throw you out of number five  i havent any idea replied ken in fact he felt that his ideas were as scarce just then as his clothes  that was the president of the sophs hes the varsity baseball captain too you slugged him great  kens spirit low as it was sank still lower what miserable luck he had his one great ambition next to getting his diploma had been to make the varsity baseball team     ii  a great arm   the shock of that battle more than the bruising he had received confined ken to his room for a week when he emerged it was to find he was a marked man marked by the freshmen with a great and friendly distinction by the sophomores for revenge if it had not been for the loss of his baseball hopes he would have welcomed the chance to become popular with his classmates but for him it was not pleasant to be reminded that he had slugged the sophs most honored member  it took only two or three meetings with the revengeful sophomores to teach ken that discretion was the better part of valor he learned that the sophomores of all departments were looking for him with deadly intent so far luck had enabled him to escape all but a wordy bullying ken became an expert at dodging he gave the corridors and campus a wide berth he relinquished his desire to live in one of the dormitories and rented a room out in the city he timed his arrival at the university and his departure his movements were governed entirely by painfully acquired knowledge of the whereabouts of his enemies  so for weeks ken ward lived like a recluse he was not one with his college mates he felt that he was not the only freshman who had gotten a bad start in college sometimes when he sat near a sadfaced classmate he knew instinctively that here was a fellow equally in need of friendship still these freshmen were as backward as he was and nothing ever came of such feelings  the days flew by and the weeks made months and all ken did was attend lectures and study he read everything he could find in the library that had any bearing on forestry he mastered his textbooks before the christmas holidays about the vacation he had long been undecided at length he made up his mind not to go home it was a hard decision to reach but his college life so far had been a disappointment he was bitter about it and he did not want his father to know judge ward was a graduate of the university often and long he had talked to ken about university life the lasting benefit of associations and friendships he would probably think that his son had barred himself out by some reckless or foolish act ken was not sure what was to blame he knew he had fallen in his own estimation and that the less he thought of himself the more he hated the sophs  on christmas day he went to carlton hall it was a chance he did not want to miss for very few students would be there as it turned out he spent some pleasant hours but before he left the club his steps led him into the athletic trophy room and there he was plunged into grief the place was all ablaze with flags and pennants silver cups and gold medals pictures of teams and individuals there were mounted sculls and oars footballs and baseballs the long and proud record of the university was there to be read all her famous athletes were pictured there and every one who had fought for his college ken realized that here for the first time he was in the atmosphere of college spirit for which the university was famed what would he not have given for a permanent place in that gallery but it was too late he had humiliated the captain of the baseball team ken sought out the picture of the last seasons varsity what a stocky lot of young chaps all consciously proud of the big letter on their shirts dale the captain and pitcher was in the centre of the group ken knew his record and it was a splendid one ken took another look at dale another at the famous trainer murray and the professional coach arthursmen under whom it had been his dream to playand then he left the room brokenhearted  when the christmas recess was over he went back to his lectures resigned to the thought that the athletic side of college life was not for him he studied harder than ever and even planned to take a course of lectures in another department also his adeptness in dodging was called upon more and more the sophs were bound to get him sooner or later but he did not grow resigned to that every dodge and flight increased his resentment presently he knew he would stop and take what they had to give and retaliate as best he could only what would they do to him when they did catch him he remembered his watch his money and clothes never recovered after that memorable tugofwar he minded the loss of his watch most that gift could never be replaced it seemed to him that he had been the greater sufferer  one saturday in january ken hurried from his classroom he was always in a hurry and particularly on saturdays for that being a short day for most of the departments there were usually many students passing to and fro a runaway team clattering down the avenue distracted him from his usual caution and he cut across the campus some one stopped the horses and a crowd collected when ken got there many students were turning away ken came face to face with a tall bronzehaired frecklefaced sophomore whom he had dodged more than once there was now no use to dodge he had to run or stand his ground  boys heres that slugging freshie yelled the soph weve got him now  he might have been an indian chief so wild was the whoop that answered him  lead us to him  oh what we wont do to that freshie  come on boys  ken heard these yells saw a number of boys dash at him then he broke and ran as if for his life the sophs a dozen strong yelling loudly strung out after him ken headed across the campus he was fleet of foot and gained on his pursuers but the yells brought more sophs on the scene and they turned ken to the right he spurted for carlton hall and almost ran into the arms of still more sophomores turning tail he fled toward the library when he looked back it was to see the bronzehaired leader within a hundred yards and back of him a long line of shouting students  if there was a place to hide round that library ken could not find it in this circuit he lost ground moreover he discovered he had not used good judgment in choosing that direction all along the campus was a high iron fence ken thought desperately hard for an instant then with renewed speed he bounded straight for college hall  this was the stronghold of the sophomores as ken sped up the gravel walk his pursuers split their throats  run you freshie yelled one  the more you run yelled another  the more well skin you finished a third  ken ran into the passageway leading through college hall  it was full of sophs hurrying toward the door to see where the yells came from when ken plunged into their midst some one recognized him and burst out with the intelligence at the same moment kens pursuers banged through the swinging doors  a yell arose then in the constricted passageway that seemed to ken to raise college hall from its foundation it terrified him like an eel he slipped through reaching arms and darted forward ken was heavy and fast on his feet and with fear lending him wings he made a run through college hall that would have been a delight to the football coach for ken was not dodging any sophomores now he had played his humiliating part of dodger long enough he knocked them right and left and many a surprised soph he tumbled over reaching the farther door he went through out into the open  the path before him was clear now and he made straight for the avenue it was several hundred yards distant and he got a good start toward it before the sophs rolled like a roaring stream from the passage ken saw other students running and also men and boys out on the avenue but as they could not head him off he kept to his course on that side of the campus a high narrow stairway lined by railings led up to the sidewalk when ken reached it he found the steps covered with ice he slipped and fell three times in the ascent while his frantic pursuers gained rapidly  ken mounted to the sidewalk gave vent to a gasp of relief and wheeling sharply he stumbled over two boys carrying a bushel basket of potatoes when he saw the large round potatoes a daring inspiration flashed into his mind taking the basket from the boys he turned to the head of the stairway  the bronzehaired soph was halfway up the steps his followers twelve or more were climbing after him then a line of others stretched all the way to college hall  with a grim certainty of his mastery of the situation ken threw a huge potato at his leading pursuer fair and square on the bronze head it struck with a sharp crack like a tenpin the soph went down he plumped into the next two fellows knocking them off their slippery footing the three fell helplessly and piled up their comrades in a dense wedge halfway down the steps if the sophs had been yelling before it was strange to note how they were yelling now  deliberately ken fired the heavy missiles they struck with sodden thuds against the bodies of the struggling sophomores a poor thrower could not very well have missed that mark and ken ward was remarkably accurate he had a powerful overhand swing and the potatoes flew like bullets one wildeyed soph slipped out of the tangle to leap up the steps ken throwing rather low hit him on the shin he buckled and dropped down with a bloodcurdling yell another shook himself loose and faced upward a betteraimed shot took him in the shoulder he gave an exhibition of a high and lofty somersault then two more started up abreast the first ken hit over the eye with a very small potato which popped like an explosive bullet and flew into bits as far as effect was concerned a martini could not have caused a more beautiful fall ken landed on the second fellow in the pit of the stomach with a very large potato there was a sound as of a suddenly struck bassdrum the soph crumpled up over the railing slid down and fell among his comrades effectually blocking the stairway  for the moment ken had stopped the advance the sophomores had been checked by one wild freshman there was scarcely any doubt about kens wildness he had lost his hat his dishevelled hair stood up like a mane every time he hurled a potato he yelled but there was nothing wild about his aim  all at once he turned his battery on the students gathering below the crush trying to find a way through the kicking slipping mass on the narrow stairs he scattered them as if they had been quail some ran out of range others dove for cover and tried to dodge this dodging brought gleeful howls from ken  dodge you indian yelled ken as he threw and seldom it was that dodging was of any use then coming to the end of his ammunition he surveyed the battlefield beneath him and turning ran across the avenue and down a street at the corner of the block he looked back there was one man coming but he did not look like a student so ken slackened his pace and bent his steps toward his boardinghouse  by george i stole those potatoes he exclaimed presently i wonder how i can make that good  several times as he turned to look over his shoulder he saw the man he had noticed at first but that did not trouble him for he was sure no one else was following him ken reached his room exhausted by exertion and excitement he flung himself upon his bed to rest and calm his mind so that he could think if he had been in a bad light before what was his position now beyond all reasoning with however was the spirit that gloried in his last stand  by george he kept saying i wouldnt have missed thatnot for anything they made my life a nightmare ill have to leave collegego somewhere elsebut i dont care  later after dinner as he sat reading he heard a doorbell ring a mans voice then footsteps in the hall some one tapped on his door ken felt a strange cold sensation which soon passed and he spoke  come in  the door opened to admit a short man with little bright eyes sharp as knives  hello kid he said then he leisurely removed his hat and overcoat and laid them on the bed  kens fear of he knew not what changed to amazement at least his visitor did not belong to the faculty there was something familiar about the man yet ken could not place him  well up in your studies he asked cordially then he seated himself put a hand on each knee and deliberately and curiously studied ken  why yes pretty well up replied ken he did not know how to take the man there was a kindliness about him which relieved ken yet there was also a hard scrutiny that was embarrassing  all by your lonely here he said  it is lonely replied ken butbut i dont get on very well with the students  small wonder most of em are crazy  he was unmistakably friendly ken kept wondering where he had seen him presently the man arose and with a wide smile on his face reached over and grasped kens right arm  hows the whip  what asked ken  the wingyour arm kid your arm  ohwhy its all right  its not sorenot after peggin a bushel of potatoes on a cold day  ken laughed and raised his arm up and down its weak tonight but not sore  these boys with their indiarubber arms its youth kid its youth say how old are you  sixteen  what no more than that  no  how much do you weigh  about one hundred and fiftysix  i thought you had some beef back of that stunt of yours today say kid it was the funniest and the best thing ive seen at the university in ten yearsand ive seen some fresh boys do some stunts i have well kid youve a grand whipa great armand were goin to do some stunts with it  ken felt something keen and significant in the very air  a great arm for what who are you  say i thought every boy in college knew me im arthurs  the baseball coach are you the baseball coach exclaimed ken jumping up with his heart in his throat  thats me my boy and im lookin you up  ken suddenly choked with thronging emotions and sat down as limp as a rag  yes kid im after you strong the way you pegged em today got me youve a great arm     iii  prisoner of the sophs   but ifits really truethat ive a great arm faltered ken it wont ever do me any good i could never get on the varsity  why not demanded the coach ill make a star of a youngster like you if youll take coachin why not  oh you dont know returned ken with a long face  say you havent struck me as a kid with no nerve whats wrong with you  it was i who slugged captain dale and caused that big rush between the freshmen and sophomores ive lived like a hermit ever since  so it was you who hit dale wellthats bad replied arthurs he got up with sober face and began to walk the floor i remember the eye he had it was a sight but dales a good fellow hell  id do anything on earth to make up for that burst out ken  good ill tell you what well do said arthurs his face brightening well go right down to dales room now ill fix it up with him somehow the sooner the better im goin to call the baseball candidates to the cage soon  they put on coats and hats and went out evidently the coach was thinking hard for he had nothing to say but he kept a reassuring hand on kens arm they crossed the campus along the very path where ken had fled from the sophomores the great circle of dormitories loomed up beyond with lights shining in many windows arthurs led ken through a courtyard and into a wide bright hallway their steps sounded with hollow click upon the tiled floor they climbed three flights of stairs and then arthurs knocked at a door kens heart palpitated it was all so sudden he did not know what he was going to say or do he did not care what happened to him if arthurs could only somehow put him right with the captain  a merry voice bade them enter the coach opened the door and led ken across the threshold ken felt the glow of a warm bright room colorful with pennants and posters and cozy in its disorder then he saw dale and behind him several other students there was a moments silence in which ken heard his heart beat  dale rose slowly from his seat the look on his frank face changing from welcome to intense amazement and then wild elation  whoop he shouted lock the door worry arthurs thiss your best bet ever  dale dashed at the coach hugged him frantically then put his head out of the door to bawl sophs sophs sophs hurry call number nine oh my  then he faced about holding the door partially open he positively beamed upon the coach  say cap whats eatin you asked arthurs he looked dumfounded ken hung to him desperately he thought he knew what was coming there were hurried footsteps in the corridor and excited voices  worry its bully of you to bring this freshman here declared the captain  well what of it demanded the coach i looked him up tonight hes got a great arm and will be good material for the team he told me about the little scrap you had in the lectureroom he lost his temper and no wonder anyway hes sorry cap and i fetched him around to see if you couldnt make it up how about it kid  im sorryawfully sorry captain dale blurted out ken i was mad and scared toothen you fellows hurt me so i hit right out but ill take my medicine  sooh ejaculated dale well this beats the deuce thats why youre here  the door opened wide to admit half a dozen eagerfaced youths  fellows heres a surprise said dale young ward the freshman the elusive slugging freshman fast on his feet and as worry here says a lad with a great arm  ward roared the sophs in unison  hold on fellowswaitno roughhouse yetwait ordered dale wards here of his own free will  silence ensued after the captain spoke while he turned to lock the door the sophs stared openmouthed at ken arthurs had a worried look and he kept his hand on ken dale went to a table and began filling his pipe then he fixed sharp thoughtful eyes upon his visitors  worry you say you brought this freshman here to talk baseball he asked  sure i did blustered arthurs it was plain now where he got the name that dale called him whats in the wind anyhow  dale then gravely spoke to ken so you came here to see me sorry you slugged me once want to make up for it somehow because you think youve a chance for the team and dont want me to be sore on you that it  not exactly replied ken id want to let you get square with me even if you werent the varsity captain  well youve more than squared yourself with meby coming here youll realize that presently but dont you know whats happened what the freshmen have done  no i dont  you havent been near the university since this afternoon when you pulled off the potato stunt  i should say i havent  this brought a laugh from the sophs  you were pretty wise went on dale the sophs didnt love you then but theyre going tounderstand  ken shook his head too bewildered and mystified to reply  well now heres giraffe boswick look what you did to him  kens glance followed the wave of dales hand and took in the tall bronzehaired sophomore who had led the chase that afternoon boswick wore a huge discolored bruise over his left eye it was hideous ken was further sickened to recollect that boswick was one of the varsity pitchers but the fellow was smiling amiably at ken as amiably as one eye would permit the plot thickened about ken he felt his legs trembling under him  boswick you forgive ward dont younow continued dale with a smile  with all my heart exclaimed the pitcher to see him here would make me forgive anything  coach arthurs was ill at ease he evidently knew students and he did not relish the mystery the hidden meaning  say you wise guys make me sick he called out gruffly heres a kid that comes right among you hes on the level and moren that hes game now cap i fetched him here and i wont stand for a whole lot get up on your toes get it over  sit down worry heres a cigarlight up said dale soothingly its all coming right lovely i say ward was game to hunt me up a thousand times gamer than he knows see here ward where are you from  i live a good long days travel from the university answered ken evasively  i thought so did you ever hear of the bowlfight the great event of the year here at wayne university  yes ive heardread a little about it but i dont know what it is  ill tell you went on dale there are a number of yearly rushes and scrapes between the freshmen and sophomores but the bowlfight is the one big meeting the timehonored event it has been celebrated here for many years it takes place on a fixed date briefly heres what comes off the freshmen have the bowl in their keeping this year because they won it in the last fight they are to select one of their number always a scrappy fellow and one honored by the class and they call him the bowlman a week before the fight on a certain date the freshmen hide this bowlman or protect him from the sophomores until the day of the fight when they all march to grant field in fightingtogs should the sophomores chance to find him and hold him prisoner until after the date of the bowlfight they win the bowl the same applies also in case the bowl is in possession of the sophomores but for ten years neither class has captured the others bowlman so they have fought it out on the field until the bowl was won  well what has all that got to do with me asked ken he felt curiously lightheaded  it has a little to do with youhasnt it fellows said dale in slow tantalizing voice  worry arthurs lost his worried look and began to smile and rub his hands  ward look here added dale now speaking sharply youve been picked for the bowlman  meme stammered ken  no other the freshmen were late in choosing a man this year today after your stuntholding up that bunch of sophomoresthey had a meeting in carlton club and picked you most of them didnt even know your name ill bet the whole freshman class is hunting for you right now  what for queried ken weakly  why i told you the bowlfight is only a week offand here you are and here youll stay until that dates past  ken drew a quick breath he began to comprehend the sudden huzzahs of dales companions gave him further enlightenment  but captain dale he said breathlessly if its soif my class has picked mei cant throw them down i dont know a soul in my class i havent a friend but i wont throw them downnot to be forever free of dodging sophsnot even to square myself with you  ward youre all right shouted dale his eyes shining  in the quiet moment that followed with all the sophomores watching him intently ken ward instinctively felt that his measure had been taken  i wont stay here said ken and for the first time his voice rang  oh yes you will replied dale laughing  quick as a cat ken leaped for the door and got it unlocked and half open before some one clutched him then dale was on him close and hard ken began to struggle he was all muscle and twice he broke from them  his legs grab his legs hes a young bull  well trim you now freshie  you potatomasher  go for his wind  fighting and wrestling with all his might ken went down under a half dozen sophomores then dale was astride his chest and others were sitting on his hands and feet  boys dont hurt that arm yelled worry arthurs  ward will you be good now and stop scrapping or shall we tie you asked dale you cant get away the thing to do is to give your word not to try we want to make this easy for you your word of honor now  never cried ken  i knew you wouldnt said dale well have to keep you under guard  they let him get up he was panting and his nose was bleeding and one of his knuckles was skinned that short struggle had been no joke the sophs certainly meant to keep him prisoner still he was made to feel at ease they could not do enough for him  its tough luck ward that you should have fallen into our hands this way said dale but you couldnt help it you will be kept in my rooms until after the fifteenth meals will be brought you and your books everything will be done for your comfort your whereabouts of course will be a secret and you will be closely watched worry remember you are bound to silence and ward perhaps it wasnt an ill wind that blew you here youve had your last scrap with a soph thats sure as for what brought you hereits more than square and ill say this if you can play ball as well as you can scrap old wayne has got a star     iv  the call for candidates   there were five rooms in dales suite in the dormitory and three other sophomores shared them with him they confined ken in the end room where he was safely locked and guarded from any possible chance to escape  for the first day or two it was irksome for ken but as he and his captors grew better acquainted the strain eased up and ken began to enjoy himself as he had not since coming to the university  he could not have been better provided for his books were at hand and even notes of the lectures he was missing were brought to him the college papers and magazines interested him and finally he was much amused by an account of his mysterious disappearance all in a day he found himself famous then dale and his roommates were so friendly and jolly that if his captivity had not meant the disgrace of the freshman class ken would have rejoiced in it he began to thaw out though he did not lose his backwardness the life of the great university began to be real to him almost the whole sophomore class in squads of twos and threes and sixes visited dales rooms during that week no soph wanted to miss a sight of a captive bowlman ken felt so callow and fresh in their presence that he scarcely responded to their jokes worry arthurs nickname of kid vied with another the coach conferred on ken and that was peg it was significant slang expressing the little baseball mans baseball notion of kens throwing power  the evening was the most interesting time for ken there was always something lively going on he wondered when the boys studied when some of the outside students dropped in there were banjo and guitar playing college songs and college gossip  come on peg be a good fellow they said and laughed at his refusal to smoke or drink beer  molly mocked one  willyboy added another  ken was callow young and backward but he had a temper and this kind of banter roused it easily the red flamed into his cheeks  i promised my mother i wouldnt smoke or drink or gamble while i was in college he retorted struggling with shame and anger and ii wont  dale stopped the goodnatured chaff fellows stop guying ward cut it out i tell you hes only a kid freshman but hes liable to hand you a punch and if he does youll remember it besides hes right look here ward you stick to that promise its a good promise to stick to and if youre going in for athletics its the best ever  worry arthurs happened to be present on this evening and he seconded dale in more forceful speech theres too much boozin and smokin of them coffin nails goin on in this college its none of my affair except with the boys im coachin and if i ketch any one breakin my rules after we go to the trainintable hell sit on the bench theres murray why he says there are fellows in college who could break records if theyd train half of sprintin or baseball or football is condition  oh worry you and mac always make a long face over things wayne has won a few championships hasnt she  the varsity ball team will be a frost this year thats sure replied arthurs gloomily  how do you make that out demanded dale plainly nettled youve hinted it before to me why wont we be stronger than last season didnt we have a crackerjack team the fastest that ever represented old wayne didnt we smother the small college teams and beat place twice shut out herne the first game and play for a tie the second  youll see all right all right replied arthurs gloomier than ever and he took his hat and went out  dale slammed his cards down on the table  fellows is it any wonder we call him worry already hes begun to fuss over the team ever since hes been here he has driven the baseball captains and managers crazy its only his way but its so irritating hes a magnificent coach and wayne owes her great baseball teams to him but hes hard on captains i see my troubles the idea of this years team being a frostwith all the old stars back in collegewith only two positions to fill and there are half a dozen cracks in college to fight for these two positionsfellows i played against on the summer nines last year worrys idea is ridiculous  this bit of baseball talk showed ken the obstacles in the way of a freshman making the varsity team what a small chance there would be for him still he got a good deal of comfort out of arthurs interest in him and felt that he would be happy to play substitute this season and make the varsity in his sophomore year  the day of the bowlfight passed and kens captivity became history the biggest honor of the sophomore year went to dale and his roommates ken returned to his department where he was made much of as he had brought fame to a new and small branch of the great university it was a pleasure to walk the campus without fear of being pounced upon kens dodging and lonelinessperhaps necessary and curbing nightmares in the life of a freshmanwere things of the past he made acquaintances slowly lost his backwardness and presently found college life opening to him bright and beautiful ken felt strongly about things and as his selfenforced exile had been lonely and bitter so now his feeling that he was really a part of the great university seemed almost too good to be true he began to get a glimmering of the meaning of his fathers love for the old college students and professors underwent some vague change in his mind he could not tell what he did not think much about it but there was a warmer touch a sense of something nearer to him  then suddenly a blow fell upon the whole undergraduate body it was a thunderbolt it affected every student but ken imagined it concerned his own college fortunes more intimately the athletic faculty barred every member of the varsity baseball team the year before the faculty had advised and requested the players not to become members of the summer baseball nines their wishes had not been heeded captain dale and his fast players had been much in demand by the famous summer nines some of them went to the orange athletic club others to richfield springs others to cape may and dale himself had captained the atlantic city team  the action of the faculty was commended by the college magazine even the students though chafing under it could not but acknowledge its justice the other universities had adopted such a rule and wayne must fall in line the objections to summer ballplaying were not few and the particular one was that it affected the amateur standing of the college player he became open to charges of professionalism at least all his expenses were paid and it was charged that usually he was paid for his services  kens first feeling when he learned this news was one of blank dismay the great varsity team wiped off the slate how place and herne would humble old wayne this year then the long hard schedule embracing thirty games at least one with every good team in the easthow would an untried green team fare against that formidable array then ken suddenly felt ashamed of a selfish glee for he was now sure of a place on the varsity  for several days nothing else was talked about by the students whenever dale or his players appeared at carlton hall they were at once surrounded by a sympathetic crowd if it was a bitter blow to the undergraduates what was it to the members of the varsity their feeling showed in pale stern faces it was reported about the campus that murray and arthurs and dale with the whole team went to the directors of the athletic faculty and besought them to change or modify the decision both the trainer and the coach who had brought such glory to the university threatened to resign their places the disgrace of a pitiably weak team of freshmen being annihilated by minor colleges was eloquently put before the directors but the decision was final  one evening early in february worry arthurs called upon ken his face was long and his mustache drooped  kid what do you think of em fatheads on the faculty queerin my team he asked best team i ever developed say but the way they could work the hitandrun game any man on the team could hit to right field when there was a runner goin down from first  maybe things will turn out all right suggested ken hopefully  worry regarded his youthful sympathizer with scorn  it takes two years to teach most college kids the rudiments of baseball look at this years schedule worry produced a card and waved it at ken the hardest schedule wayne ever had and ive got to play a kid team  ken was afraid to utter any more of his hopes and indeed he felt them to be visionary  the call for candidates goes out tomorrow went on the coach ill bet therell be a mob at the cage every fool kid in the university will think hes sure of a place now ward what have you played  everywhere but infield mostly  every kid has played the whole game what position have you played most  third base  good youve the arm for that well im anxious to see you work but dont exert yourself in the cage this is a tip see ill be busy weedin out the bunch and wont have time until we get out on the field you can run around the track every day get your wind and your legs right hold in on your arm the cage is cold ive seen many a good wing go to the bad there but your chance looks good college baseball is different from any other kind you might say its played with the heart ive seen youngsters go in through grit and spirit love of playin for their college and beat out fellows who were their superiors physically well goodnight say theres one more thing i forgot it are you up in your subjects  i surely am replied ken ive had four months of nothing but study  the reason i ask is this that faculty has made another rule the oneyear residence rule they call it you have to pass your exams get your first year over before you can represent any athletic club so in case i can use you on the team you would have to go up for your exams two months or more ahead of time that scare you  not a bit i could pass mine right now answered ken confidently  kid you and me are goin to get along well goodnight and dont forget what i said  ken was too full for utterance he could scarcely mumble goodnight to the coach he ran upstairs three steps to the jump and when he reached his room he did a war dance and ended by standing on his head when he had gotten rid of his exuberance he sat down at once to write to his brother hal about it and also his forestranger friend dick leslie with whom he had spent an adventurous time the last summer  at carlton hall next day ken saw a crowd of students before the bulletinboard and edging in he read the following notice                         baseball    call for candidates for the varsity baseball team    the athletic directors of the university earnestly   request every student who can play ball or who   thinks he can to present himself to coach arthurs   at the cage on feb 3rd    there will be no freshman team this year and a   new team entirely will be chosen for the varsity   every student will have a chance applicants are   requested to familiarize themselves with the new   eligibility rules     v  the cage   ken ward dug down into his trunk for his old baseball suit and donned it with strange elation it was dirty and torn and the shoes that went with it were worn out but ken was thinking of what hard ballplaying they represented he put his overcoat on over his sweater took up his glove and sallied forth  a thin coating of ice and snow covered the streets winter still whistled in the air to ken in his eagerness spring seemed a long way off on his way across the campus he saw strings of uniformed boys making for grant field and many wearing sweaters over their everyday clothes the cage was situated at one end of the field apart from the other trainingquarters when ken got there he found a mob of players crowding to enter the door of the big barnlike structure others were hurrying away near the door a man was taking up tickets like a doorkeeper of a circus and he kept shouting get your certificates from the doctor every player must pass a physical examination get your certificates  ken turned somewhat in disgust at so much red tape and he jostled into a little fellow almost knocking him over  wull why dont you fall all over me growled this amiable individual for two cents id hand you one  the apology on kens lips seemed to halt of its own accord  sorry i havent any change in these clothes returned ken he saw a wiry chap older than he was but much smaller and of most aggressive front he had round staring eyes a protruding jaw and his mouth turned down at the corners he wore a disreputable uniform and a small green cap over one ear  aw dont get funny he replied  ken moved away muttering to himself that fellows a grouch much to his amazement when he got to the traininghouse ken found that he could not get inside because so many players were there ahead of him after waiting an hour or more he decided he could not have his physical examination at that time and he went back to the cage the wide door was still blocked with players but at the other end of the building ken found an entrance he squeezed into a crowd of students and worked forward until stopped by a railing  ken was all eyes and breathless with interest the cage was a huge open airy room lighted by many windows and with the exception of the platform where he stood it was entirely enclosed by heavy netting the floor was of bare ground well raked and loosened to make it soft this immense hall was full of a motley crowd of aspiring ballplayers  worry arthurs with his head sunk in the collar of his overcoat and his shoulders hunched up as if he was about to spring upon something paced up and down the rear end of the cage behind him a hundred or more players in line slowly marched toward the slab of rubber which marked the batting position ken remembered that the celebrated coach always tried out new players at the bat first it was his belief that batting won games  bunt one and hit one he yelled to the batters  from the pitchers box a lanky individual was trying to locate the plate ken did not need a second glance to see that this fellow was no pitcher  stop posin and pitch yelled arthurs  one by one the batters faced the plate swung valiantly or wildly at balls and essayed bunts few hit the ball out and none made a creditable bunt after their turn at bat they were ordered to the other end of the cage where they fell over one another trying to stop the balls that were hit every few moments the coach would yell for one of them any one to take a turn at pitching ken noticed that arthurs gave a sharp glance at each new batter and one appeared to be sufficient more and more ambitious players crowded into the cage until there were so many that batted balls rarely missed hitting some one  presently ken ward awoke from his thrilling absorption in the scene to note another side of it the students around him were making game of the players  what a bunch  look at that fuzzy gosling with the yellow pants  keep your shanks out of the way freshie  couldnt hit a balloon  whenever a batter hit a ball into the crowd of dodging players down the cage these students howled with glee ken discovered that he was standing near captain dale and other members of the barred varsity  say dale how do the candidates shape up asked a student  this is a disgrace to wayne declared dale bitterly i never saw such a mob of spindlelegged kids in my life look at them scared to death that fellow never swung at a ball beforethat one never heard of a buntthey throw like girlsoh this is sickening fellows i see where worry goes to his grave this year and old wayne gets humbled by onehorse colleges  ken took one surprised glance at the captain he had admired so much and then he slipped farther over in the crowd perhaps dale had spoken truth yet somehow it jarred upon kens sensitive nature the thing that affected ken most was the earnestness of the uniformed boys trying their best to do well before the great coach some were timid uncertain others were rash and overzealous many a ball cracked off a players knee or wrist and more than once ken saw a bloody finger it was cold in the cage even an ordinarily hit ball must have stung the hands and the way a hard grounder cracked was enough to excite sympathy among those scornful spectators if nothing more but they yelled in delight at every fumble at everything that happened ken kept whispering to himself i cant see the fun in it i cant  arthurs dispensed with the bunting and ordered one hit each for the batters step up and hit he ordered hoarsely dont be afraidnever mind that crowdstep into the ball and swing natural next hurry boys  suddenly a deepchested student yelled out with a voice that drowned every other sound  hard luck worry no use youll never find a hitter among those misfits  the coach actually leaped up in his anger and his face went from crimson to white ken thought it was likely that he recognized the voice  you knocker you knocker he cried thats a fine college spirit aint it youre a fine lot of students i dont think now shut up every one of you or ill fire you out of the cage and right here at the start you knockers take this from meill find more than one hitter among those kids  a little silence fell while the coach faced that antagonistic crowd of spectators ken was amazed the second time and now because of the intensity of feeling that seemed to hang in the air ken felt a warm rush go over him and that moment added greatly to his already strong liking for worry arthurs  then the coach turned to his work the batting began again and the crack of the ball the rush of feet the sharp cries of the players mingled once more with the laughter and caustic wit of the unsympathetic audience  ken ward went back to his room without having removed his overcoat he was thoughtful that night and rebellious against the attitude of the student body a morning paper announced the fact that over three hundred candidates had presented themselves to coach arthurs it went on to say that the baseball material represented was not worth considering and that old waynes varsity team must be ranked with those of the fifthrate colleges this following kens experience at the cage on the first day made him angry and then depressed the glamour of the thing seemed to fade away ken lost the glow the exhilaration of his first feelings everybody took a hopeless view of waynes baseball prospects ken ward however was not one to stay discouraged long and when he came out of his gloom it was with his fighting spirit roused once and for all he made up his mind to work heart and soul for his college to be loyal to arthurs to hope and believe in the future of the new varsity whether or not he was lucky enough to win a place upon it  next day going early to the trainingquarters he took his place in a squad waiting for the physical examination it was a wearisome experience at length kens turn came with two other players one of whom he recognized as the sourcomplexioned fellow of the day before  wull youre pretty fresh he said to ken as they went in he had a most exasperating manner  say i dont like you a whole lot retorted ken  then a colored attendant ushered them into a large room in which were several men the boys were stripped to the waist  come here murray said the doctor theres some use in looking these boys over particularly this husky youngster  a tall man in a white sweater towered over ken it was the famous trainer he ran his hands over kens smooth skin and felt of the muscles  can you run he asked  yes replied ken  are you fast  yes  further inquiries brought from ken his name age weight that he had never been ill had never used tobacco or intoxicating drinks  ward eh peg ward said murray smiling worry arthurs has the call on youelse my boy id whisper football in your ear mebbe i will anyhow if you keep up in your studies thatll do for you  kens companions also won praise from the trainer they gave their names as raymond and weir the former weighed only one hundred and twentytwo but he was a knot of muscles the other stood only five feet but he was very broad and heavy his remarkably compact build giving an impression of great strength both replied in the negative to the inquiries as to use of tobacco or spirits  boys thats what we like to hear said the doctor you three ought to pull together  ken wondered what the doctor would have said if he had seen the way these three boys glared at each other in the dressingroom and he wondered too what was the reason for such open hostility the answer came to him in the thought that perhaps they were both trying for the position he wanted on the varsity most likely they had the same idea about him that was the secret of little raymonds pugnacious front and weirs pompous air and ken realized that the same reason accounted for his own attitude toward them he wanted very much to tell raymond that he was a little grouch and weir that he looked like a puffedup toad all the same ken was not blind to weirs handsome appearance the sturdy youngster had an immense head a great shock of bright brown hair flashing gray eyes and a clear bronze skin  theyll both make the team ill bet thought ken they look it i hope i dont have to buck against them then as they walked toward the cage ken forced himself to ask genially raymond whatre you trying for and you weir  wull if its any of your fresh business im not trying for any place im going to play infield you can carry my bat replied raymond sarcastically  much obliged retorted ken im not going to substitute ive a corner on that varsity infield myself  weir glanced at them with undisguised disdain you can save yourselves useless work by not trying for my position i intend to play infield  wull puffup now puffup growled raymond  thus the three selfappointed stars of the varsity bandied words among themselves as they crossed the field at the cage door they became separated to mingle with the pushing crowd of excited boys in uniforms  by dint of much squeezing and shoulderwork ken got inside the cage he joined the squad in the upper end and got in line for the batting worry arthurs paced wildly to and fro yelling for the boys to hit a dense crowd of students thronged the platform and laughed jeered and stormed at the players the cage was in such an uproar that arthurs could scarcely be heard watching from the line ken saw weir come to bat and stand aggressively and hit the ball hard it scattered the flock of fielders then raymond came along and batting lefthanded did likewise arthurs stepped forward and said something to both after kens turn at bat the coach said to him get out of here go run round the track do it every day dont come back until monday  as ken hurried out he saw and felt the distinction with which he was regarded by the many players whom he crowded among in passing when he reached the track he saw weir raymond and half a dozen other fellows going round at a jogtrot weir was in the lead setting the pace ken fell in behind  the track was the famous quartermile track upon which murray trained his sprinters when ken felt the spring of the cinderpath in his feet the sensation of buoyancy the eager wildfire pride that flamed over him he wanted to break into headlong flight the first turn around the track was delight the second pleasure in his easy stride the third brought a realization of distance when ken had trotted a mile he was not tired he still ran easily but he began to appreciate that his legs were not wings the end of the second mile found him sweating freely and panting  two miles were enough for the first day ken knew it and he began to wonder why the others especially weir did not know it but weir jogged on his head up his hair flying as if he had not yet completed his first quarter the other players stretched out behind him ken saw raymonds funny little green cap bobbing up and down and it made him angry why could not the grouch get a decent cap anyway  at the end of the third mile ken began to labor his feet began to feel weighted his legs to ache his side to hurt he was wringing wet his skin burned his breath whistled but he kept doggedly on it had become a contest now ken felt instinctively that every runner would not admit he had less staying power than the others ken declared to himself that he could be as bullheaded as any of them still to see weir jogging on steady and strong put a kind of despair on ken for every lap of the fourth mile a runner dropped out and at the half of the fifth only weir raymond and ken kept to the track  ken hung on gasping at every stride he was afraid his heart would burst the pain in his side was as keen as a knife thrust his feet were lead every rod he felt must be his last yet spurred on desperately and he managed to keep at the heels of the others it might kill him but he would not stop until he dropped raymond was wagging along ready to fall any moment and weir was trotting slowly with head down on the last lap of the fifth mile they all stopped as by one accord raymond fell on the grass ken staggered to a bench and weir leaned hard against the fence they were all blowing like porpoises and regarded each other as mortal enemies weir gazed grandly at the other two raymond glowered savagely at him and then at ken and ken in turn gave them withering glances without a word the three contestants for a place on the varsity then went their several ways     vi  out on the field   when ken presented himself at the cage on the following monday it was to find that arthurs had weeded out all but fifty of the candidates every afternoon for a week the coach put these players through batting and sliding practice then ordered them out to run around the track on the next monday only twentyfive players were left and as the number narrowed down the work grew more strenuous the rivalry keener and the tempers of the boys more irascible  ken discovered it was work and not by any means pleasant work he fortified himself by the thought that the pleasure and glory the real play was all to come as a reward worry arthurs drove them relentlessly nothing suited him not a player knew how to hold a bat to stand at the plate to slide right or to block a ground ball  dont hit with your left hand on topunless youre lefthanded dont grip the end of the bat there hold steady now step out and into the ball and swing clean and level if youre afraid of bein hit by the ball get out of here  it was plain to ken that not the least of arthurs troubles was the incessant gibing of the students on the platform there was always a crowd watching the practice noisy scornful abusive they would never recover from the shock of having that seasoned champion varsity barred out of athletics every once in a while one of them would yell out wait worry oh worry wait till the old varsity plays your yanigans and every time the coachs face would burn but he had ceased to talk back to the students besides the athletic directors were always present they mingled with the candidates and talked baseball to them and talked to arthurs some of them might have played ball once but they did not talk like it their advice and interference served only to make the coachs task harder  another monday found only twenty players in the squad that day arthurs tried out catchers pitchers and infielders he had them all throwing running fielding working like trojans they would jump at his yell dive after the ball fall over it throw it anywhere but in the right direction run wild and fight among themselves the everflowing ridicule from the audience was anything but a stimulus so much of it coming from the varsity and their adherents kept continually in the minds of the candidates their lack of skill their unworthiness to represent the great university in such a popular sport as baseball so that even if there were latent ability in any of the candidates no one but the coach could see it and often he could not conceal his disgust and hopelessness  battin practice he ordered sharply two hits and a bunt today get a start on the bunt and dig for first hustle now  he placed one player to pitch to the hitters another to catch and as soon as the hitters had their turn they took to fielding two turns for each at bat left the coach more than dissatisfied  youre all afraid of the ball he yelled this aint no dodgin game duck your nut if the balls goin to hit you but stop lookin for it forget it another turn now im goin to umpire lets see if you know the difference between a ball and a strike  he changed the catcher and ordering ken to the pitchers box he stepped over behind him peg he said speaking low youre not tryin for pitcher i know but youve got speed and control and i want you to peg em a few mind now easy with your arm by that i mean hold in dont whip it and you peg em as near where i say as you can see  as the players one after another faced the box the coach kept saying to ken drive that fellow away from the plate give this one a low ball now straight over the pan say peg youve got a nice ball there put a fast one under this fellows chin  another turn now boys he yelled i tell youstand up to the plate then he whispered to ken hit every one of em peg em now any place  hit them asked ken amazed  thats what i said  butmr arthurs  see here peg dont talk back to me do as i say well peg a little nerve into this bunch now ill go back of the plate and make a bluff  arthurs went near to the catchers position then he said now fellows wards pretty wild and ive told him to speed up a few stand right up and step into em  the first batter was weir ken swung easily and let drive straight as a string the ball sped for the batter like a flash he dropped flat in the dust and the ball just grazed him it was a narrow escape weir jumped up his face flaring his hair on end and he gazed hard at ken before picking up the bat  batter up ordered the coach do you think thiss a teaparty  weir managed by quick contortions to get through his time at bat without being hit three players following him were not so lucky  didnt i say he was wild yelled the coach batter up now  the next was little raymond he came forward cautiously eying ken with disapproval ken could not resist putting on a little more steam and the wind of the first ball whipped off raymonds green cap raymond looked scared and edged away from the plate and as the second ball came up he stepped wide with his left foot  step into the ball said the coach dont pull away step in or youll never hit  the third ball cracked low down on raymonds leg  ohohoh he howled beginning to hop and hobble about the cage  next batter called out arthurs  and so it went on until the most promising player in the cage came to bat this was graves a lighthaired fellow tall built like a wedge he had more confidence than any player in the squad and showed up well in all departments of the game moreover he was talky aggressive and more inclined to be heard and felt he stepped up and swung his bat at ken  you wild freshman if you hit me he cried  ken ward had not fallen in love with any of his rivals for places on the team but he especially did not like graves he did not stop to consider the reason of it at the moment still he remembered several tricks graves had played and he was not altogether sorry for the coachs order swinging a little harder ken threw straight at graves  wham the ball struck him fair on the hip limping away from the plate he shook his fist at ken  batter up yelled arthurs a little more speed now peg you see it aint nothin to get hit why thats in the game it dont hurt much i never cared when i used to get hit batter up  ken sent up a very fast ball on the outside of the plate the batter swung wide and the ball tipping the bat glanced to one side and struck arthurs in the stomach with a deep sound  arthurs round face went red he gurgled and gasped for breath he was sinking to his knees when the yelling and crowing of the students on the platform straightened him up he walked about a few minutes then ordered sliding practice  the slidingboard was brought out it was almost four feet wide and twenty long and covered with carpet  run hard boys and dont let up just before you slide keep your speed and dive now at it  a line of players formed down the cage the first one dashed forward and plunged at the board hitting it with a bang the carpet was slippery and he slid off and rolled in the dust the second player leaped forward and sliding too soon barely reached the board one by one the others followed  run fast now yelled the coach dont flinch go down hard and slide light on your hands keep your heads up slide  this feature of cagework caused merriment among the onlookers that slidingboard was a wonderful and treacherous thing most players slid off it as swift as a rocket arthurs kept them running so fast and so close together that at times one would shoot off the board just as the next would strike it they sprawled on the ground rolled over and rooted in the dust one skinned his nose on the carpet another slid the length of the board on his ear all the time they kept running and sliding the coach shouted to them and the audience roared with laughter but it was no fun for the sliders raymond made a beautiful slide and graves was good but all the others were ludicrous  it was a happy day for ken and for all the candidates when the coach ordered them out on the field this was early in march the sun was bright the frost all out of the ground and a breath of spring was in the air how different it was from the cold gloomy cage then the mocking students although more in evidence than before were confined to the stands and bleachers and could not so easily be heard but the presence of the regular varsity team practising at the far end of grant field had its effect on the untried players  the coach divided his players into two nines and had them practise batting first then fielding and finally started them in a game with each candidate playing the position he hoped to make on the varsity  it was a weird game the majority of the twenty candidates displayed little knowledge of baseball schoolboys on the commons could have beaten them they were hooted and hissed by the students and before half the innings were played the bleachers and stands were empty that was what old waynes students thought of arthurs candidates  in sharp contrast to most of them weir raymond and graves showed they had played the game somewhere weir at shortstop covered ground well but he could not locate first base raymond darted here and there quick as a flash and pounced upon the ball like a huge frog nothing got past him but he juggled the ball graves was a finished and beautiful fielder he was easy sure yet fast and his throw from third to first went true as a line  gravess fine work accounted for ken wards poor showing both were trying for third base and when ken once saw his rival play out on the field he not only lost heart and became confused but he instinctively acknowledged that graves was far his superior after all his hopes and the kind interest of the coach it was a most bitter blow ken had never played so poor a game the ball blurred in his tearwet eyes and looked double he did not field a grounder he muffed foul flies and missed thrown balls it did not occur to him that almost all of the players around him were in the same boat he could think of nothing but the dashing away of his hopes what was the use of trying but he kept trying and the harder he tried the worse he played at the bat he struck out fouled out never hit the ball square at all graves got two wellplaced hits to right field then when ken was in the field graves would come down the coaching line and talk to him in a voice no one else could hear  youve got a swell chance to make this team you have not third base is my job freshie why you towhead you couldnt play marbles you butterfinger cant you stop anything you cant even play sub on this team remember ward i said id get you for hitting me that day you hit me with a potato once too ill chase you off this team  for once kens spirit was so crushed and humbled that he could not say a word to his rival he even felt he deserved it all when the practice ended and he was walking off the field with hanging head trying to bear up under the blow he met arthurs  hello peg said the coach im going your way  ken walked along feeling arthurs glance upon him but he was ashamed to raise his head  peg you were up in the air todayway offyou lost your nut  he spoke kindly and put his hand on kens arm ken looked up to see that the coachs face was pale and tired with the characteristic worried look more marked than usual  yes i was replied ken impulsively i can play better than i did todaybutmr arthurs im not in gravess class as a thirdbaseman i know it  ken said it bravely though there was a catch in his voice the coach looked closely at him  so youre sayin a good word for graves pluggin his game  id love to make the team but old wayne must have the best players you can get  peg i said once you and me were goin to get along i said also that college baseball is played with the heart you lost your heart so did most of the kids well it aint no wonder thiss a tryin time im playin them against each other and no fellow knows where hes at now ive seen all along that you werent a natural infielder i played you at third today to get that idea out of your head tomorrow ill try you in the outfield you aint no quitter peg  ken hurried to his room under the stress of a complete revulsion of feeling his liking for the coach began to grow into something more it was strange to ken what power a few words from arthurs had to renew his will and hope and daring how different arthurs was when not on the field there he was stern and sharp ken could not study that night and he slept poorly his revival of hope did not dispel his nervous excitement  he went out into grant field next day fighting himself when in the practice arthurs assigned him to a rightfield position he had scarcely taken his place when he became conscious of a queer inclination to swallow often of a numbing tight band round his chest he could not stand still his hands trembled there was a mist before his eyes his mind was fixed upon himself and upon the other five outfielders trying to make the team he saw the players in the infield pace their positions restlessly run without aim when the ball was hit or thrown collide with each other let the ball go between their hands and legs throw wildly and sometimes stand as if transfixed when they ought to have been in action but all this was not significant to ken he saw everything that happened but he thought only that he must make a good showing he must not miss any flies or let a ball go beyond him he absolutely must do the right thing the air of grant field was charged with intensity of feeling and ken thought it was all his own his baseball fortune was at stake and he worked himself in such a frenzy that if a ball had been batted in his direction he might not have seen it at all fortunately none came his way  the first time at bat he struck out ignominiously poking weakly at the pitchers outcurves the second time he popped up a little fly on the next trial the umpire called him out on strikes at his last chance ken was desperate he knew the coach placed batting before any other department of the game almost sick with the torture of the conflicting feelings ken went up to the plate and swung blindly to his amaze he cracked a hard fly to leftcentre far between the fielders like a startled deer ken broke into a run he turned first base and saw that he might stretch the hit into a threebagger he knew he could run and never had he so exerted himself second base sailed under him and he turned in line for the third watching graves he saw him run for the base and stand ready to catch the throwin  without slacking his speed in the least ken leaped into the air headlong for the base he heard the crack of the ball as it hit gravess glove then with swift scrape on hands and breast he was sliding in the dust he stopped suddenly as if blocked by a stone wall something hard struck him on the head a blinding light within his brain seemed to explode into glittering slivers a piercing pain shot through him then from darkness and a great distance sounded a voice  ward i said id get you     vii  annihilation   that incident put ken out of the practice for three days he had a bruise over his ear as large as a small apple ken did not mind the pain nor the players remarks that he had a swelled head anyway but he remembered with slowgathering wrath gravess words i said id get you  he remembered also gravess reply to a question put by the coach i was only tagging him i didnt mean to hurt him that rankled inside ken he kept his counsel however even evading a sharp query put by arthurs and as much as it was possible he avoided the thirdbaseman  hard practice was the order of every day and most of it was batting the coach kept at the candidates everlastingly and always his cry was toe the plate left foot a little forward step into the ball and swing at the bat ken made favorable progress because the coach was always there behind him with encouraging words in the field however he made a mess of it and grew steadily worse  the directors of the athletic association had called upon the old varsity to go out and coach the new aspirants for college fame the varsity had refused even the players of preceding years what few were in or near the city had declined to help develop waynes stripling team but some of the older graduates among them several of the athletic directors appeared on the field when arthurs saw them he threw up his hands in rage and despair that afternoon ken had three wellmeaning but oldfashioned ballplayers coach him in the outfield he had them one at a time which was all that saved him from utter distraction one told him to judge a fly by the sound when the ball was hit another told him to play in close and when the ball was batted to turn and run with it the third said he must play deep and sprint in for the fly then each had different ideas as to how batters should be judged about throwing to bases about backing up the other fielders kens bewilderment grew greater and greater he had never heard of things they advocated and he began to think he did not know anything about the game and what made his condition of mind border on imbecility was a hurried whisper from arthurs between innings peg dont pay the slightest attention to em fathead grad coaches  practice days succeeding that were worse nightmares to ken ward than the days he had spent in constant fear of the sophomores it was a terribly feverish time of batting balls chasing balls and of having dinned into his ears thousands of orders rules of play talks on college spirit in athleticsall of which conflicted so that it was meaningless to him during this dark time one ray of light was the fact that arthurs never spoke a sharp word to him ken felt vaguely that he was whirling in some kind of a college athletic chaos out of which he would presently emerge  toward the close of march the weather grew warm the practice field dried up and baseball should have been a joy to ken but it was not at times he had a shameful wish to quit the field for good but he had not the courage to tell the coach the twentyfifth the day scheduled for the game with the disgraced varsity team loomed closer and closer its approach was a fearful thing for ken every day he cast furtive glances down the field to where the varsity held practice ken had nothing to say he was as glum as most of the other candidates but he had heard gossip in the lecturerooms in the halls on the street everywhere and it concerned this game what would the old varsity do to arthurs new team curiosity ran as high as the feeling toward the athletic directors resentment flowed from every source ken somehow got the impression that he was blamable for being a member of the coachs green squad so ken ward fluctuated between two fears one as bad as the otherthat he would not be selected to play and the other that he would be selected it made no difference he would be miserable if not chosen and if he washow on earth would he be able to keep his knees from wobbling then the awful day dawned  coach arthurs met all his candidates at the cage he came late he explained because he wanted to keep them off the field until time for practice today he appeared more grave than worried and where the boys expected a severe lecture he simply said ill play as many of you as i can do your best thats all dont mind what these old players say they were kids once though they seem to have forgotten it try to learn from them  it was the first time the candidates had been taken upon the regular diamond of grant field ken had peeped in there once to be impressed by the beautiful level playground and especially the magnificent turreted grandstand and the great sweeping stretches of bleachers then they had been empty now with four thousand noisy students and thousands of other spectators besides they stunned him he had never imagined a crowd coming to see the game  perhaps arthurs had not expected it either for ken heard him mutter grimly to himself he ordered practice at once and called off the names of those he had chosen to start the game as one in a trance ken ward found himself trotting out to right field  a longrolling murmur that was half laugh half taunt rose from the stands then it quickly subsided from his position ken looked for the players of the old varsity but they had not yet come upon the field of the few balls batted to ken in practice he muffed only one and he was just beginning to feel that he might acquit himself creditably when the coach called the team in arthurs had hardly given his new players time enough to warm up but likewise they had not had time to make any fumbles  all at once a hoarse roar rose from the stands then a thundering clatter of thousands of feet as the students greeted the appearance of the old varsity it was applause that had in it all the feeling of the undergraduates for the championship team many of whom they considered had been unjustly barred by the directors love loyalty sympathy resentmentall pealed up to the skies in that acclaim it rolled out over the heads of arthurs shrinking boys as they huddled together on the bench  ken ward for one was flushing and thrilling in that moment he lost his gloom he watched the varsity come trotting across the field a doughty band of baseball warriors each wore a sweater with the huge white w shining like a star many of those players had worn that honored varsity letter for three years it did seem a shame to bar them from this seasons team ken found himself thinking of the matter from their point of view and his sympathy was theirs  more than that he gloried in the look of them in the trained springy strides in the lithe erect forms in the assurance in every move every detail of that practice photographed itself upon ken wards memory and he knew he would never forget  there was dale veteran player captain and pitcher of the nine hero of victories over place and herne there was hogan catcher for three seasons a muscular fellow famed for his snapthrow to the bases and his fiendish chasing of foul flies there was hickle the great firstbaseman whom the professional leagues were trying to get what a reach he had how easily he scooped in the ball low high wide it made no difference to him there was canton at second hollis at short burns at third who had been picked for the last years allamerican college team then there was dreer brightest star of all the fleet hardhitting centrefielder this player particularly fascinated ken it was a beautiful sight to see him run the ground seemed to fly behind him when the ball was hit high he wheeled with his back to the diamond and raced out suddenly to turn with unerring judgmentand the ball dropped into his hands on low line hits he showed his fleetness for he was like a gleam of light in his forward dash and however the ball presented shoulder high low by his knees or on a short bound he caught it ken ward saw with despairing admiration what it meant to be a great outfielder  then arthurs called play ball giving the old varsity the field  with a violent start ken ward came out of his rhapsody he saw a white ball tossed on the diamond dale received it from one of the fielders and took his position in the pitchers box the uniform set off his powerful form there was something surly and grimly determined in his face he glanced about to his players as if from long habit and called out gruffly get in the game fellows no runs for this scrub outfit then with longpractised swing he delivered the ball it travelled plateward swift as the flight of a white swallow the umpire called it a strike on weir the same on the next pitch the third was wide weir missed the fourth and was out raymond followed on the batting list today as he slowly stepped toward the plate seemingly smaller and glummer than ever it was plain he was afraid the bleachers howled at the little green cap sticking over his ear raymond did not swing at the ball he sort of reached out his bat at the first three pitches stepping back from the plate each time the yell that greeted his weak attempt seemed to shrivel him up also it had its effect on the youngsters huddling around arthurs graves went up and hit a feeble grounder to dale and was thrown out at first  ken knew the halfinning was over he saw the varsity players throw aside their gloves and trot in but either he could not rise or he was glued to the bench then arthurs pulled him up saying watch sharp peg these fellows are rightfield hitters at the words all kens blood turned to ice he ran out into the field fighting the coldest most sickening sensation he ever had in his life the ice in his veins all went to the pit of his stomach and there formed into a heavy lump other times when he had been frightened flitted through his mind it had been bad when he fought with greaser and worse when he ran with the outlaws in pursuit and the forest fire was appalling but ken felt he would gladly have changed places at that moment he dreaded the mocking bleachers  of the candidates chosen to play against the varsity ken knew mccord at first raymond at second weir at short graves at third he did not know even the names of the others all of them except graves appeared too young to play in that game  dreer was first up for the varsity and ken shivered all over when the lithe centrefielder stepped to the left side of the plate ken went out deeper for he knew most hardhitting lefthanders hit to right field but dreer bunted the first ball teasingly down the thirdbase line fleet as a deer he was across the bag before the infielder reached the ball hollis was next up on the first pitch as dreer got a fast start for second hollis bunted down the firstbase line pitcher and baseman ran for the bunt hollis was safe and the sprinting dreer went to third without even drawing a throw a long pealing yell rolled over the bleachers dale sent coaches to the coaching lines hickle big and formidable hurried to the plate swinging a long bat he swung it as if he intended to knock the ball out of the field when the pitcher lifted his arm dreer dashed for homebase and seemed beating the ball but hickle deftly dumped it down the line and broke for first while dreer scored this bunt was not fielded at all how the bleachers roared then followed bunts in rapid succession dashes for first and slides into the bag the pitcher interfered with the thirdbaseman and the firstbaseman ran up the line and the pitcher failed to cover the bag and the catcher fell all over the ball every varsity man bunted but in just the place where it was not expected they raced around the bases they made long runs from first to third they were like flashes of light slippery as eels the bewildered infielders knew they were being played with the taunting boohoos and screams of delight from the bleachers were as demoralizing as the illusively daring runners closer and closer the infielders edged in until they were right on top of the batters then dale and his men began to bunt little infield flies over the heads of their opponents the merry audience cheered wildly but graves and raymond ran back and caught three of these little pop flies thus retiring the side the old varsity had made six runs on nothing but deliberate bunts and daring dashes around the bases  ken hurried in to the bench and heard some one call out ward up  he had forgotten he would have to bat stepping to the plate was like facing a cannon one of the players yelled here he is dale heres the potatopegger knock his block off  the cry was taken up by other players peg him dale peg him dale and then the bleachers got it kens dry tongue seemed pasted to the roof of his mouth this dale in baseball clothes with the lowering frown was not like the dale ken had known suddenly he swung his arm kens quick eye caught the dark shooting gleam of the ball involuntarily he ducked strike called the umpire then dale had not tried to hit him ken stepped up again the pitcher whirled slowly this time turning with long easy motion and threw underhand the ball sailed floated soared long before it reached ken it had fooled him completely he chopped at it vainly the next ball pitched came up swifter but just before it crossed the plate it seemed to stop as if pulled back by a string and then dropped down ken fell to his knees trying to hit it  the next batters attempts were not as awkward as kens still they were as futile as ken sat wearily down upon the bench he happened to get next to coach arthurs he expected some sharp words from the coach he thought he deserved anything but they were not forthcoming the coach put his hand on kens knee when the third batter fouled to hickle and ken got up to go out to the field he summoned courage to look at arthurs something in his face told ken what an ordeal this was he divined that it was vastly more than business with worry arthurs  peg watch out this time whispered the coach theyll line em at you this inninglike bullets now try hard wont you just try  ken knew from arthurs look more than his words that trying was all that was left for the youngsters the varsity had come out early in the spring and they had practised to get into condition to annihilate this new team practically chosen by the athletic directors and they had set out to make the game a farce but arthurs meant that all the victory was not in winning the game it was left for his boys to try in the face of certain defeat to try with all their hearts to try with unquenchable spirit it was the spirit that counted not the result the old varsity had received a bitter blow they were aggressive and relentless the students and supporters of old wayne idolizing the great team always bearing in mind the hot rivalry with place and herne were unforgiving and intolerant of an undeveloped varsity perhaps neither could be much blamed but it was for the new players to show what it meant to them the greater the prospect of defeat the greater the indifference or hostility shown them the more splendid their opportunity for it was theirs to try for old wayne to try to fight and never to give up  ken caught fire with the flame of that spirit  boys come on he cried in his piercing tenor they cant beat us trying  as he ran out into the field members of the varsity spoke to him you greenbacked freshman shut up you scrub  im not a varsity hasbeen retorted ken hurrying out to his position  the first man up a lefthander rapped a hard twisting liner to right field ken ran toward deep centre with all his might the ball kept twisting and curving it struck squarely in kens hands and bounced out and rolled far when he recovered it the runner was on third base before ken got back to his position the second batter hit hard through the infield toward right the ball came skipping like a fiendish rabbit ken gritted his teeth and went down on his knees to get the bounding ball full in his breast but he stopped it scrambled for it and made the throw in dale likewise hit in his direction a slow low fly difficult to judge ken overran it and the hit gave dale two bases ken realized that the varsity was now executing worry arthurs famous rightfield hitting the sudden knowledge seemed to give ken the blindstaggers the field was in a haze the players blurred in his sight he heard the crack of the ball and saw raymond dash over and plunge down then the ball seemed to streak out of the grass toward him and as he bent over it missed his hands and cracked on his shin again he fumbled wildly for it and made the throw in the pain roused his rage he bit his lips and called to himself ill stop them if it kills me  dreer lined the ball over his head for a homerun hollis made a bid for a threebagger but ken by another hard sprint knocked the ball down hickle then batted up a tremendously high fly it went far beyond ken and he ran and ran it looked like a small pinpoint of black up in the sky then he tried to judge it to get under it the white sky suddenly glazed over and the ball wavered this way and that ken lost it in the sun found it again and kept on running would it never come down he had not reached it he had run beyond it in an agony he lunged out and the ball fell into his hands and jumped out  then followed a fusillade of hits all between second base and first and all viciousbounding grounders to and fro ken ran managing somehow to get some portion of his anatomy in front of the ball it had become a demon to him now and he hated it his tongue was hanging out his breast was bursting his hands were numb yet he held before him the one idea to keep fiercely trying  he lost count of the runs after eleven had been scored he saw mccord and raymond trying to stem the torrent of rightfield hits but those they knocked down gave him no time to recover he blocked the grasscutters with his knees or his body and pounced upon the ball and got it away from him as quickly as possible would this rapid fire of uncertainbounding balls never stop ken was in a kind of frenzy if he only had time to catch his breath  then dreer was at bat again he fouled the first two balls over the grandstand some one threw out a brandnew ball farther and farther ken edged into deep right he knew what was coming let himhit it he panted ill try to get it this day settles me im no outfielder but ill try  the tired pitcher threw the ball and dreer seemed to swing and bound at once with the ringing crack the hit was one of his famous drives close to the rightfield foulline  ken was off with all the speed left in him he strained every nerve and was going fast when he passed the foulflag the bleachers loomed up indistinct in his sight but he thought only of meeting the ball the hit was a savage liner curving away from him cinders under his flying feet were a warning that he did not heed he was on the track he leaped into the air left hand outstretched and felt the ball strike in his glove  then all was dark in a stunning blinding crash     viii  examinations   when ken ward came fully to his senses he was being half carried and half led across the diamond to the players bench he heard worry arthurs say he aint hurt muchonly butted into the fence  ken tried manfully to entertain worrys idea about it but he was too dazed and weak to stand alone he imagined he had broken every bone in his body  did i make the catchhang to the ball he asked  no peg you didnt replied the coach kindly but you made a grand try for it  he felt worse over failing to hold the ball than he felt over half killing himself against the bleachers he spent the remainder of that nevertobeforgotten game sitting on the bench but to watch his fellowplayers try to play was almost as frightful as being back there in right field it was no consolation for ken to see his successor chasing long hits misjudging flies failing weakly on wicked grounders even graves weakened toward the close and spoiled his good beginning by miserable fumbles and throws it was complete and disgraceful rout the varsity never let up until the last man was out the team could not have played harder against place or herne arthurs called the game at the end of the sixth inning with the score 41 to 0  many beaten and despondent players had dragged themselves off grant field in bygone years but none had ever been so humiliated so crushed no player spoke a word or looked at another they walked off with bowed heads ken lagged behind the others he was still stunned and lame presently arthurs came back to help him along and did not speak until they were clear of the campus and going down kens street  im glad thats over said worry i kicked against havin the game but em fathead directors would have it now well be let alone there wont be no students comin out to the field and im blamed glad  ken was sick and smarting with pain and half crying  im sorry mr arthurs he faltered we weresosorotten  see here peg was the quick reply that cuts no ice with me it was sure the rottenest exhibition i ever seen in my life but theres excuses and you can just gamble im the old boy who knows you kids were scared to death what hurts me peg is the throwdown we got from my old team and from the students were not to blame for rules made by fathead directors i was surprised at dale he was mean and so were hollis and hickleall of em they didnt need to disgrace us like that  oh mr arthurs what players they are exclaimed ken i never saw such running such hitting you said theyd hit to right field like bullets but it was worse than bullets and dreer when he came up my heart just stopped beating  peg listen said worry three years ago when dreer came out on the field he was greener than you and hadnt half the spunk i made him what he is and i made all of emi made that team and i can make another  you are just saying that toto encourage me replied ken hopelessly i cant play ball i thought i could but i know now ill never go out on the field again  peg are you goin to throw me down too  mr arthurs ii  listen peg cut out the dumps get over em you made the varsity today understand you earned your big w you neednt mention it but ive picked you to play somewhere you werent a natural infielder and you didnt make much of a showin in the outfield but its the spirit i want today was a bad day for a youngster theres always lots of feelin about college athletics but here at wayne this year the strains awful and you fought yourself and stagefright and the ridicule of em quitter students you tried peg i never saw a gamer try you didnt fail me and after you made that desperate run and tried to smash the bleachers with your face the students shut up their guyin it made a difference peg even the varsity was a little ashamed cheer up now  ken was almost speechless he managed to mumble something at which the coach smiled in reply and then walked rapidly away ken limped to his room and took off his baseball suit the skin had been peeled from his elbow and his body showed several dark spots that ken knew would soon be blackandblue bruises his legs from his knees down bore huge lumps so sore to the touch that ken winced even at gentle rubbing but he did not mind the pain all the darkness seemed to have blown away from his mind  what a fine fellow worry is said ken how ill work for him i must write to brother hal and dick leslie to tell them ive made the varsity no not yet worry said not to mention it and now to plug ill have to take my exams before the first college game april 8th and thats not long  in the succeeding days ken was very busy with attendance at college in the mornings baseball practice in the afternoons and study at night  if worry had picked any more players for the varsity ken could not tell who they were of course graves would make the team and weir and raymond were pretty sure of places there were sixteen players for the other five positions and picking them was only guesswork it seemed to ken that some of the players showed streaks of fast playing at times and then as soon as they were opposed to one another in the practice game they became erratic his own progress was slow one thing he could do that brought warm praise from the coachhe could line the ball home from deep outfield with wonderful speed and accuracy  after the varsity had annihilated worrys kids as they had come to be known the students showed no further interest when they ceased to appear on the field the new players were able to go at their practice without being ridiculed already an improvement had been noticeable but rivalry was so keen for places and the coachs choice so deep a mystery that the contestants played under too great a tension and schoolboys could have done better  it was on the first of april that arthurs took ken up into college hall to get permission for him to present himself to the different professors for the early examinations while ken sat waiting in the office he heard arthurs talking to men he instantly took to be the heads of the athletic association they were in an adjoining room with the door open and their voices were very distinct so that ken could not help hearing  gentlemen i want my answer today said the coach  is there so great a hurry wait a little was the rejoinder  im sorry but this is april 1st and ill wait no longer im ready to send some of my boys up for early exams and i want to know where i stand  arthurs what is it exactly that you want things have been in an awful mess we know state your case and well try to give you a definite answer  i want full charge of the coachinthe handlin of the team as i always had before i dont want any grad coaches the directors seem divided one half want this the other half that theyve cut out the trainin quarters ive had no help from murray no baths or rubdowns or trainin for my candidates heres openin day a week off and i havent picked my team i want to take them to the trainintable and have them under my eye all the time if i cant have what i want ill resign if i can ill take the whole responsibility of the team on my own shoulders  very well arthurs well let you go ahead and have full charge there has been talk this year of abolishing a private traininghouse and table for this green varsity but rather than have you resign well waive that you can rest assured from now on you will not be interfered with give us the best team you can under the circumstances there has been much dissension among the directors and faculty because of our new eligibility rules it has stirred everybody up and the students are sore then there has been talk of not having a professional coach this year but we overruled that in last nights meeting were going to see what you can do i may add arthurs if you shape up a varsity this year that makes any kind of a showing against place and herne you will win the eternal gratitude of the directors who have fostered this change in athletics otherwise im afraid the balance of opinion will favor the idea of dispensing with professional coaches in the future  ken saw that arthurs was white in the face when he left the room they went out together and worry handed ken a card that read for him to take his examinations at once  are you up on em asked the coach anxiously  ii think so replied ken  well peg good luck to you go at em like you went at dreers hit  much to his amazement it was for ken to discover that now the time had come for him to face his examinations he was not at all sanguine he began to worry he forgot about the textbooks he had mastered in his room during the long winter when he feared to venture out because of the sophomores it was not very long till he had worked himself into a state somewhat akin to his trepidation in the varsity ball game then he decided to go up at once and have it done with his whole freshman year had been one long agony what a relief to have it ended  ken passed four examinations in one morning passed them swimmingly smilingly splendidly and left college hall in an ecstasy things were working out fine but he had another examination and it was in a subject he had voluntarily included in his course whatever on earth he had done it for he could not now tell the old doctor who held the chair in that department had thirty years before earned the name of crab and slowly in the succeeding years he had grown crabbier crustier so student rumor had it ken had rather liked the dry old fellow and had been much absorbed in his complex lectures but he had never been near him and now the prospect changed color foolishly ken asked a sophomore in what light old crab might regard a student who was ambitious to pass his exams early the picture painted by that sophomore would have made a flamingmouthed dragon appear tame nerving himself to the ordeal ken took his card and presented himself one evening at the doctors house  a maid ushered him into the presence of a venerable old man who did not look at all even in kens distorted sight like a crab or a dragon his ponderous brow seemed as if it had all the thought in the world behind it he looked over huge spectacles at kens card and then spoke in a dry quavering voice  umm sit down mr ward  ken found his breath and strangely lost his fear and trembling the doctor dryly asked him why he thought he knew more than the other students who were satisfied to wait months longer before examination ken hastened to explain that it was no desire of his that although he had studied hard and had not missed many lectures he knew he was unprepared then he went on to tell about the baseball situation and why he had been sent up  umm the professor held a glass paperweight up before ken and asked a question about it next he held out a ruler and asked something about that and also a bottle of ink following this he put a few queries about specific gravity atomic weight and the like then he sat thrumming his desk and appeared far away in thought after a while he turned to ken with a smile that made his withered parchmentlike face vastly different  where do you play he asked  ssir stammered ken  in baseball i mean what place do you play catch thrower i dont know the names much  ken replied eagerly and then it seemed he was telling this stern old man all about baseball he wanted to know what fouls were and how to steal bases and he was nonplussed by such terms as hitandrun ken discoursed eloquently on his favorite sport and it was like a kind of dream to be there strange things were always happening to him  ive never seen a game said the professor i used to play myself long ago when we had a yarn ball and pitched underhand ill have to come out to the field some day president halstead why he likes baseball hes aawhat do you call it  a fana rooter replied ken smiling  umm i guess thats it well mr ward im glad to meet you you may go now  ken got up blushing like a girl but doctor you were toi was to be examined  ive examined you he drawled with a dry chuckle and he looked over his huge spectacles at ken ill give you a passing mark but mr ward you know a heap more about baseball than you know about physics  as ken went out he trod upon air what a splendid old fellow the sophomore had lied for that matter when had a sophomore ever been known to tell the truth but he suddenly exclaimed he himself was no longer a freshman he pondered happily on the rosy lining to his old cloud of gloom how different things appeared after a little time that old doctors smile would linger long in kens memory he felt deep remorse that he had ever misjudged him he hurried on to worry arthurs house to tell him the good news and as he walked his mind was full with the wonder of it allhis lonely wretched freshman days now forever past the slow change from hatred the dawning of some strange feeling for the college and his teachers and last the freedom the delight the quickening stir in the present     ix  president halstead on college spirit   waynes opening game was not at all what ken had dreamed it would be the opposing team from hudson school was as illassorted an aggregation as ken had ever seen they brought with them a small but noisy company of cheering supporters who to the shame of ken and his fellows had the bleachers all to themselves if any wayne students were present they either cheered for hudson or remained silent  hudson won 9 to 2 it was a game that made arthurs sag a little lower on the bench graves got waynes two tallies raymond at second played about all the game from the fielding standpoint ken distinguished himself by trying wildly and accomplishing nothing when he went to his room that night he had switched back to his former spirits and was disgusted with waynes ball team himself most of all  that was on a wednesday the next day rain prevented practice and on friday the boys were out on the field again arthurs shifted the players around trying resignedly to discover certain positions that might fit certain players it seemed to ken that all the candidates except one or two were good at fielding and throwing but when they came to play a game they immediately went into a trance  travers college was scheduled for saturday they had always turned out a good minor team but had never been known to beat wayne they shut arthurs team out without a run a handful of wayne students sat in the bleachers mocking their own team arthurs used the two pitchers he had been trying hard to develop and when they did locate the plate they were hit hard ken played or essayed to play right field for a while but he ran around like a chicken with its head off as a travers player expressed it and then arthurs told him that he had better grace the bench the rest of the game ashamed as ken was to be put out he was yet more ashamed to feel that he was glad of it hardest of all to bear was the arrogant air put on by the travers college players wayne had indeed been relegated to the fifth rank of college baseball teams  on monday announcements were made in all the lecturerooms and departments of the university and bulletins were posted to the effect that president halstead wished to address the undergraduates in the wayne auditorium on tuesday at five oclock  rumor flew about the campus and carlton club everywhere that the presidents subject would be college spirit and it was believed he would have something to say about the present condition of athletics ken ward hurried to the hall as soon as he got through his practice he found the immense auditorium packed from pit to dome and he squeezed into a seat on the steps  the students as always were exchanging volleys of paperballs matching wits singing songs and passing time merrily when president halstead entered with two of his associates he was greeted by a thunder of tongues hands and heels of the standing students he was the bestbeloved member of the university faculty a distinguished scholarly looking man wellstricken in years  he opened his address by declaring the need of college spirit in college life he defined it as the vital thing the heart of a great educational institution and he went on to speak of its dangers its fluctuations then he made direct reference to athletics in its relation to both college spirit and college life  sport is too much with us of late years i have observed a great increase in the number of athletic students and a great decrease in scholarship the fame of the halfback and the shortstop and the strokeoar has grown out of proportion to their real worth the freshman is dazzled by it the great majority of college men cannot shine in sport which is the best thing that could be the students ideal instead of being the highest scholarship the best attainment for his career is apt to be influenced by the honors and friendships that are heaped upon the great athlete this is false to university life you are here to prepare yourselves for the battle with the world and i want to state that that battle is becoming more and more intellectual the student who slights his studies for athletic glory may find himself when that glory is long past distanced in the race for success by a student who had not trained to run the hundred in ten seconds  but gentlemen to keep well up in your studies and then go in for athleticsthat is entirely another question it is not likely that any student who keeps to the front in any of the university courses will have too much time for football or baseball i am as you all know heartily in favor of all branches of college sport and that brings me to the point i want to make today baseball is my favorite game and i have always been proud of waynes teams the new eligibility rules with which you are all familiar were brought to me and after thoroughly going over the situation i approved of them certainly it is obvious to you all that a university ballplayer making himself famous here and then playing during the summer months at a resort is laying himself open to suspicion i have no doubt that many players are innocent of the taint of professionalism but unfortunately they have become members of these summer teams after being first requested then warned not to do so  waynes varsity players of last year have been barred by the directors they made their choice and so should abide by it they have had their day and so should welcome the opportunity of younger players but i am constrained to acknowledge that neither they nor the great body of undergraduates welcomed the change this more than anything proves to me the evil of championship teams the football men the baseball men the crew men and all the student supporters want to win all the games all the time i would like to ask you young gentlemen if you can take a beating if you cannot i would like to add that you are not yet fitted to go out into life a good beating occasionally is a wholesome thing  well to come to the point now i find after studying the situation that the old varsity players and undergraduates of this university have been lacking inlet us be generous and say college spirit i do not need to go into detail suffice it to say that i know i will admit however that i attended the game between the old varsity and the new candidates i sat unobserved in a corner and a more unhappy time i never spent in this university i confess that my sympathies were with the inexperienced undeveloped boys who were trying to learn to play ball put yourselves in their places say you are mostly freshmen and you make yourselves candidates for the team because you love the game and because you would love to bring honor to your college you go out and try you meet the first day an implacable team of skilled veterans who show their scorn of your poor ability their hatred of your opportunity and ride roughshodi should say run with spiked shoesover you you hear the roar of four thousand students applauding these hero veterans you hear your classmates your fellowstudents in wayne howl with ridicule at your weak attempts to compete with better stronger players gentlemen how would you feel  i said before that college spirit fluctuates if i did not know students well i would be deeply grieved at the spirit shown that day i know that the tide will turn and gentlemen would not you and the old varsity be rather in an embarrassing position ifif these raw recruits should happen to develop into a team strong enough to cope with place and herne stranger things have happened i am rather strong for the new players not because of their playing which is poor indeed but for the way they tried under peculiarly adverse conditions  that young fellow wardwhat torture that inning of successive hard hits to his territory i was near him in that end of the bleachers and i watched him closely every attempt he made was a failurethat is failure from the point of view of properly fielding the ball but gentlemen that day was not a failure for young ward it was a grand success some one said his playing was the poorest exhibition ever seen on grant field that may be i want to say that to my mind it was also the most splendid effort ever made on grant field for it was made against defeat fear ridicule it was elimination of self it was made for his coach his fellowplayers his collegethat is to say for the students who shamed themselves by scorn for his trial  young men of wayne give us a little more of such college spirit     x  new players   when practice time rolled around for ken next day he went upon the field once more with his hopes renewed and bright  i certainly do die hard he laughed to himself but i can never go down and out nownever  something seemed to ring in kens ears like peals of bells in spite of his awkwardness coach arthurs had made him a varsity man in spite of his unpreparedness old crab had given him a passing mark in spite of his unworthiness president halstead had made him famous  i surely am the lucky one said ken for the hundredth time and now im going to force my luck ken had lately revolved in his mind a persistent idea that he meant to propound to the coach  ken arrived on the field a little later than usual to find arthurs for once minus his worried look he was actually smiling and ken soon saw the reason for this remarkable change was the presence of a new player out in centre field  hello peg things are lookin up said the coach beaming thats homans out there in centreroy homans a senior and a crackerjack ballplayer i tried to get him to come out for the team last year but he wouldnt spare the time but hes goin to play this seasonsaid the presidents little talk got him hes a fast heady scientific player just the one to steady you kids  before ken could reply his attention was attracted from homans to another new player in uniform now walking up to arthurs he was tall graceful powerful had red hair keen dark eyes a cleancut profile and square jaw  ive come out to try for the team he said quietly to the coach  youre a little late aint you asked worry gruffly but he ran a shrewd glance over the lithe form  yes  must have been stirred up by that talk of president halsteads wasnt you  yes there was something quiet and easy about the stranger and ken liked him at once  where do you play went on worry  left  can you hit talk sense now and mebbe youll save me work can you hit  yes  can you throw  yes he spoke with quiet assurance  can you run almost shouted worry he was nervous and irritable those days and it annoyed him for unknown youths to speak calmly of such things  run yes a little i did the hundred last year in nine and fourfifths  what you cant kid me who are you cried worry getting red in the face ive seen you somewhere  my names ray  say not ray the intercollegiate champion  im the fellow i talked it over with murray he kicked but i didnt mind that i promised to try to keep in shape to win the sprints at the intercollegiate meet  say get out there in left field quick shouted worry peg hit him some flies lam em a mile that fellows a sprinter peg what luck it would be if he can play ball hit em at him  ken took the ball worry tossed him and picking up a bat began to knock flies out to ray the first few he made easy for the outfielder and then he hit balls harder and off to the right or left without appearing to exert himself ray got under them ken watched him and also kept the tail of his eye on worry the coach appeared to be getting excited and he ordered ken to hit the balls high and far away ken complied but he could not hit a ball over rays head he tried with all his strength he had never seen a champion sprinter and now he marvelled at the wonderful stride  oh but his running is beautiful exclaimed ken  thats enough come in here yelled worry to ray peg he makes dreer look slow i never saw as fast fieldin as that  when ray came trotting in without seeming to be even warmed up worry blurted out you aint windedafter all that must be in shape  im always in shape replied ray  pick up a bat shouted worry here duncan pitch this fellow a few speed em curve em strike him out hit himanything  ray was lefthanded and he stood up to the plate perfectly erect with his bat resting quietly on his shoulder he stepped straight swung with an even powerful swing and he hit the first ball clear over the rightfield bleachers it greatly distanced dreers hit  what a drive gasped ken  oh choked worry thats enough you neednt lose my balls bunt one now  ray took the same position and as the ball came up he appeared to drop the bat upon it and dart away at the same instant  worry seemed to be trying to control violent emotion next batter up he called hoarsely and sat down on the bench he was breathing hard and beads of sweat stood out on his brow  ken went up to worry feeling that now was the time to acquaint the coach with his new idea eager as ken was he had to force himself to take this step all the hope and dread nervousness and determination of the weeks of practice seemed to accumulate in that moment he stammered and stuttered grew speechless and then as worry looked up in kind surprise ken suddenly grew cool and earnest  mr arthurs will you try me in the box  whats that peg queried the coach sharply  will you give me a trial in the box ive wanted one all along you put me in once when we were in the cage but you made me hit the batters  pitch you peg why not why didnt i think of it im sure gettin to be like em fathead directors youve got steam peg but can you curve a ball lets see your fingers  yes i can curve a ball round a corner please give me a trial mr arthurs i failed in the infield and im little good in the outfield but i know i can pitch  the coach gave ken one searching glance then he called all the candidates in to the plate and ordered dean the stocky little catcher to don his breastprotector mask and mitt  peg said the coach dean will sign youone finger for a straight ball two for a curve  when ken walked to the box all his muscles seemed quivering and tense and he had a contraction in his throat this was his opportunity he was not unnerved as he had been when he was trying for the other positions all kens life he had been accustomed to throwing at his home he had been the only boy who could throw a stone across the river the only one who could get a ball over the highschool tower a favorite pastime had always been the throwing of small apples or walnuts or stones and he had acquired an accuracy that made it futile for his boy comrades to compete with him curving a ball had come natural to him and he would have pitched all his highschool games had it not been for the fact that no one could catch him and moreover none of the boys had found any fun in batting against him  when ken faced the first batter a feeling came over him that he had never before had on the ball field he was hot trembling hurried but this new feeling was apart from these his feet were on solid ground and his arm felt as it had always in those throwing contests where he had so easily won he seemed to decide from mccords position at the plate what to throw him  ken took his swing it was slow easy natural but the ball travelled with much greater speed than the batter expected from such motion mccord let the first two balls go by and arthurs called them both strikes then ken pitched an outcurve which mccord fanned at helplessly arthurs sent trace up next ken saw that the coach was sending up the weaker hitters first trace could not even make a foul raymond was third up and ken had to smile at the scowling secondbaseman remembering his weakness for pulling away from the plate ken threw raymond two fast curves on the outside and then a slow wide curve far out raymond could not have hit the first two with a paddle and the third lured him irresistibly out of position and made him look ridiculous he slammed his bat down and slouched to the bench duncan turned out to be the next easy victim four batters had not so much as fouled ken and ken knew he was holding himself inthat in fact he had not let out half his speed blake the next player hit up a little fly that ken caught and schoonover made the fifth man to strike out  then weir stood over the plate and he was a short sturdy batter hard to pitch to he looked as if he might be able to hit any kind of a ball ken tried him first with a straight fast one over the middle of the plate weir hit it hard but it went foul and through kens mind flashed the thought that he would pitch no more speed to weir or players who swung as he did accordingly ken tried the slow curve that had baffled raymond weir popped it up and retired in disgust  the following batter was graves who strode up smiling confident sarcastic as if he knew he could do more than the others ken imagined what the thirdbaseman would have said if the coach had not been present graves always ruffled ken the wrong way  ill strike him out if i break my arm muttered ken to himself he faced graves deliberately and eyed his position at bat graves as deliberately laughed at him  pitch up pitch up he called out  right over the pan retorted ken as quick as an echo he went hot as fire all over this fellow graves had some strange power of infuriating him  ken took a different swing which got more of his weight in motion and let his arm out like a white bullet the ball shot plateward rising a little so that graves hit vainly under it the ball surprised dean knocked his hands apart as if they had been paper and resounded from his breastprotector ken pitched the second ball in the same place with a like result except that dean held on to it graves had lost his smile and wore an expression of sickly surprise the third ball travelled by him and cracked in deans mitt and arthurs called it a strike  easy therethatll do yelled the coach come in here peg out on the field now boys  homans stopped ken as they were passing each other and ken felt himself under the scrutiny of clear gray eyes  youngster you look good to me said homans  ken also felt himself regarded with astonishment by many of the candidates and ray ran a keen intuitive glance over him from head to foot but it was the coachs manner that struck ken most forcibly worry was utterly unlike himself  why didnt you tell me about this beforeyouyou he yelled red as a beet in the face he grasped ken with both hands then he let him go and picking up a ball and a mitt he grasped him again without a word he led ken across the field and to a secluded corner behind the bleachers ken felt for all the world as if he was being led to execution  worry took off his coat and vest and collar he arranged a block of wood for a plate and stepped off so many paces and placed another piece of wood to mark the pitchers box then he donned the mitt  peg somethins comin off i know it i never make mistakes in sizin up pitchers but ive had such hard luck this season that i cant believe my own eyes weve got to prove it now you go out there and pitch to me just natural like at first  ken pitched a dozen balls or more some incurves some outcurves then he threw what he called his drop which he executed by a straight overhand swing  oha beauty yelled worry where peg where did you learn that another lower now  worry fell over trying to stop the glancing drop  try straight ones now peg right over the middle see how many you can pitch  one after another with free easy motion ken shot balls squarely over the plate worry counted them and suddenly after the fourteenth pitch he stood up and glared at ken  are you goin to keep puttin em over this pan all day that way  mr arthurs i couldnt miss that plate if i pitched a week replied ken  stop callin me mister yelled worry now put em where i hold my handsinside corner outside corner again inside now low another a fast one over now high inside oh peg this aint right i aint seein straight i think im dreamin come on with em  fast and true ken sped the balls into worrys mitt seldom did the coach have to move his hands at all  peg ward did you know that pitchin was all control puttin the ball where you wanted to asked worry stopping once more  no i didnt replied ken  how did you learn to peg a ball as straight as this  ken told him how he had thrown at marks all his life  why didnt you tell me before worry seemed not to be able to get over kens backwardness look at the sleepless nights and the gray hairs you could have saved me he stamped around as if furious yet underneath the surface ken saw that the coach was trying to hide his elation here now he shouted suddenly a few more and peg em see cut loose and let me see what steam youve got  ken whirled with all his might and delivered the ball with all his weight in the swing the ball seemed to diminish in size it went so swiftly near the plate it took an upward jump and it knocked worrys mitt off his hand  worry yelled out then he looked carefully at ken but he made no effort to go after the ball or pick up the mitt  did i say for you to knock my block off come here peg youre only a youngster do you think you can keep that are you goin to let me teach you to pitch have you got any nerve are you up in the air at the thought of place and herne  then he actually hugged ken and kept hold of him as if he might get away he was panting and sweating all at once he sat down on one of the braces of the bleachers and began mopping his face he seemed to cool down to undergo a subtle change  peg he said quietly im as bad as some of em fathead directors you see i didnt have no kind of a pitcher to work on this spring i kept on hopin strange why i didnt quit and nowmy boy youre a kid but youre a natural born pitcher     xi  state university game   arthurs returned to the diamond and called the squad around him he might have been another coach from the change that was manifest in him  boys ive picked the varsity and sorry i am to say you all cant be on it ward dean mccord raymond weir graves ray homans trace duncan and schoonoverthese men will report at once to trainer murray and obey his orders then pack your trunks and report to me at 36 spring street tonight thats allup on your toes now the rest of you boys will each get his uniform and sweater but of course i cant give you the varsity letter youve all tried hard and done your best im much obliged to you and hope youll try again next year  led by arthurs the players trotted across the field to murrays quarters ken used all his eyes as he went in this was the sacred precinct of the chosen athletes and it was not open to any others he saw a small gymnasium and adjoining it a large bright room with painted windows that let in the light but could not be seen through around the room on two sides were arranged huge boxlike bins with holes in the lids and behind them along the wall were steampipes on the other two sides were little zinclined rooms with different kinds of pipes which ken concluded were used for shower baths murray the trainer was there and two grinning negroes with towels over their shoulders and a little driedup scotchman who was all one smile  murray heres my bunch look em over and tomorrow start em in for keeps said arthurs  well worry theyre not a badlooking lot slim and trim we wont have to take off any beef heres reddy ray i let you have him this year worry but the track team will miss him and heres peg ward i was sure youd pick him worry and this is homans isnt it i remember you in the freshmen games the rest of you boys ill have to get acquainted with they say im a pretty hard fellow but thats on the outside now hustle out of your suits and well give you all a good stew and a rubdown  what the stew was soon appeared plain to ken he was the first player undressed and murray lifting up one of the boxlids pushed ken inside  sit down and put your feet in that pan he directed when i drop the lid let your head come out the hole there then he wrapped a huge towel around kens neck being careful to tuck it close and tight with that he reached round to the back of the box and turned on the steam  ken felt like a jackinthebox the warm steam was pleasant he looked about him to see the other boys being placed in like positions raymond had the box on one side and reddy ray the one on the other  its great said ray smiling at ken youll like it  raymond looked scared ken wondered if the fellow ever got any enjoyment out of things then ken found himself attending to his own sensations the steam was pouring out of the pipe inside the box and it was growing wetter thicker and hotter the pleasant warmth and tickling changed to a burning sensation ken found himself bathed in a heavy sweat then he began to smart in different places and he was hard put to it to keep rubbing them the steam grew hotter his body was afire his breath labored in great heaves ken felt that he must cry out he heard exclamations then yells from some of the other boxedup players and he glanced quickly around reddy ray was smiling and did not look at all uncomfortable but raymond was scarlet in the face and he squirmed his head to and fro  ough he bawled let me out of here  one of the negro attendants lifted the lid and helped raymond out he danced about as if on hot bricks his body was the color of a boiled lobster the attendant put him under one of the showers and turned the water on raymond uttered one deep low oooo then mccord begged to be let out weirs big head with its shock of hair resembled that of an angry lion little trace screamed and duncan yelled  peg howre you asked murray walking up to ken its always pretty hot the first few times but afterward its fine look at reddy  murray give peg a good stewin put in arthurs hes got a great arm and we must take care of it  ken saw the other boys except ray let out and he simply could not endure the steam any longer  ive gotenough he stammered  scotty turn on a little more stew ordered murray cheerfully then he rubbed his hand over kens face youre not hot yet  scotty turned on more steam and ken felt it as a wet flame he was being flayed alive  pleasepleaselet me out he implored  with a laugh murray lifted the lid and ken hopped out he was as red as anything red he had ever seen then scotty shoved him under a shower and as the icy water came down in a deluge ken lost his breath his chest caved in and he gasped scotty led him out into the room dried him with a towel rubbed him down and then resting kens arm on his shoulder began to pat and beat and massage it in a few moments ken thought his arm was a piece of live india rubber he had never been in such a glow when he had dressed he felt as light as air strong fresh and keen for action  hustle now peg said arthurs get your things packed supper tonight at the traininhouse  it was after dark when ken got an expressman to haul his trunk to the address on spring street the house was situated about the middle of a fourstoried block and within sight of grant field worry answered his ring  here you are peg the last one i was beginnin to worry about you have your trunk taken right up third floor back hurry down for dinner will be ready soon  ken followed at the heels of the expressman up to his room he was surprised and somewhat taken back to find raymond sitting upon the bed  hello excuse me said ken guess ive got the wrong place  the coach said you and i were to room together returned raymond  us roommates ejaculated ken  raymond took offence at this  wull i guess i can stand it he growled  i hope i can was kens short reply it was kens failing that he could not help retaliating but he was also as repentant as he was quicktempered oh i didnt mean that see here raymond if weve got to be roommates  ken paused in embarrassment  wull were both on the varsity said raymond  thats so rejoined ken brightening it makes a whole lot of difference doesnt it  raymond got off the bed and looked at ken  whats your first name queried he i dont like peg  kenneth ken for short whats yours  mines kel wull ken  having gotten so far raymond hesitated and it was ken who first offered his hand raymond eagerly grasped it that broke the ice  kel i havent liked your looks at all said ken apologetically  ken ive been going to lick you all spring  they went downstairs arm in arm  it was with great interest and curiosity that ken looked about the cozy and comfortable rooms the walls were adorned with pictures of varsity teams and players and the college colors were much in evidence college magazines and papers littered the table in the readingroom  boys well be pretty snug and nice here when things get to runnin smooth the grub will be plain but plenty of it  there were twelve in all at the table with the coach seated at the head the boys were hungry and besides as they had as yet had no chance to become acquainted the conversation lagged the newness and strangeness however did not hide the general air of suppressed gratification after dinner worry called them all together in the readingroom  well boys here we are together like one big family and were shut in for two months now i know youve all been fightin for places on the team and have had no chance to be friendly its always that way in the beginnin and i dare say therell be some scraps among you before things straighten out well have more to say about that later the thing now is youre all varsity men and im puttin you on your word of honor your word is good enough for me heres my rules and im more than usually particular this year for reasons ill tell later  youre not to break trainin youre not to eat anything anywhere but here youre to cut out cigarettes and drinks youre to be in bed at ten oclock and i advise although i aint insistin that if you have any leisure time youll spend most of it here thats all  for ken the three days following passed as so many hours he did not in the least dread the approaching game with state university but his mind held scarcely anything outside of arthurs coaching the practice of the players had been wholly different it was as if they had been freed from some binding spell worry kept them at fielding and batting for four full hours every afternoon ken after pitching to dean for a while batted to the infield and so had opportunity to see the improvement graves was brilliant at third weir was steady and sure at short raymond seemed to have springs in his legs and pounced upon the ball with wonderful quickness and mccord fielded all his chances successfully  on the afternoon of the game worry waited at the traininghouse until all the players came downstairs in uniform  boys whats happened in the past doesnt count we start over today im not goin to say much or confuse you with complex team coachin but im hopeful i sort of think theres a nigger in the woodpile ill tell you tonight if im right think of how you have been roasted by the students play like tigers put out of your mind everything but tryin nothin counts for you boys errors are nothin mistakes are nothin play the game as one man dont think of yourselves you all know when you ought to hit or bunt or run im trustin you i wont say a word from the bench and dont underrate our chances remember that i think its possible we may have somethin up our sleeves thats all from me till after the game  worry walked to grant field with ken he talked as they went along but not on baseball the state team was already out and practising worry kept ken near him on the bench and closely watched the visitors in practice when the gong rang to call them in he sent his players out with a remark to ken to take his warmingup easily ken thought he had hardly warmed up at all before the coach called him in  peg listen he whispered his gaze seemed to hypnotize ken do you have any idea what youll do to this bunch from state  whynoi  listen i tell you i know they wont be able to touch you size up batters in your own way if they look as if theyd pull or chop on a curve hand it up if not peg em a straight one over the inside corner high if you get in a hole with runners on bases use that fast jump ball as hard as you can drive it right over the pan go in with perfect confidence i wouldnt say that to you peg if i didnt feel it myself honestly id say for you to do your best but ive sized up these state fellows and they wont be able to touch you remember what i say thats all  ill remember said ken soberly  when the umpire called the game there were perhaps fifty students in the bleachers and a few spectators in the grandstand so poor an attendance that the state players loudly voiced their derision  hey boys yelled one we drew a crowd last year and look at that  its waynes dub team replied another they ran upon the field as if the result of the game was a foregone conclusion their pitcher a lanky individual handled the ball with assurance  homans led off for wayne he stood lefthanded at the plate and held his bat almost in the middle he did not swing but poked at the first ball pitched and placed a short hit over third raymond also lefthanded came next and letting two balls go he bunted the third running fast he slid into first base and beat the throw homans kept swiftly on toward third drew the throw and sliding was also safe it was fast work and the wayne players seemed to rise off the bench with the significance of the play worry arthurs looked on from under the brim of his hat and spoke no word then reddy ray stepped up  theyre all lefthanded shouted a state player the pitcher looked at reddy then motioned for his outfielders to play deeper with that he delivered the ball which the umpire called a strike reddy stood still and straight while two more balls sped by then he swung on the next a vicious low hit cut out over first base and skipped in great bounds to the fence homans scored raymond turned second going fast but it was rays speed that electrified the watching players they jumped up cheering  oh see him run yelled ken  he was on third before raymond reached the plate weir lifted a high fly to left field and when the ball dropped into the fielders hands ray ran home on the throwin three runs had been scored in a twinkling it amazed the state team they were not slow in bandying remarks among themselves fast whos that redhead is this your dub team get in the game boys they began to think more of playing ball and less of their own superiority graves however and mccord following him went out upon plays to the infield  as ken walked out toward the pitchers box homans put a hand on his arm and said kid put them all over dont waste any make every batter hit keep your nerve were back of you out here then reddy ray in passing spoke with a cool quiet faith that thrilled ken peg weve got enough runs now to win  ken faced the plate all in a white glow he was far from calmness but it was a restless fiery hurry for the action of the game he remembered the look in worrys eyes and every word that he had spoken rang in his ears receiving the ball from the umpire he stepped upon the slab with a sudden strange deep tremor it passed as quickly and then he was eying the first batter he drew a long breath standing motionless with all the significance of worrys hope flashing before him and then he whirled and delivered the ball the batter struck at it after it had passed him and it cracked in deans mitt  speed called the state captain quick eye there  the batter growled some unintelligible reply then he fouled the second ball missed the next and was out the succeeding state player hit an easy fly to homans and the next had two strikes called upon him and swung vainly at the third  dean got a base on balls for wayne trace went out trying to bunt and ken hit into short forcing dean at second homans lined to third retiring the side the best that the state players could do in their half was for one man to send a weak grounder to raymond one to fly out and the other to fail on strikes wayne went to bat again and raymond got his base by being hit by a pitched ball reddy ray bunted and was safe weir struck out graves rapped a safety through short scoring raymond and sending ray to third then mccord fouled out to the catcher again in states inning they failed to get on base being unable to hit ken effectively  so the game progressed state slowly losing its aggressive playing and wayne gaining what its opponents had lost in the sixth homans reached his base on an error stole second went to third on raymonds sacrifice and scored on reddys drive to right state flashed up in their half getting two men to first on misplays of mccord and weir and scored a run on a slow hit to graves  with the bases full ken let his arm out and pitched the fast ball at the limit of his speed the state batters were helpless before it but they scored two runs on passed strikes by dean the little catcher had a hard time judging kens jump ball that ended the rungetting for state though they came near scoring again on more fumbling in the infield in the eighth ken landed a safe fly over second and tallied on a double by homans  before ken knew the game was half over it had endedwayne 6 state 3 his players crowded around him and some one called for the wayne yell it was given with wild vehemence  from that moment until dinner was over at the traininghouse ken appeared to be the centre of a humming circle what was said and done he never remembered then the coach stopped the excitement  boys now for a hearttoheart talk he said with a smile both happy and grave we won today as i predicted state had a fairly strong team but if ward had received perfect support they would not have got a man beyond second thats the only personal mention ill make now listen  he paused with his eyes glinting brightly and his jaw quivering  i expected to win but before the game i never dreamed of our possibilities i got a glimpse now of what hard work and a demon spirit to play together might make this team ive had an inspiration we are goin to beat herne and play place to a standstill  not a boy moved an eyelash as arthurs made this statement and the sound of a pin dropping could have been heard  to do that we must pull together as no boys ever pulled together before we must be all one heart we must be actuated by one spirit listen if you will stick together and to me ill make a team that will be a wonder never the hittin team as good as last years varsity but a faster team a finer machine think of that think of how we have been treated this year for that well win all the greater glory its worth all there is in you boys you would have the proudest record of any team that ever played for old wayne  i love the old college boys and ive given it the best years of my life if its anything to you why understand that if i fail to build up a good team this year i shall be let go by those directors who have made the change in athletics i could stand that butive a boy of my own whos preparin for wayne and my heart is set on seein him enterand he said he never will if they let me go so you youngsters and meweve much to gain go to your rooms now and think think as you never did before until the spirit of this thing the possibility of it grips you as it has me     xii  ken clashes with graves   two weeks after the contest with state university four more games with minor colleges had been played and won by wayne hour by hour the coach had drilled the players day by day the grilling practice told in quickening grasp of teamplay in gradual correction of erratic fielding and wild throwing every game a few more students attended reluctantly in halfhearted manner  were comin with a rush said worry to ken say but dale and the old gang have a surprise in store for em and the studentstheyre goin to drop dead pretty soon peg murray tells me hes puttin weight on you  why yes its the funniest thing replied ken today i weighed one hundred and sixtyfour worry im afraid im getting fat  fat nothin snorted worry its muscle i told murray to put beef on you all he can pretty soon youll be able to peg a ball through the backstop deans too light peg hes plucky and will make a catcher but hes too light youre batterin him all up  worry shook his head seriously  oh hes fine exclaimed ken im not afraid any more he digs my drop out of the dust and i cant get a curve away from him hes weak only on the jump ball and i dont throw that often only when i let drive  youll be usin that often enough against herne and place im dependin on that for those games peg are you worryin any losin any sleep over those games  indeed im not replied ken laughing  say i wish youd have a balloon ascension and have it quick it aint natural peg for you not to get a case of rattles its comin to you and i dont want it in any of the big games  i dont want it either but worry pitching is all a matter of control you say so often i dont believe i could get wild and lose my control if i tried  peg you sure have the best control of any pitcher i ever coached its your success itll make a great pitcher out of you all youve got to learn is where to pitch em to herne and place  how am i to learn that  listen worry whispered im goin to send you to washington next week to see place and herne play georgetown youll pay your little money and sit in the grandstand right behind the catcher youll have a pencil and a score card and youll be enjoyin the game but peg youll also be usin your head and when you see one of em players pull away on a curve or hit weak on a drop or miss a high fast one or slug a low ball you will jot it down on your card youll watch places hard hitters with hawk eyes my boy and a pitchers memory and when they come along to grant field youll have em pretty well sized up  thats fine worry but is it fair queried ken  fair why of course they all do it we saw places captain in the grandstand here last spring  the coach made no secret of his pride and faith in ken it was this perhaps as much as anything which kept ken keyed up for ken was really pitching better ball than he knew how to pitch he would have broken his arm for worry he believed absolutely in what the coach told him he did not think of himself at all  worry however had plenty of enthusiasm for his other players every evening after dinner he would call them all about him and talk for an hour sometimes he would tell funny baseball stories again he told of famous wayneplace games and how they had been won or lost then at other times he dwelt on the merits and faults of his own team in speaking of the swift development of this years varsity he said it was as remarkable as it had been unforeseen he claimed it would be a bewildering surprise to wayne students and to the big college teams he was working toward the perfection of a fast rungetting machine in the five games already played and won a good idea could be gotten of waynes team individually and collectively homans was a scientific shortfield hitter and remarkably sure raymond could not bat but he had developed into a wonder in reaching first base by bunt or base on balls or being hit reddy ray was a hard and timely batter and when he got on base his wonderful fleetness made him almost sure to score of the other players graves batted the best but taking the team as a whole and comparing them with place or herne it appeared that reddy and homans were the only great hitters and the two of them of course could not make a great hitting team in fielding however the coach said he had never seen the like they were all fast and homans was perfect in judgment on fly balls and raymond was quick as lightning to knock down base hits and as to the intercollegiate sprinter in left field it was simply a breathtaking event to see him run after a ball last of all was ken ward with his great arm it was a strangely assorted team worry said one impossible to judge at the moment but it was one to watch  boys were comin with a rush he went on to say but somethins holdin us back a little theres no lack of harmony yet theres a drag in spite of the spirit youve shownand i want to say its been greatthe team doesnt work together as one man all the time i advise you all to stick closer together stay away from the club and everywhere except lectures weve got to be closer n brothers itll all work out right before we go up against herne in june that games comin boys and by that time the old college will be crazy itll be our turn then  worrys talks always sank deeply into kens mind and set him to thinking and revolving over and over the gist of them so that he could remember to his profit  he knew that some of the boys had broken training and he pondered if that was what caused the drag worry mentioned ken had come to feel the life and fortunes of the varsity so keenly that he realized how the simplest deviations from honor might affect the smooth running of the team it must be perfectly smooth and to make it so every player must be of one mind  ken proved to himself how lack of the highest spirit on the part of one or two of the team tended toward the lowering of the general spirit for he began to worry and almost at once it influenced his playing he found himself growing watchful of his comrades and fearful of what they might be doing he caught himself being ashamed of his suspicions he would as lief have cut off his hand as break his promise to the coach perhaps however he exaggerated his feeling and sense of duty he remembered the scene in dales room the night he refused to smoke and drink how dale had commended his refusal nevertheless he gathered from dales remark to worry that breaking training was not unusual or particularly harmful  with dales team it might not have been so bad thought ken but its different with us weve got to make up in spirit what we lack in ability  weir and mccord occupied the room next to kens and graves and trace rooming together were also on that floor ken had tried with all his might to feel friendly toward the thirdbaseman he had caught graves carrying cake and pie to his room and smoking cigarettes with the window open one night graves took cigarettes from his pocket and offered them to kel trace and ken who all happened to be in kens room at the time trace readily accepted kel demurred at first but finally took one graves then tossed the pack to ken  no i dont smoke besides its breaking training said ken  you make me sick ward retorted graves youre a wet blanket do you think were going to be as sissy as that its hard enough to stand the grub we get here without giving up a little smoke  ken made no reply but he found it difficult to smother a hot riot in his breast when the other boys had gone to their rooms ken took kel to task about his wrongdoing  do you think thats the right sort of thing what would worry say  ken i dont care about it not a bit replied kel flinging his cigarette out of the window but graves is always asking me to do thingsi hate to refuse it seems so  kel if worry finds it out youll lose your place on the team  no exclaimed raymond staring  mark what i say i wish youd stop letting graves coax you into things  ken hes always smuggling pie and cake and candy into his room ive had some of it trace said hed brought in something to drink too  its a shame cried ken in anger i never liked him and ive tried hard to change it now im glad i couldnt  he doesnt have any use for you replied kel hes always running you down to the other boys whatd you ever do to him ken  oh it was that potato stunt of mine last fall hes a soph and i hit him i guess  i think its more than that went on raymond anyway you look out for him because hes aching to spoil your face  he is is he snapped ken  ken was too angry to talk any more and so the boys went to bed the next few days ken discovered that either out of shame or growing estrangement raymond avoided him and he was bitterly hurt he had come to like the little secondbaseman and had hoped they would be good friends it was easy to see that graves became daily bolder and more lax in training and his influence upon several of the boys grew stronger and when dean schoonover and duncan appeared to be joining the clique ken decided he would have to talk to some one so he went up to see ray and homans  the sprinter was alone sitting by his lamp with books and notes spread before him  hello peg come in you look a little glum whats wrong  reddy ray seemed like an elder brother to ken and he found himself blurting out his trouble ray looked thoughtful and after a moment he replied in his quiet way  peg its new to you but its an old story to me the track and crew men seldom break training which is more than can be said of the other athletes it seems to me baseball fellows are the most careless they really dont have to train so conscientiously its only a kind of form  but its different this year burst out ken you know what worry said and how he trusts us  youre right peg only you mustnt take it so hard things will work out all right homans and i were talking about that today you see worry wants the boys to elect a captain soon but perhaps he has not confided in you youngsters he will suggest that you elect homans or me well i wont run for the place so itll be homans hes the man to captain us thats certain graves thinks though that he can pull the wires and be elected captain hes way off besides peg hes making a big mistake worry doesnt like him and when he finds out about this break in training well have a new thirdbaseman no doubt blake will play the bag graves is the only drag in worrys baseball machine now and hell not last so peg dont think any more about it mind you the whole team circles round you youre the pivot and as sure as youre born youll be waynes captain next year thats something for you to keep in mind and work for if graves keeps after youhand him one thats not against rules punch him if worry knew the truth he would pat you on the back for slugging graves cheer up peg even if graves has got all the kids on his side which i doubt homans and i are with you and you can just bet that worry arthurs will side with us now run along for i must study  this conversation was most illuminating to ken he left reddys room all in a quiver of warm pleasure and friendliness at the great sprinters quiet praise and advice to make such a friend was worth losing a hundred friends like graves he dismissed the thirdbaseman and his scheming from mind and believed reddy as he had believed arthurs but ken thought much of what he divined was a glimmering of the inside workings of a college baseball team he had one wild start of rapture at the idea of becoming captain of waynes varsity next year and then he dared think no more of that  the day dawned for ken to go to washington and he was so perturbed at his responsibilities that he quite forgot to worry about the game wayne had to play in his absence arthurs intended to pitch schoonover in that game and had no doubt as to its outcome the coach went to the station with ken once more repeated his instructions and saw him upon the train certainly there was no more important personage on board that washington limited than ken ward in fact ken was so full of importance and responsibility that he quite divided his time between foolish pride in his being chosen to size up the great college teams and fearful conjecture as to his ability  at any rate the time flew by the trip seemed short and soon he was on the georgetown field it was lucky that he arrived early and got a seat in the middle of the grandstand for there was a throng in attendance when the players came on the diamond the noisy bleachers the merry laughter the flashing colors and especially the bright gowns and pretty faces of the girls gave ken pleasurable consciousness of what it would mean to play before such a crowd at wayne he had pitched to empty seats remembering worrys prophecy however he was content to wait  from that moment his duty absorbed him he found it exceedingly fascinating to study the batters and utterly forgot his responsibility not only did he jot down on his card his idea of the weakness and strength of the different hitters but he compared what he would have pitched to them with what was actually pitched of course he had no test of his comparison but he felt intuitively that he had the better of it watching so closely ken had forced home to him arthurs repeated assertion that control of the ball made a pitcher both pitchers in this game were wild locating the plate with them was more a matter of luck than ability the herne pitcher kept wasting balls and getting himself in the hole and then the heavy georgetown players would know when he had to throw a strike if he could and accordingly they hit hard they beat herne badly  the next day in the game with place it was a different story ken realized he was watching a great team they reminded him of dales varsity though they did not play that fiendish rightfieldhitting game ken had a numbness come over him at the idea of facing this place team it soon passed for they had their vulnerable places it was not so much that they hit hard on speed and curves for they got them where they wanted them keene flied out on high fast balls over the inside corner starke bit on low drops martin was weak on a slow ball macneff the captain could not touch speed under his chin and he always struck at it on the other hand he killed a low ball prince was the only man who in kens judgment seemed to have no weakness these men represented the batting strength of place and ken though he did not in the least underestimate them had no fear he would have liked to pitch against them right there  its all in control of the ball thought ken here are seventeen bases on balls in two gamesfour pitchers theyre wild but suppose i got wild too  the idea made ken shiver  he travelled all night sleeping on the train and got home to the traininghouse about nine the next morning worry was out scotty said and the boys had all gone over to college ken went upstairs and found raymond in bed  why kel whats the matter asked ken  im sick replied kel he was pale and appeared to be in distress  oh im sorry cant i do something get you some medicine call murray  ken dont call anybody unless you want to see me disgraced worry got out this morning before he noticed my absence from breakfast i was scared to death  scared disgraced  ken i drank a little last night it always makes me sick you know ive a weak stomach  kel you didnt drink say you didnt implored ken sitting miserably down on the bed  yes i did i believe i was half drunk i cant stand anything im sick sick of myself too this morning and i hate graves  ken jumped up with kindling eyes  kel youve gone back on mewed started to be such friendsi tried to persuade you  i know im sorry ken but i really liked you best i wasyou know how it is ken if only worry dont find it out  tell him said ken quickly  what groaned kel in fright  tell him let me tell him for you  nonono hed fire me off the team and i couldnt stand that  ill bet worry wouldnt do anything of the kind maybe he knows more than you think  im afraid to tell him ken i just cant tell him  but you gave your word of honor not to break training the only thing left is to confess  i wont tell ken its not so much my own place on the teamthere are the other fellows  ken saw that it was no use to argue with raymond while he was so sick and discouraged so he wisely left off talking and did his best to make him comfortable raymond dropped asleep after a little and when he awakened just before lunchtime he appeared better  i wont be able to practise today he said but ill go down to lunch  as he was dressing the boys began to come in from college and ran whistling up the stairs  graves bustled into the room with rather anxious haste  howre you feeling he asked  pretty rocky gravesi told ward about it said raymond  upon his hurried entrance graves had not observed ken  what did you want to do that for he demanded arrogantly  raymond looked at him but made no reply  ward i suppose youll squeal said graves sneeringly thatll about be your speed  ken rose and not trusting himself to speak remained silent  you sissy cried graves hotly will you peach on us to arthurs  no but if you dont get out of my room ill hand you one replied ken his voice growing thick  gravess face became red as fire  what why you whitefaced whitehaired freshman ive been aching to punch you  well why dont you commence  with the first retort ken had felt a hot trembling go over him and having yielded to his anger he did not care what happened  kengraves pleaded raymond white as a sheet dontplease he turned from one to the other dont scrap  graves its up to some one to call you and im going to do it said ken passionately youve been after me all season but i wouldnt care for that its your rotten influence on kel and the other boys that makes me wild you are the drag in this baseball team you are a crack ballplayer but you dont know what college spirit means youre a mucker  ill lick you for that raved graves shaking his fists  you cant lick me  come outdoors i dare you to come outdoors i dare you  ken strode out of the room and started down the hall come on he called grimly and ran down the stairs graves hesitated a moment  then followed  raymond suddenly called after them  give it to him ken slug him beat him all up     xiii  friendship   a halfhour or less afterward ken entered the traininghouse it chanced that the boys having come in were at the moment passing through the hall to the diningroom and with them was worry arthurs  hello you back whats the matter with you demanded the coach  kens lips were puffed and bleeding and his chin was bloody sundry red and dark marks disfigured his usually clear complexion his eyes were blazing and his hair rumpled down over his brow  youve been in a scrap declared worry  i know it said ken let me go up and wash  worry had planted himself at the foot of the stairway in front of ken the boys stood silent and aghast suddenly there came thumps upon the stairs and raymond appeared jumping down three steps at a time he dodged under worrys arm and plunged at ken to hold him with both hands  ken youre all bloody he exclaimed in great excitement he didnt lick you say he didnt hes got to fight me too youre all bunged up  wait till you see him muttered ken  ahuh said worry been scrappin with graves what for  its a personal matter replied ken  come no monkeybiz with me said the coach sharply out with it  there was a moments silence  mr arthurs its my fault burst out raymond flushed and eager ken was fighting on my account  it wasnt anything of the kind retorted ken vehemently  yes it was cried raymond and im going to tell why  the hall door opened to admit graves he was dishevelled dirty battered and covered with blood when he saw the group in the hall he made as if to dodge out  here come on take your medicine called worry tersely  graves shuffled in cast down and sheepish a very different fellow from his usual vaunting self  now raymond whats this all about demanded worry  raymond changed color but he did not hesitate an instant  ken came in this morning and found me sick in bed i told him i had been half drunk last nightand that graves had gotten me to drink then graves came in he and ken had hard words they went outdoors to fight  would you have told me roared the coach in fury would you have come to me with this if i hadnt caught peg  raymond faced him without flinching  at first i thought notwhen ken begged me to confess i just couldnt but now i know i would  at that worry lost his sudden heat and then he turned to the stricken graves  mebbe itll surprise you graves to learn that i knew a little of what youve been doin i told homans to go to you in a quiet way and tip off your mistake i hoped youd see it but you didnt then youve been knockin ward all season for no reason i could discover but jealousy now listen peg ward has done a lot for me already this year and hell do more but even if he beats place it wont mean any more to me than the beatin hes given you now you pack your things and get out of here theres no position for you on this varsity  without a word in reply and amid intense silence graves went slowly upstairs when he disappeared worry sank into a chair and looked as if he was about to collapse little trace walked hesitatingly forward with the manner of one propelled against his will  mr arthurs ii he stammeredim guilty too i broke training i want to  the coach waved him back i dont want to hear it not another wordfrom anybody its made me sick i cant stand any more only i see ive got to change my rules there wont be any rules any more you can all do as you like id rather have you all go stale than practise deceit on me i cut out the trainin rules  no the team rose up as one man and flung the refusal at the coach  worry we wont stand for that spoke up reddy ray his smooth cool voice was like oil on troubled waters i think homans and i can answer for the kids from now on graves was a disorganizerthats the least ill say of him well elect homans captain of the team and then well cut loose like a lot of demons its been a long hard drill for you worry but were in the stretch now and going to finish fast weve been a kind of misfit team all spring youve had a blind faith that something could be made out of us homans has waked up to our hidden strength and i go further than that ive played ball for years i know the game i held down left field for two seasons on the greatest college team ever developed out west thats new to you well it gives me license to talk a little i want to tell you that i can feel whats in this team its like the feeling i have when im running against a fast man in the sprints from now on well be a family of brothers with one idea and thatll be to play place off their feet  coach arthurs sat up as if he had been given the elixir of life likewise the members of the team appeared to be under the spell of a powerful stimulus the sprinters words struck fire from all present  homans clear gray eyes were like live coals boys one rousing cheer for worry arthurs and for wayne  lusty strained throats let out the cheer with a deafening roar  it was strange and significant at that moment to see graves whitefaced and sullen come down the stairs and pass through the hall and out of the door it was as if discord selfishness and wavering passed out with him arthurs and homans and ray could not have hoped for a more striking lesson to the young players  dave the colored waiter appeared in the doorway of the diningroom mr arthurs i done call yo all lunch is sho gittin cold  that afternoon wayne played the strong hornell university nine  blake new at third base for wayne was a revelation he was all legs and arms weir accepted eight chances raymond sick or not was all over the infield knocking down grounders backing up every play to mccord balls in the air or at his feet were all the same trace caught a foul fly right off the bleachers homans fielded with as much speed as the old varsitys centre and with better judgment besides he made four hits and four runs reddy ray drove one ball into the bleachers and on a linedrive to left field he circled the bases in time that murray said was wonderful dean stood up valiantly to his battering and for the first game had no passed balls and ken ward whirled tirelessly in the box and one after another he shot fast balls over the plate he made the hornell players hit he had no need to extend himself to the use of the long swing and whip of his arm that produced the jump ball and he shut them out without a run and gave them only two safe hits all through the game worry arthurs sat on the bench without giving an order or a sign his worried look had vanished with the crude playing of his team  that night the hornell captain a veteran player of unquestionable ability was entertained at carlton club by wayne friends and he expressed himself forcibly we came over to beat waynes weak team itll be some time till we discover what happened young ward has the most magnificent control and speed hes absolutely relentless and that froglegged secondbasemanoh say cant he cover ground homans is an allround star then your redheaded ray the sprinterhes a marvel ward homans raytheyre demons and theyre making demons of the kids i cant understand why wayne students dont support their team its strange  what the hornell captain said went from lip to lip throughout the club and then it spread like a flame in windblown grass from club to dormitory and thus over all the university  boys the college is wakin up said worry rubbing his hands yesterdays game jarred em they cant believe their own ears why hornell almost beat dales team last spring now kids look out well stand for no fussin over us we dont want any jollyin weve waited long for encouragement it didnt come and now well play out the string alone therell be a rush to grant field it cuts no ice with us let em come to see the boys they hissed and guyed early in the spring well show em a few things well make em speechless well make em so ashamed they wont know what to do well repay all their slights by beatin place  worry was as excited as on the day he discovered that ken was a pitcher  one more word boys he went on keep together now run back here to your rooms as quick as you get leave from college be civil when you are approached by students but dont mingle not yet keep to yourselves your reward is comin itll be great only wait  and that was the last touch of fire which moulded worrys players into a family of brothers close and warm and fine was the culmination of their friendship on the field they were dominated by one impulse almost savage in its intensity when they were off the field the springs of youth burst forth to flood the hours with fun  in the mornings when the mailman came there was always a wild scramble for letters and it developed that weir received more than his share he got mail every day and his goodfortune could not escape the lynx eyes of his comrades nor could the size and shape of the envelope and the neat small handwriting fail to be noticed weir always stole off by himself to read his daily letter trying to escape a merry chorus of tantalizing remarks  oh sugar  dreamy eyes  gawge the pink letter has come  weirs reception of these sallies earned him the name of puff  one morning for some unaccountable reason weir did not get downstairs when the mail arrived duncan got the pink letter scrutinized the writing closely and put the letter in his coat presently weir came bustling down  whos got the mail he asked quickly  no letters this morning replied some one  is this sunday asked weir rather stupidly  nope i meant no letters for you  weir looked blank then stunned then crestfallen duncan handed out the pink envelope the boys roared and weir strode off in high dudgeon  that day duncan purchased a box of pink envelopes and being expert with a pen he imitated the neat handwriting and addressed pink envelopes to every boy in the traininghouse next morning no one except weir seemed in a hurry to answer the postmans ring he came in with the letters and his jaw dropping it so happened that his letter was the very last one and when he got to it the truth flashed over him then the peculiar appropriateness of the nickname puff was plainly manifest one by one the boys slid off their chairs to the floor and at last weir had to join in the laugh on him  each of the boys in turn became the victim of some prank raymond betrayed kens abhorrence of any kind of perfume and straightway there was a stealthy colloquy cheap perfume of a most penetrating and paralyzing odor was liberally purchased in kens absence from his room all the clothing that he did not have on his back was saturated then the conspirators waited for him to come up the stoop and from their hidingplace in a window of the second floor they dropped an extra quart upon him  ken vowed vengeance that would satisfy him thrice over and he bided his time until he learned who had perpetrated the outrage  one day after practice his opportunity came raymond weir and trace the guilty ones went with ken to the training quarters to take the steam bath that murray insisted upon at least once every week it so turned out that the four were the only players there that afternoon while the others were undressing ken bribed scotty to go out on an errand and he let murray into his scheme now murray not only had acquired a strong liking for ken but he was exceedingly fond of a joke  all i want to know whispered ken is if i might stew them too muchreally scald them you know  no danger whispered murray thatll be the fun of it you cant hurt them but theyll think theyre dying  he hustled raymond weir and trace into the tanks and fastened the lids and carefully tucked towels round their necks to keep in the steam  lots of stew today he said turning the handles hello wheres scotty peg will you watch these boys a minute while i step out  you bet i will called ken to the already disappearing murray  the three coopedin boys looked askance at ken  wull im not much stuck raymond began glibly enough and then becoming conscious that he might betray an opportunity to ken he swallowed his tongue  whatd you say asked ken pretending curiosity suddenly he began to jump up and down oh my hullabelee schoodoorady what a chance you gave it away  look what hes doing yelled trace  hyar added weir  keep away from those pipes chimed in raymond  boys ive been laying for you but i never thought id get a chance like this if murray only stays out three minutesjust three minutes  three minutes you idiot you wont keep us in here that long asked weir in alarm  oh no not at all puff i think you can stand a little more steam  ken turned the handle on full  kel a firstrate stewing will be good for your daily grouch  to the accompaniment of raymonds threats he turned the second handle  trace you little pollparrot you will throw perfume on me now roast  the heads of the imprisoned boys began to jerk and bob around and their faces to take on a flush ken leisurely surveyed them and then did an indian wardance in the middle of the room  here let me out ken you know how delicate i am implored raymond  i couldnt entertain the idea for a second replied ken  ill lick you yelled raymond  my lad youve got a brainstorm returned ken in grieved tones not in the wildest flights of your nightmares have you ever said anything so impossible as that  ken dear ken dear old peggie cried trace you know ive got a skinned place on my hip where i slid yesterday steam isnt good for that worry says hell be sore you must let me out  i intend to see willie that youll be sore too and skinned all over replied ken  open this lid at once roared weir in sudden anger his big eyes rolled  bah taunted ken  then all three began to roar at ken at once brute devil help help help well fix you for this its hotter its fire aghh ouch oh ahhh oooo murder murderr  at this juncture murray ran in  what on earth peg what did you do  i only turned on the steam full tilt replied ken innocently  why you shouldnt have done that said murray in pained astonishment  stop talking about it let me out shrieked raymond  ken discreetly put on his coat and ran from the room     xiv  the herne game   on the morning of the first of june the day scheduled for the opening game with herne worry arthurs had ken ward closeted with homans and reddy ray worry was trying his best to be soberly calculating in regard to the outcome of the game he was always trying to impress ken with the uncertainty of baseball but a much younger and less observing boy than ken could have seen through the coach worry was dead sure of the result certain that the day would see a great gathering of wayne students and he could not hide his happiness and the more he betrayed himself the more he growled at ken  well we aint goin to have that balloonascension today are we he demanded here weve got down to the big games and you havent been up in the air yet i tell you it aint right  but worry i couldnt go off my head and get rattled just to please you could i implored ken to ken this strain of the coachs had grown to be as serious as it was funny  aw talk sense said worry why you havent pitched to a college crowd yet wait wait till you see that crowd over to place next week thousands of students crazier n indians and a flock of girls thatll make you bite your tongue off ten thousand yellin all at once  let them yell replied ken im aching to pitch before a crowd it has been pretty lonesome at grant field all season  let em yell eh retorted worry all right my boy its comin to you and if you lose your nut and get slammed all over the lot dont come to me for sympathy  i wouldnt i can take a licking why worry you talk as ifas if id done something terrible whats the matter with me ive done every single thing you wantedjust as well as i could do it what are you afraid of  youre gettin swelled on yourself said the coach deliberately  the blood rushed to kens face until it was scarlet he was so astounded and hurt that he could not speak worry looked at him once then turning hastily away he walked to the window  peg it aint much wonder he went on smoothly and im not holdin it against you but i want you to forget yourself  ive never had a thought of myself retorted ken hotly  i want you to go in today likelike an automatic machine went on worry as if ken had not spoken therell be a crowd out the first of the season mebbe theyll throw a fit anyway its our first big game as far as the university goes this is our trial the students are up in the air they dont know what to think mebbe there wont be a cheer at first but peg if we beat herne today theyll tear down the bleachers  well all ive got to say is that you can order new lumber for the bleachersbecause were going to win replied ken with a smouldering fire in his eyes  there you go again if youre not stuck on yourself its too much confidence you wont be so chipper about three this afternoon mebbe listen the herne players got into town last night and some of them talked a little its just as well you didnt see the morning papers it came to me straight that gallagher the captain and stern the firstbaseman said you were pretty good for a kid freshman but a little too swelled to stand the gaff in a big game they expect you to explode before the third innin i wasnt goin to tell you peg but youre so  they said that did they cried ken he jumped up with paling cheek and blazing eye and the big hand he shoved under worrys nose trembled like a shaking leaf what i wont do to them will be funny swelled explode stand the gaff look here worry maybe its true but i dont believe it ill beat this herne team do you get that  now youre talkin replied worry with an entire change of manner you saw the herne bunch play they can field but how about hittin  gallagher stern hill and burr are the veterans of last years varsity went on ken rapidly as one who knew his subject they can hitif they get what they like  now youre talkin how about gallagher  he hits speed he couldnt hit a slow ball with a paddle  now youre talkin theres stern howd you size him  hes weak on a low curve in or out or a drop  peg youre talkin some now how about hill  hill is a bunter a high ball in close speedy would tie him in a knot  come on hurry theres burr  burrs the best of the lot a good waiter and hard hitter but he invariably hits a high curve up in the air  all right so far so good how about the rest of the team  ill hand them up a straight easy ball and let them hit i tell you ive got herne beaten and if gallagher or any one else begins to guy me ill laugh in his face  oh you will say you go down to your room now and stay there till time for lunch study or read dont think another minute about this game  ken strode soberly out of the room  it was well for ken that he did not see what happened immediately after his exit worry and homans fell into each others arms  say fellows how i hated to do it worry choked with laughter and contrition it was the hardest task i ever had but cap you know we had to make peg sore hes too blamed goodnatured oh but didnt he take fire hell make some of those herne guys play lowbridge today wouldnt it be great if he gave gallagher the laugh  worry dont you worry about that said homans and it would please me too for gallagher is about as wordy and pompous as any captain ive seen  i think you were a little hard on ken put in reddy his quiet voice drew worry and homans from their elation of course it was necessary to rouse kens fighting blood but you didnt choose the right way you hurt his feelings you know worry that the boy is not in the least swelled  course i know it reddy why pegs too modest but i want him to be dead in earnest today mind you im thinkin of place hell beat herne to a standstill i worked on his feelins just to get him all stirred up you know theres always the chance of rattles in any young player especially a pitcher if hes mad he wont be so likely to get em so i hurt his feelins ill make it up to him dont you fear for that reddy  i wish you had waited till we go over to place next week replied ray you cant treat him that way twice over theres where i would look for his weakening but it may be he wont ever weaken if he ever does itll be because of the crowd and not the players  i think so too a yellin mob will be new to peg but fellows im only askin one game from herne and one or a good close game from place thatll give wayne the best record ever made look at our standin now why the newspapers are havin a fit since i picked the varsity we havent lost a game think of that those early games dont count weve had an unbroken string of victories peg pitchin twelve and schoonover four and if wet grounds and other things hadnt cancelled other games wed have won more  yes were in the stretch now worry and running strong well win three out of these four big games rejoined reddy  oh say thatd be too much i couldnt stand it oh say cap dont you think reddy for once is talkin about as swift as he sprints  im afraid to tell you worry replied homans earnestly when i look back at our work i cant realize it but its time to wake up the students over at college are waking up they will be out today you are the one to judge whether were a great team or not we keep on making runs its runs that count i think honestly worry that after today well be in the lead for championship honors and i hold my breath when i tell you  it was remarkably quiet about the traininghouse all that morning the coach sent a light lunch to the boys in their rooms they had orders to be dressed and to report in the readingroom at onethirty  raymond came down promptly on time  wheres peg asked worry  why i thought he was here ahead of me replied raymond in surprise  a quick survey of the uniformed players proved the absence of ken ward and reddy ray worry appeared startled out of speech and looked helplessly at homans then ray came downstairs bat in one hand shoes and glove in the other he seated himself upon the last step and leisurely proceeded to put on his shoes  reddy did you see peg asked worry anxiously  sure i saw him replied the sprinter  well growled the coach where is he sulkin because i called him  not so youd notice it answered reddy in his slow careless manner i just woke him up  what yelled arthurs  peg came to my room after lunch and went to sleep i woke him just now hell be down in a minute  worry evidently could not reply at the moment but he began to beam  what would gallagher say to that asked captain homans with a smile waynes varsity pitcher asleep before a herne game oh no i guess thats not pretty good worry could you ask any more  cap ill never open my face to him again blurted out the coach  ken appeared at the head of the stairs and had started down when the doorbell rang worry opened the door to admit murray the trainer dale the old varsity captain and the magnificently built stevens guard and captain of the football team  hello worry called out murray cheerily howre the kids boys you look good to me trim and fit and all cool and quietlike reddy be careful of your ankles and legs today after the meet next week you can cut loose and run bases like a blue streak  dale stepped forward earnest and somewhat concerned but with a winning frankness  worry will you let stevens and me sit on the bench with the boys today  worrys face took on the color of a thundercloud im not the captain he replied ask homans  how about it roy queried dale  homans was visibly affected by surprise pleasure and something more while he hesitated perhaps not trusting himself to reply quickly stevens took a giant stride to the fore  homans weve got a hunch that waynes going to win he said in a deepbass voice a few of us have been tipped off and we got it straight but the students dont know it yet so dale and i thought wed like them to see how we feel about itbefore this game youve had a rotten deal from the students this year but theyll more than make it up when you beat herne the whole college is waiting and restless  homans recovering himself faced the two captains courteously and gratefully and with a certain cool dignity  thank you fellows its fine of you to offer to sit with us on the bench i thank you on behalf of the varsity butnot today all season weve worked and fought without support and now were going to beat herne without support when weve done that you and daleall the collegecant come too quick to suit us  i think id say the same thing if i were in your place said dale and ill tell you right here that when i was captain i never plugged any harder to win than ill plug today  then these two famous captains of championship teams turned to homans players and eyed them keenly their faces working hands clenched their powerful frames vibrating with the feeling of the moment that moment was silent eloquent it linked homans team to the great athletic fame of the university it radiated the spirit to conquer the glory of past victories the strength of honorable defeats then dale and stevens went out leaving behind them a charged atmosphere  i aint got a word to say announced worry to the players  and ive very little added captain homans were all on edge and being drawn down so fine we may be overeager force that back it doesnt matter if we make misplays weve made many this season but weve won all the same at the bat remember to keep a sharp eye on the baserunner and when he signs he is going down bunt or hit to advance him thats all  ken ward walked to the field between worry arthurs and reddy ray worry had no word to say but he kept a tight grip on kens arm  peg ive won many a sprint by not underestimating my opponent said reddy quietly now you go at herne for all youre worth from the start  when they entered the field there were more spectators in the stands than had attended all the other games together in a far corner the herne players in darkblue uniforms were practising batting upon the moment the gong called them in for their turn at field practice the wayne team batted and bunted a few balls and then homans led them to the bench  upon near view the grandstand and bleachers seemed a strange sight to ken ward he took one long look at the blackandwhite mass of students behind the backstop at the straggling lines leading to the gates at the rapidly filling rows to right and left and then he looked no more already an immense crowd was present still it was not a typical college baseball audience ken realized that at once it was quiet orderly expectant and watchful very few girls were there the students as a body had warmed to curiosity and interest but not to the extent of bringing the girls after that one glance ken resolutely kept his eyes upon the ground he was conscious of a feeling that he wanted to spring up and leap at something and he brought all his will to force back his overeagerness he heard the crack of the ball the shouts of the herne players the hum of voices in the grandstand and the occasional cheers of herne rooters there were no wayne cheers  warm up a little said worry in his ear  ken peeled off his sweater and walked out with dean a long murmur ran throughout the stands ken heard many things said of him curiously wonderingly doubtfully and he tried not to hear more then he commenced to pitch to dean worry stood near him and kept whispering to hold in his speed and just to use his arm easily it was difficult for ken felt that his arm wanted to be cracked like a buggywhip  thatll do whispered worry were only takin five minutes practice say but theres a crowd are you all right pegcoollike and determined good saybut peg youd better look these fellows over  i remember them all replied ken thats gallagher on the end of the bench burr is third from him sterns fussing over the bats and theres hill the lightheaded fellow looking this way theres  thatll do said worry there goes the gong its all off now homans has chosen to take the field i guess mebbe you wont show em how to pitch a new white ball get at em now then he called ken back as if impelled and whispered to him in a husky voice its been tough for you and for me listen heres where it begins to be sweet  ken trotted out to the box to the encouraging voices of the infield and he even caught reddy rays low thrilling call from the far outfield  play with the ringing order which quieted the audience the umpire tossed a white ball to ken  for a single instant ken trembled ever so slightly in all his limbs and the stands seemed a revolving blackandwhite band then the emotion was as if it had never been he stepped upon the slab keensighted cool and with his pitching game outlined in his mind  burr the curlyhaired leader of hernes batting list took his position to the left of the plate ken threw him an underhand curve sweeping high and over the inside corner burr hit a lofty fly to homans hill the bunter was next for him ken shot one straight over the plate hill let it go by and it was a strike ken put another in the same place and hill attempting to bunt fouled a little fly which dean caught gallagher strode third to bat he used a heavy club stood righthanded over the plate and looked aggressive ken gave the captain a long study and then swung slowly sending up a ball that floated like a feather gallagher missed it on the second pitch he swung heavily at a slow curve far off the outside for a third ken tried the speedy drop and the captain letting it go was out on strikes  the sides changed worry threw a sweater around ken  the ices broke peg and youve got your control that settles it  homans went up to a wavering ripple of applause he drew two balls and then a strike from murphy and hit the next hard into short field frick fumbled the ball recovered it and threw beautifully but too late to catch homans raymond sacrificed sending his captain to second murphy could not locate the plate for reddy ray and let him get to first on four balls weir came next homans signed he was going to run on the first pitch weir hitting with the runner sent a double into right field and homans and ray scored the bleachers cheered homans ran down to third base to the coaching lines and ray went to first base both began to coach the runner dean hit into short field and was thrown out while weir reached third on the play  two out now hit yelled homans to blake  blake hit safely over second scoring weir then trace flied out to left field  three runs called homans boys thats a start three more runs and this games ours now peg now  ken did not need that trenchant thrilling now the look in worrys eyes had been enough he threw speed to halloway and on the third ball retired him raymond to mccord stern came second to bat in kens mind this player was recorded with a weakness on low curves and ken found it with two balls pitched stern popped up to blake frick a new player to ken let a strike go by and missed a drop and a fast ball  they cant touch you ken called raymond as he tossed aside his glove  faint cheers rose from scattered parts of the grandstand and here and there shouts and yells the audience appeared to stir to become animated and the herne players settled down to more sober action on the field  mccord made a bid for a hit but failed because of fast work by stern ken went up eager to get to first in any way he let murphy pitch and at last after fouling several good ones he earned his base on balls once there he gave homans the sign that he would run on the first pitch and he got a fair start he heard the crack of the ball and saw it glinting between short and third running hard he beat the throwin to third with two runners on bases raymond hit to deep short ken went out trying to reach home again reddy ray came up and got a base on balls filling the bases the crowd began to show excitement and seemed to be stifling cheers in suspense weir hurried to bat his shock of hair waving at every step he swung hard on the first ball and missing it whirled down bothering the catcher homans raced home on a halfpassed ball then weir went out on a fly to centre  peg keep at them called reddy ray weve got murphys measure  it cost ken an effort to deliberate in the box to think before he pitched he had to fight his eagerness but he wasted few balls and struck mercer out van sant hit to weir who threw wild to first allowing the runner to reach third murphy batting next hit one which ken put straight over the plate and it went safe through second scoring van sant the herne rooters broke out in loud acclaim burr came up choking his bat up short again ken gave him the high wide curve he let it pass and the umpire called it a strike ken threw another a little outside this time evidently burr was trying out kens control  he cant put them over yelled gallagher from the coaching line heres where he goes up wait him out burr good eye old man heres where we explode the freshman  ken glanced at gallagher and laughed then he sped up another high curve which the umpire called a strike  thats the place peg put another there floated from reddy in the outfield  burr swung viciously hitting a bounder toward second base raymond darted over went down with his birdlike quickness came up with the ball and then he touched the bag and threw to first it was a play in which he excelled the umpire called both runners out retiring the side a short sharp yell like a bark burst from the bleachers  worry was smilingly thoughtful as his boys trotted in to bat  say if you get a couple of runs this time well be it look at the students ready to fall out of the stands peg im glad herne got a run now we wont think of a shutout thatll steady us up and boys break loose now for the games ours  dean started off with a clean single on the first pitch he broke for second and had to slide to make it as blake missed the strike then blake went out to first trace walked mccord poked a little fly over the infield scoring dean ken fouled out the unerring homans again hit safely sending trace in with two out and mccord on third and homans on second raymond laid down a beautiful bunt tallying mccord and when the herne catcher tried to head homans from making third raymond kept on toward second it was a daring dash and he dove to the bag with a long slide but the decision was against him  the coach called homans ward and ray to him and gathered them close together  boys listen he said low and tense macneff and prince of place are in the grandstand just behind the plate theyre up there to get a line on peg well fool em and make em sick in the bargain peg you let out this innin and show up the first three hitters then ill take you out and let schoonover finish the game see  take meout echoed ken  thats it if you make these next three hitters look like monkeys dont you see weve got the herne game cinched we dont need to use our star twirler see thatll be a bone for place to chew on how about it cap what do you think reddy  oh worry if we dared to do it homans exclaimed under his breath herne would never get over it and it would scare place to death but worry reddy dare we risk it  its playin into our very hands replied worry his hazel eyes were afire with inspiration  reddy rays lean jaw bulged  homans its the trick and we can turn it  whats the score7 to 1 muttered homans it was a tight place for him and he seemed tortured between ambition and doubt  that fellow murphy hasnt got one in my groove yet said reddy im due to lace one were good for more runs  that decided homans he patted ken on the shoulder and led him out to the box but he never spoke a word  ken felt like a wild colt just let loose he faced hill with a smile and then taking his long overhand swing he delivered the jump ball hill made no move the umpire called strike the crowd roared ken duplicated the feat then hill missed the third strike gallagher walked up doggedly and ken smiled at him too then using three wicked darting drops ken struck gallagher out  thats twice called reddys penetrating voice from the outfield give him a paddle  halloway drew two balls and then three strikes  ken ran for the bench amid an uproar most strange and startling to his untried ear the long tardy and stubborn students had broken their silence  dale leaped out of the grandstand to lead the cheering the giant stevens came piling out of the bleachers to perform a like office and then they were followed by bryan captain of the crew and hilbrandt captain of the track team four captains of wayne teams inspiriting and directing the cheering kens bewildered ears drank in one long thundering ward ward ward and then his hearing seemed drowned the whole mass of students and spectators rose as one and the deafening stamp of feet only equalled the roar of voices but now the volume of sound was regular and rhythmic it was like the approach of a terrible army for minutes while the umpire held play suspended the wayne supporters in hoarse and stamping tumult came into their own again it was a wild burst of applause and as it had been long delayed so now it was prolonged fiercely to the limit of endurance  when those waves of sound had rolled away ken ward felt a difference in grant field in the varsity in himself a different color shone from the sky  ken saw reddy ray go to bat and drive the ball against the rightfield fence then as the sprinter got into his wonderful stride once more the whole audience rose in yelling crashing clamor and when on weirs fly to the outfield reddy raced in to the plate making the throwin look feeble again the din was terrific  as one in a glorious dream ken ward crouched upon the bench and watched the remainder of that game he grasped it all as if baseball was all that made life worth living and as if every moment was his last he never thought of himself he was only a part of the team and that team every moment grew sharper faster fiercer he revelled in the game schoonover was hit hard but fast play by raymond and weir kept hernes score down the little secondbaseman was here there everywhere like a glint of light herne made runs but wayne also kept adding runs blake caught a foul fly off the bleachers trace made a beautiful catch mccord was like a tower at first base and little dean went through the last stages of development that made him a star  once in the eighth inning ken became aware that worry was punching him in the back and muttering  look out peg listen murphyll get one in reddys groove this time ohh  the crack of the ball as well as worrys yell told ken what had happened besides he could see and as the ball lined away for the fence and the sprinter leaped into action ken jumped up and screamed  oh reddy its overover no run run ohhh  in the shrill piercing strife of sound kens scream seemed only a breath at his ears he held to it almost splitting his throat while the sprinter twinkled round third base and came home like a thunderbolt  another inning passed a confusion of hits throws runs and plays to ken and then worry was pounding him again  dig for the traininhouse yelled worry mouth on his ear the students are crazy theyll eat us alive theyre tearin the bleachers down run for it peg     xv  a matter of principle   ken found himself running across grant field pursued by a happy roaring mob of students they might have been indians judging from the way ken and his fellowplayers fled before them the trained athletes distanced their wellmeaning but violent pursuers and gained the gate but it was a close shave the boys bounded up the street into the traininghouse and locked the door till the puffing arthurs arrived they let him in and locked the door again  in another moment the street resounded with the rush of many feet and the yells of frantic students murray the trainer forced a way through the crowd and up the stoop he closed and barred the outside door and then pounded upon the inside door for admittance worry let him in  theyd make a bowlfight or a football rush look tame panted murray hey scottylock up tight down in the basement for heavens sake dont let that push get in on us lock the windows in the front  whos that poundin on the door yelled worry he had to yell for the swelling racket outside made ordinary conversation impossible  dont open it shouted murray what do we care for teamcaptains college professors athletic directors or students theyre all out there and theyre crazy i tell you i never saw the like itd be more than i want to get in that jam and itd never do for the varsity somebody would get crippled sure im training this baseball team  murray in his zealous care of his athletes was somewhat overshooting the mark for not one of the boys had the slightest desire to be trusted to the mob outside in fact ken looked dazed and raymond scared to the point of trembling trace was pale and all the others except homans and reddy ray showed perturbation nor were the captain and sprinter deaf to the purport of that hour only in their faces shone a kindling glow and flush  byandby the boys slipped to their rooms removed their uniforms dressed and crept downstairs like burglars and went in to dinner outside the uproar instead of abating gathered strength as time went by at the dinnertable the boys had to yell in each others ears they had to force what they ate no one was hungry when worry rose from the table they all flocked after him  it was growing dark outside and a red glow brightening upon the windows showed the students had lighted bonfires  theyre goin to make a night of it yelled worry  howll my boys be able to sleep shouted murray both coach and trainer were as excited as any of the boys  the streets packed solid listen  the tramp tramp tramp of thousands of feet keeping time was like the heavy tread of a marching multitude then the tramp died away in a piercing cheer wayne nine times clear and sustaineda long beautiful college cheer in the breathing spell that followed the steady tramp of feet went on one by one at intervals the university yells were given the broken rattling rally the floating melodious crew cheer and the hoarse smashing boom of football then again the inspiriting wayne nine times after that came shrill calls for the varsity for homans reddy ray raymond and peggie ward  come upstairs to the windows boys shouted worry weve got to show ourselves  worry threw up the windows in weirs room and the boys gingerly poked their heads out a roar greeted their appearance the heads all popped in as if they had been struck  homans youll have to make a speech cried the coach  i will not  youve got to say somethin we cant have this crazy gang out here all night  then worry and murray coaxed and led homans to the window the captain leaned out and said something that was unintelligible in the hubbub without the crowd cheered him and called for reddy ward and raymond worry grasped the secondbaseman and shoved him half over the sill raymond would have fallen out but for the coachs strong hold  come on peg yelled worry  not on your life cried ken in affright he ran away from the coach and dived under the bed but reddy ray dragged him out and to the window and held him up in the bright bonfire glare then he lifted a hand to silence the roaring crowd  fellows here he isworrys demon waynes pitcher called reddy in ringing farreaching voice listen peggie didnt lose his nerve when he faced herne today but hes lost it now hes lost his voice too but he says for you to go away and save your cheers for this day two weeks when we meet place then he says youll have something to cheer for  the crafty sprinter knew how to appeal to the students all of voice and strength and enthusiasm left in them went up in a mighty bawl that rattled the windows and shook the house they finished with nine waynes and a long rousing peggie ward and then they went away  by george look here peg said reddy earnestly they gave you waynes nine waynes nine do you hear i never knew a freshman varsity man to get that cheer  youve got to beat place now after tellin em youd do it added worry  but worry i didnt say a wordit was reddy replied ken in distress  same thing rejoined the coach now boys lets quiet down and talk over the game i wont waste any time jollyin you i couldnt praise you enough if i spent the rest of the season tryin to one and all by yourselves and in a bunch you played herne off their feet ill bet macneff and prince are dizzy figurin whatll happen saturday week as to the score why scores dont mean much to us  what was the score anyway asked ken  the boys greeted this with shouts of doubtful laughter and worry glanced with disapproval at his star  peg you keep me guessin a lot but not to know how much we beat herne would be more n i could stand on the level now dont you know the score  fair and square i dont worry you never would let me think of how many runs we had or needed i can count sevenyes and one more that was reddys homerun  peg you must have been up in the air a little 14 to 4 thats it and we didnt take our bat in the last of the ninth  then followed worrys critical account of the game and a discussion in which the boys went over certain plays during the evening many visitors called but did not gain admission the next morning however worry himself brought in the newspapers which heretofore he had forbidden the players to read and he told them they were now free to have any callers or to go where they liked there was a merry scramble for the papers and presently the readingroom was as quiet as a church  the account that held ken ward in rapt perusal was the morning timesstars at first the print blurred in kens sight then he read it over again he liked the glowing praise given the team and was shamefully conscious of the delight in his name in large letters a third time he read it guiltily this time for he did not dream that his comrades were engrossed in like indulgence                 wayne outclasses herne          arthurs develops another great team           peggie ward and reddy ray stars    wayne defeated herne yesterday 14 to 4 and thereby   leaped into the limelight it was a surprise to   every one herne most of all owing to the stringent   eligibility rules now in force at wayne and the   barring of the old varsity nothing was expected of   this seasons team arthurs the famous coach has   built a wonderful nine out of green material and   again establishes the advisability of professional   coaches for the big universities    with one or two exceptions waynes varsity is made   up of players developed this year homans the   captain was well known about town as an amateur   player of ability but arthurs has made him into   a great field captain and a basegetter of remarkable   skill an unofficial computing gives him the batting   average of 536 no captain or any other player of   any big college team in the east ever approached   such percentage as that it is so high that it must   be a mistake    reddy ray the intercollegiate champion in the sprints   is the other seasoned player of the varsity and it is   safe to say that he is the star of all the college   teams a wonderful fielder a sure and heavy hitter   and like a flash on the bases he alone makes homans   team formidable    then there is peg ward worry arthurs demon pitcher   of freshman bowlfight fame this lad has been arriving   since spring and now he has arrived he is powerful   and has a great arm he seems to pitch without effort   has twice the speed of dale and is as cool in the box   as a veteran but it is his marvellous control of the   ball that puts him in a class by himself in the fourth   inning of yesterdays game he extended himself probably   on orders from coach arthurs and struck out hernes   three best hitters on eleven pitched balls then he   was taken out and schoonover put in this whiteheaded   lad is no slouch of a pitcher bytheway but it must   have been a bitter pill for herne to swallow the proud   herne varsity have been used to knocking pitchers out   of the box instead of seeing them removed because   they were too good also macneff and prince of place   who saw the game must have had food for reflection   they did not get much of a line on young ward and   what they saw will not give them pleasant dreams   we pick ward to beat the heavyhitting place team    other youngsters of arthurs nine show up well   particularly raymond and weir who have springs in   their feet and arms like whips altogether arthurs   varsity is a strangely assorted a wonderfully chosen   group of players we might liken them to the mechanism   of a fine watch with ward as the mainspring and   the others with big or little parts to perform but   each dependent upon the other waynes greatest   baseball team   ken read it all thirstily wonderingly and recorded it deep in the deepest well of his memory it seemed a hundred times as sweet for all the misery and longing and fear and toil which it had cost to gain  and each succeeding day grew fuller and richer with its meed of reward all the boys of the varsity were sought by the students ken most of all everywhere he went he was greeted with a regard that made him still more bashful and ashamed if he stepped into carlton club it was to be surrounded by a frankly admiring circle of students he could not get a moment alone in the library professors had a smile for him and often stopped to chat the proudest moment of his college year was when president halstead met him in the promenade and before hundreds of students turned to walk a little way with him there seemed not to be a single student of the university or any one connected with it who did not recognize him bryan took him to watch the crew practise stevens played billiards with him at the club dale openly sought his society then the fraternities began to vie with one another for ken in all his life he had not imagined a fellow could be treated so well it was an open secret that ken ward was extremely desired in the best fraternities he could not have counted his friends through it all by thinking of worry and the big games coming he managed to stay on his feet  one morning when he was at the height of this enjoyable popularity he read a baseball note that set him to thinking hard the newspaper commenting on the splendid results following waynes new athletic rules interpreted one rule in a way astounding to ken it was something to the effect that all players who had been on a team which paid any player or any expenses of any player were therefore ineligible interpretation of the rules had never been of any serious moment to ken he had never played on any but boy teams but suddenly he remembered that during a visit to the mountains with his mother he had gone to a place called eagles nest a summer hotel colony it boasted of a good ball team and had a rival in the glenwoods a team from an adjoining resort ken had been in the habit of chasing flies for the players in practice one day eagles nest journeyed over to glenwood to play and being short one player they took ken to fill in he had scarcely started in the game when the regular player appeared thus relieving him the incident had completely slipped kens mind until recalled by the newspaper note  whereupon ken began to ponder he scouted the idea of that innocent little thing endangering his eligibility at wayne but the rule thus made clear stood out in startlingly blackandwhite relief eagles nest supported a team by subscription among the hotel guests ken had ridden ten miles in a bus with the team and had worn one of the uniforms for some few minutes therefore upon a technicality perhaps he had been on a summer nine and had no right to play for wayne  ken went to homans and told him the circumstance the captain looked exceedingly grave then getting more particulars he relaxed  youre safe peg youre perfectly innocent but dont mention it to any one else especially worry hed have a fit what a scare youd throw into the varsity camp forget the few minutes you wore that eagles nest suit  for the time being this reassured ken but after a while his anxiety returned homans had said not to mention it and that bothered ken he lay awake half of one night thinking about the thing it angered him and pricked his conscience and roused him he wanted to feel absolutely sure of his position for his own sake first of all so next morning he cornered worry and blurted out the secret  peg whatre you givin me he ejaculated  ken repeated his story somewhat more clearly and at greater length worry turned as white as a ghost  good gracious peg you havent told anybody  no one but homans  worry gave a long sigh of relief and his face regained some of its usual florid color  well thats all right then say didnt i tell you once that i had a weak heart peg of course youre an amateur or there never was one but em fathead directors why i wouldnt have em find that out for a million dollars theyre idiots enough to make a shinin example of you right before the place games keep it under your hat see  this last was in the nature of a command and ken had always religiously obeyed worry he went to his room feeling that the matter had been decided for him relief however did not long abide with him he began to be torn between loyalty to worry and duty to himself he felt guiltless but he was not sure of it and until he was sure he could not be free in mind suddenly he thought of being actually barred from the varsity and was miserable that he could not bear strong temptation now assailed ken and found him weak a hundred times he reconciled himself to worrys command to homans point of view yet every time something rose within him and rebelled but despite the rebellion ken almost gave in he fought off thought of his new sweet popularity of the glory of being waynes athletic star he fought to look the thing fairly in the face to him it loomed up a hundredfold larger than an incident of his baseball career and so he got strength to do the thing that would ease the voice of conscience he went straight to the coach  worry ive got to go to the directors and tell them iim sorry but ive got to do it  he expected a storm of rage from worry but never had the coach been so suave so kindly so magnetic he called homans and raymond and weir and others who were in the house at the moment and stated kens case his speech flowed smooth and rapid the matter under his deft argument lost serious proportions but it seemed to ken that worry did not tell the boys the whole truth or they would not have laughed at the thing and made him out oversensitive and ken was now growing too discouraged and bewildered to tell them moreover he was getting stubborn the thing was far from a joke the cunning of the coach proved that worry wound the boys round his little finger  at this juncture reddy ray entered the traininghouse  more than once ken had gone to the great sprinter with confidences and troubles and now he began impulsively hurriedly incoherently to tell the story  and reddy concluded ken ive got to tell the directors its somethinghard for me to explain i couldnt pitch another game with this hanging over me i musttell themand take my medicine  sure its a matter of principle replied reddy in his soft slow voice his keen eyes left kens pale face and met the coachs worry ill take peg up to see the athletic faculty i know andrews the president and hes the one to hear pegs story  worry groaned and sank into a chair crushed and beaten then he swore something unusual in him then he began to rave at the fatheaded directors then he yelled that he would never coach another ball team so long as he lived  ken followed reddy out of the traininghouse and along the street the fact that the sprinter did not say a word showed ken he was understood and he felt immeasurably grateful they crossed the campus and entered college hall to climb the winding stairway to ken that was a long hateful climb andrews and another of the directors whom ken knew by sight were in the office they greeted the visitors with cordial warmth  gentlemen began reddy ward thinks he has violated one of the eligibility rules  there was no beating about the bush with reddy ray no shading of fact no distortion of the truth coolly he stated the case but strangely to ken the very truth told by reddy in this way somehow lost its terrors kens shoulders seemed unburdened of a terrible weight  andrews and his colleague laughed heartily  you seeii forgot all about it said ken  yes and since he remembered hes been worrying himself sick resumed reddy couldnt rest till hed come over here  ward its much to your credit that you should confide something there was never any chance of becoming known said the president of the athletic faculty we appreciate it you may relieve your mind of misgivings as to your eligibility even if we tried i doubt if we could twist a rule to affect your standing and you may rest assured we wouldnt try in the case of so fine a young fellow and so splendid a pitcher for wayne  then andrews courteously shook hands with ken and reddy and bowed them out ken danced halfway down the stairway and slid the rest on the bannister  reddy wasnt he just fine cried ken all palpitating with joy  well peg andrews is a nice old thing if you approach him right replied reddy dryly you wouldnt believe me would you if i said i had my heart in my throat when we went in  no i wouldnt replied ken bluntly  i thought not said reddy then the gravity that had suddenly perplexed ken cleared from the sprinters face peg lets have some fun with worry and the boys  im in for anything now  well go back to the traininghouse with long faces when we get in you run upstairs as if you couldnt face any one but be sure to sneak back to the head of the stairs to see and hear the fun ill fix worry all right now dont flunk its a chance  ken could not manage to keep a straight face as they went in so he hid it and rushed upstairs he bumped into raymond knocking him flat  running to a fire again growled raymond got a firemedal havent you always falling over people  ken tried to simulate ungovernable rage and impotent distress at once he waved one fist and tore his hair with the other hand  get out of my way roared ken whatll you say when i tell you im barred from the varsity  oh ken no nodont say it faltered raymond all sympathy in an instant  ken ran into his room closed the door and then peeped out he saw raymond slowly sag downstairs as if his heart was broken then ken slipped out and crawled down the hall till he could see into the readingroom all the boys were there with anxious faces crowded round the coach worry was livid reddy ray seemed the only calm person in the room and he had tragedy written all over him  out with it shouted worry dont stand there like a mournful preacher what did em fatheads say  reddy threw up his hands with a significant gesture  i knew it howled worry jumping up and down i knew it why did you take the kid over there why didnt you let me and homans handle this thing you redheaded ironjawed coldblooded windchaser youve done it now havent you ioh  worry began to flounder helplessly  they said a few more things went on reddy peg is barred raymond is barred i am barred i told them about my baseball career out west the directors said some pretty plain things about you worry im sorry to tell youre a rotten coach in fact you ought to be a coach at an undertakers homans gets the credit for the work of the team they claim you are too hard on the boys too exacting too brutal in fact andrews recited a record of your taking sandwiches from us and aiding and abetting murray in our slow starvation the directors will favor your dismissal and urge the appointment of professor rhodes who as coach will at least feed us properly  reddy stopped to catch his breath and gain time for more invention of all the unhappy mortals on earth worry arthurs looked the unhappiest he believed every word as if it had been gospel and that about professor rhodes was the last straw  ken could stand the deception no longer he marvelled at reddys consummate lying and how he could ever stand that look on worrys face bounding downstairs four steps at a jump ken burst like a bomb upon the sadfaced group  oh worry its all a joke     xvi  the first place game   rain prevented the second herne game which was to have been played on the herne grounds it rained steadily all day friday and saturday to the disappointment of waynes varsity the coach however admitted that he was satisfied to see the second contest with herne go by the board  i dont like big games away from home said worry its hard on new teams besides we beat herne to death over here mebbe we couldnt do it over there though i aint doubtin but its place were after and if wed had that game at herne we couldnt have kept place from gettin a line on us so im glad it rained  the two place games fell during a busy week at wayne wednesday was the beginning of the commencement exercises and only a comparatively few students could make the trip to place but the night before the team left the students four thousand strong went to the traininghouse and filled a halfhour with college songs and cheers  next morning dale and stevens heading a small band of wayne athletes and graduates met the team at the railroad station and boarded the train with them worry and homans welcomed them and soon every wayne player had two or more for company either by accident or design ken could not tell which dale and stevens singled him out for their especial charge the football captain filled one seat with his huge bulk and faced ken and dale sat with a hand on kens shoulder  peg were backing you for all were worth said stevens but this is your first big game away from home its really the toughest game of the season place is a hard nut to crack any time and her players on their own backyard are scrappers who can take a lot of beating and still win out then theres another thing thats no small factor in their strength they are idolized by the students and rooting at place is a science they have a yell that beats anything you ever heard itll paralyze a fellow at a critical stage but that yell is peculiar in that it rises out of circumstances leading to almost certain victory that is place has to make a strong bid for a close hard game to work up that yell so if it comes today you be ready for it have your ears stuffed with cotton and dont let that yell blow you up in the air  dale was even more earnest than stevens  peg place beat me over here last year beat me 63 they hit me harder than i ever was hit before i guess you went down to washington worry said to look them over tell me what you thinkhow you sized them up  dale listened attentively while ken recited his impressions  youve got prince and macneff figured exactly right replied dale prince is the football captain bytheway be careful how you run into second base if you ever slide into him head firstgoodbye hes a great player and he can hit any kind of a ball macneff now just as you said is weak on a high ball close in and he kills a low ball kills is the word he hits them a mile but peg i think youre a little off on keene starke and martin the other place cracks theyre veterans hard to pitch to they make you cut the plate they are as apt to bunt as hit and they are fast they keep a fellow guessing i think starke pulls a little on a curve but the others have no weakness i ever discovered but peg i expect you to do more with them than i did my control was never any too good and you can throw almost as straight as a fellow could shoot a rifle then your high fast ball that one you get with the long swing it would beat any team only im wondering im askingcan you use it right along in the face of such coaching and yelling and hitting as youll run against today im asking deliberately because i want to give you confidence  why yes dale i think i can im pretty sure of it that ball comes easily only a little longer swing and more snap and honestly dale i hardly ever think about the plate i know where it is and i could shut my eyes and throw strikes  peg youre a wonder replied dale warmly if you can do thatand hang me if i doubt ityou will make place look like a lot of dubs were sure to make a few runs homans and ray will hit salisbury hard theres no fence on place field and every ball reddy hits past a fielder will be a homerun you can gamble on that so set a fast clip when you start in and hang  some time later when ken had changed seats and was talking to raymond he heard worry say to somebody  well if peg dont explode today he never will i almost wish he would hed be better for it afterward  this surprised ken annoyed him and straightway he became thoughtful why this persistent harping on the chance of his getting excited from one cause or another losing his control and thereby the game ken had not felt in the least nervous about the game he would get so presently if his advisers did not stop hinting then worrys wish that he might explode was puzzling a little shade of gloom crept over the bright horizon of kens hopes almost unconsciously vague doubts of himself fastened upon him for the first time he found himself looking forward to a baseball game with less eagerness than uncertainty stubbornly he fought off the mood  place was situated in an old college town famed for its ancient trees and quaint churches and inns the wayne varsity arriving late put on their uniforms at the st george a tavern that seemed never to have been in any way acquainted with a college baseball team it was very quiet and apparently deserted for that matter the town itself appeared deserted the boys dressed hurriedly in silence with frowning brows and compressed lips worry arthurs remained downstairs while they dressed homans looked the team over and then said  boys come on todays our hardest game  it was only a short walk along the shady street to the outskirts of the town and the athletic field the huge stands blocked the view from the back and side homans led the team under the bleachers through a narrow walledin aisle to the side entrance and there gave the word for the varsity to run out upon the field a hearty roar of applause greeted their appearance  ken saw a beautiful green field level as a floor with a great halfcircle of stands and bleachers at one end one glance was sufficient to make kens breathing an effort he saw a glittering mass a broad moving band of color everywhere waved place flags bright gold and blue white faces gleamed like daisies on a golden slope in the bleachers close to the first base massed a shirtsleeved crowd of students row on row of them thousands in number ken experienced a little chill as he attached the famous place yell to that significant placing of rooters a soft breeze blew across the field and it carried low laughter and voices of girls a merry hum and subdued murmur and an occasional clear shout the whole field seemed keenly alive  from the bench ken turned curious eager eyes upon the practising place men never had he regarded players with as sharp an interest curiosity being mingled with admiration and confidence with doubt macneff the captain at first base veteran of three years was a tall powerful fellow bold and decisive in action prince places star on both gridiron and diamond played at second base he was very short broad and heavy and looked as if he would have made three of little raymond martin at shortstop was of slim muscular build keene and starke in centre and left were big men salisbury looked all of six feet and every inch a pitcher he also played end on the football varsity ken had to indulge in a laugh at the contrast in height and weight of wayne when compared to place the laugh was good for him because it seemed to loosen something hard and tight within his breast besides worry saw him laugh and looked pleased and that pleased ken  husky lot of stiffs eh peg said worry reading kens thought but say this aint no football game well make these heavyweights look like icewagons i never was much on beefy ballplayers aha there goes the gong places takin the field that suits me peg listen the games on ive only one word to say to you try to keep solid on your feet  a short cheer electrifying in its force pealed out like a blast  then homans stepped to the plate amid generous handclapping the place adherents had their favorites but they always showed a sportsmanlike appreciation of opponents salisbury wound up took an enormous stride and pitched the ball he had speed homans seldom hit on the first pitch and this was a strike but he rapped the next like a bullet at griffith the thirdbaseman griffith blocked the ball and quickly reaching it he used a snap underhand throw to first catching homans by a narrow margin it was a fine play and the crowd let out another blast  raymond coming up began his old trick of trying to work the pitcher for a base he was small and he crouched down until a wag in the bleachers yelled that this was no kindergarten game raymond was exceedingly hard to pitch to he was always edging over the plate trying to get hit if anybody touched him in practice he would roar like a mad bull but in a game he would cheerfully have stopped cannonballs he got in front of salisburys third pitch and dropping his bat started for first base the umpire called him back thereupon raymond fouled balls and went through contortions at the plate till he was out on strikes  when reddy ray took his position at bat audible remarks passed like a wave through the audience then a long hearty cheer greeted the great sprinter when roar once again subsided into waiting suspense a stronglunged wayne rooter yelled watch him run  the outfielders edged out deeper and deeper macneff called low to salisbury dont let this fellow walk keep them high and make him hit it was evident that place had gotten a line on one wayne player  salisbury delivered the ball and reddy whirled with his level swing there was a sharp crack  up started the crowd with sudden explosive oh  straight as a beeline the ball sped to keene in deep centre and reddy was out  wayne players went running out and place players came trotting in ken however at worrys order walked slowly and leisurely to the pitchers box he received an ovation from the audience that completely surprised him and which stirred him to warm gratefulness then receiving the ball he drew one quick breath and faced the stern issue of the day  as always he had his pitching plan clearly defined in mind and no little part of it was cool deliberation study of the batter to the point of irritating him and then boldness of action he had learned that he was not afraid to put the ball over the plate and the knowledge had made him bold and boldness increased his effectiveness  for keene first batter up ken pitched his fast ball with all his power like a glancing streak it shot over a low whistling ran through the bleachers for the second pitch ken took the same long motion ending in the sudden swing but this time he threw a slow wide tantalizing curve that floated and waved and circled around across the plate it also was a strike keene had not offered to hit either in those two balls perfectly controlled ken deliberately showed the place team the wide extremes of his pitching game  keene he dont waste any hit ordered macneff from the bench the next ball a high curve keene hit on the fly to homans  the flaxenhaired prince trotted up with little short steps ken did not need the wild outburst from the crowd to appreciate this sturdy hero of many gridiron and diamond battles he was so enormously wide almost as wide as he was long that he would have been funny to ken but for the reputation that went with the great shoulders and stumpy legs  ward give me a good one said prince in a low pleasant voice he handled his heavy bat as if it had been light as a yardstick  it was with more boldness than intention of gratifying prince that ken complied using the same kind of ball he had tried first on keene prince missed it the next a low curve he cracked hard to the left of raymond the secondbaseman darted over fielded the ball cleanly and threw prince out  then the long rangy macneff homerun hitter for place faced ken his position at bat bothered ken for he stood almost on the plate remembering macneffs weakness ken lost no time putting a swift inshoot under his chin the place captain lunged round at it grunting with his swing if he had hit the ball it would have been with the handle of his bat so ken knowing his control and sure that he could pitch high shoots all day over the incomer of the plate had no more fear of the place slugger and it took only three more pitches to strike him out  from that on the game seesawed inning by inning ken outpitching salisbury but neither team scored at intervals cheers marked the good plays of both teams and time and again the work of the pitchers earned applause the crowd seemed to be holding back and while they waited for the unexpected the short sharp innings slipped by  trace for wayne led off in the seventh with a safe fly over short ken attempting to sacrifice rolled a little bunt down the thirdbase line and beat the throw with no one out and the head of the batting list up the wayne players awoke to possibilities the same fiery intensity that had characterized their play all season now manifested itself they were all on their feet and weir and mccord on the coaching lines were yelling hoarsely at salisbury tearing up the grass with their spikes dashing to and fro shouting advice to the runners  heres where we score oh you pitcher were due to trim you now steady boys play it safe play it safedont let them double you  up by the bench homans was selecting a bat  worry id better dump one he whispered  thats the trick replied the coach advance them at any cost theres reddy to follow  the reliable salisbury rolled the ball in his hands feinted to throw to the bases and showed his steadiness under fire he put one square over for homans and followed it upon the run homans made a perfect bunt but instead of going along either base line it went straight into the pitchers hands salisbury whirled and threw to prince who covered the bag and forced trace one out and still two runners on bases the crowd uttered a yell and then quickly quieted down raymond bent low over the plate and watched salisburys slightest move he bunted the first ball and it went foul over the thirdbase line he twisted the second toward first base and it too rolled foul and still he bent low as if to bunt again the infield slowly edged in closer but raymond straightened up on salisburys next pitch and lined the ball out prince leaped into the air and caught the ball in his gloved hand homans dove back into first base likewise ken into second just making it in the nick of time for martin was on the run to complete a possible double play a shout at once hoarse and shrill went up and heavy clattering thunder rolled along the floor of the bleachers two out and still two men on bases  if there was a calm person on place field at that moment it was reddy ray but his eyes glinted like sparks as he glanced at the coach  worry ill lace one this time he said and strode for the plate  weir and mccord were shrieking oh look whos up ohh ohh play it safe boys  watch him run  that came from the same deepchested individual who had before hinted of the sprinters fleetness and this time the wayne players recognized the voice of murray how hopeful and thrilling the suggestion was coming from him  the place infield trotted to deep shortfield the outfielders moved out and swung around far to the right salisbury settled down in the box and appeared to put on extra effort as he delivered the ball it was wide the next also went off the outside of the plate it looked as if salisbury meant to pass reddy to first then those on the bench saw a glance and a nod pass between reddy ray and coach arthurs again salisbury pitched somewhat to the outside of the plate but this time reddy stepped forward and swung  crack  swift as an arrow and close to the ground the ball shot to left field starke leaped frantically to head it off and as it took a wicked bound he dove forward head first hands outstretched and knocked it down but the ball rolled a few yards and starke had to recover from his magnificent effort  no one on the field saw ward and homans running for the plate all eyes were on the gray flitting shadow of a sprinter one voice only and that was murrays boomed out in the silence when reddy turned second base starke reached the ball and threw for third it was a beautiful race between ball and runner for the bag as reddy stretched into the air in a long slide the ball struck and shot off the ground with a glancing bound they reached the base at the same time but griffith trying to block the runner went spinning down and the ball rolled toward the bleachers reddy was up and racing plateward so quickly that it seemed he had not been momentarily checked the few wayne rooters went wild  three runs yelled the delirious coaches weir was so overcome that he did not know it was his turn at bat when called in he hurried to the plate and drove a line fly to centre that keene caught only after a hard run  ken ward rose from the bench to go out on the diamond the voices of his comrades sounded far away as voices in a dream  three to the good now ward its yours said captain homans  only nine more batters peg keep your feet leaded called reddy ray  its the seventh and place hasnt made a safe hit oh ken came from raymond  so all the boys vented their hope and trust in their pitcher  there was a mist before kens eyes that he could not rub away the field blurred at times for five innings after the first he had fought some unaccountable thing he had kept his speed his control his memory of batters and he had pitched magnificently but something had hovered over him and had grown more tangible as the game progressed there was a shadow always before his sight  in the last of the seventh with keene at bat ken faced the plate with a strange unsteadiness and a shrinking for which he hated himself what was wrong with him had he been taken suddenly ill anger came to his rescue and he flung himself into his pitching with fierce ardor he quivered with a savage hope when keene swung ineffectually at the high inshoot he pitched another and another and struck out the batter but now it meant little to see him slam down his bat in a rage for ken had a foreboding that he could not do it again when prince came up ken found he was having difficulty in keeping the ball where he wanted it prince batted a hot grounder to blake who fumbled macneff had three balls and one strike called upon him before he hit hard over second base but raymond pounced upon the ball like a tiger dashed over the bag and threw to first getting both runners  wull ken make them hit to me growled raymond  ken sat down upon the bench far from the coach he shunned worry in that moment the warm praise of his fellowplayers was meaningless to him something was terribly wrong he knew he shrank from going into the box again yet dared not admit it to himself he tried to think clearly and found his mind in a whirl when the wayne batters went out in one two three order and it was time for ken to pitch again he felt ice form in his veins  only six more hitters called reddys warning voice it meant cheer and praise from reddy but to ken it seemed a knell  am i weakening muttered ken am i going up in the air what is wrong with me  he was nervous now and could not stand still and he felt himself trembling the ball was wet from the sweat in his hands his hair hung damp over his brow and he continually blew it out of his eyes with all his spirit he crushed back the almost overwhelming desire to hurry hurry hurry once more in a kind of passion he fought off the dreaded unknown weakness  with two balls pitched to starke he realized that he had lost control of his curve he was not frightened for the loss of his curve but he went stiff with fear that he might lose control of his fast ball his best and last resort grimly he swung and let drive starke lined the ball to left the crowd lifted itself with a solid roar and when homans caught the hit near the foul flag subsided with a long groan ken set his teeth he knew he was not right but did any one else know it he was getting magnificent support and luck was still with him  over the pan peg dont waste one floated from reddy warningly  then ken felt sure that reddy had seen or divined his panic how soon would the place players find it out with his throat swelling and his mouth dry and his whole body in a ferment ken pitched to martin the shortstop hit to weir who made a superb stop and throw two out  from all about ken on the diamond came the low encouraging calls of his comrades horton a burly lefthander stepped forward swinging a wagontongue ken could no longer steady himself and he pitched hurriedly one ball two balls one strike three ballshow the big looming horton stood waiting over the plate almost in despair ken threw again and horton smote the ball with a solid rap it was a low bounder raymond pitched forward full length toward first base and the ball struck in his glove with a crack and stuck there raymond got up and tossed it to mccord a thunder of applause greeted this star play of the game  the relief was so great that ken fairly tottered as he went in to the bench worry did not look at him he scarcely heard what the boys said he felt them patting him on the back then to his amaze and slowly mounting certainty of disaster the side was out and it was again his turn to pitch  only three more peg the tail end of the batting list hang on said reddy as he trotted out  kens old speed and control momentarily came back to him yet he felt he pitched rather by instinct than intent he struck griffith out  only two more peg called reddy  the great audience sat in depressed straining silence long since the few wayne rooters had lost their vocal powers  conroy hit a high fly to mccord  oh peg only one more came the thrilling cry no other wayne player could speak a word then  with salisbury up ken had a momentary flash of his old spirit and he sent a straight ball over the plate meaning it to be hit salisbury did hit it and safely through short the long silent long waiting crowd opened up with yells and stamping feet  a horrible cold deadly sickness seized upon ken as he faced the fleet surehitting keene he lost his speed he lost his control before he knew what had happened he had given keene a base on balls two on bases and two out  the place players began to leap and fling up their arms and scream when out of their midst prince ran to the plate a piercing earsplitting sound pealed up from the stands as in a haze ken saw the long lines of whitesleeved students become violently agitated and move up and down to strange crashing yells  then ken ward knew that was the famed place cheer for victory at the last stand it was the trumpetcall of kens ordeal his mind was as full of flashes of thought as there were streaks and blurs before his eyes he understood worry now he knew now what was wrong with him what had been coming all through that terrible game the whole line of stands and bleachers wavered before him and the bright colors blended in one mottled band  still it was in him to fight to the last gasp the pain in his breast and the nausea in his stomach and the whirling fury in his mind did not make him give up though they robbed him of strength the balls he threw to prince were wide of the plate and had nothing of his old speed prince also took his base on balls  bases full and two out  macneff the captain fronted the plate and shook his big bat at ken of all the place hitters ken feared him the least he had struck macneff out twice and deep down in his heart stirred a last desperate rally he had only to keep the ball high and in close to win this game oh for the control that had been his pride  the field and stands seemed to swim round ken and all he saw with his halfblinded eyes was the white plate the batter and dean and the umpire then he took his swing and delivered the ball  it went true macneff missed it  ken pitched again the umpire held up one finger of each hand one ball and one strike two more rapid pitches one high and one wide two strikes and two balls  ken felt his head bursting and there were glints of red before his eyes he bit his tongue to keep it from lolling out he was almost done that ceaseless infernal din had benumbed his being with a wrenching of his shoulder ken flung up another ball macneff leaned over it then let it go by  three and two  it was torture for ken he had the game in his hands yet could not grasp it he braced himself for the pitch and gave it all he had left in him  too low he moaned macneff killed low balls  the big captain leaped forward with a terrific swing and hit the ball it lined over short then began to rise shot over homans and soared far beyond to drop and roll and roll  through darkening sight ken ward saw runner after runner score and saw homans pick up the ball as macneff crossed the plate with the winning run in kens ears seemed a sound of the end of the world  he thought himself the centre of a flying wheel it was the boys crowding around him he saw their lips move but caught no words then choking and tottering upheld by reddy rays strong arm the young pitcher walked off the field     xvii  kens day   the slow return to the tavern dressing and going to the station the ride home the arrival at the traininghouse the closepressing silent companionship of reddy ray worry and raymondthese were dim details of that day of calamity ken wards mind was deadlocked on that fatal moment when he pitched a low ball to macneff his friends left him in the darkness of his room knowing instinctively that it was best for him to be alone  ken undressed and crawled wearily into bed and stretched out as if he knew and was glad he would never move his limbs again the silence and the darkness seemed to hide him from himself his mind was a whirling riot of fire and in it was a lurid picture of that moment with macneff at bat over and over and over he lived it in helpless misery his ears were muffled with that huge tide of sound again and again and again he pitched the last ball to feel his heart stop beating to see the big captain lunge at the ball to watch it line and rise and soar  but gradually exhaustion subdued his mental strife and he wandered in mind and drifted into sleep when he woke it was with a cold unhappy shrinking from the day his clock told the noon hour he had slept long outside the june sunlight turned the maple leaves to gold was it possible ken wondered dully for the sun ever to shine again then scotty came bustling in  mr waurd wont ye be hovin breakfast he asked anxiously  scotty ill never eat again replied ken  there were quick steps upon the stairs and worry burst in rustling a newspaper  hello old man he called cheerily say look at this  he thrust the paper before kens eyes and pointed to a column     place beat wayne by a lucky drive young ward   pitched the greatest game ever pitched on   place field and lost it in the ninth with   two men out and three and two on macneff   kens dull gloomsteeped mind underwent a change but he could not speak he sat up in bed clutching the paper and gazing from it to the coach raymond came in followed by homans and last reddy ray who sat down upon the bed they were all smiling and that seemed horrible to ken  but worryreddyii lost the gamethrew it away faltered ken  oh no peg you pitched a grand game only in the stretch you got one ball too low said reddy  peg you started to go up early in the game added worry with a smile as if the fact was amusing you made your first balloonascension in the seventh and in the ninth you exploded i never seen a better case of upintheair but peg in spite of it you pitched a wonderful game you had me guessin i couldnt take you out of the box darn me if i didnt think youd shut place out in spite of your rattles  thenafter allits not so terrible ken asked breathlessly  why boy its all right we can lose a game and to lose one like thatits as good as winnin say im a liar if i didnt see em place hitters turnin grayheaded listen that game over there was tough on all the kids you most of all of course but you all stood the gaff youve fought out a grillin big game away from home thats over youll never go through that again but it was the makin of you here look this over mebbe itll cheer you up  he took something from raymond and tossed it upon the bed it looked like a round red woolly bundle ken unfolded it to disclose a beautiful sweater with a great white w in the centre  the boys all got em this mornin added worry  it was then that the tragedy of the place game lost its hold on ken and retreated until it stood only dimly in outline  illill be down to lunch said ken irrelevantly  his smiling friends took the hint and left the room  ken hugged the sweater while reading the timesstars account of the game whoever the writer was ken loved him then he hid his face in the pillow and though he denied to himself that he was crying when he arose it was certain that the pillow was wet  an hour later ken presented himself at lunch once more his old amiable self the boys freely discussed baseballin fact for weeks they had breathed and dreamed baseballbut ken noted for the first time where superiority was now added to the old confidence the wayne varsity had found itself it outclassed herne it was faster than place it stood in line for championship honors  peg you neednt put on your uniform today said the coach you rest up but go over to murray and have your arm rubbed is it sore or stiff  not at all i could work again today replied ken  that afternoon alone in his room he worked out his pitching plan for saturdays game it did not differ materially from former plans but for a working basis he had selfacquired knowledge of the place hitters it had been purchased at dear cost he feared none of them except prince he decided to use a high curve ball over the plate and let prince hit trusting to luck and the players behind him ken remembered how the place men had rapped hard balls at raymond most of them were rightfield hitters ken decided to ask homans to play reddy ray in right field also he would arrange a sign with reddy and raymond and mccord so they would know when he intended to pitch speed on the outside corner of the plate for both his curve and fast ball so pitched were invariably hit toward right field when it came to macneff ken knew from the hot rankling deep down in him that he would foil that hitter he intended to make the others hit pitching them always to the best of his judgment and skill those balls they were least likely to hit safely yet which would cut the corners of the plate if let go no bases on balls this game that he vowed grimly and if he got in a pinch he would fall back upon his last resort the fast jump ball and now that he had gone through his baptism of fire he knew he was not likely to lose his control so after outlining his plan he believed beyond reasonable doubt that he could win the game  the evening of that day he confided his plan to reddy ray and had the gratification of hearing it warmly commended while ken was with reddy the coach sent word up to all rooms that the boys were to cut baseball talk they were to occupy their minds with reading study or games  its pretty slow said reddy peg lets have some fun with somebody  im in whatll we do  cant you think youre always leaving schemes to me use your brains boy  ken pondered a moment and then leaped up in great glee  reddy ive got something out of sight he cried  spring it then  well its this kel raymond is perfectly crazy about his new sweater he moons over it and he carries it around everywhere now it happens that kel is a deep sleeper hes hard to wake up ive always had to shake him and kick him to wake him every morning im sure we could get him in that sweater without waking him so tomorrow morning you come down early before seven and help me put the sweater on kel well have worry and the boys posted and well call them in to see kel and then well wake him and swear he slept in his sweater  peg youve a diabolical bent of mind thatll be great ill be on the job bright and early  ken knew he could rely on the chattering of the sparrows in the woodbine round his window they always woke him and this morning was no exception it was after six and a soft balmy breeze blew in ken got up noiselessly and dressed raymond snored in blissful ignorance of the conspiracy presently a gentle tapping upon the door told ken that reddy was in the hall ken let him in and they held a whispered consultation  lets see said reddy picking up the sweater its going to be an allfired hard job this sweaters tight well wake him  not on your life exclaimed ken not if were quick now you roll up the sweater soand stretch it on your handssoand when i lift kel up you slip it over his head itll be like pie  the operation was deftly though breathlessly performed and all it brought from raymond was a sleepy awlemme sleep and then he was gone again  ken and reddy called all the boys most of whom were in their pajamas and worry and scotty and murray and got them all upstairs in raymonds room raymond lay in bed very innocently asleep and no one would have suspected that he had not slept in his sweater  well ill be doggoned ejaculated worry laughing till he cried murray was hugely delighted these men were as much boys as the boys they trained  the roar of laughter awakened raymond and he came out of sleep very languid and drowsy  aw ken lemme sleep smore  he opened his eyes and seeing the room full of boys and men he looked bewildered then suspicious  wull what do all you guys want  we only came in to see you asleep in your new varsity sweater replied ken with charming candor  at this raymond discovered the sweater and he leaped out of bed  its a lie i never slept in it somebody jobbed me ill lick him its a lie i say  he began to hop up and down in a black fury the upper half of him was swathed in the red sweater beneath that flapped the end of his short nightgown and out of that stuck his thin legs all knotted and spotted with honorable bruises won in fielding hardbatted balls he made so ludicrous a sight that his visitors roared with laughter raymond threw books shoes everything he could lay his hands upon and drove them out in confusion  saturday seemed a long time in arriving but at last it came all morning the boys kept close under cover of the traininghouse some one sent them a package of placards these were round in the shape of baseballs they were in the college colors the background of which was a bright red and across this had been printed in white the words peg wards day  what do you think of that cried the boys with glistening eyes but ken was silent  worry came in for lunch and reported that the whole west end of the city had been placarded  the students have had millions of em cards printed said worry theyre everywhere murray told me there was a hundred students tackin em up on the stands and bleachers theyve got em on sticks of wood for pennants for the girls peg wards day well i guess  at twothirty oclock the varsity ran upon the field to the welcoming though somewhat discordant music of the university band what the music lacked in harmony it made up in volume and as noise appeared to be the order of the day it was most appropriate however a great booming cheer from the crowded stands drowned the band  it was a bright summer day with the warm air swimming in the thick golden light of june with white clouds sailing across the blue sky grant field resembled a beautiful crater with short sloping sides of white and gold and great splashes of red and dots of black all encircling a round lake of emerald flashes of gray darted across the green and these were the place players in practice everywhere waved and twinkled and gleamed the redandwhite wayne placards and the front of the stands bore widereaching bands of these colored cards the grandstand with its pretty girls and gowns and waving pennants and darkcoated students resembled a huge mosaic of many colors moving and flashing in the sunlight one stand set apart for the place supporters was a solid mass of blue and gold and opposite to it in vivid contrast was a long circle of bleachers where five thousand redplacarded redribboned wayne students sat waiting to tear the air into shreds with cheers dale and stevens and bryan wearing their varsity sweaters strode to and fro on the cinderpath and each carried a megaphone cheers seemed to lurk in the very atmosphere a soft happy subdued roar swept around the field fun and goodnature and fairplay and love of college pervaded that hum of many voices yet underneath it all lay a suppressed spirit a hidden energy waiting for the battle  when wayne had finished a brief snappy practice kern a national league umpire called the game with place at bat ken ward walked to the pitchers slab amid a prolonged outburst and ten thousand red cards bearing his name flashed like mirrors against the sunlight then the crashing place yell replied in defiance  ken surveyed his fellowplayers from whom came low inspiriting words then facing the batter keene he eyed him in cool speculation and swung into supple action  the game started with a rush keene dumped the ball down the thirdbase line blake anticipating the play came rapidly in and bending while in motion picked up the ball and made a perfect snapthrow to mccord beating keene by a foot prince drove a hot grasscutter through the infield and the place stand let out shrill exultant yells macneff swung powerfully on the first ball which streaked like a flitting wing close under his chin prince with a good lead had darted for second it was wonderful how his little short legs carried him so swiftly and his slide was what might have been expected of a famous football player he hit the ground and shot into the bag just as raymond got deans unerring throw too late again the place rooters howled macneff watched his second strike go by the third pitch remorselessly true to that fatal place retired him on strikes and a roll of thunder pealed from under the wayne bleachers starke struck at the first ball given him the place waiters were not waiting on ken today evidently the word had gone out to hit kens beautiful speedy ball breast high was certainly a temptation starke lifted a long lofty fly far beyond homans who ran and ran and turned to get it gracefully at his breast  worry arthurs sat stern and intent upon the wayne bench get that hit back and go them a run better was his sharp order  the big loosejointed salisbury digging his foot into the dirt settled down and swung laboriously homans waited the pitch was a strike and so was the next but strikes were small matters for the patient homans he drew three balls after that and then on the next he hit one of his short punky safeties through the left side of the infield the wayne crowd accepted it with vigor of hands and feet raymond trotted up aggressive and crafty he intended to bunt and the place infield knew it and drew in closer raymond fouled one then another making two strikes but he dumped the next and raced for the base salisbury big and slow as he was got the ball and threw raymond out homans overran second intending to go on but halted by weirs hoarse coaching he ran back  when reddy ray stepped out it was to meet a rousing cheer and then the thousands of feet went crash crash crash reddy fouled the first ball over the grandstand umpire kern threw out a new one gleaming white the next two pitches were wide the following one reddy met with the short poke he used when hitting to left field the ball went over martins head scoring homans with the first run of the game that allowed the confident wayne crowd to get up and yell long and loud weir fouled out upon the first ball pitched and blake following him forced reddy out at second on an infield hit  place tied the score in the second inning on weirs fumble of martins difficult grounder a sacrifice by horton and griffiths safe fly back of second  with the score tied the teams blanked inning after inning until the fifth wayne found salisbury easy to bat but a place player was always in front of the hit and place found peg ward unsolvable when hits meant runs ken kept up his tireless swift cannonading over the plate making his opponents hit and when they got a runner on base he extended himself with the fast raise ball in the first of the fifth with two out prince met one of kens straight ones hard and fair and drove the ball into the bleachers for a homerun that solid blueandgold square of place supporters suddenly became an insane tossing screeching mêlée  the great hit also seemed to unleash the fiery spirit which had waited its chance the wayne players came in for their turn like angry bees trace got a base on balls dean sacrificed ken also essayed to bunt and fouled himself out on strikes again homans hit safely but the crafty keene playing close held trace at third  we want the score crash crash crash went the bleachers  with raymond up and two out the chance appeared slim for he was not strong at batting but he was great at trying and this time as luck would have it he hit clean through second trace scored and homans taking desperate risk tried to reach home on the hit and failed it was fast exciting work and the crowd waxed hotter and hotter  for place the lumbering horton hit a twisting grounder to mccord who batted it down with his mitt jumped for it turned and fell on the base but too late to get his man griffith swung on kens straight ball and quite by accident blocked a little bunt out of reach of both dean and ken it was a safe hit conroy stepped into kens fast ball which ticked his shirt and the umpire sent him down to first amid the vociferous objections of the wayne rooters  three runners on bases and no one out how the place students bawled and beat their seats and kicked the floor  ken took a longer moment of deliberation he showed no sign that the critical situation unnerved him but his supple shoulders knit closer and his long arm whipped harder as he delivered the ball  salisbury a poor batter apparently shut his eyes and swung with all his might all present heard the ringing crack of the bat but few saw the ball raymond leaped lengthwise to the left and flashed out his glove there was another crack of different sound then raymond bounded over second base kicking the bag and with fiendish quickness sped the ball to first kern the umpire waved both arms wide then to the gasping audience the play became clear raymond had caught salisburys line hit in one hand enabling him to make a triple play a mighty shout shook the stands then strong rhythmic lusty cheers held the field in thrall for the moment while the teams changed sides  in waynes half of the sixth both weir and mccord hit safely but sharp fielding by place held them on base  again the formidable head of places batting order was up keene lined to right field a superb hit that looked good for a triple but it had not the speed to get beyond the fleet sprinter  ken eyed the curlyhaired prince as if he was saying to himself im putting them over today hit if you can  prince appeared to jump up and chop kens first pitch the ball struck on fair ground and bounded very high and was a safe hit prince took a long lead off first base and three times slid back to the bag when ken tried to catch him the fast football man intended to steal ken saw it dean saw it everybody saw it whereupon ken delivered a swift ball outside of the plate as prince went down little dean caught the pitch and got the ball away quick as lightning raymond caught it directly in the baseline and then from the impact of the sliding prince he went hurtling down runner baseman and ball disappeared in a cloud of dust kern ran nimbly down the field and waved prince off  but raymond did not get up the umpire called time worry arthurs ran out and he and weir carried raymond to the bench where they bathed his head and wiped the blood from his face  presently raymond opened his eyes  wull what struck me he asked  oh nothin there was a trolley loose in the field replied worry can you get up why did you try to block that football rusher  raymond shook his head  did i tag the big fat devil he queried earnestly is he out  you got him a mile replied worry  after a few moments raymond was able to stand upon his feet but he was so shaky that worry sent schoonover to second  then the cheering leaders before the bleachers bellowed through their megaphones and the students rising to their feet pealed out nine ringing waynes and added a roaring raymond to the end  with two out kern called play  once again macneff was at bat he had not made a foul in his two times up he was at kens mercy and the wayne rooters were equally merciless  ho the slugging captain comes  get him a board  fluke hitter  mac that was a lucky stab of yours wednesday hit one now  no spectator of that game missed kens fierce impetuosity when he faced macneff he was as keen strung as a wire when he stood erect in the box and when he got into motion he whirled far around swung back bent like a spring and seemed to throw his whole body with the ball onetwothree strikes that waved up in their velocity and macneff for the third time went out  clatter and smash came from the bleachers long stamping of feet whistle and bang for voices had become weak  a hit an error a double play another hit a steal and a forced outthese told waynes dogged unsuccessful trial for the winning run  but worry arthurs had curtly said to his pitcher peg cut loose and man after man for place failed to do anything with his terrific speed it was as if ken had reserved himself wholly for the finish  in the last of the eighth dean hit one that caromed off griffiths shin and by hard running the little catcher made second ken sent him to third on a fielders choice it was then the run seemed forthcoming salisbury toiled in the box to coax the wary homans the wayne captain waited until he got a ball to his liking martin trapped the hit and shot the ball home to catch dean it was another close decision as dean slid with the ball but the umpire decided against the runner  peg lam them over now called reddy ray  it was the first of the ninth with the weak end of places hitting strength to face ken griffith conroy salisbury went down before him as grass before a scythe to every hitter ken seemed to bring more effort more relentless purpose to baffle them more wonderful speed and control of his fast ball  through the stands and bleachers the word went freely that the game would go to ten innings eleven innings twelve innings with the chances against the tiring salisbury  but on the wayne bench there was a different order of conviction worry sparkled like flint homans for once not phlegmatic faced the coaching line at third raymond leaned pale and still against the bench ken was radiant  reddy ray bent over the row of bats and singled out his own his strong freckled hands clenched the bat and whipped it through the air his eyes were on fire when he looked at the stricken raymond  kel something may happen yet before i get up to the plate he said but if it doesnt  then he strode out knocked the dirt from his spikes and stepped into position something about reddy at that moment or something potent in the unforeseen play to come quieted the huge crowd  salisbury might have sensed it he fussed with the ball and took a long while to pitch reddys lithe form whirled around and seemed to get into running motion with the crack of the ball martin made a beautiful pickup of the sharply bounding ball but he might as well have saved himself the exertion the championship sprinter beat the throw by yards  suddenly the whole wayne contingent arose in a body a tribute to what they expected of reddy and rent grant field with one tremendous outburst  as it ceased a hoarse voice of stentorian volume rose and swelled on the air  wayne wins watch him run  it came from murray who loved his great sprinter  thrice salisbury threw to macneff to hold reddy close to first base but he only wasted his strength then he turned toward the batter and he had scarcely twitched a muscle in the beginning of his swing when the keen sprinter was gone like a flash his running gave the impression of something demonlike forced by the wind he had covered the ground and was standing on the bag when prince caught conroys throw  pandemonium broke out in the stands and bleachers and a piercing continuous scream the sprinter could not be stopped that was plain he crouched low watching salisbury again and again the pitcher tried to keep reddy near second base but as soon as martin or prince returned the ball reddy took his lead off the bag he meant to run on the first pitch he was on his toes and the audience went wild and the place varsity showed a hurried nervous strain they yelled to salisbury but neither he nor any one else could have heard a thunderbolt in that moment  again salisbury toed the rubber and he hesitated with his face turned toward second but he had to pitch the ball and as his elbow trembled the sprinter shot out of his tracks with the start that had made him famous his red hair streaked in the wind like a waving flame his beautiful stride swallowed distance then he sailed low and slid into the base as the ball struck griffiths hands  reddy was on third now with no one out with two balls upon weir and no strikes in the fury of sound runner and batter exchanged a glance that was a sign  the sprinter crouched low watching salisbury for the third time as the pitcher vibrated with the nervous force preceding his delivery reddy got his start he was actually running before the ball left salisburys hand almost it seemed that with his marvellous fleetness he was beating the ball to the plate but as the watchers choked in agony of suspense weir bunted the ball and reddy ray flashed across the plate with the winning run  then all that seemed cheering din and stamping roar deadened in an earthshaking sound like an avalanche  the students piled out of the bleachers in streams and poured on the field an irresistible hungry clamoring flood they submerged the players  up went ken upon sturdy shoulders and up went reddy ray and kel and homans and deanall the team and last the redfaced worry arthurs then began the triumphant march about grant field and to the traininghouse  it was a wayne day a day for the varsity for homans and raymond and for the great sprinter but most of all it was peg wards day     xviii  breaking training   the wayne varsity was a muchhandled stormtossed team before it finally escaped the clutches of the students every player had a ringing in his ears and a swelling in his heart when the baseball uniforms came off they were carefully packed in the bottoms of trunks and twelve varsity sweaters received as tender care as if they were the flimsy finery dear to the boys sisters  at six the players were assembled in the big readingroom and there was a babel of exultant conversation worry suddenly came in shouting to persons without who manifestly wanted to enter nothin doin yet ill turn the boys over to you in one hour then he banged the door and locked it  worry was a sight to behold his collar was unbuttoned and his necktie disarranged he had no hat his hair was damp and rumpled and his red face worked spasmodically  wheres peg he yelled and his little bright eyes blinked at his players it was plain that worry could not see very well then some one pushed ken out and worry fell on his neck he hugged him close and hard then he dived at reddy and mauled him next he fell all over little crippled raymond who sat propped up in an armchair for once raymond never murmured for being jumped on upon every player and even the substitutes worry expressed his joy in violent manner and then he fell down himself perspiring beaming utterly exhausted this man was not the cold caustic coach of the cagedays nor the stern hard ruler from the bench nor the smooth worker on his players feelings this was worry arthurs with his varsity at the close of a championship season no one but the boys who had fought at his bidding for wayne ever saw him like that  oh peg it was glorious this game gives us the record and the championship say peg this was the great game for you to win for you made place hit and then when they got runners on bases you shut down on em you made macneff look like a dub you gave that homerun to prince  i sure was after macneffs scalp replied ken and i put the ball over for prince to hit what else could i do why that little chunky cuss has an eye and he can sting the ballhes almost as good as reddy but worry you mustnt give me the credit reddy won the game you know  you talk like a kid replied reddy for once not cool and easy i cut loose and ran some but peg you and raymond won the game  wull you make me sick retorted raymond threatening to get up there wasnt anything to this day but peg ward  ken replied with more heat than dignity and quick as a flash he and reddy and raymond were involved in a wordy war trying to place the credit for winning the game they dragged some of the other boys into the fierce argument  worry laughed and laughed then as this loyal bunch of players threatened to come to blows he got angry  shut up he roared i never seen such a lot of hotheaded kids shut up and let me tell you who won this place game itll go down on record as a famous game so youll do well to have it straight listen the wayne varsity won this game homans your captain won it because he directed the team and followed orders he hit and run some too reddy ray won this game by bein a blue streak of chain lightnin on the bases raymond won it by makin a hit when we all expected him to fall dead he won it twice the second time with the greatest fieldin play ever pulled off on grant field dean won the game by goin up and hangin onto pegs jump ball mccord won it by diggin low throws out of the dirt weir was around when it happened wasnt heand blake and trace then there was peg himself he won the game a little say he had place trimmed when he stepped on the slab in the first innin so you all won the big wayneplace game  then worry advanced impressively to the table put his hand in his breast pocket and brought forth a paper  youve won this for me boys he said spreading the paper out  what is it they asked wonderingly  nothin of much importance to you boys as compared with winnin the game but some to worry arthurs he paused with a little choke its a fiveyear contract to coach waynes baseball teams  a thundering cheer attested to the importance of that document to the boys  oh worry but im glad cried ken then your son harry will be in college next yearwill be on the team  say hell have to go some to make next years varsity with only two or three vacancies to fill now fellows i want to know things sit down now and listen  they all took seats leaving the coach standing at the table  homans is there any hope of your comin back to college next year  none im sorry to say replied the captain father intends to put me in charge of his business  reddy how about a postgraduate course for you you need that pg  worry come to think of it i really believe my college education would not be complete without that pg replied reddy with the old cool speech and a merry twinkle in his eye  at this the boys howled like indians and worry himself did a little wardance  raymond youll come back went on the coach  the secondbaseman appeared highly insulted come back wull what do you take me for id like to see the guy who can beat me out of my place next season  this brought another hearty cheer  further questioning made clear that all the varsity except homans blake and mccord would surely return to college  fine fine fine exclaimed worry  then he began to question each player as to what he intended to do through the summer months and asked him to promise not to play ball on any summer nines  peg youre the one im scared about said worry earnestly these crack teams at the seashore and in the mountains will be hot after you theyve got coin too peg and theyll spend it to get you  all ive got to say is theyll waste their breath talking to me replied ken with a short laugh  what are you goin to do all summer asked worry curiously where will you be  i expect to go to arizona  arizona what in the deuce are you goin way out there for  ken paused and then when about to reply raymond burst out  worry he says its forestry but he only took up that fool subject because he likes to chase around in the woods hes nutty about trees and bears and mustangs he was in arizona last summer you ought to hear some of the stories hes told me why if theyre true hes got frank nelson and jim hawkins skinned to a frazzle  for instance asked worry very much surprised and interested  why stories about how he was chased and captured by outlaws and lassoed bears and had scraps with mexicans and was in wild caves and forest fires and lots about a texas ranger who always carried two big guns ive had the nightmare ever since weve been in the traininghouse oh ken can tell stories all right hes as much imagination as hes got speed with a ball and say worry hes got the nerve to tell me that this summer he expects to help an old hunter lasso mountainlions out there in arizona what do you think of that  its straight goods protested ken solemnly facing the brighteyed boys  we want to go along yelled everybody  say peg i aint stuck on that idee not a little bit replied the coach dubiously  worry has begun to worry about next season hes afraid peg will get that arm chewed off put in reddy  well if ive got to choose between lettin peg chase mountainlions and seein him chased by em fathead directors ill take my chances with the lions  then all in a moment worry became serious  boys its time to break trainin i aint got much to say youre the best team i ever developed let it go at that in a few minutes you are free to go out to the banquets and receptions to all thats waitin for you and it will be great tomorrow you will be sayin goodbye to me and to each other and scatterin to your homes but lets not forget each other and how we plugged this year sure it was only baseball but after all i think good hard play on the square and against long odds will do as much for you as your studies let the old baseball coach assure you of that  he paused paced a few steps to and fro hands behind his back thoughtful and somewhat sad  the members of the varsity sat pale and still faces straight before them eyes shining with memory of that long uphill struggle and glistening too with the thought that the time had come for parting  homans will you please see to the election of the new captain said worry  homans stepped out briskly and placed a hat twelve folded slips of paper and a pencil upon the table  fellows you will follow me in our regular batting order directed homans each man is to write his name on one side of a slip of paper and his choice for captain on the other side drop the paper in the hat  homans seated himself at the table and quickly cast his vote raymond hobbled up next reddy ray followed him and so in silence and with a certain grave dignity of manner that had yet a suggestion of pleasure the members of the varsity voted  when they had resumed their seats homans turned the slips out of the hat and unfolded them  these votes will be given to the athletic directors and kept on record he said but we will never see but one side of them that is waynes rule in electing captains so the players will not know how each voted but this is an occasion i am happy to see when we shall all know who voted for who it shall be a little secret of which we will never speak  he paused while he arranged the slips neatly together  there are here twelve votes eleven have been cast for one playerone for another player will you all please step forward and look  in an intense stillness the varsity surrounded the table there was a sudden sharp gasp from one of them  with a frank glad smile homans held out his hand  captain ward   the end
