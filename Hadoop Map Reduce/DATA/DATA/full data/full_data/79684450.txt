welltilled lowland a darkhaired aethiop people skilful with needle and loom and the arts of the dyer and carver skilful but feeble of heart for they know not the lords of olympus lovers of men neither broadbrowed zeus nor pallas athene teacher of wisdom to heroes bestower of might in the battle share not the cunning of hermes nor list to the songs of apollo fearing the stars of the sky and the roll of the blue salt water fearing all things that have life in the womb of the seas and the livers eating no fish to this day nor ploughing the main like the phoenics manful with blackbeaked ships they abide in a sorrowful region vexed with the earthquake and flame and the seafloods scourge of poseidon    whelming the dwellings of men and the toils of the slowfooted oxen drowning the barley and flax and the hardearned gold of the harvest up to the hillside vines and the pastures skirting the woodland inland the floods came yearly and after the waters a monster bred of the slime like the worms which are bred from the slime of the nile bank shapeless a terror to see and by night it swam out to the seaward daily returning to feed with the dawn and devoured of the fairest cattle and children and maids till the terrified people fled inland    fasting in sackcloth and ashes they came both the king and his people came to the mountain of oaks to the house of the terrible seagods hard by the gulf in the rocks where of old the worldwide deluge sank to the inner abyss and the lake where the fish of the goddess holy undying abide whom the priests feed daily with dainties there to the mystical fish highthroned in her chamber of cedar burnt they the fat of the flock till the flame shone far to the seaward three days fasting they prayed but the fourth day the priests of the goddess cunning in spells cast lots to discover the crime of the people all day long they cast till the house of the monarch was taken cepheus king of the land and the faces of all gathered blackness then once more they cast and cassiopoeia was taken deepbosomed wife of the king whom oft farseeing apollo watched wellpleased from the welkin the fairest of aethiop women fairest save only her daughter for down to the ankle her tresses rolled blueblack as the night ambrosial joy to beholders awful and fair she arose most like in her coming to here queen before whom the immortals arise as she comes on olympus out of the chamber of gold which her son hephaestos has wrought her such in her stature and eyes and the broad white light of her forehead stately she came from her place and she spoke in the midst of the people    pure are my hands from blood  most pure this heart in my bosom yet one fault i remember this day one word have i spoken rashly i spoke on the shore and i dread lest the sea should have heard it watching my child at her bath as she plunged in the joy of her girlhood fairer i called her in pride than atergati queen of the ocean judge ye if this be my sin for i know none other  she ended wrapping her head in her mantle she stood and the people were silent    answered the darkbrowed priests no word once spoken returneth even if uttered unwitting  shall gods excuse our rashness that which is done that abides and the wrath of the sea is against us hers and the wrath of her brother the sungod lord of the sheepfolds fairer than her hast thou boasted thy daughter  ah folly for hateful hateful are they to the gods whoso impious liken a mortal fair though he be to their glory and hateful is that which is likened grieving the eyes of their pride and abominate doomed to their anger what shall be likened to gods  the unknown who deep in the darkness ever abide twyformed manyhanded terrible shapeless woe to the queen for the land is defiled and the people accursed take thou her therefore by night thou illstarred cassiopoeia take her with us in the night when the moon sinks low to the westward bind her aloft for a victim a prey for the gorge of the monster far on the seagirt rock which is washed by the surges for ever so may the goddess accept her and so may the land make atonement purged by her blood from its sin  so obey thou the doom of the rulers    bitter in soul they went out cepheus and cassiopoeia bitter in soul and their hearts whirled round as the leaves in the eddy weak was the queen and rebelled  but the king like a shepherd of people willed not the land should waste so he yielded the life of his daughter    deep in the wane of the night as the moon sank low to the westward they by the shade of the cliffs with the horror of darkness around them stole as ashamed to a deed which became not the light of the sunshine slowly the priests and the queen and the virgin bound in the galley slowly they rowed to the rocks  but cepheus far in the palace sate in the midst of the hall on his throne like a shepherd of people choking his woe dryeyed while the slaves wailed loudly around him they on the seagirt rock which is washed by the surges for ever set her in silence the guiltless aloft with her face to the eastward under a crag of the stone where a ledge sloped down to the water there they set andromeden most beautiful shaped like a goddess lifting her long white arms widespread to the walls of the basalt chaining them ruthless with brass and they called on the might of the rulers    mystical fish of the seas dread queen whom aethiops honour whelming the land in thy wrath unavoidable sharp as the stingray thou and thy brother the sun brainsmiting lord of the sheepfold scorching the earth all day and then resting at night in thy bosom take ye this one life for many appeased by the blood of a maiden fairest and born of the fairest a queen most priceless of victims    thrice they spat as they went by the maid  but her mother delaying fondled her child to the last heartcrushed and the warmth of her weeping fell on the breast of the maid as her woe broke forth into wailing    daughter my daughter forgive me  oh curse not the murderess  curse not how have i sinned but in love  do the gods grudge glory to mothers loving i bore thee in vain in the fatecursed bridebed of cepheus loving i fed thee and tended and loving rejoiced in thy beauty blessing thy limbs as i bathed them and blessing thy locks as i combed them decking thee ripening to woman i blest thee  yet blessing i slew thee how have i sinned but in love  oh swear to me swear to thy mother never to haunt me with curse as i go to the grave in my sorrow childless and lone  may the gods never send me another to slay it see i embrace thy kneessoft knees where no babe will be fondled swear to me never to curse me the hapless one not in the deathpang    weeping she clung to the knees of the maid and the maid low answered curse thee  not in the deathpang  the heart of the lady was lightened slowly she went by the ledge and the maid was alone in the darkness    watching the pulse of the oars die down as her own died with them tearless dumb with amaze she stood as a stormstunned nestling fallen from bough or from eave lies dumb which the homegoing herdsman fancies a stone till he catches the light of its terrified eyeball so through the long long hours the maid stood helpless and hopeless wideeyed downward gazing in vain at the black blank darkness feebly at last she began while wild thoughts bubbled within her guiltless i am  why thus then  are gods more ruthless than mortals have they no mercy for youth no love for the souls who have loved them even as i loved thee dread sea as i played by thy margin blessing thy wave as it cooled me thy wind as it breathed on my forehead bowing my head to thy tempest and opening my heart to thy children silvery fish wreathed shell and the strange lithe things of the water tenderly casting them back as they gasped on the beach in the sunshine home to their motherin vain for mine sits childless in anguish o false sea false sea  i dreamed what i dreamed of thy goodness dreamed of a smile in thy gleam of a laugh in the plash of thy ripple false and devouring thou art and the great world dark and despiteful    awed by her own rash words she was still  and her eyes to the seaward looked for an answer of wrath  far off in the heart of the darkness blight white mists rose slowly beneath them the wandering ocean glimmered and glowed to the deepest abyss and the knees of the maiden trembled and sunk in her fear as afar like a dawn in the midnight rose from their seaweed chamber the choir of the mystical seamaids onward toward her they came and her heart beat loud at their coming watching the bliss of the gods as they wakened the cliffs with their laughter    onward they came in their joy and before them the roll of the surges sank as the breeze sank dead into smooth green foamflecked marble awed and the crags of the cliff and the pines of the mountain were silent onward they came in their joy and around them the lamps of the seanymphs myriad fiery globes swam panting and heaving and rainbows crimson and azure and emerald were broken in starshowers lighting far through the winedark depths of the crystal the gardens of nereus coral and seafan and tangle the blooms and the palms of the ocean    onward they came in their joy more white than the foam which they scattered laughing and singing and tossing and twining while eager the tritons blinded with kisses their eyes unreproved and above them in worship hovered the terns and the seagulls swept past them on silvery pinions echoing softly their laughter around them the wantoning dolphins sighed as they plunged full of love and the great seahorses which bore them curved up their crests in their pride to the delicate arms of the maidens pawing the spray into gems till a fiery rainfall unharming sparkled and gleamed on the limbs of the nymphs and the coils of the mermen    onward they went in their joy bathed round with the fiery coolness needing nor sun nor moon selflighted immortal  but others pitiful floated in silence apart in their bosoms the seaboys slain by the wrath of the seas swept down by the anger of nereus hapless whom never again on strand or on quay shall their mothers welcome with garlands and vows to the temple but wearily pining gaze over island and bay for the sails of the sunken they heedless sleep in soft bosoms for ever and dream of the surge and the seamaids    onward they passed in their joy on their brows neither sorrow nor anger selfsufficing as gods never heeding the woe of the maiden she would have shrieked for their mercy  but shame made her dumb and their eyeballs stared on her careless and still like the eyes in the house of the idols seeing they saw not and passed like a dream on the murmuring ripple    stunned by the wonder she gazed wideeyed as the glory departed o fair shapes far fairer than i  too fair to be ruthless gladden mine eyes once more with your splendour unlike to my fancies you then smiled in the seagleam and laughed in the plash of the ripple awful i deemed you and formless inhuman monstrous as idols lo when ye came ye were women more loving and lovelier only like in all else and i blest you  why blest ye not me for my worship had you no mercy for me thus guiltless  ye pitied the seaboys why not me then more hapless by far  does your sight and your knowledge end with the marge of the waves  is the world which ye dwell in not our world     over the mountain aloft ran a rush and a roll and a roaring downward the breeze came indignant and leapt with a howl to the water roaring in cranny and crag till the pillars and clefts of the basalt rang like a godswept lyre and her brain grew mad with the noises crashing and lapping of waters and sighing and tossing of weedbeds gurgle and whisper and hiss of the foam while thundering surges boomed in the waveworn halls as they champed at the roots of the mountain hour after hour in the darkness the wind rushed fierce to the landward drenching the maiden with spray she shivering weary and drooping stood with her heart full of thoughts till the foamcrests gleamed in the twilight leaping and laughing around and the east grew red with the dawning    then on the ridge of the hills rose the broad bright sun in his glory hurling his arrows abroad on the glittering crests of the surges gilding the soft round bosoms of wood and the downs of the coastland gilding the weeds at her feet and the foamlaced teeth of the ledges showing the maiden her home through the veil of her locks as they floated glistening damp with the spray in a long black cloud to the landward high in the faroff glens rose thin blue curls from the homesteads softly the low of the herds and the pipe of the outgoing herdsman slid to her ear on the water and melted her heart into weeping shuddering she tried to forget them and straining her eyes to the seaward watched for her doom as she wailed but in vain to the terrible sungod    dost thou not pity me sun though thy wild dark sister be ruthless dost thou not pity me here as thou seest me desolate weary sickened with shame and despair like a kid torn young from its mother what if my beauty insult thee then blight it  but meoh spare me spare me yet ere he be here fierce tearing unbearable  see me see me how tender and soft and thus helpless  see how i shudder fancying only my doom  wilt thou shine thus bright when it takes me are there no deaths save this great sun  no fiery arrow lightning or deepmouthed wave  why thus  what music in shrieking pleasure in warm live limbs torn slowly  and darst thou behold them oh thou hast watched worse deeds  all sights are alike to thy brightness what if thou waken the birds to their song dost thou waken no sorrow waken no sick to their pain no captive to wrench at his fetters smile on the garden and fold and on maidens who sing at the milking flash into tapestried chambers and peep in the eyelids of lovers showing the blissful their blissdost love then the place where thou smilest lovest thou cities aflame fierce blows and the shrieks of the widow lovest thou corpsestrewn fields as thou lightest the path of the vulture lovest thou these that thou gazest so gay on my tears and my mothers laughing alike at the horror of one and the bliss of another what dost thou care in thy sky for the joys and the sorrows of mortals colder art thou than the nymphs  in thy broad bright eye is no seeing hadst thou a soulas much soul as the slaves in the house of my father wouldst thou not save  poor thralls they pitied me clung to me weeping kissing my hands and my feetwhat are gods more ruthless than mortals worse than the souls which they rule  let me die  they war not with ashes    sudden she ceased with a shriek  in the spray like a hovering foambow hung more fair than the foambow a boy in the bloom of his manhood goldenhaired ivorylimbed ambrosial over his shoulder hung for a veil of his beauty the goldfringed folds of the goatskin bearing the brass of his shield as the sun flashed clear on its clearness curved on his thigh lay a falchion and under the gleam of his helmet eyes more blue than the main shone awful around him athene shed in her love such grace such state and terrible daring hovering over the water he came upon glittering pinions living a wonder outgrown from the tightlaced gold of his sandals bounding from billow to billow and sweeping the crests like a seagull leaping the gulfs of the surge as he laughed in the joy of his leaping fair and majestic he sprang to the rock and the maiden in wonder gazed for a while and then hid in the darkrolling wave of her tresses fearful the light of her eyes while the boy for her sorrow had awed him blushed at her blushes and vanished like mist on the cliffs at the sunrise fearful at length she looked forth  he was gone  she wild with amazement wailed for her mother aloud  but the wail of the wind only answered sudden he flashed into sight by her side in his pity and anger moist were his eyes and his breath like a rosebed as bolder and bolder hovering under her brows like a swallow that haunts by the houseeaves delicatehanded he lifted the veil of her hair while the maiden motionless frozen with fear wept loud till his lips unclosing poured from their pearlstrung portal the musical wave of his wonder    ah well spoke she the wise one the grayeyed pallas athene known to immortals alone are the prizes which lie for the heroes ready prepared at their feet for requiring a little the rulers pay back the loan tenfold to the man who careless of pleasure thirsting for honour and toil fares forth on a perilous errand led by the guiding of gods and strong in the strength of immortals thus have they led me to thee  from afar unknowing i marked thee shining a snowwhite cross on the darkgreen walls of the seacliff carven in marble i deemed thee a perfect work of the craftsman likeness of amphitrite or farfamed queen cythereia curious i came till i saw how thy tresses streamed in the seawind glistening black as the night and thy lips moved slow in thy wailing speak again nowoh speak  for my soul is stirred to avenge thee tell me what barbarous horde without law unrighteous and heartless hateful to gods and to men thus have bound thee a shame to the sunlight scorn and prize to the sailor  but my prize now for a coward coward and shameless were he who so finding a glorious jewel cast on the wayside by fools would not win it and keep it and wear it even as i will thee for i swear by the head of my father bearing thee over the seawave to wed thee in argos the fruitful beautiful meed of my toil no less than this head which i carry hidden here fearfuloh speak    but the maid still dumb with amazement watered her bosom with weeping and longed for her home and her mother beautiful eager he wooed her and kissed off her tears as he hovered roving at will as a bee on the brows of a rock nymphhaunted garlanded over with vine and acanthus and clambering roses cool in the fierce still noon where streams glance clear in the mossbeds hums on from blossom to blossom and mingles the sweets as he tastes them beautiful eager he kissed her and clasped her yet closer and closer praying her still to speak    not cruel nor rough did my mother bear me to broadbrowed zeus in the depths of the brasscovered dungeon neither in vain as i think have i talked with the cunning of hermes face unto face as a friend or from grayeyed pallas athene learnt what is fit and respecting myself to respect in my dealings those whom the gods should love so fear not to chaste espousals only i woo thee and swear that a queen and alone without rival by me thou sittest in argos of hellas throne of my fathers worshipped by fairhaired kings  why callest thou still on thy mother why did she leave thee thus here  for no foeman has bound thee no foeman winning with strokes of the sword such a prize would so leave it behind him    just as at first some colt wildeyed with quivering nostril plunges in fear of the curb and the fluttering robes of the rider soon grown bold by despair submits to the will of his master tamer and tamer each hour and at last in the pride of obedience answers the heel with a curvet and arches his neck to be fondled cowed by the need that maid grew tame while the hero indignant tore at the fetters which held her  the brass too cunningly tempered held to the rock by the nails deep wedged  till the boy red with anger drew from his ivory thigh keen flashing a falchion of diamond now let the work of the smith try strength with the arms of immortals dazzling it fell and the blade as the vinehook shears off the vinebough carved through the strength of the brass till her arms fell soft on his shoulder once she essayed to escape  but the ring of the water was round her round her the ring of his arms and despairing she sank on his bosom then like a fawn when startled she looked with a shriek to the seaward    touch me not wretch that i am  for accursed a shame and a hissing guiltless accurst no less i await the revenge of the seagods yonder it comes  ah go  let me perish unseen if i perish spare me the shame of thine eyes when merciless fangs must tear me piecemeal  enough to endure by myself in the light of the sunshine guiltless the death of a kid    but the boy still lingered around her loth like a boy to forego her and waken the cliffs with his laughter yon is the foe then  a beast of the sea  i had deemed him immortal titan or proteus self or nereus foeman of sailors yet would i fight with them all but poseidon shaker of mountains uncle of mine whom i fear as is fit for he haunts on olympus holding the third of the world and the gods all rise at his coming unto none else will i yield godhelped  how then to a monster child of the earth and of night unreasoning shapeless accursed    art thou too then a god       no god i smiling he answered mortal as thou yet divine  but mortal the herds of the ocean equal to men in that only and less in all else for they nourish blindly the life of the lips untaught by the gods without wisdom shame if i fled before such    in her heart new life was enkindled worship and trust fair parents of love  but she answered him sighing    beautiful why wilt thou die  is the light of the sun then so worthless worthless to sport with thy fellows in flowery glades of the forest under the broad green oaks where never again shall i wander tossing the ball with my maidens or wreathing the altar in garlands careless with dances and songs till the glens rang loud to our laughter too full of death the sad earth is already  the halls full of weepers quarried by tombs all cliffs and the bones gleam white on the seafloor numberless gnawn by the herds who attend on the pitiless seagods even as mine will be soon  and yet noble it seems to me dying giving my life for a people to save to the arms of their lovers maidens and youths for a while  thee fairest of all shall i slay thee add not thy bones to the many thus angering idly the dread ones either the monster will crush or the seaqueens self overwhelm thee vengeful in tempest and foam and the thundering walls of the surges why wilt thou follow me down can we love in the black blank darkness love in the realms of the dead in the land where all is forgotten why wilt thou follow me down is it joy on the desolate oozes meagre to flit gray ghosts in the depths of the gray salt water beautiful why wilt thou die and defraud fair girls of thy manhood surely one waits for thee longing afar in the isles of the ocean go thy way i mine for the gods grudge pleasure to mortals    sobbing she ended her moan as her neck like a stormbent lily drooped with the weight of her woe and her limbs sank weary with watching soft on the hardledged rock  but the boy with his eye on the monster clasped her and stood like a god and his lips curved proud as he answered    great are the pitiless seagods  but greater the lords of olympus greater the aegiswielder and greater is she who attends him cleareyed justice her name is the counsellor loved of athene helper of heroes who dare in the godgiven might of their manhood greatly to do and to suffer and far in the fens and the forests smite the devourers of men heavenhated brood of the giants twyformed strange without like who obey not the goldenhaired rulers vainly rebelling they rage till they die by the swords of the heroes even as this must die for i burn with the wrath of my father wandering led by athene and dare whatsoever betides me led by athene i won from the grayhaired terrible sisters secrets hidden from men when i found them asleep on the sandhills keeping their eye and their tooth till they showed me the perilous pathway over the waterless ocean the valley that led to the gorgon her too i slew in my craft medusa the beautiful horror taught by athene i slew her and saw not herself but her image watching the mirror of brass in the shield which a goddess had lent me cleaving her brassscaled throat as she lay with her adders around her fearless i bore off her head in the folds of the mystical goatskin hide of amaltheie fair nurse of the aegiswielder hither i bear it a gift to the gods and a death to my foemen freezing the seer to stone to hide thine eyes from the horror kiss me but once and i go    then lifting her neck like a seabird peering up over the wave from the foamwhite swells of her bosom blushing she kissed him  afar on the topmost idalian summit laughed in the joy of her heart farseeing the queen aphrodite    loosing his arms from her waist he flew upward awaiting the seabeast onward it came from the southward as bulky and black as a galley lazily coasting along as the fish fled leaping before it lazily breasting the ripple and watching by sandbar and headland listening for laughter of maidens at bleaching or song of the fisher children at play on the pebbles or cattle that pawed on the sandhills rolling and dripping it came where bedded in glistening purple cold on the cold seaweeds lay the long white sides of the maiden trembling her face in her hands and her tresses afloat on the water    as when an osprey aloft darkeyebrowed royally crested flags on by creek and by cove and in scorn of the anger of nereus ranges the king of the shore if he see on a glittering shallow chasing the bass and the mullet the fin of a wallowing dolphin halting he wheels round slowly in doubt at the weight of his quarry whether to clutch it alive or to fall on the wretch like a plummet stunning with terrible talon the life of the brain in the hindhead then rushes up with a scream and stooping the wrath of his eyebrows falls from the sky like a star while the wind rattles hoarse in his pinions over him closes the foam for a moment and then from the sandbed rolls up the great fish dead and his side gleams white in the sunshine thus fell the boy on the beast unveiling the face of the gorgon thus fell the boy on the beast thus rolled up the beast in his horror once as the dead eyes glared into his then his sides deathsharpened stiffened and stood brown rock in the wash of the wandering water    beautiful eager triumphant he leapt back again to his treasure leapt back again full blest toward arms spread wide to receive him brimful of honour he clasped her and brimful of love she caressed him answering lip with lip while above them the queen aphrodite poured on their foreheads and limbs unseen ambrosial odours givers of longing and rapture and chaste content in espousals happy whom ere they be wedded anoints she the queen aphrodite    laughing she called to her sister the chaste tritonid athene seest thou yonder thy pupil thou maid of the aegiswielder how he has turned himself wholly to love and caresses a damsel dreaming no longer of honour or danger or pallas athene sweeter it seems to the young my gifts are so yield me the stripling yield him me now lest he die in his prime like hapless adonis    smiling she answered in turn that chaste tritonid athene dear unto me no less than to thee is the wedlock of heroes dear who can worthily win him a wife not unworthy and noble pure with the pure to beget brave children the like of their father happy who thus stands linked to the heroes who were and who shall be girdled with holiest awe not sparing of self for his mother watches his steps with the eyes of the gods and his wife and his children move him to plan and to do in the farm and the camp and the council thence comes weal to a nation  but woe upon woe when the people mingle in love at their will like the brutes not heeding the future    then from her goldstrung loom where she wrought in her chamber of cedar awful and fair she arose and she went by the glens of olympus went by the isles of the sea and the wind never ruffled her mantle went by the water of crete and the blackbeaked fleets of the phoenics came to the seagirt rock which is washed by the surges for ever bearing the wealth of the gods for a gift to the bride of a hero there she met andromeden and persea shaped like immortals solemn and sweet was her smile while their hearts beat loud at her coming solemn and sweet was her smile as she spoke to the pair in her wisdom    three things hold we the rulers who sit by the founts of olympus wisdom and prowess and beauty and freely we pour them on mortals pleased at our image in man as a father at his in his children one thing only we grudge to mankind  when a hero unthankful boasts of our gifts as his own stiffnecked and dishonours the givers turning our weapons against us  him ate follows avenging slowly she tracks him and sure as a lymehound sudden she grips him crushing him blind in his pride for a sign and a terror to folly this we avenge as is fit in all else never weary of giving come then damsel and know if the gods grudge pleasure to mortals    loving and gentle she spoke  but the maid stood in awe as the goddess plaited with soft swift finger her tresses and decked her in jewels armlet and anklet and earbell and over her shoulders a necklace heavy enamelled the flower of the gold and the brass of the mountain trembling with joy she gazed so well haephaistos had made it deep in the forges of aetna while charis his lady beside him mingled her grace in his craft as he wrought for his sister athene then on the brows of the maiden a veil bound pallas athene ample it fell to her feet deepfringed a wonder of weaving ages and ages agone it was wrought on the heights of olympus wrought in the goldstrung loom by the finger of cunning athene in it she wove all creatures that teem in the womb of the ocean nereid siren and triton and dolphin and arrowy fishes glittering round manyhued on the flamered folds of the mantle in it she wove too a town where grayhaired kings sat in judgment sceptre in hand in the market they sat doing right by the people wise  while above watched justice and near farseeing apollo round it she wove for a fringe all herbs of the earth and the water violet asphodel ivy and vineleaves roses and lilies coral and seafan and tangle the blooms and the palms of the ocean now from olympus she bore it a dower to the bride of a hero over the limbs of the damsel she wrapt it  the maid still trembled shading her face with her hands for the eyes of the goddess were awful    then as a pine upon ida when southwest winds blow landward stately she bent to the damsel and breathed on her  under her breathing taller and fairer she grew and the goddess spoke in her wisdom    courage i give thee the heart of a queen and the mind of immortals godlike to talk with the gods and to look on their eyes unshrinking fearing the sun and the stars no more and the blue salt water fearing us only the lords of olympus friends of the heroes chastely and wisely to govern thyself and thy house and thy people bearing a godlike race to thy spouse till dying i set thee high for a star in the heavens a sign and a hope to the seamen spreading thy long white arms all night in the heights of the aether hard by thy sire and the hero thy spouse while near thee thy mother sits in her ivory chair as she plaits ambrosial tresses all night long thou wilt shine all day thou wilt feast on olympus happy the guest of the gods by thy husband the godbegotten    blissful they turned them to go  but the fairtressed pallas athene rose like a pillar of tall white cloud toward silver olympus far above ocean and shore and the peaks of the isles and the mainland where no frost nor storm is in clear blue windless abysses high in the home of the summer the seats of the happy immortals shrouded in keen deep blaze unapproachable there ever youthful hebe harmonie and the daughter of jove aphrodite whirled in the whitelinked dance with the goldcrowned hours and the graces hand within hand while clear piped phoebe queen of the woodlands all day long they rejoiced  but athene still in her chamber bent herself over her loom as the stars rang loud to her singing chanting of order and right and of foresight warden of nations chanting of labour and craft and of wealth in the port and the garner chanting of valour and fame and the man who can fall with the foremost fighting for children and wife and the field which his father bequeathed him sweetly and solemnly sang she and planned new lessons for mortals happy who hearing obey her the wise unsullied athene  eversley 1852    hypotheses hypochondriacae 211    and should she die her grave should be upon the bare top of a sunny hill among the moorlands of her own fair land amid a ring of old and mossgrown stones in gorse and heather all embosomed there should be no tall stone no marble tomb above her gentle corsethe ponderous pile would press too rudely on those fairy limbs the turf should lightly he that marked her home a sacred spot it would beevery bird that came to watch her lone grave should be holy the deer should browse around her undisturbed the whin bird by her lonely nest should build all fearless for in life she loved to see happiness in all things and we would come on summer days when all around was bright and set us down and think of all that lay beneath that turf on which the heedless moorbird sits and whistles his long shrill painful song as though he plained for her that loved him and his pleasant hills and we would dream again of bygone days until our eyes should swell with natural tears for brilliant hopesall faded into air as on the sands of irak near approach destroys the travellers vision of still lakes and goodly streams reedclad and meadows green and leaves behind the drear reality of shadeless same yet everchanging sand and when the sullen clouds rose thick on high mountains on mountains rollingand dark mist wrapped itself round the hilltops like a shroud when on her grave swept by the moaning wind bending the heatherbellsthen would i come and watch by her in silent loneliness and smile upon the stormas knowing well the lightnings flash would surely turn aside nor mar the lowly mound where peaceful sleeps all that gave life and love to one fond heart i talk of things that are not and if prayers by night and day availed from my weak lips then should they never be till i was gone before the friends i loved to my long home oh pardon me if eer i say too much my mind too often strangely turns to ribald mirth as though i had no doubt nor hope beyond or brooding melancholy cloys my soul with thoughts of days misspent of wasted time and bitter feelings swallowed up in jests then strange and fearful thoughts flit oer my brain by indistinctness made more terrible and incubi mock at me with fierce eyes upon my couch  and visions crude and dire of planets suns millions of miles infinity space time thought being blank nonentity things incorporeal fancies of the brain seen heard as though they were material all mixed in sickening mazes trouble me and lead my soul away from earth and heaven until i doubt whether i be or not and then i see all frightful shapeslank ghosts hydras chimeras krakens wastes of sand herbless and void of living voicetall mountains cleaving the skies with height immeasurable on which perchance i climb for infinite years broad seas studded with islands numberless that stretch beyond the regions of the sun and fade away in distance vast or dreary clouds cold dark and watery where wander i for ever or space of ether where i hang for aye a speck an atominconsumable immortal hopeless voiceless powerless and oft i fancy i am weak and old and all who loved me one by one are dead and i am left aloneand cannot die surely there is no rest on earth for souls whose dreams are like a madmans  i am young and much is yet before meafter years may bring peace with them to my weary heart  helston 1835    trehill well    there stood a

moon to shine so clear and full on him and bathe his limbs in glory for a sign of what awaits him  oh look on him lord look and remember how he saved thy lamb    oh listen to me teacher husband love never till now loved utterly  oh say say you forgive me  noyou must not speak you said it to me hours agolong hours now you must rest and when tomorrow comes speak to the people call them home to god a deacon on the cross as in the church and plead from off the tree with outspread arms to show them that the son of god endured for themand me  hush  i alone will speak and while away the hours till dawn for you i know you have forgiven me as i lay beneath your feet while they were binding me i knew i was forgiven then  when i cried here am i husband  the lost lamb returned all rebaptized in blood and you said come come to thy bridebed martyr wife once more from that same moment all my pain was gone and ever since those sightless eyes have smiled lovelove  alas those eyes  they made me fall i could not bear to see them bleeding dark never no never to look into mine never to watch me round the little room singing about my work or flash on me looks bright with counselthen they drove me mad with talk of nameless tortures waiting you and i could save you  you would hear your love they knew you loved me cruel men  and then then came a dream to say one little word one easy wicked word we both might say and no one hear us but the lictors round one tiny sprinkle of the incense grains and both both free  and life had just begun only three monthsshort monthsyour wedded wife only three months within the cottage there hoping i bore your child    ah husband  saviour  god think gently of me i am forgiven       and then another dream a flashso quick i could not bear the blaze i could not see the smoke among the light to wander out through unknown lands and lead you by the hand through hamlet port and town on on until we died and stand each day to glory in you as you preached and prayed from rock and bournestone with that voice those words mingled with fire and honeyyou would wake bend save whole nations would not that atone for one short worday make it right to save you you to fight the battles of the lord and soand soalas you knew the rest you answered me    ah cruel words  no  blessed godlike words you had done nobly had you struck me dead instead of striking me to lifethe temptress    traitress apostate dead to god and me the smell of death upon meso it was true true well spoken hero  oh they snapped those words my madness like the angels voice thrilling the graves to birthpangs  all was clear there was but one right thing in the world to do and i must do it     lord have mercy  christ help through my womanhood  or i shall fail yet as i failed before     i could not speak i could not speak for shame and misery and terror of my sin and of the things i knew were coming  but in heaven in heaven there we should meet perhapsand by that time i might be worthy of you once again of you and of my god     so i went out       will you hear more and so forget the pain and yet i dread to tell you what comes next your love will feel it all again for me no it is over and the woe thats dead rises next hour a glorious angel  love say shall i tell you  ah your lips are dry tomorrow when they come we must entreat and they will give you water  one today a soldier gave me water in a sponge upon a reed and said too fair too young she might have been a gallant soldiers wife and then i cried i am a soldiers wife a heros  and he smiled but let me drink god bless him for it    so they led me back and as i went a voice was in my ears which rang through all the sunlight and the breath and blaze of all the garden slopes below and through the harvestvoices and the moan of cedarforests on the cliffs above and round the shining rivers and the peaks which hung beyond the cloudbed of the west and round the ancient stones about my feet out of all heaven and earth it rang and cried my hand hath made all these  am i too weak to give thee strength to say so  then my soul spread like a clear blue sky within my breast while all the people made a ring around and in the midst the judge spoke smilingly well hast thou brought him to a better mind no  he has brought me to a better mind i cried and said besidei know not what words which i learnt from theei trust in god nought fierce or rudefor was i not a girl three months ago beneath my mothers roof i thought of that  she might be there  i looked she was not there  i hid my face and wept and when i looked again the judges eye was on me cold and steady deep in thought she knows what shame is still so strip her  ah i shrieked not that sir  any pain  so young i ama wife tooi am not my own but hismy husbands  but they took my shawl and tore my tunic off and there i stood before them all     husband you love me still indeed i pleaded  oh shine out kind moon and let me see him smile  oh how i prayed while some cried shame and some she is too young and some mockedugly words  god shut my ears and yet no earthquake came to swallow me while all the court around and walls and roofs and all the earth and air were full of eyes eyes eyes which scorched my limbs like burning flame until my brain seemed bursting from my brow and yet no earthquake came  and then i knew this body was not yours alone but gods his loanhe needed it  and after that the worst was come and any torture more a changea lightening and i did not shriek once onlyonce when first i felt the whip it coiled so keen around my side and sent a fireflash through my heart which choked methen i shriekedthat once  the foolish echo rang so far and longi prayed you might not hear and then a mist which hid the ring of eyes swam by me and a murmur in my ears of humming bees around the limes at home and i was all alone with you and god and what they did to me i hardly know i felt and did not feel  now i look back it was not after all so very sharp so do not pity me  it made me pray forget my shame in pain and pain in you and you in god  and once when i looked down and saw an ugly sightso many wounds what matter thought i  his dear eyes are dark for them alone i kept these limbs so white a foolish pride  as god wills now  tis just    but then the judge spoke out in haste  she is mad or fenced by magic arts  she feels no pain he did not know i was on fire within better he should not so his sin was less then he cried fiercely take the slave away and crucify her by her husbands side and at those words a film came on my face a sickening rush of joywas that the end that my reward  i rose and tried to go but all the eyes had vanished and the judge and all the buildings melted into mist so how they brought me here i cannot tell here here by you until the judgmentday and after that for ever and for ever ah  if i could but reach that hand  one touch one finger tip to send the thrill through me i felt but yesterdayno  i can wait another bodyoh new limbs are ready free pure instinct with soul through every nerve kept for us in the treasuries of god they will not mar the love they try to speak they will not fail my soul as these have done      will you hear more  nayyou know all the rest yet those poor eyesalas they could not see my waking when you hung above me there with hands outstretched to bless the penitent your penitenteven like the lord himself i gloried in youlike the lord himself sharing his very sufferings to the crown of thorns which they had put on that dear brow to make you like himshow you as you were i told them so  i bid them look on you and see there what was the highest throne on earth the throne of suffering where the son of god endured and triumphed for them  but they laughed all but one soldier gray with many scars and he stood silent  then i crawled to you and kissed your bleeding feet and called aloud you heard me  you know all  i am at peace peace peace as still and bright as is the moon upon your limbs came on me at your smile and kept me happy when they dragged me back from that last kiss and spread me on the cross and bound my wrists and anklesdo not sigh i prayed and bore it  and since they raised me up my eyes have never left your face my own my own nor will till death comes       do i feel much pain not much  not maddening  none i cannot bear it has become like part of my own life or part of gods life in mehonourbliss i dreaded madness and instead comes rest rest deep and smiling like a summers night i should be easy now if i could move    i cannot stir  ah god these shoots of fire through all my limbs  hush selfish girl  he hears you who ever found the cross a pleasant bed yes i can bear it love  pain is no evil unless it conquers us  these little wrists now you said one blessed night they were too slender too soft and slender for a deacons wife perhaps a martyrsyou forgot the strength which god can give  the cord has cut them through and yet my voice has never faltered yet oh do not groan or i shall long and pray that you may die  and you must not die yet not yetthey told us we might live three days    two days for you to preach  two days to speak words which may wake the dead         hush is he sleeping they say that men have slept upon the cross so why not he     thanks lord  i hear him breathe and he will preach thy word tomorrowsave souls crowds for thee  and they will know his worth years hencepoor things they know not what they do and crown him martyr and his name will ring through all the shores of earth and all the stars whose eyes are sparkling through their tears to see his triumphpreacher  martyrahand me if they must couple my poor name with his let them tell all the truthsay how i loved him and tried

folks as i and such a port for mariners i neer shall see again as the pleasant isle of aves beside the spanish main  there were forty craft in aves that were both swift and stout all furnished well with small arms and cannons round about and a thousand men in aves made laws so fair and free to choose their valiant captains and obey them loyally  thence we sailed against the spaniard with his hoards of plate and gold which he wrung with cruel tortures from indian folk of old likewise the merchant captains with hearts as hard as stone who flog men and keelhaul them and starve them to the bone  oh the palms grew high in aves and fruits that shone like gold and the colibris and parrots they were gorgeous to behold and the negro maids to aves from bondage fast did flee to welcome gallant sailors asweeping in from sea  oh sweet it was in aves to hear the landward breeze aswing with good tobacco in a net between the trees with a negro lass to fan you while you listened to the roar of the breakers on the reef outside that never touched the shore  but scripture saith an ending to all fine things must be so the kings ships sailed on aves and quite put down were we all day we fought like bulldogs but they burst the booms at night and i fled in a piragua sore wounded from the fight  nine days i floated starving and a negro lass beside till for all i tried to cheer her the poor young thing she died but as i lay a gasping a bristol sail came by and brought me home to england here to beg until i die  and now im old and goingim sure i cant tell where one comfort is this worlds so hard i cant be worse off there if i might but be a seadove id fly across the main to the pleasant isle of aves to look at it once again  eversley 1857    the knights return    hark hark hark the

ad 395    a harper came over the danube so wide    and he came into alarics hall and he sang the song of the little baltung    to him and his heroes all  how the old old balt and the young young balt    rode out of caucaland with the royal elephants trunk on helm    and the royal lance in hand  thuringer heroes counts and knights    pricked proud in their meinie for they were away to the great kaiser    in byzant beside the sea  and when they came to the danube so wide    they shouted from off the shore come over come over ye roman slaves    and ferry your masters oer  and when they came to adrians burgh    with its towers so smooth and high come out come out ye roman knaves    and see your lords ride by  but when they came lo the long long walls    that stretch from sea to sea that old old balt let down his chin    and a thoughtful man grew he  oh oft have i scoffed at brave fridigern    but never will i scoff more if these be the walls which kept him out    from the micklegard there on the shore  then out there came the great kaiser    with twice ten thousand men but never a thuring was coward enough    to wish himself home again  bow down thou rebel old athanarich    and beg thy life this day the kaiser is lord of all the world    and who dare say him nay  i never came out of caucaland    to beg for less nor more but to see the pride of the great kaiser    in his micklegard here by the shore  i never came out of caucaland    to bow to mortal wight but to shake the hand of the great kaiser    and god defend my right  he shook his hand that cunning kaiser    and he kissed him courteouslie and he has ridden with athanarich    that wondertown to see  he showed him his walls of marble white    a mile oerhead they shone quoth the balt who would leap into that garden    king siegfrieds boots must own  he showed him his engines of arsmetrick    and his wells of quenchless flame and his flying rocks that guarded his walls    from all that against him came  he showed him his temples and pillared halls    and his streets of houses high and his watchtowers tall where his stargazers    sit reading the signs of the sky  he showed him his ships with their hundred oars    and their sides like a castle wall that fetch home the plunder of all the world    at the kaisers beck and call  he showed him all nations of every tongue    that are bred beneath the sun how they flowed together in micklegard street    as the brooks flow all into one  he showed him the shops of the china ware    and of silk and sendal also and he showed him the baths and the waterpipes    on arches aloft that go  he showed him ostrich and unicorn    ape lion and tiger keen and elephants wise roared hail kaiser    as though they had christians been  he showed him the hoards of the dragons and trolls    rare jewels and heaps of gold hast thou seen in all thy hundred years    such as these thou king so old  now that cunning kaiser was a scholar wise    and could of gramarye and he cast a spell on that old old balt    till lowly and meek spake he  oh oft have i heard of the micklegard    what i held for chapmens lies but now do i know of the micklegard    by the sight of mine own eyes  woden in valhalla    but thou on earth art god and he that dare withstand thee kaiser    on his own head lies his blood  then out and spake that little baltung    rode at the kings right knee quoth fridigern slew false kaiser valens    and he died like you or me  and who art thou thou pretty bold boy    rides at the kings right knee oh i am the baltung boy alaric    and as good a man as thee  as good as me thou pretty bold boy    with down upon thy chin oh a spaewife laid a doom on me    the best of thy realm to win  if thou be so fierce thou little wolf cub    or ever thy teeth be grown then i must guard my two young sons    lest they should lose their own  oh its i will guard your two lither lads    in their burgh beside the sea and its i will prove true man to them    if they will prove true to me  but its you must warn your two lither lads    and warn them bitterly that if i shall find them two false kaisers    high hanged they both shall be  now they are gone into the kaisers palace    to eat the peacock fine and they are gone into the kaisers palace    to drink the good greek wine  the kaiser alone and the old old balt    they sat at the cedar board and round them served on the bended knee    full many a roman lord  what ails thee what ails thee friend athanarich    what makes thee look so pale i fear i am poisoned thou cunning kaiser    for i feel my heartstrings fail  oh would i had kept that great great oath    i swore by the horses head i would never set foot on roman ground    till the day that i lay dead  oh would i were home in caucaland    to hear my harpers play and to drink my last of the nutbrown ale    while i gave the gold rings away  oh would i were home in caucaland    to hear the gothmens horn and watch the waggons and brown brood mares    and the tents where i was born  but now i must die between four stone walls    in byzant beside the sea and as thou shalt deal with my little baltung    so god shall deal with thee  the kaiser he purged himself with oaths    and he buried him royally and he set on his barrow an idol of gold    where all romans must bow the knee  and now the goths are the kaisers men    and guard him with lance and sword and the little baltung is his sworn sonatarms    and eats at the kaisers board  and the kaisers two sons are two false white lads    that a clerk may beat with cane the clerk that should beat that little baltung    would never sing mass again  oh the gates of rome they are steel without    and beaten gold within but they shall fly wide to the little baltung    with the down upon his chin  oh the fairest flower in the kaisers garden    is rome and italian land but it all shall fall to the little baltung    when he shall take lance in hand  and when he is parting the plunder of rome    he shall pay for this song of mine neither maiden nor land neither jewel nor gold    but one cup of italian wine  eversley 1864    on the death of leopold king of the belgians

leafless hawthorns flitting bats hawk the pale moths of winter  welcome then at best the flying gleam the flying shower the rainpools glittering on the long white roads and shadows sweeping on from down to down before the salt atlantic gale  yet come in whatsoever garb or gay or sad come fair come foul twill still be christmas day    how will it dawn the coming christmas day to sailors lounging on the lonely deck beneath the rushing tradewind  or to him who by some noisome harbour of the east watches swart arms roll down the precious bales spoils of the tropic forests year by year amid the din of heathen voices groaning himself half heathen  how to thosebrave hearts who toil with laden loins and sinking stride beside the bitter wells of treeless sands toward the peaks which flood the ancient nile to free a tyrants captives  how to those new patriarchs of the newfound underworld who stand like jacob on the virgin lawns and count their flocks increase  to them that day shall dawn in

the name of all he greediest triumphs by the greed of all and armed by his own victims eats up all while ever out of the eternal heavens looks patient down the great magnanimous god who maker of all worlds did sacrifice all to himself  nay but himself to one who taught mankind on that first christmas day what twas to be a man to give not take to serve not rule to nourish not devour to help not crush if need to die not live    o blessed day which givest the eternal lie to self and sense and all the brute within oh come to us amid this war of life to hall and hovel come to all who toil in

shade    beneath the giant mangotree  all things save i are full of life    the minas pluming velvet breasts the monkeys in their foolish strife    the swooping hawks the swinging nests  the lizards basking on the soil    the butterflies who sun their wings the bees about their household toil    they live they love the blissful things  each tender purple mangoshoot    that folds and droops so bashful down it lives it sucks some hidden root    it rears at last a broad green crown  it blossoms and the children cry    watch when the mangoapples fall it lives  but rootless fruitless i    i breathe and dreamand that is all  thus am i dead  yet cannot die    but still within my foolish brain there hangs a pale blue evening sky    a furzy croft a sandy lane  1870    the priests heart    it
