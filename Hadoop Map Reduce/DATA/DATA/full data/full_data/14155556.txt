the employment of olivers father he came groping down just before daylight into the great room  the great room was as its name indicated quite large occupying a considerable portion of the lower floor of the farmers house there was a very spacious fireplace in one side with a settle which was a long seat with a very high back near it the room was used both for kitchen and parlor and there was a great variety of furniture in different parts of it there were chairs and tables a bookcase with a desk below a loom in one corner by a window and a spinningwheel near it then there were a great many doors one led out into the back yard one up stairs one into a back roomwhich was used for coarse work and which was generally called the kitchenand one into a large store closet adjoining the great room  jonas groped his way down stairs but as soon as he opened the great room door he found the room filled with a flickering light which came from the fireplace there was a log there which had been buried in the ashes the night before it had burned slowly through the night and the fire had broken out at one end which now glowed like a furnace and illuminated the whole room with a faint red light  jonas went up towards the fire the hearth was very large and formed of great flat stones on one side of it was a large heap of wood which jonas had prepared the night before to be ready for his fire on the other side was a black cat asleep with her chin upon her paws when the cat heard jonas coming she rose up stretched out her fore paws and then began to purr rubbing her cheeks against the bottom of the settle  good morning darco said jonas it is time to get up  the cats name was darco  jonas took a pair of heavy iron tongs which stood by the side of the fire and pulled forward the log he found that it had burned through and by three or four strokes with the tongs he broke it up into large fragments of coal of a darkreddish color the air being thus admitted they soon began to brighten and crackle until in a few minutes there was before him a large heap of glowing and burning coals he put a log on behind then placed the andirons up to the log and a great forestick upon the andirons he placed the forestick so far out as to leave a considerable space between it and the backlog and then he put the coals up into this spacehaving first put in a slender stick resting upon the andirons to keep the coals from falling through he then placed on a great deal more wood and he soon had a roaring fire which crackled loud and blazed up into the chimney  now for my lantern said jonas  so saying he took down a lantern which hung by the side of the fire the lantern was made of tin with holes punched through it on all sides so as to allow the light to shine through and yet the holes were not large enough to admit the wind to blow out the light  jonas opened the lantern and took out a short candle from the socket within just as he was lighting it the door opened and amos came in  ah jonas said he you are before me as usual  why the youngest hand makes the fire of course said jonas  then it ought to be oliver said amosor else josey  there i promised to wake oliver up said jonas  o hes awake and he and josey are coming down they have found out that there is snow on the ground  is there much snow asked jonas  i dont know said amos the ground seems pretty well covered if there is enough to make sledding you are going after wood today  and what are you going to do said jonas  i am going up among the pines to get out the barn frame i believe  here a door opened and oliver came in followed by josey shivering with the cold and in great haste to get to the fire  didnt your father say said amos to oliver that he was going with me today to get out the timber for the barn frame  yes said oliver he is going to build a great barn next summer but im going up into the woods with jonas to haul wood theres plenty of snow  id go too said josey if it wasnt so cold  it wont be cold in the woods said jonas theres no wind in the woods  while they had been talking thus jonas had got his lantern ready and had gone to the door and stood there a minute ready to go out  jonas said josey are you going out into the barn  yes said jonas  wait a minute then for me just till i put on my other boot  jonas waited a minute according to joseys request and then they all went out together  they found the snow pretty deep all over the yard but they waded through it to the barn they had to go through a gate which led them into the barnyard from the barnyard they entered the barn itself by a small door near one corner  there were two great doors in the middle of the barn made so large that when they were opened there was space enough for a large load of hay to go in opposite these doors there was a space floored over with plank pretty wide and extending through the barn to the back side this was called the barn floor on one side was a place divided off for stables for the horses and on the other side was the tieup a place for the oxen and cows there was also the bay and the lofts for hay and grain and at the end of the tieup there was a door leading into a calfpen and thence by a passage behind the calfpen to a workshop and shed the small door where the boys came in led to a long and narrow passage between the tieup and the bay  they walked along jonas going before with his lantern in his hand the cattle which had lain down began to get up and the horses neighed in their stalls for the shining of the lantern in the barn was the wellknown signal which called them to breakfast  jonas clambered up by a long ladder to the hayloft to pitch down some hay and josey and oliver followed him while amos remained below to feed out the hay as he called it as fast as they pitched it down it was pretty dark upon the loft although the lantern shed a feeble light upon the rafters above  boys said jonas it is dangerous for you to be up here id rather youd go down  well said oliver and he began to descend  why said josey i dont think theres any danger  yes said jonas a pitchfork wound is worse than almost any other it is what they call a punctured wound  what kind of a wound is that said josey  ill tell you some other time said jonas but dont stay up here you dont obey so well as oliver go down and give the old general some hay  the old general was the name of a large white horse quite old and steady but of great strength when he was younger he belonged to a general who used to ride him upon the parade and this was the origin of his name  josey at this proposal made haste down the ladder and began to put some hay over into the old generals crib he then went round into the generals stall and patting him upon the neck he asked him if his breakfast was good  in the mean time oliver opened the great barn doors and taking a shovel he began to clear away the snow from before them the sky in the east was by this time beginning to be quite bright and a considerable degree of light from the sky and from the newfallen snow came into the barn josey got a shovel and went out to help oliver after they had shoveled away the snow from the great barn doors they went to the house and began to clear the steps before the doors and to make paths in the yards they worked in this way for half an hour and then just as the sun began first to show its bright glittering rays above the horizon they went into the house they found that the great fire which jonas had built was burnt half down the breakfasttable was set and the breakfast itself was nearly ready  the boys came to the fireplace to see what they were going to have for breakfast  boys said the farmers wife while she was turning her cakes go and call amos in to family prayersand jonas  you go oliver said josey  oliver said nothing but obeyed his mothers direction he went into the barnyard and he found amos and jonas at work in a shed beyond getting down a sled which had been stowed away there during the summer it was a large and heavy sled and had a tongue extending forward to draw it by  what are you getting out that sled for said oliver  to haul wood on said jonas were going to haul wood after breakfast and i want to get all ready  there was another smaller and lighter sled which had been upon the top of the heavy one before amos and jonas had taken it off this smaller sled had two shafts to draw it by instead of a tongue jonas knew by this that it was intended to be drawn by a horse while the one with a tongue was meant for oxen  oliver said jonas i think it would be a good plan for you and josey to take this sled and the old general and go with me to haul wood  well said oliver i should like it very much  we can all go up together you and josey can be loading the horsesled while i load the oxsled and then we can drive them down and so get two loads down instead of one  well said oliver i mean to ask my father  or perhaps continued jonas you can be teamster for the oxen and josey can drive the horse and so i remain up in the woods cutting and splitting  no said oliver because we cant unload alone  no said jonas i had forgotten that  but i mean to ask my father said oliver to let me have the old general and haul a load down when you come  so saying the boys walked along towards the house the sun was now shining beautifully upon the fresh snow making it sparkle in every direction all around they walked in by the path which oliver and josey had shoveled  why didnt you make your path wider said amos this isnt wide enough for a cowpath  o yes amos said jonas it will do very well i can widen it a little when i come out after breakfast  when they got to the door jonas stopped a moment to look around the fields were white in every direction and the branches of the trees near the house were loaded with the snow the air was keen and frosty and the breaths of the boys were visible by the vapor which was condensed by the cold the pond was one great level field of dazzling white all was silentnothing was seen of life or motion except that darco who came out when the door was opened looked around astonished took a few cautious steps along the path and then finding the snow too deep and cold went back again to take her place once more by the fire    chapter ii   commanding and obeying  about an hour after breakfast jonas with the oxen and oliver and josey with the horse were slowly moving along up the road which led back from the pond towards the wood lot the wood lot was a portion of the forest which had been reserved to furnish a supply of wood for the winter fires the road followed for some distance the bank of the brook which emptied into the pond at the place where jonas and oliver had cleared land when jonas first came to live on this farm  it was a very pleasant road the brook was visible here and there through the bushes and trees on one side of it these bushes and trees were of course bare of leaves excepting the evergreens and they were loaded down with the snow some were bent over so that the tops nearly touched the ground  the brook itself too was almost buried and concealed in the snow in the still places it had frozen over and so the snow had been supported by the ice and thus it concealed both ice and water at the little cascades and waterfalls however which occurred here and there the water had not frozen water does not freeze easily where it runs with great velocity at these places therefore the boys could see the water and hear it bubbling and gurgling as it fell and disappeared under the ice which had formed below  at last they came to the wood lot the wood which they were going to haul had been cut before and it had been piled up in long piles extending here and there under the trees which had been left these piles were now however partly covered with the snow which lay light and unsullied all over the surface of the ground  the sticks of wood in these piles were of different sizes though they were all of the same length some had been cut from the tops of the trees or from the branches and were consequently small in diameter others were from the trunks which would of course make large logs these logs had however been split into quarters by a beetle and wedges when the wood had been prepared so that there were very few sticks or logs so large but that jonas could pretty easily get them on to the sled  jonas drove his team up near to one end of the pile while josey and oliver went to the other where the wood was generally small while jonas was loading he heard a conversation something like this between the other boys  lets put some good large logs on our sled said josey  well said oliver as large as we can only wed better put this small wood on first  i wish youd go around to the other side oliver said josey again youre in my way  no said oliver i cant work on that side very well  then i mean to move the old general round a little  no said oliver the sled stands just right now only you get up on the top of the pile and ill stay here no said josey id rather stand here myself  so the boys continued at work a few minutes longer each being in the others way  at length josey said again  o here is a large log and i mean to get it out and put it upon our sled  the log was covered with smaller wood so that josey could only get hold of the end of it he clasped his hands together under this end and began to lift it up endeavoring to get it free from the other wood he succeeded in raising it a little but it soon got wedged in again worse than before  come oliver said josey help me get out this log it is rock maple  no said oliver im busy  jonas said josey calling out aloud jonas heres a stick of wood which i cant get out i wish youd come and help me  in answer to this request jonas only called both the boys to come to him  they accordingly left the old general standing in the snow with his sled partly loaded and came to the end of the pile where jonas was at work  i see you dont get along very well said jonas  why you see said josey that oliver wouldnt help me put on a great log  the difficulty is said jonas that you both want to be master whereas when two people are working together one must be master and the other servant  i dont want to be servant said josey  its better to be servant on some accounts said jonas then you have no responsibility  responsibility repeated josey  yes said jonas power and responsibility always go togetheror at least they ought to but come boys be helping me load while we are settling this difficulty so as not to lose our time  so the boys began to put wood upon jonass sled while the conversation continued as follows  cant two persons work together unless one is master and the other servant asked josey  at least replied jonas one must take the lead and the other follow in order to work to advantage there must be subordination for you see that in all sorts of work there are a great many little questions coming up which are of no great consequence only they ought to be decided one way or the other quick or else the work wont go on you act in your work like jack and jerry when they ran against the horseblock  why how was that said josey  they were drawing the wagon along to harness the horse in and the horseblock was in the way so they both got hold of the shafts and jack wanted to pull it around towards the right while jerry said it would be better to have it go to the left so they pulled one one way and the other the other and thus they got it up chock against the horseblock one shaft on each side here they stood pulling in opposition for some time and all the while their father was waiting for them to turn the wagon and harness the horse  what did he say to them said oliver when he found it out  he made jack bring it round jerrys way and then made jerry draw it back again and bring it along jacks way  when men are at work continued jonas one acts as director and the rest follows on as he guides then all the unimportant questions are decided promptly  well said josey let us do so oliver ill be director  how do they decide who shall be director said oliver  the oldest and most experienced directs generally or if one is the employer and the others are employed by him then the employer directs the others if a man wants a stone bridge built and hires three men to do it there is always an understanding at the beginning who shall have the direction of the work and all the others obey  so continued jonas if a carpenter were to send two of his men into the woods to cut down a tree for timber without saying which of them should have the directionthen the oldest or most experienced or the one who had been the longest in the carpenters employ would take the direction he would say let us go out this way and the other would assent or i think we had better take this tree and the other would say perhaps heres one over here which looks rather straighter wont you come and look at this but they would not dispute about it one would leave it to the other to decide  suppose said josey one was just as old and experienced as the other  why if there was no reason whatever why one should take the lead rather than the other then they would not either of them be tenacious of their opinion if one proposed to do a thing the other would comply without making any objection unless he had a very decided objection indeed so they would get along peaceably  now continued jonas boys are very apt to have different opinions and to be very tenacious of them and so get into disputes and difficulties when they are working together therefore when boys are set to work it is generally best to appoint one to take charge for they havent generally good sense enough to find out themselves which it is most proper should be in charge  for instance now continued jonas which of you do you think on the whole is the proper one to take the direction of the work when you are set to work together  i said josey with great promptness  oliver did not answer at all  theres one reason why you ought not to be the one said jonas  what is it said josey  why you dont obey very well no person is well qualified to command until he has learned to obey  i obey said josey im sure  not always said jonas this morning when you were upon the haymow and i told you both to go down oliver went down immediately but you remained up and made excuses instead of obeying  josey was silent he perceived that jonass charge against him was just  besides continued jonas there are some other reasons why oliver should command rather than you first he understands more of farmers work being more accustomed to it secondly he is older  no interrupted josey he isnt older im the oldest  are you said jonas  yes replied josey im two months older than he is  oliver had so much more prudence and discretion and being besides a little larger than josey made jonas think that he was older  well said jonas at any rate he has more judgement and experience and he certainly obeys better so you may go back to your work and let oliver take the command and then after a little while if oliver says that you have obeyed him well ill try the experiment of letting you josey command  the boys accordingly went back and finished loading up the old general oliver took the direction and josey obeyed very well now and then he would forget for a moment and begin to argue but josey would submit pretty readily for he was very desirous that jonas would let him command next time and he thought that he would not allow him to command until he had learned to obey  they had the two sleds loaded nearly at the same time and then went down when they were going back after the second load they all got on to jonass sled which was forward to ride leaving the old general to follow with his sled he was so well trained that he walked along very steadily oliver fastened the reins to one of the stakes so that they should not get down under the horses feet the boys all got together upon the forward sled in order that they might talk with one another as they were going back to the woods  now josey said jonas we will let you have the command for the next trip and while we are going back i will give you both some instructions  about obeying said josey  yes and about commanding too said jonas it requires rather more skill to know how to command than how to obey to know how to direct work than to know how to execute it a good director in the first place takes care to plan wisely and he feels a responsibility about the work and a desire to have it go on to good advantage if some men build a way and after it is finished it tumbles down the man who had charge of the work would feel more concerned about it than any of the others because the chief responsibility comes upon him so with your workif you have the command and you and oliver idle away the time and when my sled is loaded yours has but little wood in it you would be more to blame than oliver  what if i didnt play any more than oliver  yes said jonas because you are responsible it is your duty to be industrious and it is also your duty to see that oliver is industrious if you are the directorso that you neglect two duties  it is a good plan too said jonas for a director to give his directions in a mild and gentle tone some boys are very domineering and authoritative in their manner  how do you mean said josey  why they would say for example get out of the way john quick whereas it would be better to say john you are in the way where we want to come along some men give their directions with great noise and vociferation and others give them quietly and gently  i shouldnt think theyd mind em said josey  yes said jonas directions ought to be given very distinctly so as to be plainly understood but they are not obeyed any better for violence and noise in giving them  a commander ought to have a regard for those under him continued jonas and deal justly by them if a number of boys were going to ride a wagon and their father put one of them in charge he ought not to keep the best seat in the wagon for himself  while talking thus the oxen continued slowly advancing along the road their previous trip had broken out the road but the pathway was filled with loose snow of a pure and spotless white through which the great sled runners following the oxen ploughed their way on each side of the track which they had made the surface was smooth and unbroken excepting under some of the trees where masses of snow had fallen down from above they saw at length as they were passing along by the brook a little track like a double dotting running along in a winding way under the treesthen crossing the road and disappearing under the trees upon the other side  whats that asked josey  thats a rabbit track replied oliver  lets go and catch him said josey  no said jonas we must go on with our work  at a little distance farther on they saw another track it was larger than the first and not so regular  what sort of a track is that said josey  i dont know said oliver it looks like a dogs track but i shouldnt think there would be a dog out here in the woods  they found that this track followed the road along for some distance the animal which made it seemed sometimes to have gone in the middle of the road and sometimes out at the side and jonas said that he had passed there since they went down with the first load of wood  how do you know said oliver  because said jonas his track is made upon the broken snow in the middle of the road  they watched the track for some time and then they lost sight of it presently however they saw it again  i wonder which way he went said oliver  ill jump off and look at the track said jonas  so saying he jumped off the sled and examined the track  he went up said jonas the same way that we are going it may be a dog which has lost his master perhaps we shall find him up by our wood piles  jonas was right for when the boys arrived at the wood piles they found there waiting for them a large black dog he stood near one end of a wood pile with his fore feet upon a log by which his head and shoulders were raised so that he could see better who was coming he was of handsome form and he had an intelligent and goodnatured expression of countenance he was looking very intently at the party coming up to see whether his master was among them  whose dog is that said josey  i dont know said oliver i never saw him before  i wonder what his name is said josey here towzer towzer towzer said he  here caesar caesar caesar said oliver  pompey pompey pompey said jonas  illustration he was looking very intently at the party coming up to see whether his master was among them  the dog remained motionless in his position until just as the boys had finished their calls and as the foremost sled was drawn pretty near him he suddenly wheeled around with a leap and bounded away through the snow for half the length of the first wood pile and then stopped and again looked round  i wish we had something for him to eat said jonas  ive got a piece of bread and butter said josey i went in and got it when you and oliver were unloading  so josey took his bread and butter out of his pocket there were two small slices put together and folded up in a piece of paper jonas took a piece and walked slowly towards the dog  here franco franco said jonas  hes coming said josey who remained with oliver at the sled  the dog was slowly and timidly approaching the bread which jonas held out towards him  hes coming said josey his name is franco i wonder how jonas knew  franco franco said jonas again come here franco good franco  the dog came timidly up to jonas and took the bread and butter from joseys hand and devoured it eagerly while he was doing it jonas patted him on the head  hes very hungry said jonas bring the rest of your bread and butter josey  so josey brought the rest of his luncheon and the dog ate it all  after this he seemed to be quite at ease with his new friends he staid about there with the boys until the sleds were loaded and then he went down home with them there they fed him again with a large bone jonas said that he was undoubtedly a dog that had lost his master and had been wandering about to find him until he became very hungry so he said they would leave him in the yard to gnaw his bone and that then he would probably go away josey wanted to shut him up and keep him but jonas said it would be wrong  so the boys left the dog gnawing his bone and went up after another load but before they had half loaded their sleds oliver saw franco coming bounding up the road towards them he came up to jonas and stood before him looking up into his face and wagging his tail    chapter iii   franco  franco followed the boys all that forenoon as they went back and forth for their wood at dinner they did not say any thing about him to the farmer because they supposed that he would go away when they came in and left him and that they should see no more of him in the afternoon but when jonas went out after dinner to get the old general to harness him for work again he found franco lying snugly in the generals stall under the crib  at night therefore he told the farmer about him the farmer said that he was some dog that had strayed away from his master and he told jonas to go out after supper and drive him away josey begged his uncle to keep him but his aunt said she would not have a dog about the house she said it would cost as much to keep him as to keep a sheep and that instead of bringing them a good fleece a dog was good for nothing but to track your floors in wet weather and keep you awake all night with his howling  so the farmer told jonas to go out after supper and drive the dog away  let us give him some supper first father said oliver  no said his father the more you give him the more he wont go away i expect now youve fooled with him so much that it will be hard to get him off at any rate  jonas has not fooled with him any said oliver  nor i said josey  after supper jonas went out according to orders to drive franco away it was a raw windy night but not very cold franco was in a little shed where there was a well near the back door he was lying down but he got up and came to jonas when he saw him appear at the door  come franco said jonas come with me  franco wagged his tail and followed jonas  jonas walked out into the road franco after him he walked along until he had got to some distance from the house franco keeping up with him all the way sometimes on one side of the road and sometimes on the other at length when jonas thought that he had gone far enough he stopped franco stopped too and looked up at jonas  now franco ive got to send you away its a hard case franco but you and i must both submit to orders so go off franco as fast as you can  so saying jonas pointed along the road in the direction away from the house and said st boy st boy  franco darted along the road a few steps barked once and then turned round and looked eagerly at jonas as if he did not know what he wanted him to do  get home said jonas in a stern and severe tone get home and he stamped with his foot upon the ground and looked at franco with a countenance of displeasure  franco bounded forward a few steps over the smooth and icy road and then he turned round and stood in the middle of the road facing jonas and looking very much astonished  get home franco said jonas again and stooping down he took a piece of hardened snow or ice from the road and threw it towards him the ice fell before it reached franco and rolled along towards his feet which made him scamper along a little farther and then he stopped and turned around and looked at jonas as before  jonas began slowly to turn backwards keeping his eye on franco  its a hard case franco i acknowledge if i had a barn of my own id let you sleep in a corner of it but i must obey orders you must go and find your master  so saying jonas turned round and walked slowly home just before he turned to go into the house he looked back to see what had become of the dog he was standing motionless in the place where jonas had left him  i wish the farmer would let me give him a bone said he to himself and then he turned away and walked slowly around to the barn to fodder the cattle  that night just before bedtime he went to the front door and looked out into the road and all around to see if he could see any thing of franco it was rather dark and windythough he could see the moon shining dimly through the broken clouds which were driving across the sky the roads looked black as they do about the commencement of a thaw presently the moon shone out full through the interstices of the clouds jonas took advantage of the opportunity to look all up and down the road but franco was nowhere to be seen  the next morning however when he went out into the stable to give the cattle some hay he found franco in his old place under the generals crib  why franco said jonas how came you here  franco said nothing but stood looking up into jonass face and wagging his tail  franco said jonas how could you get in here  franco remained in the same position the light of the lantern shining in his face and his tail wagging a very little he could not tell certainly whether jonas was scolding him or not  franco remained about the barn until breakfasttime and then jonas at the table told the farmer that he tried to drive the dog away the night before but that in the morning he found him in the barn  i dont believe you really tried said the farmers wife i can drive him away i knowas ill show you after breakfast  accordingly after breakfast putting on hastily an old straw bonnet she went out into the yard and took a small stick from the wood pile to use for a club and then called to franco  franco said she come here  franco looked first at her and then at jonas who was standing in the doorway as if at a loss to know what to do  go franco said jonas  the farmers wife walked out in front of the house into the wind calling franco to follow she then attempted to drive him along the road much as jonas had done she brandished her stick at him and when she had succeeded in getting him as far from her as she could by stern and threatening language in order to drive him farther she threw the stick at him with all her force  franco jumped out of its way the stick rolled along the road before him he sprang forward to it seized it in his mouth and came trotting back to the farmers wife and laid it down at her feet and then standing back a few steps he looked up into her face with a very earnest expression of countenance which seemed to say  what do you want me to do next  this very act of francos embarrassed the woman considerably she could not bear to take up the very stick which franco had himself brought to her and throw it at him again and on the other hand she could not bear to give up and let franco remain she however picked up the stick and brandished it again towards franco and stamping with her foot at him she said  away with you dog get home  what the result of this contest would have been it is very difficult to say had it not been that it was soon decided by the occurrence of a singular incident for as the farmers wife nodded her head and stamped at the dog the jar or the motion seemed to give the wind a momentary advantage over her bonnet which in her haste she had not tied on very securely a strong gust carried it clear from her head and blew it away over franco upon the snow by the side of the road beyond franco who was all ready for a spring bounded after it and pursued it at full speed the snow was nearly level with the top of the stone walls and the wind carrying it diagonally from the road it rolled over the little ridge of stones which remained above the drifts and then swept across the field down a long descent like a feather before the gale  franco pursued it with flying leaps over the snow which had become sufficiently consolidated to support his steps he gained upon it rapidly and at length overtook and seized it and then turning round he trotted swiftly back leaped over the top of the wall and brought the bonnet and laid it down at its owners feet with an air of great satisfaction  the good woman took up her bonnet and threw her stick away and turning around walked back to the house the farmer who had been looking out at the window was laughing heartily she herself smiled as she returned to her work saying  the dog has something in him i acknowledge go and see if you cant find him a bone jonas yes jonas said the farmer you may have him for your dog till the owner comes and claims him  and this is the way that jonas first got his dog franco he told oliver that morning as he was patting his head under the old generals crib that the dog had taught them one good lesson  what is it asked oliver  why that the christian duty of returning good for evil is good policy as well as good morals  illustration    chapter iv   dog lost  about the middle of the winter the farmer went to market with his produce the vehicle on which he carried it was a kind of box upon runners with a pole in front to which two horses were fastened he was gone three days  when he came back he said that he had bargained for another load of his produce at the market town and that he was going to send jonas with it jonas was very glad when he heard this he liked to take journeys  what day shall i go sir said jonas  day after tomorrow said the farmer as early as possible well let the horses rest one day  about the middle of the afternoon on the day following the one on which this conversation had taken place jonas and the farmer began to load up the box sleigh in order to have it ready for the morning he had about forty miles to go and he wanted to get to market deliver his load and return five or ten miles that same evening  it was quite cold that afternoon and it seemed to be growing colder and colder jonas got the box sleigh ready under a shed first shoveling in some snow under the runners in order that the horses might draw the sled out easily when it was loaded he put in the various articles of produce which were contained in bags and firkins and boxes over these he spread blankets and buffaloskins and put in a bag of oats for his horses and a box of bread and cheese for himself he did not know whether franco was to go with him or not but he arranged the bags in such a way that he could easily make a warm nest for him in one corner if the farmer should allow him to go  the farmer helped him about all the arrangements and when they were completed he told jonas to go in and get his supper and go to bed so as to get up and set off early in the morning  it will be a fine starlight night said he and youd better be ten miles on your way by sunrise  when amos got up the next morning and went out with his lantern to go to the barn as he passed by the shed on his way he saw that the sleigh was gone he proceeded to the barn and as he opened the door he was startled at something which suddenly darted past him and rushed out  whats that said oliver who was behind him it is franco said he where is he going  franco ran off to the shed where jonas had harnesses his horses and began smelling around upon the ground he followed the scent along the yard up to a post by the side of the house where jonas had stopped a moment ago to go in and get his greatcoat when all was ready and then after pausing here a moment he darted off towards the road  here franco franco said amos come back here  franco franco repeated oliver herehereherehere  franco paid no attention to these calls but ran off along the road at full speed  in the mean time jonas had traveled rapidly onward by the light of the stars over the glittering and frosty road  the keen air made his ears tingle a little but he rubbed them and they soon became warm his feet were comfortably stowed away down in his box among the bags and buffaloskins so that they were warm and comfortable  the horses trotted along at good speed and soon brought jonas and his load to the village at the mill the street was vacant and the houses dark excepting that a faint light shone behind a curtain in one chamber window jonas supposed that somebody was sick there even the mill was silent and the gate shut down and instead of the ordinary roar of the water under the wheel only a hissing sound was heard where the imprisoned water spouted through the crevices of the flume vast stalactites of ice extended continuously along the whole face of the dam like a frozen waterfall behind which the water percolated curiously down into the foaming abyss at the bottom of the fall jonas thought that all this seen by starlight looked very cold  the horses trotted across the bridge with a loud sound which reverberated far and wide in the still night he ascended the hill beyond and drove on his woollen comforter tied about his neck became frosted over from his breath and the breasts and mane and sides of the horses were gradually sprinkled with white in the same way they were both black horsesthe general having been left at home they trotted down the hills and along the level portions of the road and wheeled around the curves with great speed jonas found that he had no occasion for his whip and so he put it away behind him under the buffaloes  he went on in this way without any special adventure for a couple of hours and then began to see a gray light appearing in the eastern sky about the same time the windows of the farmhouses which he passed on the road began to be illuminated by the fires which they were kindling within now and then he could see a man hurrying out to a barn to feed the cattle jonas thought that they ought to be up earlier the sun rose soon after and the fields on every side sparkled by the reflection of his rays from the crystalline surface of the snow tall columns of dense white smoke ascended from the chimneys some erect others leaning a little some one way some another in a word it was a cold still winter morning  at length as jonas was walking his horses up a long hill he heard light footsteps behind him he turned round to see what was coming and to his utter astonishment he saw franco coming up upon the full run and close behind the sleigh he came to the side of it and looked up with every appearance of exultation and joy  why franco said jonas how came you here  he stopped his horses and franco leaped up before him his ears and the glossy black hair which curled under his neck and upon his sides were tipped with frost jonas patted him upon his head saying  why franco how did you get out of the barn and how did you find out which way i came  franco wagged his tail and curled down around jonass feet but he made no reply  jonas was very much surprised for as he had no permission to take franco he had concluded that it was his duty not to take him and when he found that he was inclined to come with him at the time that he was harnessing the horses he conducted him back into the barn and to make it secure he fastened up the place where he had got in the first night that he lodged there he knew that the barn would be opened when amos came out in the morning to take care of the old general and the oxen but said he to himself i shall by that time be ten miles off and it will be too late for him to follow or find me jonas was therefore very much surprised when he found that franco had contrived to make his escape and to track his master so many miles  jonas drove on very prosperously until it was about time for him to stop and give his horses some breakfast as for himself he ate his breakfast from his box when they were coming up a long hill he accordingly stopped at a tavern and took his horses out of their harness and rubbed them down well and gave them a good drink of water and plenty of oats which he bought of the tavernkeeper he kept the oats in his bag to use in the town by the time that he stopped he was comfortably warm for he had taken some exercise walking up the hills franco always got out when jonas did at the bottom of the hills and then got in again at the top he remained in the sleigh however at the tavern keeping guard while jonas went into the house and he would growl a little if any body came near the sleigh and thus warn them not to touch any thing that was in it  while the horses were eating jonas went into the tavern and sat down by the kitchen fire the fire was very large and many persons were busy getting breakfast jonas wished that he was going to have a cup of the coffee that they were making but he thought it better that he should content himself with what the farmer had provided for him there was a young woman in the back part of the room at a window sewing she asked jonas how far he had come that morning and he told her then she said that he must have set out very early and she said that he had a pair of very handsome black horses she had seen them as jonas passed the window  there was a small girl sitting near her with a slate ciphering she seemed very busy for a few minutes and then she looked up to the young woman and said  my sum does not come right aunt lucia  doesnt it im sorry but i cant help you now very well replied aunt lucia i am very busy with my sewing  the little girl then got up and came towards the fire with her slate hanging by a string from her finger and her arithmetic under her arm  where are you ciphering asked jonas  in fractions said the girl  if you will let me look at your sum perhaps i can tell you how to do it replied jonas  the girl handed her book to him and showed him the sum in it she also let him see the work upon her slate jonas looked it over very carefully and then said  you have done very well indeed with such a hard sum there is only one mistake  and jonas pointed out the mistake to her and she corrected it and then the answer was right she then went and put away her slate and book with an appearance of great satisfaction as she passed by the window aunt lucia whispered to her to say  i think you had better thank that young man and give him a mug of coffee  well said the little girl i will so she went to a cupboard at the side of the room and took down a tin mug she poured out some coffee from a coffeepot and put in some milk and sugar and then brought it to jonas and asked him if he wouldnt like a little coffee jonas thanked her and took the coffee and he liked it very much  after this jonas harnessed his horses again and went on he traveled until nearly noon and then he arrived at the town where he was to leave his load he had a letter to a merchant who had bought the produce of the farmer and in a very short time his load was taken out and the other articles put in which he was to carry back in exchange he had some money given him by the merchant in part payment for his load of produce it was in banknotes and he put it into his waistcoat pocket and pinned it in  then he set out on his return his load was light the road was smooth and his horses though they had traveled fast had been driven carefully and they carried him rapidly over the ground it was the middle of the afternoon however before he set out and the days were then so short that the sun soon began to go down he had to ride quite into the evening before he reached the place where he was to stop for the night  he put up his horses and then went into the house he called for some supper for his own provisions had long since been exhausted after supper he carried out something for franco whom he had left in the sleigh in the barn lying upon a good warm buffalo to watch the property  franco said he here is your supper  franco jumped up when he heard jonass voice and leaped out of the sleigh he took his supper and jonas after once more feeding his horses went out and shut the door leaving franco to finish his bone by himself  jonas went back into the tavern and took his seat by the fire there was a table before the fire with a lamp upon it and there were one or two books and an old newspaper lying upon another table in the back part of the room jonas looked at the books but they were not interesting to read one was a dictionary he read the newspaper for some time and then he took the lamp up and began to look at some pictures of the prodigal son which were hung up upon the wall over the mantelpiece  beyond the pictures were some advertisements one was for a farm for sale jonas read the description and he wished that he was old enough to buy a farm and then he would go and look at that  the next advertisement was about some machinery which a man had invented and the next was headed in large letters dog lost this caught jonass attention immediately it was in writing and he could not read it very easily it was so high so he got a chair and stood up in it and read as follows  dog lost  strayed or stolen from the subscriber a valuable dog of large size and black color  i wonder if it isnt franco said jonas interrupting himself in his reading  he had on a brass collar marked with the owners name  no said jonas there was no collar but then the man that stole him might have taken it off  answers to the name of ney  ney ney said jonasi never called him ney i wonder if he would answer if i should call him ney  is kind and docile and quite intelligent  yes said jonas i verily believe it is franco  any person who will return said dog to the subscriber at his residence at walton plain shall be suitably rewarded  james edwards  i verily believe it is franco said jonas as he slowly got down from the chairwalton plain  he stood a moment looking thoughtfully into the fire  yes he repeated i verily believe it is franco i wonder where walton plain is  jonas had learned from mr holiday that it was never wise to communicate important information relating to private business unless necessary so he said nothing about franco to any of the people at the tavern but quietly went to bed and after thinking some time what to do he went to sleep and slept finely until morning  about daylight he arose and as he had paid his bill the night before he went to the barn harnessed his horses and set off at the first village that he came to after sunrise he stopped at a store and inquired whether there was any such town as walton plain in that neighborhood  yes said the boy who stood with a broom in his hand with which he was sweeping out the storeyes it is about five miles from here right on the way you are going  jonas thanked the boy got into his sleigh and rode on  poor franco said he i am afraid i must lose you  he had hoped that walton plain would have proved to be off of his road so that he could have had a good reason for not doing any thing about restoring the dog until after he had gone home and reported the facts to the farmer but now as he found that it was on his way and as he would very probably go directly by mr edwardss door he concluded that he ought at any rate to call and let him look at franco and see whether it was his dog or not  when he reached walton plain he inquired whether mr james edwards lived in the village they told him that he lived about half a mile out of the village they said it was a handsome white house under the trees back from the road with a portico over the door  jonas rode on observing all the houses as he passed and he at once recognized the one which had been described to him he stopped before the great gate and fastened his horses to a post he then walked along a roadway which led in by the end of the house and presently came to a door where he stopped and knocked a girl came and opened the door  is mr edwards at home  yes said the girl  will you ask him to come to the door a minute  youd better walk in and ill speak to him  illustration jonas stopping at the house of mr edwards  jonas stepped into an entry which was carpeted and which had a large map hanging against the wall the girl opened a door into a little room which looked somewhat like mr holidays study there was a great deal of handsome furniture in it and bookshelves around the walls a large table was in the middle of the room covered with books and papers  the girl handed jonas a seat  who shall i say has called said she to jonas as she was about to go out of the room  whyimy name is jonas he replied but i dont suppose mr edwards knows me i came to see him about his dog  at this remark the girl looked around towards the fire and jonas involuntarily turned his eyes in the same direction he saw there a large dog very much like franco in form and size lying upon the carpet he was as handsome as franco jonas was surprised to see him the girl too looked surprised she however said nothing but went out and shut the door  in a few minutes the door opened and an elderly gentleman with grayish hair and a mild and pleasant expression of countenance came in he nodded to jonas as he entered and jonas rose to receive him the gentleman then took a seat by the fire and asked jonas to sit down again  i came to see you sir about your dog said jonas  well my boy replied the man and what about my dog and as he said this he looked down at the dog which was lying upon the floor  i dont know but that i have got him  you have got him repeated mr edwards  yes sir a dog like that one came to me in the woods one day this winter  o said mr edwards you mean the dog that i lostyesi had forgotten that it is so long ago when did you find him  jonas then told the whole story of the dogs coming to them and of their attempt to drive him away and also of his seeing the advertisement in the tavern mr edwards asked him a great many questions such as what his name was where he lived and how long he had lived there and how he happened to be journeying now at last he said  i think it very probable that it is my dog i lost one of that description six or eight months ago and advertised him but i couldnt hear any thing of him and so i got another as much like him as i could it is probable yours is the same dog but i dont know that there is any particular proof of it you havent called him ney have you  no sir said jonas we call him franco  if he should come at the call of ney that would be proof where is he now  he is with me sir he is out in my sleigh  o well then said the man we can tell in a moment ill step to the door and call him  so mr edwards put on his hat and stepped to the door the dog was standing up in the sleigh and looking wildly around when he saw mr edwards he seemed more excited still  here ney said mr edwards  the dog leaped down from the sled and came bounding up the road he leaped first about mr edwards and then about jonas as if at a loss which was his master  why ney said mr edwardspoor neyhave you got back at last come walk in ney  ney slipped in through the door and turned immediately into the little room as if he was perfectly familiar with the localities jonas and mr edwards followed they shut the door and took their seats again ney ran around the room and examined every thing he looked at the strange dog lying so comfortably in his old place upon the warm carpet and then came and gazed up eagerly into his old masters face a moment he came to jonas and wagged his tail and then he went to the door and whined as if he wanted to go out  wont you let him out said mr edwards we will see what he will do  jonas opened the door and the dog ran out into the entry and then made the same signs to have the outer door opened jonas opened it and let him out jonas stepped out himself a moment to see what he would do and presently returned again to the room where he had left mr edwards  where did he go said mr edwards  he has run to the sleigh said jonas and jumped up into it and is lying down on the buffalo  the dog seems to have become attached to you jonas said mr edwards and i presume that you have become somewhat attached to him  yes sir very much indeed replied jonas  mr edwards was silent a few minutes appearing lost in thought  i hardly know what to say about this dog he continued at length you did very right to come and let me know about him i am afraid that some boys would have kept him without saying any thing about it i am glad that you were honest i valued the dog very much and would have given a large sum to have recovered him when he was first lost but i have got another now and dont really need two should you be disposed to buy him  yes sir said jonas if i could but i havent got but a dollar at my command and i suppose he is worth more than that  jonas had a dollar of his own mr holiday had given it to him when he left his house thinking it probable that he would want to buy something for himself jonas had taken this money with him when he left the farmers intending to expend a part of it in the market town but he did not see any thing that he really wanted and so the money was in his pocket now  why yes said mr edwards i gave a great deal more for him than that havent you any more money with you  not of my own said jonas  i suppose you got some for your produce  yes sir said jonas but it belongs to the farmer that i work with  and dont you think that he would be willing to have you pay a part of it for the dog  i dont know sir said jonas i know he likes the dog very much but i have no authority to buy him with his money  if jonas had been willing to have used his employers money without authority mr edwards would not have taken it he made the inquiry to see whether jonas was trustworthy  after a few minutes pause mr edwards resumed the conversation as follows  well jonas said he i have been thinking of this a little and have concluded to let you keep the dog for me a little whilethat is if he is willing to go with you but remember he is my property still and i shall have a right to call for him whenever i choose and you must give him up to me  yes sir said jonas i will and i wish that you would not agree to sell him to any body else without letting me know  well replied mr edwards i will not so you may take him and keep him till i send for himthat is provided he will go with you of his own accord i cant drive him away from his old home  jonas thanked mr edwards and rose to go mr edwards took his hat and followed him to the door to see whether the dog would go willingly when he was upon the step he called him  ney said he ney  ney looked up and in a moment afterwards jumped out of the sleigh and came running up to the door  now continued mr edwards if you can call him back while i am standing here it is pretty good proof that you have been kind to him and that he would like to go with you  so jonas walked down towards the gate looking back and calling  franco franco franco  the dog ran down towards him a little way and then stopped looked back and after a moments pause he returned a few steps towards his former master he seemed a little at a loss to know which to choose  jonas got into his sleigh  franco said he  franco looked at him then at mr edwards then at jonas and finally he went back to the door and began to lick his old masters hand  jonas turned his horses heads a little towards the road and moved them on a step  come franco said he franco come  franco hearing these words and seeing that jonas was actually going seemed to come to a final decision he leaped off the steps and bounded down the road through the gate and jumped up into jonass sleigh mr edwards continued to call him but he paid no attention to it he curled down before jonas a moment then he raised himself up a little so as to look back towards the house but he showed no disposition to get out again jonas put his hand upon his head and patted it gently as he drove away and when he found that franco was really going with him he turned his head back and said with a look of great satisfaction  goodby sir im very much obliged to you  goodby jonas take good care of ney  yes sir said he i certainly will  youre a good dog franco he continued patting his head to come with mevery good dog franco to choose the coarse hay for a bed under the old generals crib rather than that good warm carpet for the sake of coming with me ill make you a little house francoi certainly will and ill put a carpet on the floor ill make it as soon as i get home  and jonas did the next evening after he got home make franco a house just big enough for him and he found an old piece of carpet to put upon the floor he put franco in but the next morning he found him in his old place under the generals crib franco liked that place better the truth was it was rather warmer and then besides he liked the old generals company  illustration    chapter v   signs of a storm  one evening early in february the farmer told jonas that his work the next day would be to get out four or five bushels of corn and grain and go to mill accordingly after he had got through with his mornings work of taking care of the stock he took a halfbushel measure and several bags and went into the granary the granary was a small square building with narrow boards and wide cracks between them on the south side the building itself was mounted on posts at the four corners with flat stones upon the top of the posts for the corners to rest upon  the open work upon the side was to let the air in to dry the corn and the high posts and the flat stones were to keep the mice from getting in and eating it up  jonas put a short board across the top of the halfbushel and sat upon it then he began taking the corn and shelling it off from the cob by rubbing it against the edge of the board as he sat thus at work he occasionally looked up and he could see out of the open door of the granary into the farmyards  it was a very pleasant morning the sun shone beautifully and now and then a drop fell from the roof on the south side of the barn the cattle were standing basking in the sun in the barnyard and in the sheds where the sun could shine in upon them the whole area of the barnyard was trodden smooth and hard by the footsteps of the cattle and broad and smooth paths had been worn in every direction about the house behind the barn was a large sheepyard also well worn with the footsteps of the sheep a great many sheep were therenow and then eating hay from a long rack which extended across the yard  when jonas had shelled out the corn he carried the bags and put them into the sleigh which was generally used in going to mill then he locked the granary and put the key away and afterwards went to the barn and opened the great doors which led in to the barn floor he climbed up a tall ladder to a loft under the roof of the barn and threw down some sheaves of wheatas many as he thought would be necessary to produce the quantity of grain which the farmer had ordered he then descended the ladder and got a flail and began to thresh them out  standing now in a new position he had a different prospect before him beyond the barnyard he could see another larger yard nearer the house in which the snow had also been beaten down by the going and coming of teams sleds and all sorts of travel for two or three weeks during which there had been no new falls of snow upon one side of this yard was an enormous heap of wood which jonas and oliver had been hauling nearly all the winter on the other side was a quantity of timber of all sizes and lengths which the farmer and amos had been getting out for the new barn some of it was hewed and some not and several large pieces were laid out upon the level surface of the yard and the farmer and amos were sitting upon them working upon the frame amos was boring holes with an auger and the farmer was cutting the holes thus made into a square form with a chisel josey was there too and amelia they were building a house of the blocks which had been sawed off from the ends of the timbers  when however they heard the sound of jonass flail they left their play and came along to the barn to see him josey came into the barn amelia remained at the door  what are you doing jonas said josey  threshing some wheat replied jonas but stand back or i shall hit you with the flail  are you going to mill said josey  yes i or somebody else i am getting a grist ready  here comes uncle said josey i mean to ask him to let me go  the farmer came in and told jonas that he expected that they were going to have a snowstorm and therefore as soon as his grist was ready he might harness a horse into the sleigh and drive directly to mill  then said he you may come directly back and not wait to have it ground for i want you to go up to the woods this afternoon and bring down a load of small spruces which i cut for rafters i want them down before the road gets blocked up with snow  the farmer had reflected that about this time in the winter they were generally exposed to long and driving snowstorms by which the roads were often blocked up he usually endeavored to get all out of the woods which he had to get early in the season while the snow was not deep he had now got down all his wood and all his timber except one or two loads of rafters and he wished therefore to get those down so that in case of a severe storm he would not have to break out the road again  jonas accordingly despatched his preparations for going to mill as rapidly as possible and soon was ready in driving out he stopped opposite the place where the farmer was at work upon his frame  all ready i believe sir said jonas  very well said the farmer the pond road is a little the nearest isnt it  yes sir said jonas  and josey wants to go with you have you any objection to take him  no sir said jonas i should like very much to have him go  well josey get your greatcoat and come  o no sir said josey i dont need any greatcoat it isnt cold  very well then jump in  josey got in upon the top of the bags and jonas drove on after riding a short distance they turned down by a road which led to the pond which was now covered with so thick and solid a sheet of ice that it was safe travelling upon it and it was accordingly intersected with roads in every direction they rode down at a rapid trot to the ice followed by franco who was always glad to go upon an expedition  the road led them over very nearly the same part of the pond that jonas had navigated in his boat when he fitted a sail to itthough now the appearances were so different all around that one would hardly have supposed the scene to have been the same there was the same level surface but it was now a solid field white with snow instead of the undulating expanse of water of the deepblue color reflected from the sky there were the same islands and promontories and beaches but the verdure was gone and the naked whiteness of the beach seemed to have spread over the whole landscape it was a very pleasant ride however the road was level though very winding as it passed around capes and headlands and now and then took a wide circuit to avoid a breathinghole the sun shone pleasantly too  i dont see what signs there are of a snowstorm said josey  such a calm and pleasant day in february portends a storm said jonas besides the wind what there is is northeast and dont you see that snowbank off south  josey looked in the direction in which they were going which was towards the southwest and he saw a long white bank of cloud extending over that quarter of the heavens  is that a snowbank asked josey  it is a bank of snowclouds i suppose said jonas they call it a snowbank  by the time that the boys reached the mill a hazy appearance had overspread the whole sky they took out the grist and left it to be ground and then immediately got into the sleigh again and commenced their return before they had gone far the sky became entirely overcast and the distant hills to the southeast were enveloped in what appeared to be a kind of mist but which was really falling snow  how windy it is said josey  no said jonas it is not much more windy than it was when we came but then we were riding with it and now we are going against it you feel cold dont you  why yes a little said josey now the sun has gone and the wind has come  well then said jonas get down in the bottom of the sleigh and ill cover you up with buffaloes  so josey crept down into the bottom of the sleigh and jonas covered him up and he found his place very warm and comfortable  how do you like your place said jonas  very well said josey only i cant see where we are going  trust yourself to me said jonas ill drive you safely  i know it said josey and i wish youd tell me now and then what you see  well replied jonas i see a load of hay coming along on the pond before us  a large load said josey  yes replied jonas and now were going pretty near the round island there the load of hay is turning off by another road o there is a sleigh behind it it was hid before the sleigh is coming this way  i dont hear any bells said josey  we are too far off yet youll hear them presently  very soon josey did hear the bells they came nearer and nearer and at last jingled by close to his ears as soon as the sound had gone by he threw up the buffalo with his arms and looked out saying to jonas  i guess they wondered what you had got here covered up with the buffalo jonas  jonas smiled and josey covered himself up again not long after this it began to snow and jonas said that he could hardly see the shore in some places  suppose it should snow so fast said josey that you could not see the land at all then if you should come to two roads how could you tell which one to take  why one way replied jonas would be to let franco trot on before us and hed know the way  is franco coming along with us said josey  yes said jonas he is close behind  why dont you call him ney asked josey that is his real name  i was uncertain which to call him for some time said jonas but finally i concluded to let him keep both names and so now he is franco ney  well said josey i think that is a good plan  a short time after this jonas turned up off from the pond and soon reached home  illustration    chapter vi   the rescue  jonas found when he reached home that it was about dinnertime the farmer said that the storm was coming on sooner than he had expected and he believed that they should have to leave the rafters where they were but jonas said that he thought he could get them without any difficulty if the farmer would let him take the oxen and sled  the farmer finding that jonas was very willing to go notwithstanding the storm said that he should be very glad to have him try and josey he said might accompany him or not just as he pleased  i wouldnt go jonas said josey if i were you it is going to be a great storm  he however walked along with jonas to the barn to see him yoke the oxen the yard was covered with a thin coating of light snow which made the appearance of it very different from what it had been when they had left it the cows and oxen stood out still exposed their backs whitened a little with the fine flakes which had fallen upon them jonas went to the shed and brought out the yoke  jonas said josey i wouldnt go  no i think it very likely that you wouldnt you are not a very efficient boy  what is an efficient boy asked josey  one that has energy and resolution enough to go on and accomplish his object even if there are difficulties in the way  is that what you mean by being efficient said josey  yesa boy that hasnt some efficiency isnt good for much  as he said this jonas had got one of the oxen yoked he then went to bring up the other  when the other ox was up in his place jonas raised the end of the yoke and put it over his neck  you see continued he your uncle wants all those rafters got down it will be a little harder getting them in the storm but i care nothing for that it will be a great satisfaction to him to have them all safe down here before it drifts he doesnt require me to go but if i go voluntarily and bring them down dont you think that tomorrow morning when he finds two feet of snow on the ground hell be glad to think that all his rafters are safe in the yard  why yes said josey ive a great mind to go with you  do just as you please said jonas  well do you want me to go  yes i should like your company very well and besides perhaps you can help me  well said josey ill go  he accordingly followed jonas as he drove the oxen along to the sled jonas held up the tongue while josey backed the oxen so that he could enter the end of the tongue into the ring attached to the lower side of the yoke he then put the iron pin in and all was ready  jonas drove the oxen along till he came to the great gate in the back yard and then he stopped to go and get some chains the chains he fastened to the stakes which were in the sides of the sled then he opened the great gate and the oxen went through after which he seated himself upon the sled by the side of josey and so they rode along up into the woods  the storm increased though very slowly the road into the woods which had become well worn was now beginning to be covered here and there with little white patches wherever new snow driven along by the wind found places where it could lodge at length however they came to the woods and there they were sheltered from the wind and the snow fell more equally josey had found it quite cold riding in the open ground for the wind was against them but under the shelter of the trees he found it quite warm and comfortable  the forest appeared very silent and solitary it is true they could hear the moaning of the wind upon the tops of the trees but there was no sound of life and no motion but that of the fine flakes descending through the air in a gentle shower the whole surface of the ground and every thing lying upon it was covered with the snow for the branches and the stumps and the stems trimmed up for timber and the places where the old snow had been trampled down by the oxen and by the woodcutters were now all whitened over again and concealed  who would think said jonas that there could be any thing alive here  is there any thing said josey  yes thousands of animals all covered up in the snowmice in the ground and squirrels in the hollow logs and millions of insects frozen up in the bark of the dead trees  and theyll be covered up deeper before morning said josey  yes said jonas and so would our rafters if we didnt get them out we could not have found half of them if we had left them till after this storm  the rafters were lying around upon the old snow wherever small trees from which they had been formed had fallen they could be distinguished very plainly now although covered with an inch of snow  jonas and josey immediately went to work getting them together and placing them upon the sled when they had been at work in this way for some time jonas said  we shall not get half of them at this load  then what shall you do said josey  o come up again and get the rest  but then it will be dark before you get home  that will be no matter said jonas  only youll get lost and buried up in the snow  no said jonas there might be some danger tomorrow evening after it shall have been snowing four and twenty hours but not tonight the snow will not be more than a foot deep at midnight  when they had got as many of the rafters upon the sled as jonas thought the oxen could conveniently draw he secured the load by the chains and collected the rest of the sticks together a little on the ground then he told josey to climb up to the top of the load and ride he said that he would walk along by the side of the oxen josey found it more comfortable going back than it was coming up for the wind was now behind him and the snow did not drive into his face jonas walked along in the snow which was now nearly ankle deep and after they had got out of the woods there were some places where it had drifted much deeper  do you suppose that uncle has got his frame done said josey  i presume he has left it if he hasnt finished it said jonas  why why couldnt he stay out in the storm to work as well as we  because said jonas the snow would wet his tools and fill up his mortises and so trouble him a great deal more than it does us you cant do carpenters work out of doors in a snowstorm  do you mean to go after the other load asked josey  yes replied jonas  the boys found when they reached the yard that it was as jonas had predicted the farmer and amos had left their work and gone in they were in the shop grinding their tools the farmer asked jonas if he had got all the rafters  no sir said jonas there is another load  well well let them go said the farmer im very glad youve got one load down  i think sir said jonas if you have no objection id better go and get the rest i know just where they are and i can get them all down here before night  you wont have time to get down before it will be dark said the farmer  just as you think best sir said jonas but i think i can get out of the woods before dark and it is of no consequence about the rest of the way  very well said the farmer you may go dont you want amos to go with you  no sir it isnt necessary  no sir said josey i can go with him  so jonas threw off his load and then turned his team about and once more set out for the woods he and josey sat upon the sled talking by the waythe storm continuing without much change the snow gradually increased in depth but the oxen walked along without difficulty through it sometimes they came to a drift where the snow was so deep as to come in a little upon the bars where the boys were sitting but in general the sled runners glided along through it very smoothly  the woods appeared still more somber and solitary than they had done before the new snow was deeper and it was falling faster and besides as it was now nearly sundown there was only a gloomy sort of twilight under the trees jonas and josey loaded the sled as fast as they could they put on the last of the rafters which jonas had collected with great satisfaction josey especially began to be in haste to set out on his return  now said jonas ill look around a little just to see that there are none left behind  o no i wouldnt said josey let us go weve got them all i know  i want to be sure said jonas and make thorough work of it  so saying he began wading about in the snow to see if he could find any more rafters he however soon satisfied himself that they were all upon the sled he then secured his load carefully with the chains and they set out upon their return as before  it grew dark rapidly and the wind and storm increased when they came out of the woods they found that the air was very thick with the falling flakes and the drifts had begun to be quite large so that sometimes in plunging through them the snow would bank up quite high before the sled against the ends of the rafters jonas said that if they had been two hours later they could not have got along  you said that the snow wouldnt be a foot deep by midnight said josey  it is coming faster than i thought it would said jonas it is almost a foot deep now  the road by which the boys were advancing led along the bank of the brook until it reached nearly to the shore of the pond and then it turned off and went towards the house at a little distance from the shore when they reached this part of the road the storm which here swept down across the pond beat upon them with unusual fury the wind howled the snow was driven through the air and seemed to scud along the ground with great violence and the drifts running diagonally across the road were once or twice so deep that the oxen could hardly get the load through it was now almost dark too and all the traces of the road were obliteratedthough jonas knew by the land and fences how to go  just at this time when the wind seemed to lull for an instant jonas thought he heard a cry he stopped his oxen to listen  no said josey i dont believe it is any thing let us go on  in fact josey was afraid and wanted to get home as soon as he could  wait a minute said jonas he listened again and in a moment he heard the cry again it seemed to be a cry of distress but he could not distinguish any words  it is somebody off upon the pond said jonas  is the pond out that way asked josey  yes said jonas and i verily believe somebody is out on it and has lost his way  well said josey let us go home as fast as we can and tell uncle  no said jonas that wont do  jonas turned in the direction from which the sound appeared to come and putting his hands up to his mouth in the shape of a speakingtrumpet he called out as loud as he could call  halloo  he listened after he had thus called but there was no answer in a few minutes the cry which he had heard first was repeated in the same tone as before  they dont hear me said jonas  halloo cried out josey as loud as he could call  there was no answer but in a few seconds afterwards the cry was repeated as at first  you see said jonas that the wind blows this way and they cant hear us we must go out after them  josey tried to dissuade jonas from this plan but jonas said he must go and that as they had oxen with them there would be no danger first said he we must throw off our load  so he and josey went to work and threw off the rafters as fast as they could jonas reserved four or five rafters which he left upon the sled then he turned the oxen in the direction from which the cry had come they continued to hear it at moderate intervals  they descended gradually a short distance across the field and then they came to the shore of the pond here jonas took off one of his rafters and laid it upon the shore with one end raised up out of the snow  what is that for said josey  to show us the way back to our road said jonas i place it so that it points right backthe way we came  we can tell by our tracks said josey  no said jonas our tracks will all be covered up before we come back  jonas then drove down upon the pond guiding his oxen in the direction of the cry he kept josey upon the sled so as not to exhaust his strength he rode himself too as much as he could but he was obliged to jump off very frequently to keep the oxen in a right direction he stopped occasionally to put down a rafter placing it so that its length should be in the line of his road and taking care to sink one end into the snow so as to leave the other out as far as possible to prevent its being all buried up before they should return every now and then too he would answer the cry as loud as he could call  at last after they had toiled along in this way for some time jonas thought that he succeeded in making the travellers hear for immediately after his call he would hear a calling from them following it and speaking in a different way though jonas could not understand what was said he kept pressing forward steadily and before long he found that the travellers were silent excepting immediately after he called to themwhen there was a sound as if intended for a response though jonas could not tell what was said  we shall get to them josey said he  who do you suppose it is said josey  i dont know very probably some travellers lost upon the pond  jonas was right in his conjecture as they came nearer and nearer the sounds became more distinct  halloo vociferated jonas  halloo was the answer canyoucomeandhelpus  ay ay said jonas were coming  ay ay shouted josey in his loudest voice which being more shrill than that of jonas was perhaps heard farther  still nothing was to be seen besides being dark the atmosphere was thick with snow so it was not until they got very near to the travellers that they could see them at all they saw at last however some darklooking object before them on coming up to it they found that it was a horse and sleigh the horse was in a very deep snowdrift and was half lying down there was a woman in the sleigh with a small child in her arms and a boy about as large as josey standing at the horses head  o i am so glad you have got some oxen sir said the woman we couldnt have got out without oxen  i dont see how the snow happens to be so deep just here  why its that island said the woman i suppose there is an island off there i told isaiah it would be drifted under this island and now the horse is all beat out and besides we dont know the way  well said jonas ill hook the oxen on and well soon get you to the land isaiah you take your horse out of the sleigh  so isaiah went to work to unhook the traces and the holdbacks in order to get the horse free from the sleigh  ill get out said the woman  no said jonas you sit still and keep your child warm  as soon as isaiah had taken the horse out jonas told him to lead him around behind the sleigh while he turned the shafts over back against the dasher and then he brought the oxen up in front of the sleigh he first however drove the oxen out of the road with the sled so as to leave that where it would not be in the way then he took two chains from the sled and attached the oxen by means of them to the forward part of the sleigh when all was ready he put josey in with the woman and let isaiah lead his horse behind he then started the oxen  are you going to leave the sled here said josey  yes said jonas we can come and get it after the storm is over  the oxen drew the sleigh along very easily the snow was quite deep for a little distance and then it became less so but it was very dark and it was difficult for jonas to follow his track the snow blew across it with great violence and was fast filling it up  however jonas soon came to his first rafter and this encouraged him it was a good deal covered with snow but the end was out and the direction of it showed him which way to go in order to find the next one after he had passed this guide the path was no more to be distinguished he went on however as nearly as he could in the direction indicated by the rafter and after going the proper distance he began to look out before him for the second he began to be a little anxious lest he had missed it when he observed something dark in the snow at a little distance on the right he went to it and found that it was the rafter  thus he was upon his track again but his having so narrowly escaped missing it made him afraid that he should not be able to follow the train very far his fears proved well grounded all his efforts to discover the third rafter were entirely unavailing  tis of no consequence said jonas we cant be far from the shore ill keep straight on and we shall strike the land somewhere not far from the house  but it is much easier to get bewildered in a storm than jonas had supposed the darkness the obscurity produced by the falling snow the perfect and unvarying level of the surface in every direction the same and the agitation of mind which even the most resolute must experience in such a situation all conspired to make it difficult in a case like this to find the way jonas drove on in the direction which he thought would have led to the shore but after going amply far enough to reach it no shore was to be seen the fact was that he had insensibly deviated just so far from his course as to be going along parallel with the shore instead of in the direction towards it jonas began to be somewhat concerned and josey was in a state of great anxiety and fear  he rose up in the sleigh and attempted to look around and his fear was suddenly changed into terror at seeing a large black animal like a bear coming furiously up behind them bounding over the snow josey screamed aloud  what is the matter said the woman  why franco franco said jonas how could you get here  it was franco true enough he came swiftly along leaping and staggering through the deep snow and he seemed delighted to have found jonas and his party at last jonas patted his head both jonas and franco were overjoyed to see each other  illustration that cant be the way franco said jonas  jonas patted francos head and praised him while the dog wagged his tail whisked about and shook the snow off from his back and sides  what dog is that said the woman  this is franco said jonas franco ney is his name now we shall have no trouble in getting out  franco turned off short from the road in which jonas was going he knew by instinct which way the shore lay from them jonas at first hesitated about following him  that cant be the way franco said he  but franco after plunging on a few steps looked round and whined then he came back towards jonas again a few steps looking him full in the face and then whisked about again and went on farther than beforeand then stopped and looked back as if to see whether jonas was going to follow him jonas stood just in advance of the oxen hesitating  that must be the way said jonas franco knows  no that isnt the way said the woman the dog dont know any thing about it we must go straight forward  no said jonas it will be safest to follow franco and so saying he began to turn his oxen in the direction indicated by franco  the woman remonstrated against this with great earnestness she said that they should only get entirely lost for he was leading them altogether out of their way but jonas considered that the responsibility properly belonged to him and that he must act according to his own discretion so he pushed forward steadily after franco  but his progress was now interrupted by hearing another loud call behind him back upon the pond  whats that said josey  somebody calling said jonas  more travellers lost said the womano dear me  he listened again and heard the calls more distinctly he thought he could distinguish his own name he answered the call and was himself answered in return by mens voices which now seemed more distinct and nearer  i know now who it is said jonas it is your uncle and amos coming out after us franco was with them  jonas was right in a few minutes the farmer and amos came up and they were exceedingly surprised when they saw jonas with his oxen drawing a sleigh with a woman in it off the pond instead of a sled load of rafters from the woods  jonas said he with astonishment how came you here  i came to help isaiah get off the pond said jonas but how did you find out where we were  franco guided us said the farmer he followed the road along some time and then he wanted to turn off suddenly towards the pond we wouldnt follow him for some time but he would go that way and no other when he came to the shore of the pond we found your rafter laid there and that made us think you must have gone upon the ice but we couldnt imagine what for at last we found where you had left the sled and then we began to halloo to you  but uncle said josey didnt you see our heap of rafters by the road where we turned off  no said his uncle  we put a load there  then they must have got pretty well covered up said he for we didnt observe them  the whole party followed franco who led them out to the shore the shortest way they took isaiah and his mother to the house and gave them some supper and let them stay there that night the next morning when jonas got up he found that it was clearing away and when after breakfast he looked out upon the pond to see if he could see any thing of his sled he observed away out half a mile from shore two short rows of stakes sticking up in the snow not far from on island the body of the sled was wholly buried up and concealed from view    chapter vii   a fire  the last of february drew nigh which was the time fixed upon for josey to go home he had remained with his uncle much longer than his father had at first intended but now they wanted him to return before the roads broke up in the spring  the evening before josey was to go the farmer was sitting by the fire when jonas came in from the barn  jonas said the farmer i have got to write a letter to my brother to send by josey tomorrow why wont you take a sheet of paper and write for me and ill tell you what to say you are rather handier with the pen than i am  jonas accordingly brought a sheet of paper and a pen and ink and took his place at a table at the back side of the room and the farmer dictated to him as follows       dear brother      i take this opportunity to inform you that we are all alive     and well and i hope that you may be the same this will be     handed to you by josey who leaves us tomorrow according     to your orders we have been very glad to have him with us     though he hasnt had opportunity to learn much however i     suppose hell fetch up again in his learning when he gets     home he has behaved pretty fair on the whole as boys go     he will make a smart man ive no doubt though he dont     seem to take much to farming      we hope to have you and your wife and children come and     pay us a visit this coming summersay in raspberry time     which will be just after haying  there said the farmer now fold it up and write my brothers name on the back and tomorrow morning ill look it over and sign my name to it  jonas accordingly folded the letter up and wrote upon the back joseph jones esq bristol when it was done he laid it on the table  amos came and took it up jonas said he i wish i could write as well as that  the farmer had a daughter whose name was isabella she was about eighteen years old she was at this time spinning in a corner of the room near a window she came forward to look at the letter  yes jonas said she you write beautifully i wish youd teach me to write like that  very well said jonas that i can do  how can you do it said isabella  why we can have an evening school these long evenings replied jonas you get through your spinning in time to have half an hour for school before bedtime  half an hour wouldnt be enough said amos  o yes replied jonas half an hour every day will amount to a great deal in three months  yes said the farmer thats a very good plan you shall have an evening school and jonas shall teach youan excellent plan  what shall we study said isabella  whatever you want to learn replied jonas you say you want to learn to write that will do for one thing  and i want to learn more arithmetic said amos  very well said jonas well have an evening school half an hour every evening beginning at eight oclock have you got any schoolbooks in the house isabella  isabella said there were some on a shelf up stairs  well said jonas bring them to me and ill look over them and form a plan  isabella brought jonas the schoolbooks and he looked them over but said nothing then about his plan he reflected upon the subject until the next day because he did not wish to propose any thing to them until it was well matured  the next evening at eight oclock isabella put up her spinning and took a seat by the fire to hear jonass plan amos sat by a table at the back side of the room the farmers wife was sitting upon the settle knitting and the farmer himself was asleep in his armchair at the opposite corner  now said jonas i like the plan of having an evening school and i am willing to be either teacher or pupil only if i am teacher i must direct and you must both do as i say  no said isabella you mustnt direct entirely well talk over the plans all together and then do as we all agree  no said jonas i have no idea of having all schooltime spent in talking im perfectly willing that either of you should be teacher and ill obey ill set copies or do any thing else you please only i wont have any responsibility about the arrangements or if you wish im willing to be teacher but then in that case i must direct every thing just as i think is bestand you must do just as i say  well said isabella what are your orders well obey  amos and oliver also agreed that they would obey his directions jonas then consented to take the station of teacher and he proceeded to give his directions  i have been looking at the books said he and i find we havent got but one of each kind  then we cant have any classes in our school said oliver  yes we can said jonas the first evening amos may take the arithmetic and the slate and cipher while isabella writes and oliver studies a good long spelling lesson then the second evening amos shall study the spelling lesson and isabella cipher and oliver write  but i dont want to cipher said isabella i dont like arithmetic i never could understand it  you promised to obey my orders said jonas  well said isabella ill try but i know i cant do the sums  then the third evening said jonas isabella shall study the spelling lesson oliver the arithmetic and amos take the writingbook  what aint you going to have but one writingbook  no said jonas one is enough because you wont all write the same evening so you can write one page oliver another and amos the third  no said isabella i dont like that i want every scholar to have his own book  if youll be the teacher said jonas you can have it so  but i want to have it so and you be the teacher said isabella  no said jonas if i have the responsibility of teacher i must have the power too  well said isabella i suppose we had better submit  but whats the reason jonas said oliver that you aint willing that we should all have writingbooks of our own  there are two or three reasons said jonas but it is very poor policy for a schoolmaster to spend his time in convincing his scholars that his regulations are good he must make them obey and let them see that the regulations turn out to be good in the end  but it seems to me youve grown arbitrary all at once said amos with a smile  yes said jonas im always arbitrary when im in command if you mean by arbitrary determined to have my own way i wont usurp any power but if you put it upon me i shall use it you may depend upon it  jonas had two good reasons why he wanted to have only one writingbook for all his scholars one was that he thought it uncertain how long their school plan would last and he did not want to trouble the farmer to look up some paper and then make a parade of preparing so many writingbooks and then perhaps the whole plan might be abandoned when they had written four or five pages in each and therefore as he found one old writingbook of olivers half full he determined to make the blank leaves of that answer for all  but he had another reason still he thought that if all his scholars should write in succession in the same book their writing would come into such close juxtaposition and comparison that each one would be stimulated to write with greater attention and care as each one would wish his or her own page to look as neatly written as the rest he knew that isabella when it came to her turn to write would naturally without any thing being said look at amoss work on the page before and that she would observe its excellences and its faults and that her page would probably be written better in consequence of her criticism upon his  thus though jonas had good reasons he chose not to give them he preferred if he was going to be teacher that they should not be in the habit of expecting him to give reasons for all his directions so he simply expressed his decision upon the subject by saying  you may do just as you please about making me teacher but if you put me into the office you must expect to have to obey  thats right jonas said the farmers wife i am glad to see you make em mind  it was settled without any further discussion that jonass plan in regard to the writing should be adopted and that his scholars would obey his directions in other things whatever they might be jonas then proceeded as follows  now you see that if we go on so three evenings you will all have got three lessons and the fourth evening we will have for recitation i will hear you spell and examine your writing and see if your sums are done right  jonass exposition of the plan of his school was here interrupted by the farmers wife who as she sat at the end of the settle towards the fire had her face somewhat turned towards the window and she saw a light at a distance near the horizon  what light is that said she  jonas and all his school rose and went to the window to see  the window looked towards the pond they looked off across a sort of bay beyond which there was a long point of landthe one which the boys had had to sail around when they went to mill just over this land and near the extremity of it a light was to be seen as if from a fire beyond and behind the land  thats exactly in the direction of the village said amos  it is a house on fire i know said oliveror a store  it looks like a fire certainly said jonas  yes said the farmers wife and you must go boys and help put it out  it is several miles off said amos  yes but put kate into the light sleigh and shell carry you there over the pond in twenty minuteshere husband husband she continued calling to the farmer who was still asleep in his chair heres a fire  the farmer opened his eyes and sat upright in his chair and asked what was the matter  heres a fire she repeated over in the village hadnt the boys better go and put it out  the farmer rose walked very deliberately to the window looked a minute at the light and then said  its nothing but the moon  the moonno it cant be the moon husband said she the moon dont rise there  yes said the farmer thats just about the place  besides said she it isnt time for the moon to rise it dont rise now till midnight  he turned away and walked slowly across the room to where the almanac was hanging he seemed very sleepy he turned over the leaves and then said moon riseseight hours and fifty minutes that islets seeten minutes before nine  well said his wife and tisnt much past eight now  its the moon you may depend said the farmer perhaps our time is a little out so he returned to the chair sat down in it and put his feet out towards the fire  well said his wife we shall know pretty soon for if it is the moon it will soon rise higher  so they all stood a few minutes and watched the light it seemed to enlarge a little and to grow somewhat brighter but it did not move from its place  it certainly must be a fire said the farmers wife again and i wish husband that youd let the boys take kate in the sleigh and go along the pond and see  ive no objection said the farmer if theyve a mind to take that trouble but theyll find nothing but the moon they may depend  lets go said amos  very well said jonas im ready  well go too boys said the farmers wife isabella and i you can put in two seats there are no hills and kate will take us all along like a bird i never saw a fire in my life  the boys hastened to the barn and got kate out of the stall franco who knew that something extraordinary must have taken place though he could not tell what came out from his place leaped about and indicated by his actions that wherever they were going he meant to go too  the sleigh was soon harnessed they drove up to the door and found isabella and her mother all ready they took their places upon the back seat while amos and jonas sat upon another seat which they had placed in before oliver came running with a bucket which he put in under the forward seat and then he jumped on behind standing upon the end of the runner and clinging to the corner of the sleigh close to isabellas shoulder  kate set off at a rapid trot down the road which led to the pond the sleigh went very easily for the road was smooth there had been rain and thaws lately and cold weather after them so that the surface of the road had melted and then become frozen again and this made it icy they found the ice of the pond in the same state the rain and the thaws had melted the snow upon the top of the ice and made it a sheet of water then this had frozen again so that now the surface of the pond was almost every where hard and smooth and when they came down upon it and turned to go across the bay the horse being at his full speed the sleigh swept round sideways over the ice in a great circle and made the farmers wife very much afraid that she should be upset it seemed as if the sleigh was trying to get before the horse  however amos who was driving contrived to get the horse ahead again and then they went on with great speed it was a mile across to the end of the point of land but kate carried them over this space in a very few minutes as they drew near to the point they watched the light it did not rise at all  it cannot be the moon said jonas for it is now full a quarter of an hour since we first saw it  yes said the farmers wife i knew it couldnt be the moon  just at this moment the sleigh came around the point with great speed and brought into view a very bright but distant fire far before them  it is a fire they all exclaimed  but it isnt in the direction of the village said jonas  it must be some farmhouse said the farmers wife on the shore  no said jonas i think it is on the ice  it very soon became evident that the fire was upon the ice it was plainly a large fire though the distance made it look rather small it was very bright and it flashed up high and a cloud of illuminated smoke arose from it and floated off to the northward the party in the sleigh could soon perceive also a number of small bright spots near it which seemed to be in motion about the fire they looked like the moons about the planet jupiter seen through a telescope  i wonder what it is said isabella  i presume said jonas that the boys are out skating and this is a fire on the ice which they have built  and are those the boys moving about asked oliver  yes said jonas when they are near the fire the light shines upon their faces  as they rode on it became gradually more and more evident that jonas was right the forms of the skaters as they stood before the fire or came wheeling up to it became more and more distinct and in fact the ringing sound of the skates soon became audible the horse in the mean time went on with great speed directly towards the fire when they arrived near the fire the skaters came around them in great numbers wondering who could have come jonas asked them where they got the wood to build their fire  all along the shore said a large boy with a long stick in his hand lets go and get some more boys he added and brighten up our fire  so saying he wheeled round and skated away the whole crowd of skaters small and great following him at full speed as they swept round by the fire the light glared brightly upon their faces and forms but they soon disappeared from view in the darkness beyond only jonas could hear the sound of their skates ringing over the ice as they receded  what a great hot fire said oliver  yes said isabella i never saw such a large fire on the ice i dont see how they got all the wood  i suppose said jonas that they got out the wood from the forest along the shore and threw it out upon the ice before they put on their skates and then they could easily bring it to the fire but hark they are coming back again  the fire was so bright where they were and it flashed so strongly upon the ice around that they could not see the skaters until they came pretty near the dark figures however soon began to appear the foremost was a tall young man who came forward with great speed pushing before him a long and slender log half decayed and dry one end he held before him in his hands and the other glided along upon the smooth ice towards the fire  there followed close behind him another skater with the fragment of an old stump upon his shoulder then several others with branches sticks dry bushes and fragments of every shape and size these they piled upon the fire as they swept up alongside of it and then wheeled away back from the heat which radiated from it two large boys came on bringing a long log between them one at each end it looked large but it was really not very heavy as it was hollow and decayed they hove it up with great effort upon the fire and its fall upon the heap threw up a large bright column of sparks and flame another boy had the top of a young spruce which he had cut off with his knife by dint of great labor it made a great roaring and crackling when it was put upon the fire and finally behind all the rest there came a little boy not so big as oliver tugging away at a long branch which he dragged behind him and put it upon the fire too  well said the farmers wife after a little time we mustnt stay here much longer  well drive around the fire in one great sweep said jonas  so he started the horse on and took a great circuit about the fire the skaters went with him on each side of the sleigh then they turned their course towards home again the light of the fire shone upon the distant point of land and illuminated it faintly but in a very beautiful manner and showed jonas which way to drive  isabella turned back her head repeatedly to look at the fire as they rode on and left it far behind them it seemed to grow smaller and smaller as they receded and at length when jonas turned around the point of land it disappeared entirely in a few minutes afterward the moon arose and lighted them the rest of the way home  illustration    chapter viii   the cardingmill  jonas was often sent away to transact business for the farmer he was a very excellent hand to do business it requires several qualities to make a boy good at business he must be gentlemanly in his manners so as to speak to the persons that he is sent to in a respectful and proper manner he must be faithful so as not to neglect what is intrusted to him and he must be patient and persevering then he must also have considerable judgment and discretion for when he is sent away from home on business he must often be placed in circumstances that are unforeseen and where he must act without instructions in such cases he will have to exercise his own judgment and discretion jonas was placed in such circumstances at one time when he was sent to the cardingmill to get some rolls for isabella  the rolls which isabella wanted were rolls of wool as they are prepared at the mill ready for spinning the wool is carded very fine and then by curious machinery it is rolled out into rolls about three feet long and as large round as a whiphandle at the middle these rolls isabella used to spin into yarn at her spinningwheel  isabella had spun nearly all her rolls and she wanted jonas to carry some wool to the cardingmill and get some more the cardingmill was not in the village upon the outlet stream but it was upon another stream which emptied into the pond instead of flowing from it it was the same stream that flowed by the land which jonas and oliver had cleared when he first came to live with the farmer only the mill was at some distance from the mouth of the stream back towards the high land it was more than two miles by the road from the farmers house  the farmer told jonas where to get the wool and then gave him some more business at a place in the woods about two miles beyond the mill oliver wanted to go too and his father gave him leave oliver always liked to go to the mill as the machine for carding the wool was a great curiosity  jonas put up the wool in a very large bundle which almost filled up the bottom of the sleigh jonas himself sat upon the seat with his feet under the bundle but oliver sat upon the bundle he said it made a very soft seat  they rode along pleasantly towards the mill the snowdrifts were very high in some places on each side of the road and the fences and walls were almost buried up  i wish that josey was here said oliver i think that he would like to see the cardingmill very much indeed  yes said jonas  only replied oliver perhaps it would be dangerous to take him  why said jonas  why because said oliver i suppose he would touch the machinery and perhaps get his hands torn off  yes said jonas boys sometimes do get very badly hurt in millscareless and disobedient boys especially  i think that he is a careless and disobedient boy said oliver  illustration he said it made a very soft seat  yes but it is his misfortune rather than his fault replied jonas  his misfortune repeated oliver  yes said jonas his fathers situation is such that it is very unfortunate for him i expect he is very unhappily situated at home in many respects  how said oliver  why in the first place said jonas he lives im told in a large and handsome house  yes said oliver  and then continued jonas your aunt i have heard is a very fine woman and has a great deal of company  well said oliver  and then continued jonas they can buy josey any thing he wants for playthings  yes said oliver he told me he had got a rockinghorse but i dont call that being unfortunate  it is very fortunate for the father and mother but such a kind of life is generally unfortunate for the child you see if a man has been industrious himself when he was a boy and has grown up to be a good business man and to acquire a great deal of property and builds a good house and has plenty of books and journeys it is all very well for him he can bear it but it very often spoils his children  why does it spoil his children asked oliver  in the first place it makes them conceited and vainnot always but often the children of wealthy men are very often conceited they wear better clothes than some other boys and have more books and prettier playthings and so they become vain and think that they are very important when in fact they owe every thing to their fathers  then besides continued jonas they dont form good habits of industry their fathers dont make them work and so they dont acquire any habits of industry and patience and perseverance  if i was a man and had ever so much money said oliver i would make my boys work  that is very doubtful said jonas  why is it doubtful asked oliver  because said jonas you would be very busy and couldnt attend to it it would be a great deal more trouble to make your boys do any thing than it would be to hire another man to do it and so you would hire a man to save your trouble  yes but then jonas farmers are very busy and yet they make their boys work  true replied jonas but farmers are busy about such kind of work as that their boys can help them do itso they can keep them at work without any special trouble but men of property are employed in such kind of business as boys cannot do and so they must work if they work at all at something else and that makes a good deal of trouble  then id send my boys to some farmer and let him make them work said oliver  yes said jonas that would do pretty well  so saying jonas stopped the horse a moment and stepped out of the sleigh he was at the foot of a long steep hill in the woods he was going to walk up oliver remained in the sleigh and rode when they reached the top jonas got in again and they rode on  but then jonas said oliver there is one thing to be thought of and that is that rich mens sons will not have to work when they grow up and so they dont need so much to grow industrious  o yes they will said jonas  why josey told me that he didnt expect to work when he should be a man  no he doesnt expect to work but hell find that it is different from what he had expected when he grows up  how said oliver  why a great many rich mens boys find when they get to be twentyone that they have to go out into the world and earn their own living without any money  why said oliver wont their fathers give them any money  their fathers cannot generally give them enough to support them said jonas even if they are disposed to do it because you see they have their own families still to support besides if they were to divide their property at once among all their children it would only be a small portion for each one it wouldnt be enough for the boys to live as expensively as they have been living while at home therefore as fast as they grow up young men they have to go away into the world and earn their own money by some kind of work head work or hand work  jonas would probably have given oliver some further explanations on this subject were it not that about this time they arrived at the mill oliver tied the horse at a post while jonas took out the great bundle of wool and went in oliver followed immediately after him  the machinery made a heavy rumbling sound which grew louder and louder as the boys went up stairs jonas opened a door into a large room and at this the noise increased very loudly so that oliver and jonas could hardly hear each other talk jonas put down the bundle of wool by the door and then he and oliver went in among the wheels and machinery there were a great many separate machines at different parts of the room with girls tending them there was a large round beam of wood overhead slowly revolving there were wheels upon it in different parts with straps passing around these wheels and also around other wheels connected with the machines below  oliver saw jonas walk to a man who was writing at a desk in the corner of a room and say something to him oliver could not hear what it was jonas pointed while he was talking to the man to the great bundle of wool presently the man came and took the bundle of wool and dragged it off to one of the machines which was not in motion he called a girl to come and tend it  at one end of the machine was a broad band of cloth passing around two rollers one roller was close to the wheels and other large rollers of the machine itself the other was back from it a little and the cloth being extended from one of these to the other formed a sort of flat table just before the machine  the girl who came to tend the machine immediately opened the great bundle of wool and then she took up a handful of it and began to spread it evenly over the cloth when she had got the cloth pretty nearly covered she pulled a handle pretty near her and that in some mysterious way or other set the machinery agoing the cloth with all the wool upon it began to move towards the great rollers of the machine these rollers were covered with card teeth and the wool as it was drawn in between them was carded fine and spread evenly over all the surface and in a few minutes jonas and oliver found that it began to come out at the other end in the shape of rolls one roll after another dropped out in a very singular manner oliver thought that it was a very curious machine indeed to take in wool in that way at one end and drop it out in beautiful long rolls at the other  now said jonas after a few minutes to oliver i am going away farther and shall come back here in about an hour you may go with me or you may stay herejust which you prefer  well said oliver ill stay here  goodby then said jonas i shall be back again in about an hour  so jonas went down stairs and oliver began to walk about the room a little there was a window in the back side of the room which he happened to pass pretty near to and he stopped to look out at it he saw the dam and the waterfall below there was a large pond above the fall which was made by the dam the pond was frozen over and the ice was covered with snow the water was open for a short distance above the edge of the fall and it was also open below the fall where there was a great foaming and tumbling and whirling of currents  oliver looked at it a moment and then he concluded that it would be better for him to go with jonas  i have seen said he to himself pretty much all of the machinery and i shall be very tired of waiting here an hour  so he concluded that he would run down quick and see if jonas had gone  when he got down stairs and out at the door he found that the sleigh was not at the post he ran around the corner and saw jonas at some distance just at the foot of a hill he ran after him calling jonas jonas  just at this time jonas stopped to let his horse walk up the hill and so he heard oliver calling for the bells did not make so much noise when the horse was walking as they did before  so jonas stopped until oliver overtook him and they went on the rest of the way together  illustration    chapter ix   difficulty  although it was winter when the boys were taking this ride yet the sun was shining in a very warm and pleasant manner and the snow was every where softening in the fields and melting in the roads indicating that the spring was coming on  there was a little stream of water coming down the hill in the middle of the road and forming a long pool at the bottom jonas turned his horse to one side to avoid this pool of water and waited until oliver came up  well oliver said hetired of the mill already  why no said oliver only i thought that on the whole id rather go with you i didnt think that you were going to be gone so long  it is about two miles said jonas  where are you going said oliver  o to see about some logs i thought you heard your father tell me to go and see about some logs  what about the logs said oliver  why to make the boards of for the barn  o replied oliver i didnt know that  yes continued jonas when we want boards we have to go to somebody who owns some pine timber in the woods and get him to cut down some of them and haul them to the mill then they saw them up and make boards  what mill said oliver  at that sawmill near the cardingmill the mill down in the village you know is a gristmill  by this time the boys had got to the top of the hill and they got into the sleigh and rode along presently they came to a place where jonas was going to turn off into a sort of byroad which led away into the woods where the pinetrees grew the man that owned the trees lived pretty near in a farmhouse  is that the road that we are going in asked oliver  yes said jonas but it does not look very promising  the road was filled up nearly full of snow it had been hard so that they could travel upon it pretty well but the warm sun had softened the snow so much that the horses feet sunk down into it in some places very deep however jonas went along as well as he could  let us get out and walk jonas said oliver  no said jonas that will not do much good for it is the weight of the horse himself that makes him sink into the snow not the weight of the sleigh  so the boys both continued to ride in the sleigh they soon came into the woods where the ground being sheltered by the trees above the snow lay more evenly upon it and though the horse slumped a little yet he got along very comfortably  at length however they came out of the woods into an opening the road went along under a high bank with a deep brook on the other side the wind during the storms in the winter had blown in over this bank and filled up the road entirely  now said jonas i am afraid were in difficulty  why said oliver is that a very bad place  yes said jonas it looks like a very bad place  oliver saw that the snow was very deep on the upper side of the road and that it sloped away in such a manner that it would be very difficult for them to get along even if the roadway was hard  perhaps it is hard said oliver  no said jonas i think it cannot be for the bank slopes to the south and the sun has been shining upon it all day however we must try it  the horse hesitated a moment when he came to this place for he knew by instinct that it would be very hard for him to get through it  come general said jonas though stop a moment oliver perhaps we had better get out and walk or the sleigh may upset  so they got out oliver walked by the horse keeping on the upper side of the road jonas went behind taking hold of the back part of the sleigh so as to hold it in case it should tip down too far they went on thus for some distance tolerably well the horse sometimes got in pretty far and for a moment would plunge and stagger as if he could hardly get along but then he would work his way out and go on a little farther  at length however the old general came to a full stop he sank down shoulders under in the snow the more he struggled to get free the deeper he got in jonas stepped on before him and patted him on the head and tried to quiet him  jonas said oliver let us stop i dont believe we can go any farther  nor i said jonas at least i dont think we can get the old general any farther  nor back again either said oliver as i see  the boys stood still looking upon the horse a moment utterly at a loss what to do  oliver said jonas should you be willing to stay here and take care of the horse while i go on and see about the logs  whyidont know said oliver im afraid he wont stand quiet  o i shall get him out of the snow first said jonas and take him to some level place where hell stand well  how shall you get him out asked oliver  why we will unharness him first said jonas and then draw the sleigh back out of the way  so jonas began to unbuckle the straps of the harness in order to liberate the horse oliver tried to help him but he could not do much the horse was so deep in the snow and besides he was standing or rather lying in such a position that many parts of the harness were drawn so tense that oliver had not strength enough to unbuckle them  however jonas at length got the sleigh separated from the horse and drew it back out of the way he trampled the snow down around the horse as much as he could and then the horse with a leap and a plunge recovered his footing he stood deep in the snow yet however  now said jonas where shall we put him till i come back  oliver looked across the brook and saw there upon a bank under some trees a spot which was bare the reason why it was bare was that the snow had nearly all blown off during the storms and then the sun which had been shining for some days so pleasantly had melted away what there had been left and now the ground was bare and almost dry but the difficulty was to get to it for it was upon the other side of the stream and the bed of the stream was filled with water and ice  i wouldnt lead him over there said oliver i think you had better go home and not do any thing about the timber  no said jonas  why father will not think you did wrong to give it up when we got into such trouble said oliver  no i dont suppose he would but id rather carry him back an answer if i can  then let me go with you said oliver  why it is a long and very hard walk said jonas there is no work so hard as travelling in soft snow without snowshoes if we had a pair of snowshoes we could get along very well  did you ever see any snowshoes said oliver  no replied jonas but i have read about them they are very large and flat and your foot stands in the middle of them and so presses them upon the snow and they are so large that they will not sink in very far  while jonas was saying this he was climbing down to the bank of the brook with a pole in his hands with which he was going to see if he could find firm footing for the horse to go across  yes said he punching his pole down to the bottom of the brook yes it isnt deep the old general will get down here very well i think  so he and oliver trampled a sort of path down to the brook and then they led the old general down he seemed a little reluctant at first to step into the water however he soon went in and walked over and oliver fastened him to a tree so that he could stand upon the bare piece of ground jonas then pulled the sleigh out of the road so that it should not be in the way if any body should come along with any other team then he bade oliver goodby and went on alone  jonas traveled along as well as he could through the snow though he found it very laborious walking in some places he found hard footing for some distance but then he would sink down again for several successive steps after a short distance he got out of the deep drift which had prevented the horse from going on and then he could advance faster there was a singularlooking track in the road it consisted of a smooth groove in the snow as if the end of a large log had been dragged along  it was in fact made by a log which had been drawn along that road towards the mill one end of the log had been placed upon a sled and the other left to drag along in the snow and this was what made the smooth groove which jonas observed he did not see it before because the man who drove the sled had turned out of the main road into a byway across the fields to avoid the deep drift where jonass horse got into difficulty  jonas found it pretty good walking after this the snow was not so deep as it had been and the path which the log had made was hard and smooth he concluded that it must have been made by such a log and of course if he followed it that it would take him directly to the house of the man whom he wanted to see  after walking about a mile he came to the house it was a small farmhouse in the woods there were a great many large logs lying each side of the road near it ready to be drawn to the mill  jonas went up towards the door which was in the end of the house as he drew near to it he saw a boys head behind an enormous pile of wood he went around it and found that the boy was about as big as jonas himself he was rolling down a large stick of wood and had an axe in his hand as if he was going to chop it  does mr woodman live here said jonas  yes said the boy but he isnt at home  where is he said jonas  he is out in the lot falling trees said the boy  how far is it from here asked jonas  o about a good half mile  which way said jonas  out yonder said the boy and he pointed back of the house where a rough sledroad led into the woods you can hear his axe  jonas listened and he heard distinctly the sound of an axe in the woods behind presently it ceased immediately after there was a prolonged crash which echoed back from the mountains  there goes a tree said the boy  jonas was sorry to have to leave oliver so long but he wished to persevere until he should find the man as he knew that the farmer was very desirous of having the business done that day so he told the boy that he believed he would go and see if he could find mr woodman and then he set off in the direction which the boy had indicated  this road was so sheltered by the woods that the snow was not much drifted and besides it had been kept open by the teams which had been employed in hauling out pine logs when jonas got in to the end of the road he heard the strokes of the axe at a short distance on the right  he looked that way and found that the man was standing at the foot of a tall tree of very large size and he was cutting through the trunk of it about two feet from the top of the snow he saw that it was nearly off and so he thought he would wait a moment where he was and see it fall he observed that mr woodman occasionally looked up the stem of the tree between the strokes of his axe as if to see whether it was beginning to fall  after a few strokes more he stepped back from the foot of the tree to one side jonas wondered why he left his work before the tree fell he looked up to the top of it and he perceived that it was moving it was bending over very slowly indeed it moved however faster and faster and presently began to come tearing down between the branches of the other trees and at length descended with a mighty crash to the ground jonas thought that it was a very fine spectacle indeed he wished that oliver had been there to see it  jonas then went to mr woodman and transacted his business successfully according to the farmers directions then he turned around and began to walk back as fast as he could go  i am afraid said he to himself that oliver is almost out of patience waiting for me  illustration    chapter x   a surprise  jonas walked on until he came out of the woods at the house where he had seen the boy cut wood as he approached the place he saw that the boy was there still but there was a man with him the man had a goadstick in his hand  he is driving a team somewhere said jonas to himself i wonder where his oxen are  a moment afterwards jonas came in sight of the oxen which were in the road having been hid from his view before by the wood pile  the man and the boy looked at jonas as he walked towards them the man smiled a little as if he knew jonas but jonas thought that he had never seen him before  well jonas said the man did you find mr woodman  yes sir replied jonas he wondered how the man happened to know his name  im glad of it said he and youd better make haste back rollo is almost tired of waiting for you  oliver you mean said jonas  no said the manrollo he said his name was rollo  rollo said jonas his name is oliver i dont see what made him tell you that his name was rollo  so saying jonas walked thoughtfully away wondering what this could mean he had never known oliver to do any such thing before oliver he thought would not tell a falsehood on any account he was not inclined to say any thing of that kind by way of jest he was a very sober and sedate as well as honest boy besides he could not think what should have put rollo into olivers head he did not recollect that he had said any thing of rollo for a long time in fact he had seldom told oliver any thing about him and what could have induced him to call himself rollo he could not conceive  however he had nothing to do but to go on for the more he attempted to imagine some explanation of the mystery the more he was puzzled so he walked on as diligently as he could  he came at length in sight of the spot where he had left the horse and oliver the horse was there but oliver was not to be seen  he has got tired of waiting and has gone away said jonas or perhaps he is playing about near  this last supposition was pretty soon for a moment confirmed for jonas saw very soon after a boys head on the bank of the brook at a little distance below  there he is now said jonas to himself no it isnt he that boy isnt dressed like oliver i wonder who it is  the boy had a long pole in his hand and was pushing cakes of ice with it he was so intent upon this amusement that at first he did not see jonas but presently looking up his eye suddenly caught a view of jonas coming and he instantly dropped his pole and ran towards him shouting  jonas  why rollo exclaimed jonas in his turn how came you to be here  it was rollo indeed jonas was astonished he could scarcely believe his senses is it possible that this is you said he  yes said rollo laughing with great delight i believe it is  and how came you here i left oliver here an hour ago little thinking that he would turn into rollo while i was gone  oliver said rollo who is oliver  why dont you know oliver said jonas he is the farmers son he came with me and i left him here to the care of the sleigh havent you seen any thing of him  no replied rollo nothing there was nobody here when i came  what can have become of him then said jonas i hope he is not lost in the woods  so saying jonas began to call aloud oliver oliver but no oliver answered  let us see if we can find any tracks said he and he and rollo began to look about for tracks  whats this said rollo looking down intently upon the snow pretty near where the horse had been tied  any tracks said jonas  no said rollo but some writing in the snow  so rollo began to read the writing in a slow manner as he walked along from one word to another for the letters being large the sentence extended quite a distance from where it first attracted his attention he read as follows  jonasiamtired of writingno waiting i am goingbacktothemill  let me see said jonas  so jonas came to the place and saw the writing rollo had read it correctly  yes said jonas he has gone back to the mill no doubt we will go and we shall find him therebut when did you come from home and how did you find where i was  rollo in answer to jonass question explained to him that his father had given him permission to take the horse and sleigh and nathan and come and pay jonas a visit he had arrived at the farmers that day just after jonas and oliver had set out the farmer told them where jonas had gone and he was very desirous of going after him he said that he had no doubt that he could find him  the farmer had hesitated a little but finally he gave his consent and rollo set off leaving nathan at the farmers as he was rather tired he had followed jonas to the mill and then he inquired of the people whether jonas had been there a man in the road told him that he had seen jonas ride away on a certain road and so rollo had followed on in the road pointed out to him as he knew that it was not far that he was to go  when rollo had got so far in his story jonas interrupted him to ask  were you on foot rollo  no replied rollo in my sleigh  and where is your sleigh asked jonas  why i left it out here a little way when i found that the snow was deep and my horse slumped in pretty bad i left him by the side of the road and walked on to see if i could see any thing of you i soon found your sleigh run out of the path and the horse tied under a tree over the brook so i knew that you couldnt be far off  and you did not go any farther  no said rollo i thought it would be better for me to stay by the sleigh and wait for you  jonas asked rollo a great many questions about all the people at homehis father and mother and his cousin lucy and he said that he was very glad indeed that rollo had come to see him  do you have a pretty good time upon the farm said rollo  yes said jonas very good indeed you would like to be here very much  are there any boys for me to play with said rollo  yes said jonas there is oliver though he dont play much he works nearly all the time but then there is josey though he has gone home now  i saw a boy at the mill said rollo when i came along i verily believe it was oliver  how big was he asked jonas  o about as big as i am said rollo  and what was he doing said jonas  o he was playing about on the rocks under the falls but he didnt seem to have much to do he stopped and looked at me when i was coming by  very likely it was he said jonas if he had only known who you were he would have liked very much to have come along with you and you would have been good company for each other  and o rollo said jonas again very eagerly theres somebody youll like very much indeed  who is it said rollo  franco ney said jonas  franco ney repeated rollo i never heard a boy named franco before how old is he  i dont know said jonas  dont know well where does he liveat your house  no said jonas jonas was correct in this answer for franco was accustomed to live in the barn  after some other conversation rollo suddenly looking up said  how far is it jonas from your house to mr neys  jonas laughed very heartily at this question but gave no answer rollo could not imagine what he could he laughing at jonas however would not tell him but said that he would know all about it when he should come to see franco ney  well said rollo ill ask him why you wouldnt tell me where his father lives  very soon rollo and jonas arrived at the mill they found oliver safe there waiting for them and the rolls too were ready as they did not like to tumble the rolls oliver rode with rollo in his sleigh and jonas took care of the rolls  rollo was greatly astonished as well as very much pleased when he came to see franco ney  illustration    chapter xi   the snow fort or good for evil  the next morning after breakfast oliver proposed to rollo that they should go down to the pond and build a snow fort during the night there had been a slight thaw accompanied with some rain the body of snow on the ground had become softened and adhesive by the moisture and was as jonas said in prime condition for all sorts of snow work  oliver borrowed of jonas the large wooden snowshovel with a blade nearly two feet square used in cutting out the paths around the house rollo assisted him to strap it on the handsled together with some boards two iron shovels and a hoe  the conquerorfor that was the name of his sledwill have to be captive today said oliver as he bound the load upon the sled which he and rollo were going to drag down to the pond  you had better take the gardenreel and line said jonas to oliver if you intend to make a good fort you will want to stretch your line so as to make the sides square and to guide you in cutting out your blocks of snow  o we dont want to be so particular as that said oliver  but i thought said jonas that your plan last evening was to do your work in a workmanlike manner if you want a substantial fort to last all winter you must lay a good foundation and cut your courses true so that they will rest firmly one upon the otherand especially if you are going to have a roof  we mean to have a roof said rollo or we cannot illuminate it in the evening  well then said jonas i advise you to take the line and build according to rule  oliver had not forgotten what jonas had often told him about doing his work like a workman  what is worth doing at all is worth doing well jonas used to say  so oliver went to get the reel and line  while he was gone to the toolhouse rollo thought of franco ney and began to call aloud franco franco  franco did not come  franco francoo francoo where is franco said rollo we cant go without him  he wont mind you said oliver as he came running back  you call him then said rollo  oliver whistled the dog call and in a moment franco came running from the poultry yard with a bone in his mouth which he had been gnawing for a breakfast at that moment nathan came running out of the door with a luncheon in his hand for them all the farmers wife had put up in a paper an apple turnover and a nutcake for each of the boys as they were going on so important an expedition  very soon every thing was ready and they started for the scene of operations eager for their work oliver and rollo drawing the sled and nathan and franco following on behind  when they arrived near the pond oliver pointed to a little mound not far from the edge of the water which overlooked the principal skatingground of the village boys in winter  there rollo said oliver theres the place for a fort many a pleasant time we have had there in a clear winter night watching the skaters all the way up to the head of the pond the fires look splendidly  it is a good place for a lookout said rollo but then i wouldnt build it here let us go down nearer the pond  no said oliver if we go down near the pond as likely as not the first skating night some of the boys will tear our fort all to pieces  what if they do said rollo  i want it to last all winter said oliver  rollo yielded to olivers wishes and they began together to unbind their load of boards and tools  come nathan said oliver we want you to help us now  rollo and nathan measured with the reel and line while oliver planted a stake firmly in the snow at the four corners of the square  according to jonass advice the evening before they had agreed to make their fortification twelve feet square and the walls about one foot thick  rollo and nathan held the cord stretched from corner to corner just along the surface of the snow while oliver with the shovel cut the snow square down to the ground more than a foot and a half deep  in this way they went round the whole enclosure outside they then went inside and by a similar process cut away the snow so as to leave an unbroken line of snow wall about ten feet square and one foot wide  there said oliver there are the sills as jonas called them it is what i call a good foundation  after this oliver asked rollo to bring in the measuringboard inside of the fort  oliver and rollo remembered what jonas had told them about commanding and obeying and agreed to take turns in being director  it was olivers turn for the first hour and rollo was to obey him nathan was to assist them both when he was wanted  oliver therefore took the command and directed where and how to cut out the snow in the manner which jonas had described  they proceeded with the measuringboard to mark off and cut out by it solid blocks of snow about four feet long one foot wide and one thick  rollo laid down the measuringboard on the snow and then both of them with the shovels cut down the snow perpendicularly along the edges so as to have all the snowblocks of precisely the same length breadth and thickness these they laid in courses on the top of the foundation  it took just three blocks to form a side excepting the side where the door was which they left three feet wide  after working more than two hours and laying two courses they shoveled out all the broken snow that remained inside and then sat down on the sled to eat their luncheon and rest  how do you like the looks of it rollo said oliver  well said rollo only i dont see how we can make a roof  jonas will help us do that said oliver if we do the rest of the work well  the boys however were now pretty tired they had worked very hard they pulled off their caps and with their handkerchiefs wiped the perspiration from their foreheads  dont let us work any longer now said nathan rubbing his hands and knocking one foot against the other i think we have done enough for one day and my feet are so cold  weve done enough said oliver i think rollo and i have had the principal doing to do you and franco have been looking on    what youve to do     get done today     and do not for tomorrow stay     theres always danger in delay  said rollo i think we had better finish it now come nathan jump about here on the sled and you will soon be warm  so they went briskly at work again rollo taking the command they found it very hard after the second course to get the snowblocks up on the snowy wall often they would slip away out of their hands just as they were lodging them safely on the top and fall over on one side of the wall and break to pieces  let us cut them in two said oliver we can handle them better so  before they got through the fourth course they were glad to cut all their materials into pieces of one foot square  how high are the walls now said rollo as they stopped to look at the appearance of the last course  between five and six feet said oliver the foundation is at least a foot and a half high and we have laid four courses  oliver rollo and nathan went to work together then stopping up all the chinks in the wall inside and out with soft snow  when this was well done oliver took the hoe and with the sharp edge shaved down all around on both sides making the walls look even and true  well said rollo that is the best snow fort i ever saw jonas does know how to do things doesnt he oliver but i dont see how we are to get a roof on  i dont care about a roof said oliver we dont want to play in it only in pleasant weather  ill tell you what we might do said rollo we could make a partition through the middle and put a roof over half of it  so we can said oliver well do that this afternoon its time to go to dinner now  the boys then gathered all the tools c and laid them together as jonas had taught them to do when they finished work and then started for home  halloo franco said rollo are you here still they had been so busy at work they had taken no notice of him but franco had watched their operations and now went running on in the path before the boys wagging his tail as if he had as much pleasure as they in contemplating the result of their mornings labor  when jonas came home to dinner at noon the boys were impatient to tell him what they had done  but jonas was too much engaged in some work about the new barn to listen to their story then he told them however that he would go down about sunset and look at their work and hear the account in the evening of the experiment in doing work like workmen  after dinner oliver was excused from many of his regular duties on account of the visit of rollo and nathan and the three boys hastened to return to their fort they were so intent on finishing it that they lost all interest in playing with franco or each other  what shall we call our fort said oliver as they walked along  we dont want any name do we said rollo  o yes said oliver let us have a name i always like to have a name theres the old generalwe have had many a good time with him and my conquerorthere isnt a boy in town that doesnt know my sled  we might call it gibraltar said rollo  yes thats a good name said oliver how do you like iceberg castle jonas was telling us all about the icebergs the other evening and i read a story about a famous ice palace in russia how do you like that  i dont like that said rollo ours is a fort it isnt a palace  if you are going to have it a palace said nathan whom will you have for a king  you may be king nathan said rollo and we will soon demolish your palace and make a prisoner of you  no no said oliver the fort shall stand as long as ice will last i mean to pour water all over it and freeze it into solid ice and i expect the last ice to be seen any where about next spring will be the ruins of the old fort  after some discussion the boys agreed to call it iceberg castle  they then took a survey inside and out of their mornings work and decided to proceed at once and build the partition which rollo proposed before dinner at olivers suggestion rollo was director  for more than an hour they continued their toil in constructing the partition jonas had given them no instructions about this and they found it much more difficult than the walls on account of the small low door which they had to make to lead from one apartment into the other  at last as oliver and nathan were drawing through the outer door a small heap of loose snow which they had gathered up from the floor of the inner room rollo followed them shouting as they emerged from the fort done boys donehurrah for iceberg castle  i wish jonas was here now said oliver but i suppose it will be two or three hours before he can come down  cant we do something more said rollo i wish we could put on a roof before he comes  i dont believe we can do that said oliver  the boys walked in and out and all around the fort again and again admiring its appearance and thinking what else they could do  it wouldnt be a bad plan to have a king as nathan said in our castle would it oliver said rollo  not at all said oliver let us make a king or a giant to keep the premises for us when we are away  so saying they all set to work rolling snowballs to make him  oliver rolled up a huge mass for his body larger than they could at first get through the doors  rollo rolled one for his head and nathan made several small ones  in one corner of the inner room they laid a small platform of several square flat blocks of snow for a throne as rollo called it and here they placed his majesty  it seems to me said oliver that the king of the frozen regions ought to have a crown and a court  no sooner said than done a little band of snowballs in double rows soon encircled his brow surmounted too with icicles and stalactites which nathan brought from the brook  the opposite corners of the room were soon decorated with corresponding figures whom rollo introduced as lord and lady frost  he had scarcely pronounced the names when jonas walked in to the surprise and great delight of the boys  well done boys said jonas i think you have followed directions this time i give you credit for doing your work in a workmanlike manner but i cant stay to talk with you about it now your father oliver wishes me to go out on the pond and bring home the sled we left there the other night in the storm the wind has come out in the northwest and there is every prospect of a bitter cold night it has begun to stiffen already and before morning the sled may be locked up in solid ice  jonas hurried away and the boys not a little disappointed gathered all their implements together to return home  it will be a cold night wont it said oliver as he looked off to the northwest how fast it grows cold it freezes now i was in hopes we should have one more mild day but we cant get a roof on after this  wont it make good skating on the pond asked rollo if the water freezes now  yes indeed said oliver i shouldnt be surprised if there was skating there tonight its only a thin sheet of water over the ice and snow three or four hours of real cold will make ice enough for that  come nathan jump on the sled and you shall have a ride rollo and i will be your horses mother will have supper ready by the time we get home  nathan glad of a ride took his seat and they were soon at the house  oliver took the snowshovels and the other tools and returned them to their proper places and then drew up his sled into a corner of the wagonhouse  after tea oliver and rollo went out into the yard to feel the air and judge of the impression the night would probably make upon iceberg castle and its inhabitants  it was clear and cold the stars twinkled brightly the moon was not up  see there said oliver i do believe they are building a fire down on the pond already therell be a skating party tonight no doubt  the boys returned to a cheerful room with a good fire and were seated round the table to amuse themselves for the evening they passed the time pleasantly until jonas returned from the pond  o jonas jonas they all said as he came in what made you stay so long  jonas gave them an account of his adventures and of his meeting a party of skaters who were already on the pond expecting to be joined in the course of the evening by a much larger number from the village  after jonas had taken his supper the boys gathered around him to talk about their fort every now and then running to the door or window to see the fire on the pond  long before it went out oliver rollo and nathan were in a sound sleep  the next morning early they appeared as impatient to run down to the castle as if they had dreamed of it all night long and before the fire was well burning in the great room they all three came running back to jonas out of breath and with sad faces exclaiming  o jonas jonas our fort is all torn to pieces  true enough some of the boys of the skating party had completely demolished the castle  oliver and rollo were greatly excited they were grieved and they were angry and could scarcely refrain from expressing wishes of vengeance which it was not in their power to execute  jonas sympathized with them in their severe disappointment  tis too bad said rollo  tis too bad repeated oliver how shall we pay them for it jonas tell us how  pay them for it said jonas that isnt the way i should do  well i think they deserve it said rollo  so do i said oliver  what do you mean by paying them for it said jonas giving them as much injury and pain as they have given you dont you remember the lesson that franco taught us that to return good for evil was good policy as well as good morals  well what would you do jonas they both asked together  i dont know now said jonas what i would do i will think of it but this i knowthat we ought never to be overcome of evil but to overcome evil with good  oliver and rollo wondered what jonas would do
