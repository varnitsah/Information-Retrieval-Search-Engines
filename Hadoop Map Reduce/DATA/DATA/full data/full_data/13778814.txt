13778814	dear brutus   by  j m barrie      act i   the scene is a darkened room which the curtain reveals so stealthily that if there was a mouse on the stage it is there still our object is to catch our two chief characters unawares they are darkness and light  the room is so obscure as to be invisible but at the back of the obscurity are french windows through which is seen lobs garden bathed in moonshine the darkness and light which this room and garden represent are very still but we should feel that it is only the pause in which old enemies regard each other before they come to the grip the moonshine stealing about among the flowers to give them their last instructions has left a smile upon them but it is a smile with a menace in it for the dwellers in darkness what we expect to see next is the moonshine slowly pushing the windows open so that it may whisper to a confederate in the house whose name is lob but though we may be sure that this was about to happen it does not happen a stir among the dwellers in darkness prevents it  these unsuspecting ones are in the diningroom and as a communicating door opens we hear them at play several tenebrious shades appear in the lighted doorway and hesitate on the two steps that lead down into the unlit room the fanciful among us may conceive a rustle at the same moment among the flowers the engagement has begun though not in the way we had intended  voices   go on coady lead the way   oh dear i dont see why i should go first   the nicest always goes first   it is a strange house if i am the nicest   it is a strange house   dont close the door i cant see where the switch is   over here  they have been groping their way forward blissfully unaware of how they shall be groping there again more terribly before the night is out some one finds a switch and the room is illumined with the effect that the garden seems to have drawn back a step as if worsted in the first encounter but it is only waiting  the apparently inoffensive chamber thus suddenly revealed is for a bachelors home creditably like a charming country house drawingroom and abounds in the little feminine touches that are so often best applied by the hand of man there is nothing in the room inimical to the ladies unless it be the cut flowers which are from the garden and possibly in collusion with it the fireplace may also be a little dubious it has been hacked out of a thick wall which may have been there when the other walls were not and is presumably the cavern where lob when alone sits chatting to himself among the blue smoke he is as much at home by this fire as any gnome that may be hiding among its shadows but he is less familiar with the rest of the room and when he sees it as for instance on his lonely way to bed he often stares long and hard at it before chuckling uncomfortably  there are five ladies and one only of them is elderly the mrs coade whom a voice in the darkness has already proclaimed the nicest she is the nicest though the voice was no good judge coady as she is familiarly called and as her husband also is called each having for many years been able to answer for the other is a rounded old lady with a beaming smile that has accompanied her from childhood if she lives to be a hundred she will pretend to the census man that she is only ninetynine she has no other vice that has not been smoothed out of existence by her placid life and she has but one complaint against the male coady the rather odd one that he has long forgotten his first wife our mrs coady never knew the first one but it is she alone who sometimes looks at the portrait of her and preserves in their home certain mementoes of her such as a lock of brown hair which the equally gentle male coady must have treasured once but has now forgotten the first wife had been slightly lame and in their brief married life he had carried solicitously a rest for her foot had got so accustomed to doing this that after a quarter of a century with our mrs coady he still finds footstools for her as if she were lame also she has ceased to pucker her face over this taking it as a kind little thoughtless attention and indeed with the years has developed a friendly limp  of the other four ladies all young and physically fair two are married mrs dearth is tall of smouldering eye and fierce desires murky beasts lie in ambush in the labyrinths of her mind she is a whitefaced gypsy with a husky voice most beautiful when she is sullen and therefore frequently at her best the other ladies when in conclave refer to her as the dearth mrs purdie is a safer companion for the toddling kind of man she is soft and pleading and would seek what she wants by laying her head on the loved ones shoulder while the dearth might attain it with a pistol a brighter spirit than either is joanna trout who when her affections are not engaged has a merry face and figure but can dismiss them both at the important moment which is at the word love then joanna quivers her sense of humour ceases to beat and the dullest man may go ahead there remains lady caroline laney of the disdainful poise lately from the enormously select school where they are taught to pronounce their rs as ws nothing else seems to be taught but for matrimonial success nothing else is necessary every woman who pronounces r as w will find a mate it appeals to all that is chivalrous in man  an oldfashioned gallantry induces us to accept from each of these ladies her own estimate of herself and fortunately it is favourable in every case this refers to their estimate of themselves up to the hour of ten on the evening on which we first meet them the estimate may have changed temporarily by the time we part from them on the following morning what their mirrors say to each of them is a dear face not classically perfect but abounding in that changing charm which is the best type of english womanhood here is a woman who has seen and felt far more than her reticent nature readily betrays she sometimes smiles but behind that concession controlling it in a manner hardly less than adorable lurks the sigh called knowledge a strangely interesting face mysterious a line for her tombstone might be if i had been a man what adventures i could have had with her who lies here  are these ladies then so very alike they would all deny it so we must take our own soundings at this moment of their appearance in the drawingroom at least they are alike in having a common interest no sooner has the diningroom door closed than purpose leaps to their eyes oddly enough the men having been got rid of the drama begins   alice dearth the darkest spirit but the bravest we must not waste a second our minds are made up i think  joanna now is the time  mrs coade at once delighted and appalled yes now if at all but should we  alice certainly and before the men come in  mabel purdie you dont think we should wait for the men they are as much in it as we are  lady caroline unlucky as her opening remark is without a single r lob would be with them if the thing is to be done at all it should be done now  mrs coade is it quite fair to lob after all he is our host  joanna of course it isnt fair to him but lets do it coady  mrs coade yes lets do it  mabel mrs dearth is doing it  alice who is writing out a telegram of course i am the men are not coming are they  joanna reconnoitring no your husband is having another glass of port  alice i am sure he is one of you ring please  the bold joanna rings  mrs coade poor matey  lady caroline he wichly desewves what he is about to get  joanna he is coming dont all stand huddled together like conspirators  mrs coade it is what we are  swiftly they find seats and are sunk thereon like ladies waiting languidly for their lords when the doomed butler appears he is a man of brawn who could cast any one of them forth for a wager but we are about to connive at the triumph of mind over matter  alice always at her best before the bright face of danger ah matey i wish this telegram sent  matey a general favourite very good maam the village post office closed at eight but if your message is important  alice it is and you are so clever matey i am sure that you can persuade them to oblige you  matey taking the telegram i will see to it myself maam you can depend on its going  there comes a little gasp from coady which is the equivalent to dropping a stitch in needlework  alice who is the dearth now thank you better read the telegram matey to be sure that you can make it out matey reads it to himself and he has never quite the same faith in woman again the dearth continues in a purring voice read it aloud matey  matey oh maam  alice without the purr aloud  thus encouraged he reads the fatal missive  matey to police station great cumney send officer first thing tomorrow morning to arrest matey butler for theft of rings  alice yes that is quite right  matey maam but seeing that she has taken up a book he turns to lady caroline my lady  lady caroline whose voice strikes colder than the dearths should we not say how many wings  alice yes put in the number of rings matey  matey does not put in the number but he produces three rings from unostentatious parts of his person and returns them without noticeable dignity to their various owners  matey hopeful that the incident is now closed may i tear up the telegram maam  alice certainly not  lady caroline i always said that this man was the culpwit i am nevaw mistaken in faces and i see bwoad awwows all over youws matey  he might reply that he sees ws all over hers but it is no moment for repartee  matey it is deeply regretted  alice darkly i am sure it is  joanna who has seldom remained silent for so long we may as well tell him now that it is not our rings we are worrying about they have just been a means to an end matey  the stir among the ladies shows that they have arrived at the more interesting point  alice precisely in other words that telegram is sent unless  mateys head rises  joanna unless you can tell us instantly whet peculiarity it is that all we ladies have in common  mabel not only the ladies all the guests in this house  alice we have been here a week and we find that when lob invited us he knew us all so little that we begin to wonder why he asked us and now from words he has let drop we know that we were invited because of something he thinks we have in common  mabel but he wont say what it is  lady caroline drawing back a little from joanna one knows that no people could be more unlike  joanna thankfully one does  mrs coade and we cant sleep at night matey for wondering what this something is  joanna summing up but we are sure you know and it you dont tell usquod  matey with growing uneasiness i dont know what you mean ladies  alice oh yes you do  mrs coade you must admit that your master is a very strange person  matey wriggling he is a little odd maam that is why every one calls him lob not mr lob  joanna he is so odd that it has got on my nerves that we have been invited here for some sort of horrid experiment matey shivers you look as if you thought so too  matey oh no miss ihe the words he would keep back elude him you shouldnt have come ladies you didnt ought to have come  for the moment he is sorrier for them than for himself  lady caroline shouldnt have come now my man what do you mean by that  matey nothing my lady ii just mean why did you come if you are the kind he thinks  mabel the kind he thinks  alice what kind does he think now we are getting at it  matey guardedly i havent a notion maam  lady caroline whose ws must henceforth be supplied by the judicious reader then it is not necessarily our virtue that makes lob interested in us  matey thoughtlessly no my lady oh no my lady this makes an unfavourable impression  mrs coade and yet you know he is rather lovable  matey carried away he is maam he is the most lovable old devili beg pardon maam  joanna you scarcely need to for in a way it is true i have seen him out there among his flowers petting them talking to them coaxing them till they simply had to grow  alice making use perhaps of the wrong adjective it is certainly a divine garden  they all look at the unblinking enemy  mrs coade not more deceived than the others how lovely it is in the moonlight roses roses all the way dreamily it is like a hat i once had when i was young  alice lob is such an amazing gardener that i believe he could even grow hats  lady caroline who will catch it for this he is a wonderful gardener but is that quite nice at his age what is his age man  matey shuffling he wont tell my lady i think he is frightened that the police would step in if they knew how old he is they do say in the village that they remember him seventy years ago looking just as he does today  alice absurd  matey yes maam but there are his razors  lady caroline razors  matey you wont know about razors my lady not being marriedas yetexcuse me but a married lady can tell a mans age by the number of his razors a little scared if you saw his razorsthere is a little world of them from patents of the present day back to implements so horrible you can picture him with them in his hand scraping his way through the ages  lady caroline you amuse one to an extent was he ever married  matey too lightly he has quite forgotten my lady reflecting how long ago is it since merry england  lady caroline why do you ask  mabel in queen elizabeths time wasnt it  matey he says he is all that is left of merry england that little man  mabel who has brothers lob i think there is a famous cricketer called lob  mrs coade wasnt there a lob in shakespeare no of course i am thinking of robin goodfellow  lady caroline the names are so alike  joanna robin goodfellow was puck  mrs coade with natural elation that is what was in my head lob was another name for puck  joanna well he is certainly rather like what puck might have grown into if he had forgotten to die and by the way i remember now he does call his flowers by the old elizabethan names  matey he always calls the nightingale philomel missif that is any help  alice who is not omniscient none whatever tell me this did he specially ask you all for midsummer week  they assent  matey who might more judiciously have remained silent he would  mrs coade now what do you mean  matey he always likes them to be here on midsummer night maam  alice them whom  matey them who have that in common  mabel what can it be  matey i dont know  lady caroline suddenly introspective i hope we are all nice women we dont know each other very well certain suspicions are reborn in various breasts does anything startling happen at those times  matey i dont know  joanna why i believe this is midsummer eve  matey yes miss it is the villagers know it they are all inside their houses tonightwith the doors barred  lady caroline because ofof him  matey he frightens them there are stories  alice what alarms them tell usorshe brandishes the telegram  matey i know nothing for certain maam i have never done it myself he has wanted me to but i wouldnt  mabel done what  matey with fine appeal oh maam dont ask me be merciful to me maam i am not bad naturally it was just going into domestic service that did for me the accident of being flung among bad companions its touch and go how the poor turn out in this world all depends on your taking the right or the wrong turning  mrs coade the lenient i daresay that is true  matey under this touch of sun when i was young maam i was offered a clerkship in the city if i had taken it there wouldnt be a more honest man alive today i would give the world to be able to begin over again  he means every word of it though the flowers would here if they dared burst into ironical applause  mrs coade it is very sad mrs dearth  alice i am sorry for him but still  matey his eyes turning to lady caroline what do you say my lady  lady caroline briefly as you ask me i should certainly say jail  matey desperately if you will say no more about this maamill give you a tip that is worth it  alice ah now you are talking  lady caroline dont listen to him  matey lowering you are the one that is hardest on me  lady caroline yes i flatter myself i am  matey forgetting himself you might take a wrong turning yourself my lady  lady caroline i how dare you man  but the flowers rather like him for this it is possibly what gave them a certain idea  joanna near the keyhole of the diningroom door the men are rising  alice hurriedly very well matey we agreeif the tip is good enough  lady caroline you will regret this  matey i think not my lady its this i wouldnt go out tonight if he asks you go into the garden if you like the garden is all right he really believes this i wouldnt go farthernot tonight  mrs coade but he never proposes to us to go farther why should he tonight  matey i dont know maam but dont any of you godevilishly except you my lady i should like you to go  lady caroline fellow  they consider this odd warning  alice shall i they nod and she tears up the telegram  matey with a gulp thank you maam  lady caroline you should have sent that telegram off  joanna you are sure you have told us all you know matey  matey yes miss but at the door he is more generous above all ladies i wouldnt go into the wood  mabel the wood why there is no wood within a dozen miles of here  matey no maam but all the same i wouldnt go into it ladiesnot if i was you  with this cryptic warning he leaves them and any discussion of it is prevented by the arrival of their host lob is very small and probably no one has ever looked so old except some newborn child to such as watch him narrowly as the ladies now do for the first time he has the effect of seeming to be hollow an attenuated piece of piping insufficiently inflated one feels that if he were to strike against a solid object he might rebound feebly from it which would be less disconcerting if he did not obviously know this and carefully avoid the furniture he is so light that the subject must not be mentioned in his presence but it is possible that were the ladies to combine they could blow him out of a chair he enters portentously his hands behind his back as if every bit of him from his domed head to his little feet were the physical expressions of the deep thoughts within him then suddenly he whirls round to make his guests jump this amuses him vastly and he regains his gravity with difficulty he addresses mrs coade  lob standing dear lady pray be seated  he finds a chair for her and pulls it away as she is about to sit or kindly pretends to be about to do so for he has had this quaint conceit every evening since she arrived  mrs coade who loves children you naughty  lob eagerly it is quite a flirtation isnt it  he rolls on a chair kicking out his legs in an ecstasy of satisfaction but the ladies are not certain that he is the little innocent they have hitherto thought him the advent of mr coade and mr purdie presently adds to their misgivings mr coade is old a sweet pippin of a man with a gentle smile for all he must have suffered much you conclude incorrectly to acquire that tolerant smile sometimes as when he sees other people at work a wistful look takes the place of the smile and mr coade fidgets like one who would be elsewhere then there rises before his eyes the room called the study in his house whose walls are lined with boxes marked a b c to z and a2 b2 c2 to k2 these contain dusty notes for his great work on the feudal system the notes many years old the work strictly speaking not yet begun he still speaks at times of finishing it but never of beginning it he knows that in more favourable circumstances for instance if he had been a poor man instead of pleasantly well to do he could have flung himself avidly into that noble undertaking but he does not allow his secret sorrow to embitter him or darken the house quickly the vision passes and he is again his bright self idleness he says in his game way has its recompenses it is charming now to see how he at once crosses to his wife solicitous for her comfort he is bearing down on her with a footstool when mr purdie comes from the diningroom he is the most brilliant of our company recently notable in debate at oxford where he was runnerup for the presidentship of the union and only lost it because the other man was less brilliant since then he has gone to the bar on monday married on tuesday and had a brief on wednesday beneath his brilliance and making charming company for himself he is aware of intellectual powers beyond his years as we are about to see he has made one mistake in his life which he is bravely facing  alice is my husband still sampling the port mr purdie  purdie with a disarming smile for the absent dearth do you know i believe he is do the ladies like our proposal coade  coade i have not told them of it yet the fact is i am afraid that it might tire my wife too much do you feel equal to a little exertion tonight coady or is your foot troubling you  mrs coade the kind creature i have been resting it coady  coade propping it on the footstool there is that more comfortable presently dear if you are agreeable we are all going out for a walk  mrs coade quoting matey the garden is all right  purdie with jocular solemnity ah but it is not to be the garden we are going farther afield we have an adventure for tonight get thick shoes and a wrap mrs dearth all of you  lady caroline with but languid interest where do you propose to take us  purdie to find a mysterious wood with the word wood the ladies are blown upright their eyes turn to lob who however has never looked more innocent  joanne are you being funny mr purdie you know quite well that there are not any trees for miles around you have said yourself that it is the one blot on the landscape  coade almost as great a humorist as purdie ah on ordinary occasions but allow us to point out to you miss joanna that this is midsummer eve  lob again comes sharply under female observation  purdie tell them what you told us lob  lob with a pout for the credulous it is all nonsense of course just foolish talk of the villagers they say that on midsummer eve there is a strange wood in this part of the country  alice lowering where  purdie ah that is one of its most charming features it is never twice in the same place apparently it has been seen on different parts of the downs and on more common once it was close to radley village and another time about a mile from the sea oh a sporting wood  lady caroline and lob is anxious that we should all go and look for it  coade not he lob is the only sceptic in the house says it is all rubbish and that we shall be sillies if we go but we believe eh purdie  purdie waggishly rather  lob the artful just wasting the evening let us have a round game at cards here instead  purdie grandly no sir i am going to find that wood  joanna what is the good of it when it is found  purdie we shall wander in it deliciously listening to a new sort of bird called the philomel  lob is behaving in the most exemplary manner making sweet little clucking sounds  joanna doubtfully shall we keep together mr purdie  purdie no we must hunt in pairs  joanna converted i think it would be rather fun come on coady ill lace your boots for you i am sure your poor foot will carry you nicely  alice miss trout wait a moment lob has this wonderful wood any special properties  lob pooh theres no wood  lady caroline youve never seen it  lob not i i dont believe in it  alice have any of the villagers ever been in it  lob dreamily so its said so its said  alice what did they say were their experiences  lob that isnt known they never came back  joanna promptly resuming her seat never came back  lob absurd of course you see in the morning the wood was gone and so they were gone too he clucks again  joanna i dont think i like this wood  mrs coade it certainly is midsummer eve  coade remembering that women are not yet civilised of course if you ladies are against it we will drop the idea it was only a bit of fun  alice with a malicious eye on lob yes better give it upto please lob  purdie oh all right lob what about that round game of cards  the proposal meets with approval  lob bursting into tears i wanted you to go i had set my heart on your going it is the thing i wanted and it isnt good for me not to get the thing i want  he creeps under the table and threatens the hands that would draw him out  mrs coade good gracious he has wanted it all the time you wicked lob  alice now you see there is something in it  coade nonsense mrs dearth it was only a joke  mabel melting dont cry lobby  lob nobody cares for menobody loves me and i need to be loved  several of them are on their knees to him  joanna yes we do we all love you nice nice lobby  mabel dear lob i am so fond of you  joanna dry his eyes with my own handkerchief he holds up his eyes but is otherwise inconsolable  lady caroline dont pamper him  lob furiously i need to be pampered  mrs coade you funny little man let us go at once and look for his wood  all feel that thus alone can his tears be dried  joanna boots and cloaks hats forward come on lady caroline just to show you are not afraid of matey  there is a general exodus and lob left alone emerges from his temporary retirement he ducks victoriously but presently is on his knees again distressfully regarding some flowers that have fallen from their bowl  lob poor bruised one it was i who hurt you lob is so sorry lie there to another pretty pretty let me see where you have a pain you fell on your head is this the place now i make it better oh little rascal you are not hurt at all you just pretend oh dear oh dear sweetheart dont cry you are now prettier than ever you were too tall oh how beautifully you smell now that you are small he replaces the wounded tenderly in their bowl rink drink now you are happy again the little rascal smiles all smile pleasenod headsaha aha you love loblob loves you  joanna and mr purdie stroll in by the window  joanna what were you saying to them lob  lob i was saying twos company threes none  he departs with a final cluck  joanna that manhe suspects  this is a very different joanna from the one who has so far flitted across our scene it is also a different purdie in company they seldom look at each other though when the one does so the eyes of the other magnetically respond we have seen them trivial almost cynical but now we are to greet them as they know they really are the great stronghearted man and his natural mate in the grip of the master passion for the moment lobs words have unnerved joanna and it is john purdies dear privilege to soothe her  purdie no one minds lob my dear oh my dear  joanna faltering yes but he saw you kiss my hand jack if mabel were to suspect  purdie happily there is nothing for her to suspect  joanna eagerly no there isnt is there she is desirous ever to be without a flaw jack i am not doing anything wrong am i  purdie you  with an adorable gesture she gives him one of her hands and manlike he takes the other also  joanna mabel is your wife jack i should so hate myself if i did anything that was disloyal to her  purdie pressing her hand to her eyes as if counting them in the strange manner of lovers those eyes could never be disloyalmy lady of the nutbrown eyes he holds her from him surveying her and is scorched in the flame of her femininity oh the sveldtness of you almost with reproach joanna why are you so sveldt  for his sake she would be less sveldt if she could but she cant she admits her failure with eyes grown still larger and he envelops her so that he may not see her thus men seek safety  joanna while out of sight all i want is to help her and you  purdie i knowhow well i knowmy dear brave love  joanna i am very fond of mabel jack i should like to be the best friend she has in the world  purdie you are dearest no woman ever had a better friend  joanna and yet i dont think she really likes me i wonder why  purdie who is the bigger brained of the two it is just that mabel doesnt understand nothing could make me say a word against my wife  joanna sternly i wouldnt listen to you if you did  purdie i love you all the more dear for saying that but mabel is a cold nature and she doesnt understand  joanna thinking never of herself but only of him she doesnt appreciate your finer qualities  purdie ruminating thats it but of course i am difficult i always was a strange strange creature i often think joanna that i am rather like a flower that has never had the sun to shine on it nor the rain to water it  joanna you break my heart  purdie with considerable enjoyment i suppose there is no more lonely man than i walking the earth today  joanna beating her wings it is so mournful  purdie it is the thought of you that sustains me elevates me you shine high above me like a star  joanna no no i wish i was wonderful but i am not  purdie you have made me a better man joanna  joanna i am so proud to think that  purdie you have made me kinder to mabel  joanna i am sure you are always kind to her  purdie yes i hope so but i think now of special little ways of giving her pleasure that nevertobeforgotten day when we first met you and i  joanna fluttering nearer to him that tragic lovely day by the weir oh jack  purdie do you know how in gratitude i spent the rest of that day  joanna crooning tell me  purdie i read to mabel aloud for an hour i did it out of kindness to her because i had met you  joanna it was dear of you  purdie do you remember that first time my armsyour waistyou are so fluid joanna passionately why are you so fluid  joanna downcast i cant help it jack  purdie i gave her a ruby bracelet for that  joanna it is a gem you have given that lucky woman many lovely things  purdie it is my invariable custom to go straight off and buy mabel something whenever you have been sympathetic to me those new earrings of hersthey are in memory of the first day you called me jack her paquin gownthe one with the beadswas because you let me kiss you  joanna i didnt exactly let you  purdie no but you have such a dear way of giving in  joanna jack she hasnt worn that gown of late  purdie no nor the jewels i think she has some sort of idea now that when i give her anything nice it means that you have been nice to me she has rather a suspicious nature mabel she never used to have it but it seems to be growing on her i wonder why i wonder why  in this wonder which is shared by joanna their lips meet and mabel who has been about to enter from the garden quietly retires  joanna was that any one in the garden  purdie returning from a quest there is no one there now  joanna i am sure i heard some one if it was mabel with a perspicacity that comes of knowledge of her sex jack if she saw us she will think you were kissing me  these fears are confirmed by the rather odd bearing of mabel who now joins their select party  mabel apologetically i am so sorry to interrupt you jack but please wait a moment before you kiss her again excuse me joanna she quietly draws the curtains thus shutting out the garden and any possible onlooker i did not want the others to see you they might not understand how noble you are jack you can go on now  having thus passed the time of day with them she withdraws by the door leaving jack bewildered and joanna knowing all about it  joanna how extraordinary of all the oh but how contemptible she sweeps to the door and calls to mabel by name  mabel returning with promptitude did you call me joanna  joanna guardedly i insist on an explanation with creditable hauteur what were you doing in the garden mabel  mabel who has not been so quiet all day i was looking for something i have lost  purdie hope springing eternal anything important  mabel i used to fancy it jack it is my husbands love you dont happen to have picked it up joanna if so and you dont set great store by it i should like it backthe pieces i mean  mr purdie is about lo reply to this when joanna rather wisely fills the breach  joanna mabel ii will not be talked to in that way to imply that ithat your husbandoh shame  purdie finely i must say mabel that i am a little disappointed in you i certainly understood that you had gone upstairs to put on your boots  mabel poor old jack she muses a woman like that  joanna changing her comment in the moment of utterance i forgive you mabel you will be sorry for this afterwards  purdie warningly but still reluctant to think less well of his wife not a word against joanna mabel if you knew how nobly she has spoken of you  joanna imprudently she does know she has been listening  there is a moments danger of the scene degenerating into something midvictorian fortunately a chivalrous man is present to lift it to a higher plane john purdie is one to whom subterfuge of any kind is abhorrent if he has not spoken out before it is because of his reluctance to give mabel pain he speaks out now and seldom probably has he proved himself more worthy  purdie this is a mans business i must be open with you now mabel it is the manlier way if you wish it i shall always be true to you in word and deed it is your right but i cannot pretend that joanna is not the one woman in the world for me if i had met her before youits kismet i suppose he swells  joanna from a chair too late too late  mabel although the woman has seen him swell i suppose you never knew what true love was till you met her jack  purdie you force me to say it joanna and i are as one person we have not a thought at variance we are one rather than two  mabel looking at joanna yes and thats the one with the cheapest sarcasm i am so sorry to have marred your lives  purdie if any blame there is it is all mine she is as spotless as the driven snow the moment i mentioned love to her she told me to desist  mabel not she  joanna so you were listening the obtuseness of mabel is very strange to her mabel dont you see how splendid he is  mabel not quite joanna  she goes away she is really a better woman than this but never capable of scaling that higher plane to which he has as it were offered her a hand  joanna how lovely of you jack to take it all upon yourself  purdie simply it is the mans privilege  joanna mabel has such a horrid way of seeming to put people in the wrong  purdie have you noticed that poor mabel it is not an enviable quality  joanna despondently i dont think i care to go out now she has spoilt it all she has taken the innocence out of it jack  purdie a rock we must be brave and not mind her ah joanna if we had met in time if only i could begin again to be battered for ever just because i once took the wrong turning it isnt fair  joanna emerging from his arms the wrong turning now who was saying that a moment agoabout himself why it was matey  a footstep is heard  purdie for the first time losing patience with his wife is that her coming back again its too bad  but the intruder is mrs dearth and he greets her with relief  ah it is you mrs dearth  alice yes it is but thank you for telling me mr purdie i dont intrude do i  joanna descending to the lower plane on which even goddesses snap why should you  purdie rather not we werehoping it would be you we want to start on the walk i cant think what has become of the others we have been looking for them everywhere he glances vaguely round the room as if they might so far have escaped detection  alice pleasantly well do go on looking under that flowerpot would be a good place it is my husband i am in search of  purdie who likes her best when they are in different rooms shall i rout him out for you  alice how too unutterably kind of you mr purdie i hate to trouble you but it would be the sort of service one never forgets  purdie you know i believe you are chaffing me  alice no no i am incapable of that  purdie i wont be a moment  alice miss trout and i will await your return with illconcealed impatience  they await it across a table the newcomer in a reverie and joanna watching her presently mrs dearth looks up and we may notice that she has an attractive screw of the mouth which denotes humour  yes i suppose you are right i dare say i am  joanna puzzled i didnt say anything  alice i thought i heard you say that hateful dearth woman coming butting in where she is not wanted  joanna draws up her sveldt figure but a screw of one mouth often calls for a similar demonstration from another and both ladies smile they nearly become friends  joanna you certainly have good ears  alice drawling yes they have always been rather admired  joanna snapping by the painters for whom you sat when you were an artists model  alice measuring her so that has leaked out has it  joanna ashamed i shouldnt have said that  alice their brief friendship over do you think i care whether you know or not  joanna making an effort to be good im sure you dont still it was cattish of me  alice it was  joanna in flame i dont see it  mrs dearth laughs and forgets her and with the entrance of a man from the dining room joanna drifts elsewhere not so much a man this newcomer as the relic of what has been a good one it is the most he would ever claim for himself sometimes brandy in hand he has visions of the will dearth he used to be clear of eye sees him but a field away singing at his easel or fishingrod in hand leaping a stile our will stares after the fellow for quite a long time so long that the two melt into the one who finishes lobs brandy he is scarcely intoxicated as he appears before the lady of his choice but he is shaky and has watery eyes  alice has had a rather wild love for this man or for that other one and he for her but somehow it has gone whistling down the wind we may expect therefore to see them at their worst when in each others company  dearth who is not without a humorous outlook on his own degradation i am uncommonly flattered alice to hear that you have sent for me it quite takes me aback  alice with cold distaste it isnt your company i want will  dearth you know i felt that purdie must have delivered your message wrongly  alice i want you to come with us on this mysterious walk and keep an eye on lob  dearth on poor little lob oh surely not  alice i cant make the man out i want you to tell me something when he invited us here do you think it was you or me he specially wanted  dearth oh you he made no bones about it said there was something about you that made him want uncommonly to have you down here  alice will try to remember this did he ask us for any particular time  dearth yes he was particular about its being midsummer week  alice ah i thought so did he say what it was about me that made him want to have me here in midsummer week  dearth no but i presumed it must be your fascination alice  alice just so well i want you to come out with us tonight to watch him  dearth crackinmyeyetommy spy on my host and such a harmless little chap too excuse me alice besides i have an engagement  alice an engagementwith the port decanter i presume  dearth a good guess but wrong the decanter is now but an empty shell  still how you know me my engagement is with a quiet cigar in the garden  alice your hand is so unsteady you wont be able to light the match  dearth i shall just manage he triumphantly proves the exact truth of his statement  alice a nice hand for an artist  dearth one would scarcely call me an artist nowadays  alice not so far as any work is concerned  dearth not so far as having any more pretty dreams to paint is concerned  grinning at himself wonder why i have become such a waster alice  alice i suppose it was always in you  dearth with perhaps a glimpse of the fishingrod i suppose so and yet i was rather a good sort in the days when i went courting you  alice yes i thought so unlucky days for me as it has turned out  dearth heartily yes a bad job for you puzzling unsteadily over himself i didnt know i was a wrong un at the time thought quite well of myself thought a vast deal more of you crackinmyeyetommy how i used to leap out of bed at 6 am all agog to be at my easel blood ran through my veins in those days and now im middleaged and done for funny dont know how it has come about nor what has made the music mute mildly curious when did you begin to despise me alice  alice when i got to know you really will a long time ago  dearth bleary of eye yes i think that is true it was a long time ago and before i had begun to despise myself it wasnt till i knew you had no opinion of me that i began to go down hill you will grant that wont you and that i did try for a bit to fight on if you had cared for me i wouldnt have come to this surely  alice well i found i didnt care for you and i wasnt hypocrite enough to pretend i did thats blunt but you used to admire my bluntness  dearth the bluntness of you the adorable wildness of you you untamed thing  there were never any shades in you kiss or kill was your motto alice i felt from the first moment i saw you that you would love me or knife me  memories of their shooting star flare in both of them for as long as a sheet of paper might take to burn  alice i didnt knife you  dearth no i suppose that was where you made the mistake it is hard on you old lady becoming watery i suppose its too late to try to patch things up  alice lets be honest it is too late will  dearth whose tears would smell of brandy perhaps if we had had childrenpity  alice a blessing i should think seeing what sort of a father they would have had  dearth ever reasonable i dare say youre right well alice i know that somehow its my fault im sorry for you  alice im sorry for myself if i hadnt married you what a different woman i should be what a fool i was  dearth ah three things they say come not back to men nor womenthe spoken word the past life and the neglected opportunity wonder if we should make any more of them alice if they did come back to us  alice you wouldnt  dearth avoiding a hiccup i guess youre right  alice but i  dearth sincerely yes what a boon for you but i hope its not freddy finchfallowe you would put in my place i know he is following you about again he is far from threatening her he has too beery an opinion of himself for that  alice he followed me about as you put it before i knew you i dont know why i quarrelled with him  dearth your heart told you that he was no good alice  alice my heart told me that you were so it wasnt of much service to me my heart  dearth the honourable freddy finchfallowe is a rotter  alice ever inflammable you are certainly an authority on the subject  dearth with the sad smile of the disillusioned you have me there after which brief but pleasant little connubial chat he pursued his dishonoured way into the garden  he is however prevented doing so for the moment by the return of the others  they are all still in their dinner clothes though wearing wraps they crowd in through the door chattering  lob here they are are you ready dear lady  mrs coade seeing that dearths hand is on the window curtains are you not coming with us to find the wood mr dearth  dearth alas i am unavoidably detained you will find me in the garden when you come back  joanna whose sense of humour has been restored if we ever do come back  dearth precisely with a groggy bow should we never meet again alice fare thee well purdie if you find the tree of knowledge in the wood bring me back an apple  purdie i promise  lob come quickly matey mustnt see me he is turning out the lights  lady caroline pouncing matey what difference would that make lob  lob he would take me off to bed its past my time  coade not the least gay of the company you know old fellow you make it very difficult for us to embark upon this adventure in the proper eerie spirit  dearth well im for the garden  he walks to the window and the others are going out by the door but they do not go there is a hitch somewhereat the window apparently for dearth having begun to draw the curtains apart lets them fall like one who has had a shock the others remember long afterwards his grave face as he came quietly back and put his cigar on the table the room is in darkness save for the light from one lamp  purdie wondering how now dearth  dearth what is it we get in that wood lob  alice ah he wont tell us that  lob shrinking come on  alice impressed by the change that has come over her husband tell us first  lob forced to the disclosure they say that in the wood you get what nearly everybody here is longing fora second chance  the ladies are simultaneously enlightened  joanna speaking for all so that is what we have in common  coade with gentle regret i have often thought coady that if i had a second chance i should be a useful man instead of just a nice lazy one  alice morosely a second chance  lob come on  purdie gaily yes to the woodthe wood  dearth as they are going out by the door stop why not go this way  he pulls the curtains apart and there comes a sudden indrawing of breath from all for no garden is there now in its place is an endless wood of great trees the nearest of them has come close to the window it is a sombre wood with splashes of moonshine and of blackness standing very still in it  the party in the drawingroom are very still also there is scarcely a cry or a movement it is perhaps strange that the most obviously frightened is lob who calls vainly for matey  the first articulate voice is dearths  dearth very quietly any one ready to risk it  purdie after another silence of course there is nothing in itjust  dearth grimly of course going out purdie  purdie draws back  mrs dearth the only one who is undaunted a second chance she is looking at her husband they all look at him as if he had been a leader once  dearth with his sweet mournful smile i shall be back in a momentprobably  as he passes into the wood his hands rise as if a hammer  had tapped him on the forehead he is soon lost to view  lady caroline after a long pause he does not come back  mrs coade its horrible  she steals off by the door to her room calling to her husband to do likewise he takes a step after her and stops in the grip of the two words that holds them all the stillness continues at last mrs purdie goes out into the wood her hands raised and is swallowed up by it  purdie mabel  alice sardonically you will have to go now mr purdie  he looks at joanna and they go out together one tap of the hammer for each  lob thats enough warningly dont you go mrs dearth youll catch it if you go  alice a second chance  she goes out unflinching  lady caroline one would like to know  she goes out mrs coades voice is heard from the stair calling to her husband he hesitates but follows lady caroline to lob now alone comes matey with a tray of coffee cups  matey as he places his tray on the table it is past your bedtime sir say goodnight to the ladies and come along  lob matey look  matey looks  matey shrinking great heavens then its true  lob yes but ii wasnt sure  matey approaches the window cautiously to peer out and his master gives him a sudden push that propels him into the wood lobs back is toward us as he stands alone staring out upon the unknown he is terrified still yet quivers of rapture are running up and down his little frame    act ii  we are translated to the depths of the wood in the enchantment of a moonlight night in some other glade a nightingale is singing in this one in proud motoring attire recline two mortals whom we have known in different conditions the second chance has converted them into husband and wife the man of gross muddy build lies luxurious on his back exuding affluence a prominent part of him heaving playfully like some little wave that will not rest in a still sea a handkerchief over his face conceals from us what colossus he may be but his mate is our lady caroline the nightingale trills on and lady caroline takes up its song  lady caroline is it not a lovely night jim listen my own to philomel he is saying that he is lately married so are we you ducky thing i feel jim that i am rosalind and that you are my orlando  the handkerchief being removed mr matey is revealed and the nightingale seeks some farther tree  matey what do you say i am caroliny  lady caroline clapping her hands my own one dont you think it would be fun if we were to write poems about each other and pin them on the tree trunks  matey tolerantly poems i never knew such a lass for highflown language  lady caroline your lass dearest jims lass  matey pulling her ear and dont you forget it  lady caroline with the curiosity of woman what would you do if i were to forget it great bear  matey take a stick to you  lady caroline so proud of him i love to hear you talk like that it is so virile i always knew that it was a master i needed  matey its what you all need  lady caroline it is it is you knowing wretch  matey listen caroliny he touches his money pocket which emits a crinkly soundthe squeak of angels that is what gets the ladies  lady caroline how much have you made this week you wonderful man  matey blandly another two hundred or so thats all just two hundred or so  lady caroline caressing her wedding ring my dear golden fetter listen to him kiss my fetter jim  matey wait till i light this cigar  lady caroline let me hold the darling match  matey tidylooking petitey corona this there was a time when one of that sort would have run away with two days of my screw  lady caroline how i should have loved jim to know you when you were poor  fancy your having once been a clerk  matey remembering napoleon and others we all have our beginnings but it wouldnt have mattered how i began caroliny i should have come to the top just the same becoming a poet himself i am a climber and there are nails in my boots for the parties beneath me boots i tell you if i had been a bootmaker i should have been the first bootmaker in london  lady caroline a humourist at last i am sure you would jim but should you have made the best boots  matey uxoriously wishing that others could have heard this very good  caroliny that is the nearest thing i have heard you say but its late we had best be strolling back to our rollsroyce  lady caroline as they rise i do hope the ground wasnt damp  matey dont matter if it was i was lying on your rug  indeed we notice now that he has had all the rug and she the bare ground  joanna reaches the glade now an unhappy lady who has got what she wanted she is in country dress and is unknown to them as they are to her who is the mournful party  joanna hesitating i wonder sir whether you happen to have seen my husband i have lost him in the wood  matey we are strangers in these parts ourselves missis have we passed any one caroliny  lady caroline coyly should we have noticed dear might it be that old gent over there after the delightful manner of those happily wed she has already picked up many of her lovers favourite words and phrases  joanna oh no my husband is quite young  the woodlander referred to is mr coade in gala costume at his mouth a whistle he has made him from some friendly twig to its ravishing music he is seen pirouetting charmingly among the trees his new occupation  matey signing to the unknown that he is wanted seems a merry old cock  evening to you sir do you happen to have seen a young gentleman in the wood lately all by himself and looking for his wife  coade with a flourish of his legs cant say i have  joanna dolefully he isnt necessarily by himself and i dont know that he is looking for me there may be a young lady with him  the more happily married lady smiles and joanna is quick to take offence  joanna what do you mean by that  lady caroline neatly ohoif you like that better  matey now now nowyour manners caroliny  coade would he be singing or dancing  joanna oh noat least i hope not  coade an artist to the tips hope not odd if he is doing neither i am not likely to notice him but if i do what name shall i say  joanna gloating not purdie i am mrs purdie  coade i will try to keep a lookout and if i see him   but i am rather occupied at present   the reference is to his legs and a new step they are acquiring he sways this way and that and whistle to lips minuets off in the direction of paradise  joanna looking elsewhere i am sorry i troubled you i see him now  lady caroline is he alone  joanna glares at her  ah i see from your face that he isnt  matey who has his wench in training caroliny no awkward questions  evening missis and i hope you will get him to go along with you quietly  looking after coade watch the old codger dancing  lighthearted as children they dance after him while joanna behind a tree awaits her lord purdie in knickerbockers approaches with misgivings to make sure that his joanna is not in hiding and then he gambols joyously with a charming confection whose name is mabel they chase each other from tree to tree but fortunately not round joannas tree  mabel as he catches her no and no and no i dont know you nearly well enough for that besides what would your wife say i shall begin to think you are a very dreadful man mr purdie  purdie whose sincerity is not to be questioned surely you might call me jack by this time  mabel heaving perhaps if you are very good jack  purdie of noble thoughts compact if only joanna were more like you  mabel like me you mean her face it is awell if it is not precisely pretty it is a good face handsomely i dont mind her face at all i am glad you have got such a dependable little wife jack  purdie gloomily thanks  mabel seated with a moonbeam in her lap what would joanna have said if she had seen you just now  purdie a wife should be incapable of jealousy  mabel joanna jealous but has she any reason jack tell me who is the woman  purdie restraining himself by a mighty effort for he wishes always to be true to joanna shall i mabel shall i  mabel faltering yet not wholly giving up the chase i cant think who she is have i ever seen her  purdie every time you look in a mirror  mabel with her head on one side how odd jack that cant be when i look in a mirror i see only myself  purdie gloating how adorably innocent you are mabel joanna would have guessed at once  slowly his meaning comes to her and she is appalled  mabel not that  purdie aflame shall i tell you now  mabel palpitating exquisitely i dont know i am not sure jack try not to say it but if you feel you must say it in such a way that it would not hurt the feelings of joanna if she happened to be passing by as she nearly always is  a little moan from joannas tree is unnoticed  purdie i would rather not say it at all than that way he is touchingly anxious that she should know him as he really is i dont know mabel whether you have noticed that i am not like other men he goes deeply into the very structure of his being all my life i have been a soul that has had to walk alone even as a child i had no hope that it would be otherwise i distinctly remember when i was six thinking how unlike other children i was  before i was twelve i suffered from terrible selfdepreciation i do so still  i suppose there never was a man who had a more lowly opinion of himself  mabel jack you who are so universally admired  purdie that doesnt help i remain my own judge i am afraid i am a dark spirit mabel yes yes my dear let me leave nothing untold however it may damage me in your eyes your eyes i cannot remember a time when i did not think of love as a great consuming passion i visualised it mabel as perhaps few have done but always as the abounding joy that could come to others but never to me i expected too much of women i suppose i was touched to finer issues than most that has been my tragedy  mabel then you met joanna  purdie then i met joanna yes foolishly as i now see i thought she would understand that i was far too deep a nature really to mean the little things i sometimes said to her i suppose a man was never placed in such a position before what was i to do remember i was always certain that the ideal love could never come to me whatever the circumstances i was convinced that my soul must walk alone  mabel joanna how could you  purdie firmly not a word against her mabel if blame there is the blame is mine  mabel and so you married her  purdie and so i married her  mabel out of pity  purdie i felt it was a mans part i was such a child in worldly matters that it was pleasant to me to have the right to pay a womans bills i enjoyed seeing her garments lying about on my chairs in time that exultation wore off but i was not unhappy i didnt expect much i was always so sure that no woman could ever plumb the well of my emotions  mabel then you met me  purdie then i met you  mabel too lateneverforeverforevernever they are the saddest words in the english tongue  purdie at the time i thought a still sadder word was joanna  mabel what was it you saw in me that made you love me  purdie plumbing the well of his emotions i think it was the feeling that you are so like myself  mabel with great eyes have you noticed that jack sometimes it has almost terrified me  purdie we think the same thoughts we are not two mabel we are one your hair  mabel joanna knows you admire it and for a week she did hers in the same way  purdie i never noticed  mabel that was why she gave it up and it didnt really suit her ruminating i cant think of a good way of doing dear joannas hair what is that you are muttering to yourself jack dont keep anything from me  purdie i was repeating a poem i have written it is in two words mabel purdie may i teach it to you sweet say mabel purdie to me  mabel timidly covering his mouth with her little hand if i were to say it jack i should be false to joanna never ask me to be that let us go on  purdie merciless in his passion say it mabel say it see i write it on the ground with your sunshade  mabel if it could be jack ill whisper it to you  she is whispering it as they wander not two but one farther into the forest ardently believing in themselves they are not hypocrites the somewhat bedraggled figure of joanna follows them and the nightingale resumes his lovesong thats all you know you bird thinks joanna cynically the nightingale however is not singing for them nor for her but for another pair he has espied below they are racing the prize to be for the one who first finds the spot where the easel was put up last night the hobbledehoy is sure to be the winner for she is less laden and the father loses time by singing as he comes also she is all legs and she started ahead brambles adhere to her one boot has been in the water and she has as many freckles as there are stars in heaven she is as lovely as you think she is and she is aged the moment when you like your daughter best a hoot of triumph from her brings her father to the spot  margaret daddy daddy i have won here is the place crackinmyeyetommy  he comes crackinmyeyetommy this engaging fellow in tweeds is mr dearth ablaze in happiness and health and a daughter he finishes his song picked up in the latin quarter  dearth yes that is the tree i stuck my easel under last night and behold the blessed moon behaving more gorgeously than ever i am sorry to have kept you waiting old moon but you ought to know by now how time passes now keep still while i hand you down to posterity  the easel is erected margaret helping by getting in the way  margaret critical as an artists daughter should be the moon is rather pale tonight isnt she  dearth comes of keeping late hours  margaret showing off daddy watch me look at me please sweet moon a pleasant expression no no not as if you were sitting or it that is too professional that is better thank you now keep it that is the sort of thing you say to them dad  dearth quickly at work i oughtnt to have brought you out so late you should be tucked up in your cosy bed at home  margaret pursuing a squirrel that isnt there with the pillow anyhow  dearth except in its proper place  margaret wetting the other foot and the sheet over my face  dearth where it oughtnt to be  margaret more or less upside down and daddy tiptoeing in to take it off  dearth which is more than you deserve  margaret in a tree then why does he stand so long at the door and before he has gone she bursts out laughing for she has been awake all the time  dearth thats about it what a life but i oughtnt to have brought you here  best to have the sheet over you when the moon is about moonlight is bad for little daughters  margaret pelting him with nuts i cant sleep when the moons at the full she keeps calling to me to get up perhaps i am her daughter too  dearth gad you look it tonight  margaret do i then cant you paint me into the picture as well as mamma you could call it a mother and daughter or simply two ladies if the moon thinks that calling me her daughter would make her seem too old  dearth o matre pulchra filia pulchrior that means o moonmore beautiful than any twopennyhalfpenny daughter  margaret emerging in an unexpected place daddy do you really prefer her  dearth sh shes not a patch on you its the sort of thing we say to our sitters to keep them in good humour he surveys ruefully a great stain on her frock i wish to heaven margaret we were not both so fond of appletart  and whats this catching hold of her skirt  margaret unnecessarily its a tear  dearth i should think it is a tear  margaret that boy at the farm did it he kept calling snubs after me but i got him down and kicked him in the stomach he is rather a jolly boy  dearth he sounds it ye gods what a night  margaret considering the picture and what a moon dad she is not quite so fine as that  dearth sh i have touched her up  margaret dad dadwhat a funny man  she has seen mr coade with whistle enlivening the wood he pirouettes round them and departs to add to the happiness of others margaret gives an excellent imitation of him at which her father shakes his head then reprehensibly joins in the dance her mood changes she clings to him  margaret hold me tight daddy i m frightened i think they want to take you away from me  dearth who gosling  margaret i dont know its too lovely daddy i wont be able to keep hold of it  dearth what is  margaret the worldeverythingand you daddy most of all things that are too beautiful cant last  dearth who knows it now how did you find that out  margaret still in his arms i dont know daddy am i sometimes stranger than other peoples daughters  dearth more of a madcap perhaps  margaret solemnly do you think i am sometimes too full of gladness  dearth my sweetheart you do sometimes run over with it he is at his easel again  margaret persisting to be very gay dearest dear is so near to being very sad  dearth who knows it how did you find that out child  margaret i dont know from something in me thats afraid unexpectedly daddy what is a mighthavebeen  dearth a mighthavebeen they are ghosts margaret i daresay i might have been a great swell of a painter instead of just this uncommonly happy nobody or again i might have been a worthless idle waster of a fellow  margaret laughing you  dearth who knows some little kink in me might have set me off on the wrong road and that poor soul i might so easily have been might have had no margaret my word im sorry for him  margaret so am i she conceives a funny picture the poor old daddy wandering about the world without me  dearth and there are other mighthavebeenslovely ones but intangible  shades margaret made of sad folks thoughts  margaret jigging about i am so glad i am not a shade how awful it would be daddy to wake up and find one wasnt alive  dearth it would dear  margaret daddy wouldnt it be awful i think men need daughters  dearth they do  margaret especially artists  dearth yes especially artists  margaret especially artists  dearth especially artists  margaret covering herself with leaves and kicking them off fame is not everything  dearth fame is rot daughters are the thing  margaret daughters are the thing  dearth daughters are the thing  margaret i wonder if sons would be even nicer  dearth not a patch on daughters the awful thing about a son is that never neverat least from the day he goes to schoolcan you tell him that you rather like him by the time he is ten you cant even take him on your knee  sons are not worth having margaret signed w dearth  margaret but if you were a mother dad i daresay he would let you do it  dearth think so  margaret i mean when no one was looking sons are not so bad signed m  dearth but im glad you prefer daughters she works her way toward him on her knees making the tear larger at what age are we nicest daddy she has constantly to repeat her questions he is so engaged with his moon hie daddy at what age are we nicest daddy hie hie at what age are we nicest  dearth eh thats a poser i think you were nicest when you were two and knew your alphabet up to g but fell over at h no you were best when you were halfpast three or just before you struck six or in the mumps year when i asked you in the early morning how you were and you said solemnly i havent tried yet  margaret awestruck did i  dearth such was your answer struggling with the momentous question but i am not sure that chickenpox doesnt beat mumps oh lord im all wrong the nicest time in a fathers life is the year before she puts up her hair  margaret topheavy with pride in herself i suppose that is a splendid time  but theres a nicer year coming to you daddy there is a nicer year coming to you  dearth is there darling  margaret daddy the year she does put up her hair  dearth with arrested brush puts it up for ever you know i am afraid that when the day for that comes i shant be able to stand it it will be too exciting my poor heart margaret  margaret rushing at him no no it will be lucky you for it isnt to be a bit like that i am to be a girl and woman day about for the first year you will never know which i am till you look at my hair and even then you wont know for if it is down i shall put it up and if it is up i shall put it down and so my daddy will gradually get used to the idea  dearth wryly i see you have been thinking it out  margaret gleaming i have been doing more than that shut your eyes dad and i shall give you a glimpse into the future  dearth i dont know that i want that the present is so good  margaret shut your eyes please  dearth no margaret  margaret please daddy  dearth oh all right they are shut  margaret dont open them till i tell you what finger is that  dearth the dirty one  margaret on her knees among the leaves daddy now i am putting up my hair  i have got such a darling of a mirror it is such a darling mirror i ve got dad dad dont look i shall tell you about it it is a little pool of water  i wish we could take it home and hang it up of course the moment my hair is up there will be other changes also for instance i shall talk quite differently  dearth pooh where are my matches dear  margaret top pocket waistcoat  dearth trying to light his pipe in darkness you were meaning to frighten me just now  margaret no i am just preparing you you see darling i cant call you dad when my hair is up i think i shall call you parent he growls parent dear do you remember the days when your margaret was a slip of a girl and sat on your knee how foolish we were parent in those distant days  dearth shut up margaret  margaret now i must be more distant to you more like a boy who could not sit on your knee any more  dearth see here i want to go on painting shall i look now  margaret i am not quite sure whether i want you to it makes such a difference perhaps you wont know me even the pool is looking a little scared the change in her voice makes him open his eyes quickly she confronts him shyly what do you think will i do  dearth stand still dear and let me look my fill the margaret that is to be  margaret the change in his voice falling clammy on her youll see me often enough daddy like this so you dont need to look your fill you are looking as long as if this were to be the only time  dearth with an odd tremor was i surely it isnt to be that  margaret be gay dad bumping into him and round him and over him you will be sick of margaret with her hair up before you are done with her  dearth i expect so  margaret shut up daddy she waggles her head and down comes her hair daddy i know what you are thinking of you are thinking what a handful she is going to be  dearth well i guess she is  margaret surveying him from another angle now you are thinking aboutabout my being in love some day  dearth with unnecessary warmth rot  margaret reassuringly i wont you know no never oh i have quite decided so dont be afraid disordering his hair will you hate him at first daddy daddy will you hate him will you hate him daddy  dearth at work whom  margaret well if there was  dearth if there was what darling  margaret you know the kind of thing i mean quite well would you hate him at first  dearth i hope not i should want to strangle him but i wouldnt hate him  margaret i would that is to say if i liked him  dearth if you liked him how could you hate him  margaret for daring  dearth daring what  margaret you know sighing but of course i shall have no say in the matter you will do it all you do everything for me  dearth with a groan i cant help it  margaret you will even write my loveletters if i ever have any to write which i wont  dearth ashamed surely to goodness margaret i will leave you alone to do that  margaret not you you will try to but you wont be able  dearth in a hopeless attempt at selfdefence i want you you see to do everything exquisitely i do wish i could leave you to do things a little more for yourself i suppose its owing to my having had to be father and mother both i knew nothing practically about the bringing up of children and of course i couldnt trust you to a nurse  margaret severely not you so sure you could do it better yourself thats you all over daddy do you remember how you taught me to balance a biscuit on my nose like a puppy  dearth sadly did i  margaret you called me rover  dearth i deny that  margaret and when you said snap i caught the biscuit in my mouth  dearth horrible  margaret gleaming

laugh that was all your own  margaret havent i it now  dearth its gone he looks ruefully at her ill tell you how it went we were fishing in a streamthat is to say i was wading and you were sitting on my shoulders holding the rod we didnt catch anything somehow or anotheri cant think how i did ityou irritated me and i answered you sharply  margaret gasping i cant believe that  dearth yes it sounds extraordinary but i did it gave you a shock and for the moment the world no longer seemed a safe place to you your faith in me had always made it safe till then you were suddenly not even sure of your bread and butter and a frightened tear came to your eyes i was in a nice state about it i can tell you he is in a nice state about it still  margaret silly bewildered but what has that to do with my laugh daddy  dearth the laugh that children are born with lasts just so long as they have perfect faith to think that it was i who robbed you of yours  margaret dont dear i am sure the laugh just went off with the tear to comfort it and they have been playing about that stream ever since they have quite forgotten us so why should we remember them cheeky little beasts  shall i tell you my farthest back recollection in some awe i remember the first time i saw the stars i had never seen night and then i saw it and the stars together crackinmyeye tommy it isnt every one who can boast of such a lovely lovely recollection for their earliest is it  dearth i was determined your earliest should be a good one  margaret blankly do you mean to say you planned it  dearth rather most peoples earliest recollection is of some trivial thing how they cut their finger or lost a piece of string i was resolved my margarets should be something bigger i was poor but i could give her the stars  margaret clutching him round the legs oh how you love me daddikins  dearth yes i do rather  a vagrant woman has wandered in their direction one whom the shrill winds of life have lashed and bled here and there ragged graces still cling to her and unruly passion smoulders but she once a dear fierce rebel with eyes of storm is now first of all a whimperer she and they meet as strangers  margaret nicely as becomes an artists daughter good evening  alice good evening missy evening mister  dearth seeing that her eyes search the ground lost anything  alice sometimes when the tourists have had their sandwiches there are bits left over and they squeeze them between the roots to keep the place tidy i am looking for bits  dearth you dont tell me you are as hungry as that  alice with spirit try me strange that he should not know that once loved husky voice  margaret rushing at her father and feeling all his pockets daddy that was my last biscuit  dearth we must think of something else  margaret taking her hand yes wait a bit we are sure to think of something daddy think of something  alice sharply your father doesnt like you to touch the likes of me  margaret oh yes he does defiantly and if

margaret  alice its kind of you im richer this minute than i have been for many a day  dearth its nothing i am sure you would do the same for us  alice i wish i was as sure  dearth of course you would

dearth who has returned to his easel margaret  alice margaret you drew something good out of the lucky bag when you got her mister  dearth yes  alice take care of her they are easily lost  she shuffles away  dearth poor soul i expect she has had a rough time and that some man is to blame for itpartly at any rate restless that woman rather affects me margaret i dont know why didnt you like her husky voice he goes on painting i say margaret we lucky ones lets swear always to be kind to people who are down on their luck and then when we are kind lets be a little kinder  margaret gleefully yes lets  dearth margaret always feel sorry for the failures the ones who are always failuresespecially in my sort of calling wouldnt it be lovely to turn them on the thirtyninth year of failure into glittering successes  margaret topping  dearth topping  margaret oh topping how could we do it dad  dearth by letter to poor old tom broken heart top attic garret chambers sedear sirhis majesty has been graciously pleased to purchase your superb picture of marlow ferry  margaret psi am sending the money in a sack so as you can hear it chink  dearth what could we do for our friend who passed just now i cant get her out of my head  margaret you have made me forget her plaintively dad i didnt like it  dearth didnt like what dear  margaret shuddering i didnt like her saying that about your losing me  dearth the one thing of which he is sure i shant lose you  margaret hugging his arm it would be hard for me if you lost me but it would be worse for you i dont know how i know that but i do know it what would you do without me  dearth almost sharply dont talk like that dear it is wicked and stupid and naughty somehow that poor womani wont paint any more tonight  margaret lets get out of the wood it frightens me  dearth and you loved it a moment ago hullo he has seen a distant blurred light in the wood apparently from a window i hadnt noticed there was a house there  margaret tingling daddy i feel sure there wasnt a house there  dearth goose it is just that we didnt look our old way of letting the world go hang so interested in ourselves nice behaviour for people who have been boasting about what they would do for other people now i see what i ought to do  margaret lets get out of the wood  dearth yes but my idea first it is to rouse these people and get food from them for the husky one  margaret clinging to him she is too far away now  dearth i can overtake her  margaret in a frenzy dont go into that house daddy i dont know why it is but i am afraid of that house  he waggles a reproving finger at her  dearth there is a kiss for each moment until i come back she wipes them from her face oh naughty go and stand in the corner she stands against a tree but she stamps her foot who has got a nasty temper  she tries hard not to smile but she smiles and he smiles and they make comic faces at each other as they have done in similar circumstances since she first opened her eyes  i shall be back before you can count a hundred  he goes off humming his song so that she may still hear him when he is lost to sight all just as so often before she tries dutifully to count her hundred but the wood grows dark and soon she is afraid again she runs from tree to tree calling to her daddy we begin to lose her among the shadows  margaret out of the impalpable that is carrying her away daddy come back i dont want to be a mighthavebeen    act iii  lobs room has gone very dark as it sits up awaiting the possible return of the adventurers the curtains are drawn so that no light comes from outside  there is a tapping on the window and anon two intruders are stealing about the floor with muffled cries when they meet unexpectedly they find the switch and are revealed as purdie and his mabel something has happened to them as they emerged from the wood but it is so superficial that neither notices it they are again in the evening dress in which they had left the house but they are still being led by that strange humour of the blood  mabel looking around her curiously a pretty little room i wonder who is the owner  purdie it doesnt matter the great thing is that we have escaped joanna  mabel jack look a man  the term may not be happily chosen but the person indicated is lob curled up on his chair by a dead fire the last look on his face before he fell asleep having been a leery one it is still there  purdie he is asleep  mabel do you know him  purdie not i excuse me sir hi no shaking however wakens the sleeper  mabel darling how extraordinary  purdie always considerate after all precious have we any right to wake up a stranger just to tell him that we are runaways hiding in his house  mabel who comes of a good family i think he would expect it of us  purdie after trying again there is no budging him  mabel appeased at any rate we have done the civil thing  she has now time to regard the room more attentively including the tray of coffee cups which matey had left on the table in a not unimportant moment of his history there have evidently been people here but they havent drunk their coffee ugh cold as a deserted egg in a birds nest jack if you were a clever detective you could construct those people out of their neglected coffee cups i wonder who they are and what has spirited them away  purdie perhaps they have only gone to bed ought we to knock them up  mabel after considering what her mother would have done i think not dear  i suppose we have run away jackmeaning to  purdie with the sturdiness that weaker vessels adore irrevocably mabel if the doglike devotion of a lifetime   he becomes conscious that something has happened to lobs leer it has not left his face but it has shifted he is not shamming do you think  mabel shake him again  purdie after shaking him its all right mabel if the doglike devotion of a lifetime   mabel poor little joanna still if a woman insists on being a pendulum round a mans neck   purdie do give me a chance mabel if the doglike devotion of a lifetime   joanna comes through the curtains so inopportunely that for the moment he is almost pettish  may i say this is just a little too much joanna  joanna unconscious as they of her return to her dinner gown so sweet husband your soul is still walking alone is it  mabel who hates coarseness of any kind how can you sneak about in this way joanna have you no pride  joanna dashing away a tear please to address me as mrs purdie madam she sees lob who is this man  purdie we dont know and there is no waking him you can try if you like  failing to rouse him joanna makes a third at table they are all a little inconsequential as if there were still some moonshine in their hair  joanna you were saying something about the devotion of a lifetime please go on  purdie diffidently i dont like to before you joanna  joanna becoming coarse again oh dont mind me  purdie looking like a note of interrogation i should certainly like to say it  mabel loftily and i shall be proud to hear it  purdie i should have liked to spare you this joanna you wouldnt put your hands over your ears  joanna alas no sir  mabel fie joanna surely a wifes natural delicacy   purdie severely as you take it in that spirit joanna i can proceed with a clear conscience if the doglike devotion of a lifetimehe reels a little staring at lob over whose face the leer has been wandering like an insect  mabel did he move  purdie it isnt that i am feelingvery funny did one of you tap me just now on the forehead  their hands also have gone to their foreheads  mabel i think i have been in this room before  purdie flinching there is something coming rushing back to me  mabel i seem to know that coffee set if i do the lid of the milk jug is chipped it is  joanna i cant remember this mans name but i am sure it begins with l  mabel lob  purdie lob  joanna lob  purdie mabel your dress  mabel beholding it how on earth  joanna my dress to purdie you were in knickerbockers in the wood  purdie and so i am now he sees he is not where did i change the wood  let me think the wood  the wood certainly but the wood wasnt the wood  joanna revolving like one in pursuit my head is going round  mabel lobs wood i remember it all we were here we did go  purdie so we did but how could where was  joanne and who was  mabel and what was  purdie even in this supreme hour a man dont let go hold on to what we were doing or we shall lose grip of ourselves devotion something about devotion hold on to devotion if the doglike devotion of a lifetime which of you was i saying that to  mabel to me  purdie are you sure  mabel shakily i am not quite sure  purdie anxiously joanna what do you think with a sudden increase of uneasiness which of you is my wife  joanna without enthusiasm i am no i am not it is mabel who is your wife  mabel me  purdie with a curious gulp why of course you are mabel  mabel i believe i am  purdie and yet how can it be i was running away with you  joanna solving that problem you dont need to do it now  purdie the wood hold on to the wood the wood is what explains it yes i see the whole thing he gazes at lob you infernal old rascal let us try to think it out dont any one speak for a moment think first love   hold on to love he gets another tap i say i believe i am not a deeply passionate chap at all i believe i am just  a philanderer  mabel it is what you are  joanna more magnanimous mabel what about ourselves  purdie to whom it is truly a nauseous draught i didnt know just a philanderer the soul of him would like at this instant to creep into another body and if people dont change i suppose we shall begin all over again now  joanna the practical i daresay but not with each other i may philander again but not with you  they look on themselves without approval always a sorry occupation the man feels it most because he has admired himself most or perhaps partly for some better reason  purdie saying goodbye to an old friend john purdie john purdie the fine fellow i used to think you when he is able to look them in the face again the wood has taught me one thing at any rate  mabel dismally what jack  purdie that it isnt accident that shapes our lives  joanna no its fate  purdie the truth running through him seeking for a permanent home in him willing to give him still another chance loth to desert him its not fate joanna fate is something outside us what really plays the dickens with us is some thing in ourselves something that makes us go on doing the same sort of fool things however many chances we get  mabel something in ourselves  purdie shivering something we are born with  joanna cant we cut out the beastly thing  purdie depends i expect on how long we have pampered him we can at least control him if we try hard enough but i have for the moment an abominably clear perception that the likes of me never really tries forgive me joannano mabelboth of you he is a shamed man it isnt very pleasant to discover that one is a rotter i suppose i shall get used to it  joanna i could forgive anybody anything tonight candidly it is so lovely not to be married to you jack  purdie spiritless i can understand that i do feel small  joanna the true friend you will soon swell up again  purdie for whom alas we need not weep that is the appalling thing but at present at any rate i am a rag at your feet joannano at yours mabel  are you going to pick me up i dont advise it  mabel i dont know whether i want to jack to begin with which of us is it your lonely soul is in search of  joanna which of us is the fluid one or the fluider one  mabel are you and i one or are you and joanna one or are the three of us two  joanna he wants you to whisper in his ear mabel the entrancing poem mabel purdie do it jack there will be nothing wrong in it now  purdie rub it in  mabel when i meet joannas successor  purdie quailing no no mabel none of that at least credit me with having my eyes open at last there will be no more of this i swear it by all that is  joanna in her excellent imitation of a sheep baaa he is off again  purdie oh lord so i am  mabel dont joanna  purdie his mind still illumined she is quite righti was in my present state of depressionwhich wont lasti feel there is something in me that will make me go on being the same ass however many chances i get i havent the stuff in me to take warning my whole being is corroded shakespeare knew what he was talking aboutthe fault dear brutus is not in our stars but in ourselves that we are underlings  joanna for dear brutus we are to read dear audience i suppose  purdie you have it  joanna meaning that we have the power to shape ourselves  purdie we have the power right enough  joanna but isnt that rather splendid  purdie for those who have the grit in them yes still seeing with a strange clearness through the chink the hammer has made and they are not the dismal chappies they are the ones with the thin bright faces he sits lugubriously by his wife and is sorry for the first time that she has not married a better man i am afraid there is not much fight in me mabel but we shall see if you catch me at it again have the goodness to whisper to me in passing lobs wood that may cure me for the time being  mabel still certain that she loved him once but not so sure why perhaps i will  as long as i care to bother jack it depends on you how long that is to be  joanna to break an awkward pause i feel that there is hope in that as well as a warning perhaps the wood may prove to have been useful after all this brighter view of the situation meets with no immediate response with her next suggestion she reaches harbour you know we are not people worth being sorrowful aboutso let us laugh  the ladies succeed in laughing though not prettily but the man has been too much shaken  joanna in the middle of her laugh we have forgotten the others i wonder what is happening to them  purdie reviving yes what about them have they changed  mabel i didnt see any of them in the wood  joanna perhaps we did see them without knowing them we didnt know lob  purdie daunted thats true  joanna wont it be delicious to be here to watch them when they come back and see them waking upor whatever it was we did  purdie what was it we did i think something tapped me on the forehead  mabel blanching how do we know the others will come back  joanna infected we dont know how awful  mabel listen  purdie i distinctly hear some one on the stairs  mabel it will be matey  purdie the chink beginning to close be cautious both of you dont tell him we have had any  odd experiences  it is however mrs coade who comes downstairs in a dressinggown and carrying a candle and her husbands muffler  mrs coade so you are back at last a nice house i must say where is coady  purdie taken aback coady did he go into the wood too  mrs coade placidly i suppose so i have been down several times to look for him  mabel coady too  joanna seeing visions i wonder   oh how dreadful  mrs coade what is dreadful joanna  joanna airily nothing i was just wondering what he is doing  mrs coade doing what should he be doing did anything odd happen to you in the wood  purdie taking command no no nothing  joanna we just strolled about and came back that subject being exhausted she points to lob have you noticed him  mrs coade oh yes he has been like that all the time a sort of stupor i think and sometimes the strangest grin comes over his face  purdie wincing grin  mrs coade just as if he were seeing amusing things in his sleep  purdie guardedly i daresay he is oughtnt we to get matey to him  mrs coade matey has gone too  purdie whaat  mrs coade at all events he is not in the house  joanna unguardedly matey i wonder who is with him  mrs coade must somebody be with him  joanna oh no not at all  they are simultaneously aware that someone outside has reached the window  mrs coade i hope it is coady  the other ladies are too fond of her to share this wish  mabel oh i hope not  mrs coade blissfully why mrs purdie  joanna coaxingly dear mrs coade whoever he is and whatever he does i beg you not to be surprised we feel that though we had no unusual experiences in the wood others may not have been so fortunate  mabel and be cautious you dear what you say to them before they come to  mrs coade come to you puzzle me and coady didnt have his muffler  let it be recorded that in their distress for this old lady they forget their own misadventures purdie takes a step toward the curtains in a vague desire to shield herand gets a rich reward he has seen the coming addition to their circle  purdie elated and pitiless it is matey  a butler intrudes who still thinks he is wrapped in fur  joanna encouragingly do come in  matey with apologies ladies and gents   may i ask who is host  purdie splashing in the temperature that suits him best a very reasonable request third on the left  matey advancing upon lob merely to ask sir if you can direct me to my hotel  the sleepers only response is a alight quiver in one leg  the gentleman seems to be reposing  mrs coade it is lob  matey what is lob maam  mrs coade pleasantly curious surely you havent forgotten  purdie overriding her anything we can do for you sir just give it a name  joanna in the same friendly spirit i hope you are not alone do say you have some lady friends with you  matey with an emphasis on his leading word my wife is with me  joanna his wife  with commendation you have been quick  mrs coade i didnt know you were married  matey why should you madam you talk as if you knew me  mrs coade good gracious do you really think i dont  purdie indicating delicately that she is subject to a certain softening sit down wont you my dear sir and make yourself comfy  matey accustomed of late to such deferential treatment thank you but my wife   joanna hospitably yes bring her in we are simply dying to make her acquaintance  matey you are very good i am much obliged  mabel as he goes out who can she be  joanna leaping who who who  mrs coade but what an extraordinary wood he doesnt seem to know who he is at all  mabel soothingly dont worry about that coady darling he will know soon enough  joanna again finding the bright side and so will the little wife by the way whoever she is i hope she is fond of butlers  mabel who has peeped it is lady caroline  joanna leaping again oh joy joy and she was so sure she couldnt take the wrong turning  lady caroline is evidently still sure of it  matey may i present my wifelady caroline matey  mabel glowing how do you do  purdie your servant lady caroline  mrs coade lady caroline matey you  lady caroline without an r in her charmed im sure  joanna neatly very pleased to meet any wife of mr matey  purdie taking the floor allow me the duchess of candelabra the ladies helena and matilda mnab i am the lord chancellor  mabel i have wanted so long to make your acquaintance  lady caroline charmed  joanna gracefully these informal meetings are so delightful dont you think  lady caroline yes indeed  matey the introductions being thus pleasantly concluded and your friend by the fire  purdie i will introduce you to him when you wake upi mean when he wakes up  matey perhaps i ought to have said that i am james matey  lady caroline the happy creature the james matey  matey a name not perhaps unknown in the world of finance  joanna finance oh so you did take that clerkship in the city  matey a little stiffly i began as a clerk in the city certainly and i am not ashamed to admit it  mrs coade still groping fancy that now and did it save you  matey save me madam  joanna excuse uswe ask odd questions in this house we only mean did that keep you honest or are you still a pilferer  lady caroline an outraged swan husband mine what does she mean  joanna no offence i mean a pilferer on a large scale  matey remembering certain newspaper jealousy if you are referring to that labrador businessor the working womens bank   purdie after the manner of one who has caught a fly oho got him  joanna bowing yes those are what i meant  matey stoutly there was nothing proved  joanna like one calling a meeting mabel jack here is another of us you have gone just the same way again my friend ecstatically there is more in it you see than taking the wrong turning you would always take the wrong turning the only fitting comment tralala  lady caroline if you are casting any aspersions on my husband allow me to say that a prouder wife than i does not today exist  mrs coade who finds herself the only clearheaded one my dear do be careful  mabel so long as you are satisfied dear lady caroline but i thought you shrank from all blood that was not blue  lady caroline you thought why should you think about me i beg to assure you that i adore my jim  she seeks his arm but her jim has encountered the tray containing coffee cups and a cake and his hands close on it with a certain intimacy whatever are you doing jim  matey i dont understand it caroliny but somehow i feel at home with this in my hands  mabel caroliny  mrs coade look at me well dont you remember me  matey musing i dont remember you but i seem to associate you with hardboiled eggs with conviction you like your eggs hardboiled  purdie hold on to hardboiled eggs she used to tip you especially to see to them  mateys hand goes to his pocket  yes that was the pocket  lady caroline with distaste tip  matey without distaste tip  purdie jolly word isnt it  matey raising the tray it seems to set me thinking  lady caroline feeling the tap of the hammer why is my workbasket in this house  mrs coade you are living here you know  lady caroline that is what a person feels but when did i come it is very odd but one feels one ought to say when did one go  purdie she is coming to with a wush  matey under the hammer mr purdie  lady caroline mrs coade  matey the guvnor my clothes  lady caroline one is in evening dress  joanna charmed to explain you will understand clearly in a minute caroliny you didnt really take that clerkship jim you went into domestic service but in the essentials you havent altered  purdie pleasantly ill have my shaving water at 730 sharp matey  matey mechanically very good sir  lady caroline sir midsummer eve the wood  purdie yes hold on to the wood  matey you are  you are  you are lady caroline laney  lady caroline it is matey the butler  mabel you seemed quite happy with him you know lady caroline  joanna nicely we wont tell  lady caroline subsiding caroline matey and i seemed to like it how horrible  mrs coade expressing a general sentiment it is rather difficult to see what we should do next  matey tentatively perhaps if i were to go downstairs  purdie it would be conferring a personal favour on us all  thus encouraged matey and his tray resume friendly relations with the pantry  lady caroline with itching fingers as she glares at lob it is all that wretchs doing  a quiver from lobs right leg acknowledges the compliment the gay music of a pipe is heard from outside  joanna peeping coady  mrs coade coady why is he so happy  joanna troubled dear hold my hand  mrs coade suddenly trembling wont he know me  purdie abashed by that soft face mrs coade i m sorry it didnt so much matter about the likes of us but for your sake i wish coady hadnt gone out  mrs coade we that have been happily married this thirty years  coade popping in buoyantly may i intrude my name is coade the fact is i was playing about in the wood on a whistle and i saw your light  mrs coade the only one with the nerve to answer playing about in the wood with a whistle  coade with mild dignity and why not madam  mrs coade madam dont you know me  coade i dont know you  reflecting but i wish i did  mrs coade do you why  coade if i may say so you have a very soft lovable face  several persons breathe again  mrs coade inquisitorially who was with you playing whistles in the wood  the breathing ceases  coade no one was with me  and is resumed  mrs coade no  lady  coade certainly not then he spoils it i am a bachelor  mrs coade a bachelor  joanna dont give way dear it might be much worse  mrs coade a bachelor and you are sure you never spoke to me before do think  coade not to my knowledge never  except in dreams  mabel taking a risk what did you say to her in dreams  coade i said my dear this when uttered surprises him odd  joanna the darling man  mrs coade wavering how could you say such things to an old woman  coade thinking it out old i didnt think of you as old no no youngwith the morning dew on your facecoming across a lawnin a black and green dressand carrying such a pretty parasol  mrs coade thrilling that was how he first met me he used to love me in black and green and it was a pretty parasol look i am old so it cant be the same woman  coade blinking old yes i suppose so but it is the same soft lovable face and the same kind beaming smile that children could warm their hands at  mrs coade he always liked my smile  purdue so do we all  coade to himself emma  mrs coade he hasnt forgotten my name  coade it is sad that we didnt meet long ago i think i have been waiting for you i suppose we have met too late you couldnt overlook my being an old fellow could you eh  joanna how lovely he is going to propose to her again coady you happy thing he is wanting the same soft face after thirty years  mrs coade undoubtedly hopeful we mustnt be too sure but i think that is it primly what is it exactly that you want mr coade  coade under a lucky star i want to have the right to hold the parasol over you wont you be my wife my dear and so give my long dream of you a happy ending  mrs coade preening kisses are not called for at our age coady but here is a muffler for your old neck  coade my muffler i have missed it it is however to his forehead that his hand goes immediately thereafter he misses his sylvan attire why  why  what  who  how is this  purdie nervously he is coming to  coade reeling and righting himself lob  the leg indicates that he has got it  bless me coady i went into that wood  mrs coade and without your muffler you that are so subject to chills what are you feeling for in your pocket  coade the whistle it is a whistle igone of course it is its rather a pity but  anxious have i been saying awful things to you  mabel you have been making her so proud it is a compliment to our whole sex you had a second chance and it is her again  coade of course it is crestfallen but i see i was just the same nice old lazy coady as before and i had thought that if i had a second chance i could do things i have often said to you coady that it was owing to my being cursed with a competency that i didnt write my great book but i had no competency this time and i havent written a word  purdie bitterly enough that neednt make you feel lonely in this house  mrs coade in a small voice you seem to have been quite happy as an old bachelor dear  coade i am surprised at myself emma but i fear i was  mrs coade with melancholy perspicacity i wonder if what it means is that you dont especially need even me i wonder if it means that you are just the sort of amiable creature that would be happy anywhere and anyhow  coade oh dear can it be as bad as that  joanna a ministering angel she certainly not it is a romance and i wont have it looked upon as anything else  mrs coade thank you joanna you will try not to miss that whistle coady  coade getting the footstool for her you are all i need  mrs coade yes but i am not so sure as i used to be that it is a great compliment  joanna coady behave  there is a knock on the window  purdie peeping mrs dearth his spirits revive she is alone who would have expected that of her  mabel she is a wild one jack but i sometimes thought rather a dear i do hope she has got off cheaply  alice comes to them in her dinner gown  purdie the irrepressible pleased to see you stranger  alice prepared for ejection i was afraid such an unceremonious entry might startle you  purdie not a bit  alice defiant i usually enter a house by the front door  purdie i have heard that such is the swagger way  alice simpering so stupid of me i lost myself in the wood  and   joanna genially of course you did but never mind that do tell us your name  lady caroline emerging again yes yes your name  alice of course i am the honourable mrs finchfallowe  lady caroline of course of course  purdie i hope mr finchfallowe is very well we dont know him personally but may we have the pleasure of seeing him bob up presently  alice no i am not sure where he is  lady caroline with point i wonder if the dear clever police know  alice imprudently no they dont  it is a very secondary matter to her this woman of calamitous fires hears and sees her tormentors chiefly as the probable owner of the cake which is standing on that tray so awkward i gave my sandwiches to a poor girl and her father whom i met in the wood and now  isnt it a nuisancei am quite hungry so far with a mincing bravado may i  without waiting for consent she falls to upon the cake looking over it like one ready to fight them for it  purdie sobered again poor soul  lady caroline we are so anxious to know whether you met a friend of ours in the wooda mr dearth perhaps you know him too  alice dearth i dont know any dearth  mrs coade oh dear what a wood  lady caroline he is quite a front door sort of man knocks and rings you know  purdie dont worry her  alice gnawing i meet so many you see i go out a great deal i have visitingcardsprinted ones  lady caroline how very distingue perhaps mr dearth has painted your portrait he is an artist  alice very likely they all want to paint me i daresay that is the man to whom i gave my sandwiches  mrs coade but i thought you said he had a daughter  alice such a pretty girl i gave her half a crown  coade a daughter that cant be dearth  purdie darkly dont be too sure was the man you speak of a rather chopfallen gonetoseed sort of person  alice no i thought him such a jolly attractive man  coade dearth jolly attractive oh no did he say anything about his wife  lady caroline yes do try to remember if he mentioned her  alice snapping no he didnt  purdie he was far from jolly in her time  alice with an archness for which the cake is responsible perhaps that was the ladys fault  the last of the adventurers draws nigh carolling a french song as he comes  coade dearths voice he sounds quite merry  joanna protecting alice you poor thing  purdie this is going to be horrible  a cleareyed man of lusty gait comes in  dearth i am sorry to bounce in on you in this way but really i have an excuse i am a painter of sorts and  he sees he has brought some strange discomfort here  mrs coade i must say mr dearth i am delighted to see you looking so well like a new man isnt he  no one dares to answer  dearth i am certainly very well if you care to know but did i tell you my name  joanna for some one has to speak no butbut we have an instinct in this house  dearth well it doesnt matter here is the situation my daughter and i have just met in the wood a poor woman famishing for want of food we were as happy as grigs ourselves and the sight of her distress rather cut us up can you give me something for her why are you looking so startled seeing the remains of the cake may i have this  a shrinking movement from one of them draws his attention and he recognises in her the woman of whom he has been speaking he sees her in fine clothing and he grows stern  i feel i cant be mistaken it was you i met in the wood have you been playing some trick on me to the others it was for her i wanted the food  alice her hand guarding the place where his gift lies have you come to take hack the money you gave me  dearth your dress you were almost in rags when i saw you outside  alice frightened as she discovers how she is now attired i dont  understand   coade gravely enough for that matter dearth i daresay you were different in the wood too  dearth sees his own clothing  dearth what  alice frightened where am i to mrs coade i seem to know you  do i  mrs coade motherly yes you do hold my hand and you will soon remember all about it  joanna i am afraid mr dearth it is harder for you than for the rest of us  purdie looking away i wish i could help you but i cant i am a rotter  mabel we are awfully sorry dont you remember  midsummer eve  dearth controlling himself midsummer eve this room yes this room  you was it you  were going out to look for something  the tree of knowledge wasnt it somebody wanted me to go too  who was that a lady i think  why did she ask me to go what was i doing here i was smoking a cigar  i laid it down there  he finds the cigar who was the lady  alice feebly something about a second chance  mrs coade yes you poor dear you thought you could make so much of it  dearth a lady who didnt like me with conviction she had good reasons toobut what were they  alice a little old man he did it what did he do  the hammer is raised  dearth i am  it is coming backi am not the man i thought myself  alice i am not mrs finchfallowe who am i  dearth staring at her you were that lady  alice it is youmy husband  she is overcome  mrs coade my dear you are much better off so far as i can see than if you were mrs finchfallowe  alice with passionate knowledge yes yes indeed generously but he isnt  dearth alice  ihe tries to smile i didnt know you when i was in the wood with margaret she  she  margaret the hammer falls  o my god  he buries his face in his hands  alice i wishi wish  she presses his shoulder fiercely and then stalks out by the door  purdie to lob after a time you old ruffian  dearth no i am rather fond of him our lonely friendly little host lob i thank thee for that hour  the seedylooking fellow passes from the scene  coade did you see that his hand is shaking again  purdie the watery eye has come back  joanna and yet they are both quite nice people  purdie finding the tragedy of it we are all quite nice people  mabel if she were not such a savage  purdie i daresay there is nothing the matter with her except that she would always choose the wrong man good man or bad man but the wrong man for her  coade we cant change  mabel jack says the brave ones can  joanna the ones with the thin bright faces  mabel then there is hope for you and me jack  purdie ignobly i dont expect so  joanna wandering about the room like one renewing acquaintance with it after returning from a journey hadnt we better go to bed it must be getting late  purdie hold on to bed they all brighten  matey entering breakfast is quite ready  they exclaim  lady caroline my watch has stopped  joanna and mine just as well perhaps  mabel there is a smell of coffee  the gloom continues to lift  coade come along coady i do hope you have not been tiring your foot  mrs coade i shall give it a good rest tomorrow dear  matey i have given your egg six minutes maam  they set forth once more upon the eternal round the curious joanna remains behind  joanna a strange experiment matey does it ever have any permanent effect  matey on whom it has had none so far as i know not often miss but i believe once in a while  there is hope in this for the brave ones if we could wait long enough we might see the dearths breasting their way into the light  he could tell you  the elusive person thus referred to kicks responsively meaning perhaps that none of the others will change till there is a tap from another hammer but when matey goes to rout him from his chair he is no longer there his disappearance is no shock to matey who shrugs his shoulders and opens the windows to let in the glory of a summer morning the garden has returned and our queer little hero is busy at work among his flowers a lark is rising    the end
