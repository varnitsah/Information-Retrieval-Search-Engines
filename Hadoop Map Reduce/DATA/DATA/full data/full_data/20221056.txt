let us examine and ponder over it  it has been well said that this is the age of the specialist everybody if they wish to leave the world a better and happier place for their stay in it should endeavour to adopt some speciality and make it their own chapples speciality was being late for breakfast he was late not once or twice but every day sometimes he would scramble in about the time of the second cup of coffee buttoning his waistcoat as he sidled to his place generally he would arrive just as the rest of the house were filing out when having lurked hidden until mr seymour was out of the way he would enter into private treaty with herbert the factotum who had influence with the cook for something hot and maybe a fresh brew of coffee for there was nothing of the amateur latebreakfaster about chapple your amateur slinks in with blushes deepening the naturally healthy hue of his face and bolting a piece of dry bread and gulping down a cup of cold coffee dashes out again filled more with good resolutions for the future than with food not so chapple he liked his meals he wanted a good deal here below and wanted it hot and fresh conscience had but a poor time when it tried to bully chapple he had it weak in the first round  but there was one more powerful than consciencemr seymour he had marked the constant lateness of our hero and disapproved of it  thus it happened that chapple having finished an excellent breakfast one morning some twenty minutes after everybody else was informed as he sat in the junior dayroom trying with the help of an illustrated article in a boys paper to construct a handy model steamengine out of a reel of cotton and an old notebookfor his was in many ways a giant brainthat mr seymour would like to have a friendly chat with him in his study laying aside his handy model steamengine he went off to the housemasters study  you were late for breakfast today said mr seymour in the horrid abrupt way housemasters have  why yes sir said chapple pleasantly  and the day before  yes sir  and the day before that  chapple did not deny it he stood on one foot and smiled a propitiating smile so far mr seymour was entitled to demand a cigar or cocoanut every time  the housemaster walked to the window looked out returned to the mantelpiece and shifted the position of a china vase two and a quarter inches to the left chapple by way of spirited repartee stood on the other leg and curled the disengaged foot round his ankle the conversation was getting quite intellectual  you will write out  sir please sir interrupted chapple in an irepresentthe defendantmlud tone of voice  well  its awfully hard to hear the bell from where i sleep sir  owing to the increased numbers of the house this term chapple had been removed from his dormitory proper to a small room some distance away  nonsense the bell can be heard perfectly well all over the house  there was reason in what he said herbert who woke the house of a morning did so by ringing a bell it was a big bell and he enjoyed ringing it few sleepers however sound could dream on peacefully through herberts morning solo after five seconds of it they would turn over uneasily after seven they would sit up at the end of the first quarter of a minute they would be out of bed and you would be wondering where they picked up such expressions  chapple murmured wordlessly in reply he realised that his defence was a thin one mr seymour followed up his advantage  you will write a hundred lines of vergil he said and if you are late again tomorrow i shall double them  chapple retired  this he felt was a crisis he had been pursuing his career of unpunctuality so long that he had never quite realised that a time might come when the authorities would drop on him for a moment he felt that it was impossible that he could not meet mr seymours wishes in the matter but the bulldog pluck of the true englishman caused him to reconsider this he would at least have a dash at it  ill tell you what to do said his friend brodie when consulted on the point over a quiet pot of tea that afternoon you ought to sleep without so many things on the bed how many blankets do you use for instance  i dont know said chapple as many as they shove on  it had never occurred to him to reckon up the amount of his bedclothes before retiring to rest  well you take my tip said brodie and only sleep with one on then the coldll wake you in the morning and youll get up because itll be more comfortable than staying in bed  this scientific plan might have worked in fact to a certain extent it did work it woke chapple in the morning as brodie had predicted but it woke him at the wrong hour it is no good springing out of bed when there are still three hours to breakfast when chapple woke at five the next morning after a series of dreams the scenes of which were laid mainly in the arctic regions he first sneezed then he piled upon the bed everything he could find including his boots and then went to sleep again the genial warmth oozed through his form and continued to ooze until he woke once more this time at eightfifteen breakfast being at eight it occurred to him that his position with mr seymour was not improved while he was devoting a few moments profound meditation to this point the genial warmth got in its fell work once again when he next woke the bell was ringing for school he lowered the worlds record for rapid dressing and was just in time to accompany the tail of the procession into the formroom  you were late again this morning said mr seymour after dinner  yes sir i overslebbed myselb sir replied chapple who was suffering from a cold in the head  two hundred lines  yes sir  things had now become serious it was no good going to brodie again for counsel brodie had done for himself proved himself a fraud an idiot in fine a rotter he must try somebody else happy thought spenlow it was a cold day when spenlow got left behind he would know what to do there was a chap for you if you liked young mind you but what a brain colossal  what i should do said spenlow is this i should put my watch on half an hour  what ud be the good of that  why dont you see youd wake up and find it was ten to eight say by your watch so youd shove on the pace dressing and nip downstairs and then find that youd really got tons of time what price that  but i should remember id put my watch on objected chapple  oh no probably not youd be half asleep and youd shoot out of bed before you remembered and thats all youd want its the getting out of bed thats so difficult if you were once out you wouldnt want to get back again  oh shouldnt i said chapple  well you might want to but youd have the sense not to do it  its not a bad idea said chapple thanks  that night he took his waterbury prised open the face with a pocketknife as if he were opening an oyster put the minute hand on exactly half an hour and retired to bed satisfied there was going to be no nonsense about it this time  i am sorry to disappoint the reader but facts are facts and i must not tamper with them it is therefore my duty to state however reluctantly that chapple was not in time for breakfast on the following morning he woke at seven oclock when the hands of the watch pointed to seventhirty primed with virtuous resolutions he was just about to leap from his couch when his memory began to work and he recollected that he had still an hour punctuality he felt was an excellent thing a noble virtue in fact but it was no good overdoing it he could give himself at least another half hour so he dozed off he woke again with something of a start he seemed to feel that he had been asleep for a considerable time but no a glance at the watch showed the hands pointing to twentyfive to eight twentyfive minutes more he had a good long doze this time then feeling that now he really must be getting up he looked once more at the watch and rubbed his eyes it was still twentyfive to eight  the fact was that in the exhilaration of putting the hands on he had forgotten that other and even more important operation winding up the watch had stopped  there are few more disturbing sensations than that of suddenly discovering that one has no means of telling the time this is especially so when one has to be in a certain place by a certain hour it gives the discoverer a weird lost feeling as if he had stopped dead while all the rest of the world had moved on at the usual rate it is a sensation not unlike that of the man who arrives on the platform of a railway station just in time to see the tailend of his train disappear  until that morning the worlds record for dressing set up the day before had been five minutes twentythree and a fifth seconds he lowered this by two seconds and went downstairs  the house was empty in the passage that led to the diningroom he looked at the clock and his heart turned a somersault it was five minutes past nine not only was he late for breakfast but late for school too never before had he brought off the double event  there was a little unpleasantness in his form room when he stole in at seven minutes past the hour mr dexter his formmaster never a jolly sort of man to have dealings with was rather bitter on the subject  you are incorrigibly lazy and unpunctual said mr dexter towards the end of the address you will do me a hundred lines  oooo sirr said chapple but he felt at the time that it was not much of a repartee after dinner there was the usual interview with mr seymour  you were late again this morning he said  yes sir said chapple  two hundred lines  yes sir  the thing was becoming monotonous  chapple pulled himself together this must stop he had said that several times previously but now he meant it nor poppy nor mandragora nor all the drowsy syrups of the world should make him oversleep himself again this time he would try a combination of schemes  before he went to bed that night he put his watch on half an hour wound it up and placed it on a chair at his bedside then he seized his rug and all the blankets except one and tore them off then he piled them in an untidy heap in the most distant corner of the room he meant to put temptation out of his reach there should be no genial warmth on this occasion  nor was there he woke at six feeling as if he were one solid chunk of ice he put up with it in a torpid sort of way till seven then he could stand it no longer it would not be pleasant getting up and going downstairs to the cheerless junior dayroom but it was the only thing to do he knew that if he once wrapped himself in the blankets which stared at him invitingly from the opposite corner of the room he was lost so he crawled out of bed shivering washed unenthusiastically and he proceeded to put on his clothes  downstairs it was more unpleasant than one would have believed possible the dayroom was in its usual state of disorder the fire was not lit there was a vague smell of apples life was very very grey there seemed no brightness in it at all  he sat down at the table and began once more the task of constructing a handy model steamengine but he speedily realised what he had suspected before that the instructions were the work of a dangerous madman what was the good of going on living when gibbering lunatics were allowed to write for weekly papers  about this time his gloom was deepened by the discovery that a tin labelled mixed biscuits which he had noticed in brodies locker was empty  he thought he would go for a stroll it would be beastly of course but not so beastly as sitting in the junior dayroom  it is just here that the tragedy begins to deepen  passing out of seymours gate he met brooke of applebys brooke wore an earnest thoughtful expression  hullo brooke said chapple where are you off to  it seemed that brooke was off to the carpenters shop hence the earnest thoughtful expression his mind was wrestling with certain pieces of wood which he proposed to fashion into photograph frames there was always a steady demand in the school for photograph frames and the gifted were in the habit of turning here and there an honest penny by means of them  the artist soul is not always unfavourable to a gallery brooke said he didnt mind if chapple came along only he wasnt to go rotting about or anything so chapple went along  arrived at the carpenters shop brooke was soon absorbed in his labours chapple watched him for a time with the interest of a brotherworker for had he not tried to construct handy model steamengines in his day indeed yes after a while however the rôle of spectator began to pall he wanted to do something wandering round the room he found a chisel and upon the instant in direct contravention of the treaty respecting rotting he sat down and started carving his name on a smooth deal board which looked as if nobody wanted it the pair worked on in silence broken only by an occasional hard breath as the toil grew exciting chapples tongue was out and performing mystic evolutions as he carved the letters he felt inspired  he was beginning the a when he was brought to earth again by the voice of brooke  you are an idiot said brooke complainingly thats my board and now youve spoilt it  spoilt it chapple liked that spoilt it if you please when he had done a beautiful piece of carving on it  well it cant be helped now said brooke philosophically i suppose its not your fault youre such an ass anyhow come on now its struck eight  its what gasped chapple  struck eight but it doesnt matter appleby never minds one being a bit late for breakfast  oh said chapple oh doesnt he                                        go into seymours at eight sharp any morning and look down the table and you will see the face of g m chappleobscured every now and then perhaps by a coffee cup or a slice of bread and marmalade he has not been late for three weeks the spare room is now occupied by postlethwaite of the upper fourth whose place in miltons dormitory has been taken by chapple milton is the head of the house and stands alone among the house prefects for the strenuousness of his methods in dealing with his dormitory nothing in this world is certain but it is highly improbable that chapple will be late again there are swaggersticks     shields and the cricket cup   the house cricket cup at wrykyn has found itself on some strange mantelpieces in its time new talent has a way of cropping up in the house matches tailend men hit up fifties and bowlers who have never taken a wicket before except at the nets go on fifth change and dismiss first eleven experts with deliveries that bounce twice and shoot so that nobody is greatly surprised in the ordinary run of things if the cup does not go to the favourites or even to the second or third favourites but one likes to draw the line and wrykyn drew it at shields and yet as we shall proceed to show shields once won the cup and that too in a year when donaldsons had four first eleven men and dexters three  shields occupied a unique position at the school it was an absolutely inconspicuous house there were other houses that were slack or wild or both but the worst of these did something shields never did anything it never seemed to want to do anything this may have been due in some degree to mr shields as the housemaster is so the house is he was the most inconspicuous master on the staff he taught a minute form in the junior school where earnest infants wrestled with somebodys handy book of easy latin sentences and depraved infants threw cunningly compounded inkballs at one another and the ceiling after school he would range the countryside with a picklebottle in search of polly woggles and other big game which he subsequently transferred to slides and examined through a microscope till an advanced hour of the night the curious part of the matter was that his house was never riotous perhaps he was looked on as a noncombatant one whom it would be unfair and unsporting to rag at any rate a weird calm reigned over the place and this spirit seemed to permeate the public lives of the shieldsites they said nothing much and they did nothing much and they were very inoffensive as a rule one hardly knew they were there  into this abode of lotuseaters came clephane a day boy owing to the departure of his parents for india clephane wanted to go to donaldsons in fact he said so his expressions indeed when he found that the whole thing had been settled and that he was to spend his last term at school at a house which had never turned out so much as a member of the gym six bordered on the unfilial it appeared that his father had met mr shields at dinner in the towna fact to which he seemed to attach a mystic importance clephanes criticism of this attitude of mind was of such a nature as to lead his father to address him as archibald instead of archie  however the thing was done and clephane showed his good sense by realising this and turning his energetic mind to the discovery of the best way of making life at shields endurable fortune favoured him by sending to the house another day boy one mansfield clephane had not known him intimately before though they were both members of the second eleven but at shields they instantly formed an alliance and in due seasonor a little laterthe house matches began henfrey of days the wrykyn cricket captain met clephane at the nets when the drawing for opponents had been done  just the man i wanted to see said henfrey i suppose youre captain of shields lot clephane well youre going to scratch as usual i suppose  for the last five seasons that lamentable house had failed to put a team into the field youd better said henfrey we havent overmuch time as it is that match with pagets team has thrown us out a lot we ought to have started the house matches a week ago  scratch said clephane dont you wish we would my good chap were going to get the cup  you neednt be a funny ass said henfrey in his complaining voice we really are awfully pushed as it is we shall have to settle the opening rounds on the first innings thats to say we can only give em a day each if they dont finish the winner of the first innings wins you might as well scratch  i cant help your troubles by rotten mismanagement you have got the housematches crowded up into the last ten days of term and you come and expect me to sell a fine side like shields to get you out of the consequences of your reckless act my word henfrey youve sunk pretty low nice young fellow henfrey was at one time but seems to have got among bad companions quite changed now avoid him as much as i can leave me henfrey i would be alone  but you cant raise a team  raise a team do you happen to know that half the house is biting itself with agony because we cant find room for all shields gives stumpcricket soirées in his study after prep one every time you hit the ball two into the bowl of goldfish and out if you smash the microscope  well said henfrey viciously if you want to go through the farce of playing one round and making idiots of yourselves youll have to wait a bit youve got a bye in the first round  clephane told the news to mansfield after tea ive been and let the house in for a rollicking time he said abstracting the copy of latin verses which his friend was doing and sitting on them to ensure undivided attention to his words wanting to score off old henfreyi have few pleasuresi told him that shields was not going to scratch so we are booked to play in the second round of the housers we drew a bye for the first it would be an awful rag if we could do something we must raise a team of some sort henfrey would score so if we didnt whos there dyou think that can play  mansfield considered the question thoughtfully they all play i suppose he said slowly if you can call it playing what i mean to say is crickets compulsory here so i suppose theyve all had an innings or two at one time or another in the eightieth game or so but if you want recordbreakers i shouldnt trust to shields too much  not a bit so long as we put a full team into the field thats all i care about ive often wondered what its like to go in first and bowl unchanged the whole time  youll do that all right said mansfield i should think shields bowling ran to slow grubs to judge from the look of em youd better go and see wilkins about raising the team as head of the house he probably considers himself captain of cricket  wilkins however took a far more modest view of his position the notion of leading a happy band of cricketers from shields into the field had it seemed small attractions for him but he went so far as to get a house list and help choose a really representative team and as details about historic teams are always welcome we may say that the averages ranged from 3005 to 814 this last was wilkins own and was as he would have been the first to admit substantially helped by a contribution of nineteen in a single innings in the fifth game  so the team was selected and clephane turned out after school next day to give them a little fieldingpractice to his surprise the fielding was not so outrageous as might have been expected all the simpler catches were held and one or two of the harder as well given this form on the day of their appearance in public and henfrey might be disappointed when he came to watch and smile sarcastically a batting fiasco is not one half so ridiculous as maniac fielding  in the meantime the first round of the house matches had been played off and it would be as well to describe at this point the positions of the rival houses and their prospects in the first place there were only four teams really in the running for the cup days headed by the redoubtable henfrey spences who had jackson that season a head and shoulders above the other batsmen in the first elevenhe had just wound up the school season with an average of 513 donaldsons and dexters all the other house teams were mainly tail  now in the first round the powerful quartette had been diminished by the fact that donaldsons had drawn dexters and had lost to them by a couple of wickets  for the second round shields drew applebys a poor team space on the wrykyn field being a consideration with three house matches to be played off at the same time clephanes men fought their first battle on rugged ground in an obscure corner as the captain of cricket ordered these matters henfrey had naturally selected the best bit of turf for days v dexters that section of the ground which was sacred to the school secondeleven matches was allotted to spences v the school house the idle public divided its attention between the two big games and paid no attention to the death struggle in progress at the far end of the field whereby it missed a deal of quiet fun  i say death struggle advisedly clephane had won his secondeleven cap as a fast bowler he had failed to get into the first eleven because he was considered too erratic put these two facts together and you will suspect that dark deeds were wrought on the men of appleby in that lonely corner of the wrykyn meadow  the pitch was not a good one as a sample of the groundmans art it was sketchy and amateurish it lacked finish clephane won the toss took a hasty glance at the corrugated turf and decided to bat first the wicket was hardly likely to improve with use  he and mansfield opened the batting he stood three feet out of his ground and smote the first four balls he took full pitch the last two owing to a passion for variety on the part of the bowler were long hops at the end of the over shields score was twentyfour mansfield pursued the same tactics when the first wicket fell seventy was on the board a spirit of martial enthusiasm pervaded the ranks of the house team mild youths with spectacles leaped out of their ground like tigers and snicked fours through the slips when the innings concluded blood had been spiltfrom an injured fingerbut the total was a hundred and two  then clephane walked across to the school shop for a vanilla ice he said he could get more devil as it were into his bowling after a vanilla ice he had a couple  when he bowled his first ball it was easy to see that there was truth in the report of the causes of his inclusion in the second eleven and exclusion from the first the batsman observed somewhat weakly here i say and backed towards square leg the ball soared over the wicketkeeps head and went to the boundary the bowler grinned pleasantly and said he was just getting his arm in  the second ball landed fullpitch on the batsmans right thigh the third was another full pitch this time on the top of the middle stump which it smashed with profound satisfaction the batsman hobbled to the trees and sat down let somebody else have a shot he said kindly  applebys made twentyeight that innings  their defeat by an innings and fiftythree runs they attributed subsequently to the fact that only seven of the team could be induced to go to the wickets in the second venture  so youve managed to win a match grunted henfrey i should like to have been there  you might just as well have been said clephane from what they tell me  at which henfrey became abusive for he had achieved an egg that afternoon and missed a catch which things soured him though days had polished off dexters handsomely  well he said at length youre in the semifinal now of all weird places youd better play spences next when can you play  henfrey said clephane i have a bright open boyish countenance but i was not born yesterday you want to get a dangerous rival out of the way without trouble so you set shields to smash up spences no henfrey i do not intend to be your catspaw we will draw lots who is to play which here comes jackson well toss odd man out  and when the coins fell there were two tails and one head and the head belonged to the coin of clephane  so you see he said to henfrey shields is in the final no wonder you wanted us to scratch  i should like this story to end with a vivid description of a tight finish considering that days beat spences and consequently met shields in the final that would certainly be the most artistic ending henfrey battingclephane bowlingone to tie two to win one wicket to fall up goes the ball will the lad catch it he fumbles it it falls all is over but look with a supreme effortand so on  the real conclusion was a little sensational in its way but not nearly so exciting as that  the match between days and shields opened in a conventional enough manner days batted first and made two hundred and fifty henfrey carried his bat for seventysix and there were some thirties for shields clephane and mansfield made their usual firstwicket stand and the rest brought the total up to ninetyeight at this point henfrey introduced a variation on custom the match was a three days match in fact owing to the speed with which the other games had been played it could if necessary last four days the followon was therefore a matter for the discretion of the side which led henfrey and his team saw no reason why they should not have another pleasant spell of batting before dismissing their opponents for the second time and acquiring the cup so in they went again and made another two hundred and fifty odd shields being left with four hundred and twelve to make to win  on the morning after days second innings a fag from days brought clephane a message from henfrey henfrey was apparently in bed he would be glad if clephane would go and see him in the dinnerhour the interview lasted fifteen minutes then clephane burst out of the house and dashed across to shields in search of mansfield  i say have you heard he shouted  whats up  why every man in days team bar two kids is in bed ill do you mean to say you havent heard they thought theyd got that house cup safe so all the team except the two kids fags you know had a feed in honour of it in henfreys study some ass went and bought a bad rabbit pie and now theyre laid up not badly but they wont be out for a day or two  but what about the match  oh thatll go on i made a point of that they can play subs  mansfield looked thoughtful  but i say he said it isnt very sporting is it oughtnt we to wait or something  sporting my dear chap a case like this mustnt be judged by ordinary standards we cant spoil the giant rag of the century because it isnt quite sporting think what it meansshields getting the cup itll keep the school laughing for terms what do you want to spoil peoples pleasure for  oh all right said mansfield  besides think of the moral effect itll have on the house it may turn it into the blood house of wrykyn shields himself may get quite sportive we mustnt miss the chance  the news having got about the school clephane and mansfield opened their second innings to the somewhat embarrassed trundling of masters royce and tibbit of the junior school before a substantial and appreciative audience  both played carefully at first but soon getting the measure of the bowling which was not deep began to hit out and runs came quickly at fifty tibbit understudying henfrey as captain of the side summoned to his young friend todby from short leg and instructed him to have a go at the top end  it was here that clephane courteously interfered substitutes he pointed out were allowed by the laws of cricket only to field not to bowl he must therefore request friend todby to return to his former sphere of utility where he added politely he was a perfect demon  but blow it said master tibbit who alas was addicted to the use of strong language royce and i cant bowl the whole blessed time  youll have to im afraid said clephane with the kindly air of a doctor soothing a refractory patient of course you can take a spell at grubs whenever you like  oh darn said master tibbit  shortly afterwards clephane made his century                                       the match ended late on the following afternoon in a victory for shields by nine wickets and the scene at the school shop when royce and tibbit arrived to drown their sorrows and moisten their dry throats with ginger beer is said by eyewitnesses to have been something quite out of the common run  the score sheet of the match is also a little unusual clephanes three hundred and one not out is described in the wrykinian as a masterly exhibition of sound yet aggressive batting how henfrey described it we have never heard     an international affair   part 1  the whole thing may be said to have begun when mr  oliver ring of new york changing cars as he called it at wrykyn on his way to london had to wait an hour for his train he put in that hour by strolling about the town and seeing the sights which were not numerous wrykyn except on market day was wont to be wrapped in a primaeval calm which very nearly brought tears to the strenuous eyes of the man from manhattan he had always been told that england was a slow country and his visit now in its third week had confirmed this opinion but even in england he had not looked to find such a lotuseating place as wrykyn he looked at the shop windows they resembled the shop windows of every other country town in england there was no dash no initiative about them they did not leap to the eye and arrest the pedestrians progress they ordered these things thought mr ring better in the states and then something seemed to whisper to him that here was the place to set up a branch of rings comeone comeall uptodate stores during his stroll he had gathered certain pieces of information to wit that wrykyn was where the county families for ten miles round did their shopping that the population of the town was larger than would appear at first sight to a casual observer and finally that there was a school of six hundred boys only a mile away nothing could be better within a month he would take to himself the entire trade of the neighbourhood  its a cinch murmured mr ring with a glad smile as he boarded his train a leadpipe cinch  everybody who has moved about the world at all knows rings comeone comeall uptodate stores the main office is in new york broadway to be exact on the left as you go down just before you get to park row where the newspapers come from there is another office in chicago others in st louis st paul and across the seas in london paris berlin and in short everywhere the peculiar advantage about rings stores is that you can get anything you happen to want there from a motor to a macaroon and rather cheaper than you could get it anywhere else england had up to the present been illsupplied with these handy paradises the one in piccadilly being the only extant specimen but now mr ring in person had crossed the atlantic on a tour of inspection and things were shortly to be so brisk that you would be able to hear them whizz  so an army of workmen invaded wrykyn a trio of decrepit houses in the high street were pulled down with a run and from the ruins there began to rise like a phoenix the striking building which was to be the wrykyn branch of rings comeone comeall uptodate stores  the sensation among the tradesmen caused by the invasion was as may be imagined immense and painful the thing was a public disaster it resembled the advent of a fox in a fowlrun for years the tradesmen of wrykyn had jogged along in their comfortable way each making his little profits with no thought of competition or modern hustle and now the enemy was at their doors many were the gloomy looks cast at the gaudy building as it grew like a mushroom it was finished with incredible speed and then advertisements began to flood the local papers a special sheaf of bills was despatched to the school  dunstable got hold of one and read it with interest then he went in search of his friend linton to find out what he thought of it  linton was at work in the laboratory he was an enthusiastic but unskilful chemist the only thing he could do with any real certainty was to make oxygen but he had ambitions beyond that feat and was continually experimenting in a reckless way which made the chemistry master look wan and uneasy he was bending over a complicated mixture of tubes acids and bunsen burners when dunstable found him it was after school so that the laboratory was empty but for them  dont mind me said dunstable taking a seat on the table  look out man dont jog sit tight and ill broaden your mind for you i take this bit of litmus paper and dip it into this bilge and if ive done it right itll turn blue  then i bet it doesnt said dunstable  the paper turned red  hades said linton calmly well im not going to sweat at it any more lets go down to cooks  cooks is the one school institution which nobody forgets who has been to wrykyn it is a little confectioners shop in the high street its exterior is somewhat forbidding and the uninitiated would probably shudder and pass on wondering how on earth such a place could find a public daring enough to support it by eating its wares but the school went there in flocks tea at cooks was the alternative to a study tea there was a large room at the back of the shop and here oceans of hot tea and tons of toast were consumed the staff of cooks consisted of mr cook late sergeant in a line regiment six foot three disposition amiable left leg cut off above the knee by a spirited fuzzy in the last soudan war mrs cook wife of the above disposition similar and possessing the useful gift of being able to listen to five people at one and the same time and an invisible menial or menials who made toast in some nether region at a perfectly dizzy rate of speed such was cooks  talking of cooks said dunstable producing his pamphlet have you seen this itll be a bit of a knockout for them i should think  linton took the paper and began to read dunstable roamed curiously about the laboratory examining things  what are these little crystal sort of bits of stuff he asked coming to a standstill before a large jar and opening it they look good to eat shall i try one  dont you be an idiot said the expert looking up what have you got hold of great scott no dont eat that stuff  why not is it poison  no but it would make you sick as a cat its sal ammoniac  sal how much  ammoniac youd be awfully bad  all right then i wont well what do you think of that thing itll be rough on cooks wont it you see they advertise a special publicschool tea as they call it it sounds jolly good i dont know what buckwheat cakes are but they ought to be decent i suppose now everybodyll chuck cooks and go there its a beastly shame considering that cooks has been a sort of school shop so long and they really depend on the school at least one never sees anybody else going there well i shall stick to cooks i dont want any of your beastly yankee invaders support home industries be a patriot the band then played god save the king and the meeting dispersed but seriously man i am rather sick about this the cooks are such awfully good sorts and this is bound to make them lose a tremendous lot the schools simply crawling with chaps whod do anything to get a good tea cheaper than theyre getting now theyll simply scrum in to this new place  well i dont see what we can do said linton except keep on going to cooks ourselves lets be going now by the way well get as many chaps as we can to promise to stick to them but we cant prevent the rest going where they like come on  the atmosphere at cooks that evening was heavily charged with gloom exsergeant cook usually a treasury of jest and anecdote was silent and thoughtful mrs cook bustled about with her customary vigour but she too was disinclined for conversation the place was ominously empty a quartette of school house juniors in one corner and a solitary prefect from donaldsons completed the sum of the customers nobody seemed to want to talk a great deal there was something in the air which      said as plain as whisper in the ear     the place is haunted  and so it was haunted by the spectre of that hideous new glaring redbrick building down the street which had opened its doors to the public on the previous afternoon  look there said dunstable as they came out he pointed along the street the doors of the new establishment were congested a crowd made up of members of various houses was pushing to get past another crowd which was trying to get out the publicschool tea at one shilling appeared to have proved attractive  look at em said dunstable sordid beasts all they care about is filling themselves there goes that man merrett randbrown with him here come four more come on it makes me sick  i wish it would make them sick said linton  perhaps it will by george  he started  whats up said linton  oh nothing i was only thinking of something  they walked on without further conversation dunstables brain was working fast he had an idea and was busy developing it                                        the manager of the wrykyn branch of rings comeone comeall stores stood at the entrance to his shop on the following afternoon spitting with energy and precision on to the pavementhe was a freeborn american citizenand eyeing the high street as a monarch might gaze at his kingdom he had just completed a highly satisfactory report to headquarters and was feeling contented with the universe and the way in which it was managed even in the short time since the opening of the store he had managed to wake up the sluggish britishers as if they had had an electric shock  we he observed epigrammatically to a passing cat which had stopped on its way to look at him are it  as he spoke he perceived a youth coming towards him down the street he wore a cap of divers colours from which the manager argued that he belonged to the school evidently a devotee of the advertised publicschool shillingsworth and one who as urged by the small bills had come early to avoid the rush step right in mister he said moving aside from the doorway and what can i do for you  are you the manager of this place asked dunstablefor the youth was that strategist and no other  on the bulls eye first time replied the manager with easy courtesy will you take a cigar or a cocoanut  can i have a bit of a talk with you if you arent busy  sure step right in  now sir said the manager whats your little trouble  its about this public school tea business said dunstable its rather a shame you see before you came bargeing in everybody used to go to cooks  and now interrupted the manager they come to us correct sir we are the main stem and why not  cooks such a good sort  i should like to know him said the manager politely  you see said dunstable it doesnt so much matter about the other things you sell but cooks simply relies on giving fellows tea in the afternoon  one moment sir said the man from the states let me remind you of a little rule which will be useful to you when you butt into the big cold world that is never let sentiment interfere with business see either rings stores or your friend has got to be on top and if i know anything its going to be we we and im afraid thats all i can do for you unless youve that hungry feeling and want to sample our publicschool tea at twentyfive cents  no thanks said dunstable here come some chaps though who look as if they might  he stepped aside as half a dozen school house juniors raced up  for one day only said the manager to dunstable you may partake free if you care to you have mans most priceless possession cool cheek and cool cheek when recognised should not go unrewarded step in  no thanks said dunstable youll find me at cooks if you want me  kindness said he to himself as mrs cook served him in the depressed way which had now become habitual with her kindness having failed we must try severity   part 2  those who knew and liked dunstable were both pained and disgusted at his behaviour during the ensuing three days he suddenly exhibited a weird fondness for some of wrykyns least deserving inmates he walked over to school with merrett of seymours and ruthven of donaldsons both notorious outsiders when linton wanted him to come and play fives after school he declined on the ground that he was teaing with chadwick of applebys now in the matter of absolute outsiderishness chadwick of applebys was to merrett of seymours as captain is to subaltern linton was horrified and said so  what do you want to do it for he asked whats the point of it you cant like those chaps  awfully good sorts when you get to know them said dunstable  youve been some time finding it out  i know chadwicks an acquired taste by the way im giving a tea on thursday will you come  whos going to be there inquired linton warily  well chadwick for one and merrett and ruthven and three other chaps  then said linton with some warmth i think youll have to do without me i believe youre mad  and he went off in disgust to the fivescourts  when on the following thursday dunstable walked into rings stores with his five guests and demanded six publicschool teas the manager was perhaps justified in allowing a triumphant smile to wander across his face it was a signal victory for him  no free list today sir he said entirely suspended  never mind said dunstable im good for six shillings  free list said merrett as the manager retired i didnt know there was one  there isnt only he and i palled up so much the other day that he offered me a tea for nothing  didnt you take it  no i went to cooks  rotten hole cooks im never going there again said chadwick you take my tip dun old chap and come here  dun old chap smiled amiably  i dont know he said looking up from the teapot into which he had been pouring water you can be certain of the food at cooks  what do you mean so you can here  oh said dunstable i didnt know ive never had tea here before but ive often heard that american food upsets one sometimes  by this time the tea having stood long enough he poured out and the meal began  merrett and his friends were hearty feeders and conversation languished for some time then chadwick leaned back in his chair and breathed heavily  you couldnt get stuff like that at cooks he said  i suppose it is a bit different said dunstable have any of you  noticed something queer  merrett stared at ruthven ruthven stared at merrett  i said merrett  dyou know said ruthven  chadwicks face was a delicate green  i believe said dunstable the stuff  was  poisoned i                                       drink this said the school doctor briskly bending over dunstables bed with a medicineglass in his hand and be ashamed of yourself the fact is youve overeaten yourself nothing more and nothing less why cant you boys be content to feed moderately  i dont think i ate much sir protested dunstable it must have been what i ate i went to that new american place  so you went there too why ive just come from attending a bilious boy in mr seymours house he said he had been at the american place too  was that merrett sir he was one of the party we were all bad we cant all have eaten too much  the doctor looked thoughtful  hm curious very curious do you remember what you had  i had some things the man called buckwheat cakes with some stuff he said was maple syrup  bah american trash the doctor was a staunch briton conservative in his views both on politics and on food why cant you boys eat good english food i must tell the headmaster of this i havent time to look after the school if all the boys are going to poison themselves you lie still and try to go to sleep and youll be right enough in no time  but dunstable did not go to sleep he stayed awake to interview linton who came to pay him a visit  well said linton looking down at the sufferer with an expression that was a delicate blend of pity and contempt youve made a nice sort of ass of yourself havent you i dont know if its any consolation to you but merretts just as bad as you are and i hear the others are too so now you see what comes of going to rings instead of cooks  and now said dunstable if youve quite finished you can listen to me for a bit  so now you know he concluded  lintons face beamed with astonishment and admiration  well im hanged he said youre a marvel but how did you know it wouldnt poison you  i relied on you you said it wasnt poison when i asked you in the lab my faith in you is touching  but why did you take any yourself  sort of idea of diverting suspicion but the thing isnt finished yet listen  linton left the dormitory five minutes later with a look of a young disciple engaged on some holy mission   part 3  you think the food is unwholesome then said the headmaster after dinner that night  unwholesome said the school doctor it must be deadly it must be positively lethal here we have six ordinary strong healthy boys struck down at one fell swoop as if there were a pestilence raging why  one moment said the headmaster come in  a small figure appeared in the doorway  please sir said the figure in the strained voice of one speaking a piece which he has committed to memory mr seymour says please would you mind letting the doctor come to his house at once because linton is ill  what exclaimed the doctor whats the matter with him  please sir i believe its buckwheat cakes  what and heres another of them  a second small figure had appeared in the doorway  sir please sir said the newcomer mr bradfield says may the doctor  and what boy is it this time  please sir its brown he went to rings stores  the headmaster rose  perhaps you had better go at once oakes he said this is becoming serious that place is a positive menace to the community i shall put it out of bounds tomorrow morning  and when dunstable and linton pale but cheerful made their wayslowly as befitted convalescentsto cooks two days afterwards they had to sit on the counter all the other seats were occupied     the guardian   in his sunday suit with ten shillings in specie in the righthand trouser pocket and a brandnew bowler hat the youngest of the shearnes thomas beauchamp algernon was being launched by the combined strength of the family on his publicschool career it was a solemn moment the landscape was dotted with relativeshere a small sister awed by the occasion into refraining from insult there an aunt vaguely admonitory well tom said mr shearne youll soon be off now youre sure to like eckleton remember to cultivate your bowling everyone can bat nowadays and play forward not outside the outsides get most of the fun certainly but then if youre a forward youve got eight chances of getting into a team  all right father  oh and work hard this by way of an afterthought  all right father  and tom said mrs shearne you are sure to be comfortable at school because i asked mrs davy to write to her sister mrs spencer who has a son at eckleton and tell her to tell him to look after you when you get there he is in mr dencrofts house which is next door to mr blackburns so you will be quite close to one another mind you write directly you get there  all right mother  and look here tom his eldest brother stepped to the front and spoke earnestly look here dont you forget what ive been telling you  all right  youll be right enough if you dont go sticking on side dont forget that however much of a blood you may have been at that rotten little private school of yours youre not one at eckleton  all right  you look clean which is the great thing theres nothing much wrong with you except cheek youve got enough of that to float a ship keep it under  all right keep your hair on  there you go said the expert with gloomy triumph if you say that sort of thing at eckleton youll get jolly well sat on by jove  bai jove old chap murmured the younger brother were devils in the fortytwoth  the other whose chief sorrow in life was that he could not get the smaller members of the family to look with proper awe on the fact that he had just passed into sandhurst gazed wistfully at the speaker but realising that there was a locked door between them tried no active measures  well anyhow he said youll soon get it knocked out of you thats one comfort look here if you do get scrapping with anybody dont forget all ive taught you and i should go on boxing there if i were you so as to go down to aldershot some day you ought to make a fairly decent featherweight if you practise  all right  lets know when eckletons playing haileybury and ill come and look you up i want to see that match  all right  goodbye  goodbye tom  goodbye tom dear  chorus of aunts and other supers goodbye tom  tom comprehensively gbye  the train left the station                                       kennedy the head of dencrofts said that when he wanted his study turned into a beastly furnace he would take care to let spencer know he pointed out that just because it was his habit to warm the study during the winter months there was no reason why spencer should light the gasstove on an afternoon in the summer term when the thermometer was in the eighties spencer thought he might want some muffins cooked for tea did he kennedy earnestly advised spencer to give up thinking as nature had not equipped him for the strain thinking necessitated mental effort and spencer in kennedys opinion had no mind but rubbed along on a cheap substitute of mud and putty  more chatty remarks were exchanged and then spencer tore himself away from the pleasant interview and went downstairs to the junior study where he remarked to his friend phipps that life was getting a bit thick  whats up now inquired phipps  everything weve just had a week of term and ive been in extra once already for doing practically nothing and ive got a hundred lines and kennedys been slanging me for lighting the stove how was i to know he didnt want it lit wish i was fagging for somebody else  all the while youre jawing said phipps theres a letter for you on the mantelpiece staring at you  so there is hullo  whats up hullo is that a postal order how much for  five bob i say whos shearne  new kid in blackburns why  great scott i remember now they told me to look after him i havent seen him yet and listen to this mrs shearne has sent me the enclosed to give to you her son writes to say that he is very happy and getting on very well so she is sure you must have been looking after him why i dont know the kid by sight i clean forgot all about him  well youd better go and see him now just to say youve done it  spencer perpended  beastly nuisance having a new kid hanging on to you hes probably a frightful rotter  well anyway you ought to said phipps who possessed the scenario of a conscience  i cant  all right dont then but you ought to send back that postal order  look here phipps said spencer plaintively you neednt be an idiot you know  and the trivial matter of thomas b a shearne was shelved                                       thomas as he had stated in his letter to his mother was exceedingly happy at eckleton and getting on very nicely indeed it is true that there had been one or two small unpleasantnesses at first but those were over now and he had settled down completely the little troubles alluded to above had begun on his second day at blackburns thomas as the reader may have gathered from his glimpse of him at the station was not a diffident youth he was quite prepared for anything fate might have up its sleeve for him and he entered the junior dayroom at blackburns ready for emergencies on the first day nothing happened one or two people asked him his name but none inquired what his father wasa question which he had understood from books of school life was invariably put to the new boy he was thus prevented from replying coolly with his eyes fixed on his questioners a gentleman whats yours and this of course had been a disappointment but he reconciled himself to it and on the whole enjoyed his first day at eckleton  on the second there occurred an episode  thomas had inherited from his mother a pleasant rather meek cast of countenance he had pink cheeks and golden hairalmost indecently golden in one who was not a choirboy  now if you are going to look like a ministering child or a little willie the sunbeam of the home when you go to a public school you must take the consequences as thomas sat by the window of the junior dayroom reading a magazine and deeply interested in it there fell upon his face such a rapt angelic expression that the sight of it silhouetted against the window roused master p burge his fellowblackburnite as it had been a trumpetblast to seize a bradley arnolds latin prose exercises and hurl it across the room was with master burge the work of a moment it struck thomas on the ear he jumped and turned some shades pinker then he put down his magazine picked up the bradley arnold and sat on it after which he resumed his magazine  the acute interest of the junior dayroom always fond of a break in the monotony of things induced burge to go further into the matter  you with the face said burge rudely  thomas looked up  what the dickens are you going with my book pass it back  oh is this yours said thomas here you are  he walked towards him carrying the book at two yards range he fired it in it hit burge with some force in the waistcoat and there was a pause while he collected his wind  then the thing may be said to have begun  yes said burge interrogated on the point five minutes later he had had enough  good said thomas pleasantly want a handkerchief  that evening he wrote to his mother and thanking her for kind inquiries stated that he was not being bullied he added also in answer to inquiries that he had not been tossed in a blanket and thatso farno hulking senior with scowl had let him down from the dormitory window after midnight by a sheet in order that he might procure gin from the local publichouse as far as he could gather the seniors were mostly teetotallers yes he had seen spencer several times he did not add that he had seen him from a distance                                       im so glad i asked mrs davy to get her nephew to look after tom said mrs shearne concluding the reading of the epistle at breakfast it makes such a difference to a new boy having somebody to protect him at first  only drawback is said his eldest brother gloomilywont get cheek knocked out of him toms kid whought getsheadsmacked regly be no holding him  and he helped himself to marmalade of which delicacy his mouth was full with a sort of magnificent despondency  by the end of the first fortnight of his school career thomas beauchamp algernon had overcome all the little ruggednesses which relieve the path of the new boy from monotony he had been taken in by a primaeval sell which the junior dayroom invariably sprang on the newcomer but as he had sat on the head of the engineer of the same for the space of ten minutes despite the latters complaints of pain and forecasts of what he would do when he got up the laugh had not been completely against him he had received the honourable distinction of extra lesson for ragging in french he had been touched up by the prefect of his dormitory for creating a disturbance in the small hours in fact he had gone through all the usual preliminaries and become a fullblown eckletonian  his letters home were so cheerful at this point that a second postal order relieved the dwindling fortune of spencer and it was this coupled with the remonstrances of phipps that induced the dencroftian to break through his icy reserve  look here spencer said phipps his conscience thoroughly stirred by this second windfall its all rot you must either send back that postal order or go and see the chap besides hes quite a decent kid were in the same game at cricket hes rather a good bowler im getting to know him quite well ive got a jolly sight more right to those postal orders than you have  but hes an awful ass to look at pleaded spencer  whats wrong with him doesnt look nearly such a goat as you said phipps with the refreshing directness of youth  hes got yellow hair argued spencer  why shouldnt he have  he looks like a sort of young sundayschool kid  well he jolly well isnt then because i happen to know that hes had scraps with some of the fellows in his house and simply mopped them  well all right then said spencer reluctantly  the historic meeting took place outside the school shop at the quarter to eleven interval next morning thomas was leaning against the wall eating a bun spencer approached him with half a jam sandwich in his hand there was an awkward pause  hullo said spencer at last  hullo said thomas  spencer finished his sandwich and brushed the crumbs off his trousers thomas continued operations on the bun with the concentrated expression of a lunching python  i believe your people know my people said spencer  we have some awfully swell friends said thomas spencer chewed this thoughtfully awhile  beastly cheek he said at last  sorry said thomas not looking it  spencer produced a bag of gelatines  have one he asked  whats wrong with em  all right dont  he selected a gelatine and consumed it  ever had your head smacked he inquired courteously  a slightly strained look came into thomass blue eyes  not often he replied politely why  oh i dont know said spencer i was only wondering  oh  look here said spencer my mater told me to look after you  well you can look after me now if you want to because im going  and thomas dissolved the meeting by walking off in the direction of the junior block  that kid said spencer to his immortal soul wants his head smacked badly  at lunch phipps had questions to ask  saw you talking to shearne in the interval he said what were you talking about  oh nothing in particular  what did you think of him  little idiot  ask him to tea this afternoon  no  you must dash it all you must do something for him youve had ten bob out of his people  spencer made no reply  going to the school shop that afternoon he found thomas seated there with phipps behind a pot of tea as a rule he and phipps tead together and he resented this desertion  come on said phipps we were waiting for you  pining away added thomas unnecessarily  spencer frowned austerely  come and look after me urged thomas  spencer sat down in silence for a minute no sound could be heard but the champing of thomass jaws as he dealt with a slab of gingerbread  buck up said phipps uneasily  give me said thomas just one loving look  spencer ignored the request the silence became tense once more  coming to the house net phipps asked spencer  we were going to the baths why dont you come  all right said spencer  doctors tell us that we should allow one hour to elapse between taking food and bathing but the rule was not rigidly adhered to at eckleton the three proceeded straight from the teatable to the baths  the place was rather empty when they arrived it was a little earlier than the majority of eckletonians bathed the bath filled up as lockup drew near with the exception of a couple of infants splashing about in the shallow end and a stout youth who dived in from the springboard scrambled out and dived in again each time flatter than the last they had the place to themselves  whats it like gorrick inquired phipps of the stout youth who had just appeared above the surface again blowing like a whale the question was rendered necessary by the fact that many years before the boiler at the eckleton baths had burst and had never been repaired with the consequence that the temperature of the water was apt to vary that is to say most days it was colder than others  simply boiling said the man of weight climbing out i say did i go in all right then  not bad said phipps  bit flat added thomas critically  gorrick blinked severely at the speaker a headwaiter at a fashionable restaurant is cordial in his manner compared with a boy who has been at a public school a year when addressed familiarly by a new boy after reflecting on the outrage for a moment he dived in again  worse than ever said truthful thomas  look here said gorrick  oh come on exclaimed phipps and led thomas away  that kid said gorrick to spencer wants his head smacked badly  thats just what i say agreed spencer with the eagerness of a great mind which has found another that thinks alike with itself  spencer was the first of the trio ready to enter the water his movements were wary and deliberate there was nothing of the professional diver about spencer first he stood on the edge and rubbed his arms regarding the green water beneath with suspicion and dislike then crouching down he inserted three toes of his left foot drew them back sharply and said oo then he stood up again his next move was to slap his chest and dance a few steps after which he put his right foot into the water again remarked oo and resumed position i  thought you said it was warm he shouted to gorrick  so it is hot as anything come on in  and spencer came on in not because he wanted tofor by rights there were some twelve more movements to be gone through before he should finally creep in at the shallow endbut because a cold hand placed suddenly on the small of his back urged him forward down he went with the water fizzing and bubbling all over and all round him he swallowed a good deal of it but there was still plenty left and what there was was colder than one would have believed possible  he came to the surface after what seemed to him a quarter of an hour and struck out for the side when he got out phipps and thomas had just got in gorrick was standing at the end of the cocoanut matting which formed a pathway to the springboard gorrick was blue but determined  i say did i go in all right then inquired gorrick  how the dickens do i know said spencer stung to fresh wrath by the inanity of the question  spencer did said thomas appearing in the water below them and holding on to the rail  look here cried spencer did you shove me in then  me shove thomass voice expressed horror and pain why you dived in jolly good one too reminded me of the diving elephants at the hippodrome  and he swam off  that kid said gorrick gazing after him wants his head smacked  badly agreed spencer look here did he shove me in did you see him  i was doing my dive but it must have been him phipps never rags in the bath  spencer gruntedan expressive gruntand creeping down the steps entered the water again  it was spencers ambition to swim ten lengths of the bath he was not a young channel swimmer and ten lengths represented a very respectable distance to him he proceeded now to attempt to lower his record it was not often that he got the bath so much to himself usually there was barely standingroom in the water and longdistance swimming was impossible but now with a clear field he should he thought be able to complete the desired distance  he was beginning the fifth length before interruption came just as he reached halfway a reproachful voice at his side said oh percy youll tire yourself and a hand on the top of his head propelled him firmly towards the bottom  every schoolboy as honble macaulay would have put it knows the sensation of being ducked it is always unpleasantsometimes more sometimes less the present case belonged to the former class there was just room inside spencer for another halfpint of water he swallowed it when he came to the surface he swam to the side without a word and climbed out it was the last straw honour could now be satisfied only with gore  he hung about outside the baths till phipps and thomas appeared then with a steadfast expression on his face he walked up to the latter and kicked him  thomas seemed surprised but not alarmed his eyes grew a little rounder and the pink on his cheeks deepened he looked like a choirboy in a bad temper  hullo whats up you ass spencer inquired phipps  spencer said nothing  where shall we go asked thomas  oh chuck it said phipps the peacemaker  spencer and thomas were eyeing each other warily  you chaps arent going to fight said phipps  the notion seemed to distress him  unless he cares to take a kicking said spencer suavely  not today i think thanks replied thomas without heat  then look here said phipps briskly i know a ripping little place just off the lelby road it isnt five minutes walk and theres no chance of being booked there rot if someone was to come and stop it halfway through its in a field thick hedges no one can see and i tell you whatill keep time ive got a watch two minute rounds and halfaminute in between and im the referee so if anybody fouls the other chap ill stop the fight see come on  of the details of that conflict we have no very clear record phipps is enthusiastic but vague he speaks in eulogistic terms of a corker which spencer brought off in the second round and again of a tremendous biff which thomas appears to have consummated in the fourth but of the more subtle points of the fighting he is content merely to state comprehensively that they were tophole as to the result it would seem that in the capacity of referee he declared the affair a draw at the end of the seventh round and later in his capacity of second to both parties helped his principals home by back and secret ways one on each arm  the next items to which the chronicler would call the attention of the reader are two letters  the first was from mrs shearne to spencer and ran as follows      my dear spenceri am writing to you direct instead of through     your aunt because i want to thank you so much for looking after     my boy so well i know what a hard time a new boy has at a public     school if he has got nobody to take care of him at first i heard     from tom this morning he seems so happy and so fond of you he     says you are an awfully decent chap and the only chap who has     stood up to him at all i suppose he means for him i hope you     will come and spend part of your holidays with us catch me     said spencer                              yours sincerely                                       isabel shearne      psi hope you will manage to buy something nice with     the enclosed  the enclosed was yet another postal order for five shillings as somebody wisely observed a womans ps is always the most important part of her letter  that kid murmured spencer between swollen lips has got cheek enough for eighteen awfully decent chap  he proceeded to compose a letter in reply and for dignity combined with lucidity it may stand as a model to young writers                                   5 college grounds                                           eckleton      mr c f spencer begs to present his compliments to mrs shearne     and returns the postal order because he doesnt see why he should     have it he notes your remarks re my being a decent chap in     your favour of the 13th prox but cannot see where it quite     comes in as the only thing ive done to mrs shearnes son is to     fight seven rounds with him in a field w g phipps refereeing it     was a draw i got a black eye and rather a whack in the mouth but     gave him beans also particularly in the wind which i learned to do     from reading rodney stonethe bit where bob whittaker beats the     eyetalian gondoleery cove hoping that this will be taken in the     spirit which is meant                             i remain                                    yours sincerely                                                c f spencer     one enclosure  he sent this off after prep and retired to bed full of spiritual pride  on the following morning going to the shop during the interval he came upon thomas negotiating a hot bun  hullo said thomas  as was generally the case after he had had a fair and spirited turnout with a fellow human being thomas had begun to feel that he loved his late adversary as a brother a wholesome respect which had hitherto been wanting formed part of his opinion of him  hullo said spencer pausing  i say said thomas  whats up  i say i dont believe we shook hands did we  i dont remember doing it  they shook hands spencer began to feel that there were points about thomas after all  i say said thomas  hullo  im sorry about in the bath you know i didnt know you minded being ducked  oh all right said spencer awkwardly  eight bars rest  i say said thomas  hullo  doing anything this afternoon  nothing special why  come and have tea  all right thanks  ill wait for you outside the house  all right  it was just here that spencer regretted that he had sent back that fiveshilling postal order five good shillings  simply chucked away  oh life life  but they were not after all on his plate at breakfast next day spencer found a letter this was the letter      messrs j k shearne father of t b a shearne and p w shearne     brother of same beg to acknowledge receipt of mr c f spencers     esteemed communication of yesterdays date and in reply desire to     inform mr spencer of their hearty approval of his attentions to     mr t b a shearnes wind it is their opinion that the above     a nice boy but inclined to cheek badly needs treatment on these     lines occasionally they therefore beg to return the postal order     together with another for a like sum and trust that this will meet     with mr spencers approval                                 signed j k shearne                                         p w shearne      two enclosures  of course whats up really said spencer to himself after reading this is that the whole familys jolly well cracked  his eye fell on the postal orders  still he said  that evening he entertained phipps and thomas b a shearne lavishly at tea     a corner in lines   of all the useless and irritating things in this world lines are probably the most useless and the most irritating in fact i only know of two people who ever got any good out of them dunstable of days was one linton of seymours the other for a portion of one winter term they flourished on lines the more there were set the better they liked it they would have been disappointed if masters had given up the habit of doling them out  dunstable was a youth of ideas he saw far more possibilities in the routine of life at locksley than did the majority of his contemporaries and every now and then he made use of these possibilities in a way that caused a considerable sensation in the school  in the ordinary way of school work however he was not particularly brilliant and suffered in consequence his chief foe was his formmaster mr langridge the feud between them had begun on dunstables arrival in the form two terms before and had continued ever since the balance of points lay with the master the staff has ways of scoring which the school has not this story really begins with the last day but one of the summer term it happened that dunstables people were going to make their annual migration to scotland on that day and the headmaster approached on the subject both by letter and in person saw no reason whythe examinations being overdunstable should not leave locksley a day before the end of term  he called dunstable to his study one night after preparation  your father has written to me dunstable he said to ask that you may be allowed to go home on wednesday instead of thursday i think that under the special circumstances there will be no objection to this you had better see that the matron packs your boxes  yes sir said dunstable good business he added to himself as he left the room  when he got back to his own den he began to ponder over the matter to see if something could not be made out of it that was dunstables way he never let anything drop until he had made certain that he had exhausted all its possibilities  just before he went to bed he had evolved a neat little scheme for scoring off mr langridge the knowledge of his plans was confined to himself and the headmaster his dormmaster would imagine that he was going to stay on till the last day of term therefore if he misbehaved himself in form mr langridge would set him lines in blissful ignorance of the fact that he would not be there next day to show them up at the beginning of the following term moreover he would not be in mr langridges form for he was certain of his move up  he acted accordingly  he spent the earlier part of wednesday morning in breaches of the peace mr langridge instead of pulling him up put him on to translate dunstable went on to translate as he had not prepared the lesson and was not an adept at construing unseen his performance was poor  after a minute and a half the formmaster wearied  have you looked at this dunstable he asked  there was a timehonoured answer to this question  yes sir he said  publicschool ethics do not demand that you should reply truthfully to the spirit of a question the letter of it is all that requires attention dunstable had looked at the lesson he was looking at it then masters should practise exactness of speech a certain form at harrow were in the habit of walking across a copy of a latin author before morningschool they could then say with truth that they had been over it this is not an isolated case  go on said mr langridge  dunstable smiled as he did so  mr langridge was annoyed  what are you laughing at what do you mean by it stand up you will write out the lesson in latin and english and show it up to me by four this afternoon i know what you are thinking you imagine that because this is the end of the term you can do as you please but you will find yourself mistaken mindby four oclock  at four oclock dunstable was enjoying an excellent tea in green street park lane and telling his mother that he had had a most enjoyable term marred by no unpleasantness whatever his holidays were sweetened by the thought of mr langridges baffled wrath on discovering the true inwardness of the recent episode                                           when he returned to locksley at the beginning of the winter term he was at once made aware that that episode was not to be considered closed on the first evening mr day his housemaster sent for him  well dunstable he said where is that imposition  dunstable affected ignorance  please sir you set me no imposition  no dunstable no mr day peered at him gravely through his spectacles i set you no imposition but mr langridge did  dunstable imitated that eminent tactician brer rabbit he lay low and said nuffin  surely continued mr day in tones of mild reproach you did not think that you could take mr langridge in  dunstable rather thought he had taken mr langridge in but he made no reply  well said mr day i must set you some punishment i shall give the butler instructions to hand you a note from me at three oclock tomorrow the next day was a halfholiday in that note you will find indicated what i wish you to write out  why this comicopera secretsociety business dunstable wondered then it dawned upon him mr day wished to break up his halfholiday thoroughly  that afternoon dunstable retired in disgust to his study to brood over his wrongs to him entered charles his friend one c j linton to wit of seymours a very hearty sportsman  good said linton didnt think i should find you in thought you might have gone off somewhere as its such a ripping day tell you what well do scull a mile or two up the river and have tea somewhere  i should like to awfully said dunstable but im afraid i cant  and he explained mr days ingenious scheme for preventing him from straying that afternoon  rot isnt it he said  beastly wouldnt have thought old day had it in him but ill tell you what he said do the impot now and then youll be able to start at three sharp and we shall get in a good time on the river day always sets the same thing ive known scores of chaps get impots from him and they all had to do the greek numerals hes mad on the greek numerals never does anything else youll be as safe as anything if you do them buck up ill help  they accordingly sat down there and then by three oclock an imposing array of sheets of foolscap covered with badlywritten greek lay on the study table  that ought to be enough said linton laying down his pen he cant set you more than weve done i should think  rummy how alike our writing looks said dunstable collecting the sheets and examining them you can hardly tell which is which even when you know well there goes three my watch is slow as it always is ill go and get that note  two minutes later he returned full of abusive references to mr day the crafty pedagogue appeared to have foreseen dunstables attempt to circumvent him by doing the greek numerals on the chance of his setting them the imposition he had set in his note was ten pages of irregular verbs and they were to be shown up in his study before five oclock lintons programme for the afternoon was out of the question now but he loyally gave up any other plans which he might have formed in order to help dunstable with his irregular verbs dunstable was too disgusted with fate to be properly grateful  and the worst of it is he said as they adjourned for tea at halfpast four having deposited the verbs on mr days table that all those numerals will be wasted now  i should keep them though said linton they may come in useful you never know                                       towards the end of the second week of term fate by way of compensation allowed dunstable a distinct stroke of luck mr forman the master of his new form set him a hundred lines of virgil and told him to show them up next day to dunstables delight the next day passed without mention of them and when the day after that went by and still nothing was said he came to the conclusion that mr forman had forgotten all about them  which was indeed the case mr forman was engaged in editing a new edition of the bacchae and was apt to be absentminded in consequence so dunstable with a glad smile hove the lines into a cupboard in his study to keep company with the greek numerals which he had done for mr day and went out to play fives with linton  linton curiously enough had also had a stroke of luck in a rather similar way he told dunstable about it as they strolled back to the houses after their game  bit of luck this afternoon he said you remember appleby setting me a hundredandfifty the day before yesterday well i showed them up today and he looked through them and chucked them into the wastepaper basket under his desk i thought at the time i hadnt seen him muck them up at all with his pencil which is his usual game so after he had gone at the end of school i nipped to the basket and fished them out they were as good as new so i saved them up in case i get any more  dunstable hastened to tell of his own good fortune linton was impressed by the coincidence  i tell you what he said we score either way because if we never get any more lines  dunstable laughed  yes i know linton went on were bound to but even supposing we dont what weve got in stock neednt be wasted  i dont see that said dunstable going to have em bound in cloth and published or were you thinking of framing them  why dont you see sell them of course there are dozens of chaps in the school who would be glad of a few hundred lines cheap  it wouldnt work theyd be spotted  rot its been done before and nobody said anything a chap in seymours who left last easter sold all his stock lines by auction on the last day of term they were virgil mostly and greek numerals they sold like hot cakes there were about five hundred of them altogether and i happen to know that every word of them has been given up and passed all right  well i shall keep mine said dunstable i am sure to want all the lines in stock that i can get i used to think langridge was fairly bad in the way of impots but forman takes the biscuit easily it seems to be a sort of hobby of his you cant stop him  but it was not until the middle of preparation that the great idea flashed upon dunstables mind  it was the simplicity of the thing that took his breath away that and its possibilities this was the idea why not start a lines trust in the school an agency for supplying lines at moderate rates to all who desired them there did not seem to be a single flaw in the scheme he and linton between them could turn out enough material in a week to give the trust a good working capital and as for the risk of detection when customers came to show up the goods supplied to them that was very slight as has been pointed out before there was practically one handwriting common to the whole school when it came to writing lines it resembled the movements of a fly that had fallen into an inkpot and subsequently taken a little brisk exercise on a sheet of foolscap by way of restoring the circulation then again the attitude of the master to whom the lines were shown was not likely to be critical so that everything seemed in favour of dunstables scheme  linton to whom he confided it was inclined to scoff at first but when he had had the beauties of the idea explained to him at length became an enthusiastic supporter of the scheme  but he objected itll take up all our time is it worth it we cant spend every afternoon sweating away at impots for other people  its all right said dunstable ive thought of that we shall need to pitch in pretty hard for about a week or ten days that will give us a good big stock and after that if we turn out a hundred each every day it will be all right a hundreds not much fag if you spread them over a day  linton admitted that this was sound and the locksley lines supplying trust ltd set to work in earnest  it must not be supposed that the agency left a great deal to chance the writing of lines in advance may seem a very speculative business but both dunstable and linton had had a wide experience of locksley masters and the methods of the same when roused and they were thus enabled to reduce the element of chance to a minimum they knew for example that mr days favourite imposition was the greek numerals and that in nine cases out of ten that would be what the youth who had dealings with him would need to ask for from the lines trust mr appleby on the other hand invariably set virgil the oldest inhabitant had never known him to depart from this custom for the french masters extracts from the works of victor hugo would probably pass muster  a week from the date of the above conversation everyone in the school with the exception of the prefects and the sixth form found in his desk on arriving at his formroom a printed slip of paper spiking the stationer in the high street had printed it it was nothing less than the prospectus of the new trust it set forth in glowing terms the advantages offered by the agency dunstable had written ithe had a certain amount of skill with his penand linton had suggested subtle and captivating additions the whole presented rather a striking appearance  the document was headed with the name of the trust in large letters under this came a number of scare headlines such as                see what you save                  no more worry               peace perfect peace           why do lines when we do them                     for you  then came the real prospectus      the locksley lines supplying trust ltd has been instituted to     meet the growing demand for lines and other impositions while     there are masters at our public schools there will always be lines     at locksley the crop of masters has always flourishedand still     flourishesvery rankly and the demand for lines has greatly taxed     the powers of those to whom has been assigned the task of supplying     them      it is for the purpose of affording relief to these that the lines     trust has been formed it is proposed that all orders for lines     shall be supplied out of our vast stock our charges are moderate     and vary between threepence and sixpence per hundred lines the     higher charge is made for greek impositions which for obvious     reasons entail a greater degree of labour on our large and     efficient staff of writers      all orders which will be promptly executed should be forwarded to     mr p a dunstable 6 college grounds locksley or to mr c j     linton 10 college grounds locksley payment must be inclosed     with order or the latter will not be executed under no     conditions will notes of hand or cheques be accepted as legal     tender there is no trust about us except the name      come in your thousands we have lines for all if the trusts     stock of lines were to be placed end to end it would reach part     of the way to london you pay the threepence we do the rest  then a blank space after which came a few unsolicited testimonials      lower fifth writes i was set two hundred lines of virgil on     saturday last at one oclock having laid in a supply from your     agency i was enabled to show them up at five minutes past one     the master who gave me the commission was unable to restrain his     admiration at the rapidity and neatness of my work you may make     what use of this you please      dexters house writes please send me one hundred 100 lines     from aeneid book two mr dexter was so delighted with the last     i showed him that he has asked me to do some more      enthusiast writes thank you for your greek numerals day took     them without blinking so beautifully were they executed that i can     hardly believe even now that i did not write them myself                                        there could be no doubt about the popularity of the trust it caught on instantly  nothing else was discussed in the formrooms at the quarter to eleven interval and in the houses after lunch it was the sole topic of conversation dunstable and linton were bombarded with questions and witticisms of the near personal sort to the latter they replied with directness to the former evasively  whats it all about someone would ask fluttering the leaflet before dunstables unmoved face  you should read it carefully dunstable would reply its all there  but what are you playing at  we tried to make it clear to the meanest intelligence sorry you cant understand it  while at the same time linton in his formroom would be explaining to excited inquirers that he was sorry but it was impossible to reply to their query as to who was running the trust he was not at liberty to reveal business secrets suffice it that there the lines were waiting to be bought and he was there to sell them so that if anybody cared to lay in a stock large or small according to taste would he kindly walk up and deposit the necessary coin  but here the public showed an unaccountable disinclination to deal it was gratifying to have acquaintances coming up and saying admiringly you are an ass you know as if they were paying the highest of complimentsas indeed they probably imagined that they were all this was magnificent but it was not business dunstable and linton felt that the whole attitude of the public towards the new enterprise was wrong locksley seemed to regard the trust as a huge joke and its prospectus as a literary jeu desprit  in fact it looked very much as iffrom a purely commercial point of viewthe great lines supplying trust was going to be what is known in theatrical circles as a frost  for two whole days the public refused to bite and dunstable and linton turning over the stacks of lines in their studies thought gloomily that this world is no place for original enterprise  then things began to move  it was quite an accident that started them jackson of dexters was teaing with linton and as was his habit was giving him a condensed history of his life since he last saw him in the course of this he touched on a small encounter with m gaudinois which had occurred that afternoon  so i got two pages of quatrevingt treize to write he concluded for doing practically nothing  all jacksons impositions according to him were given him for doing practically nothing now and then he got them for doing literally nothingwhen he ought to have been doing formwork  done em asked linton  not yet no replied jackson more tea please  what you want to do then said linton is to apply to the locksley lines supplying trust thats what you must do  you neednt rot a chap on a painful subject protested jackson  i wasnt rotting said linton why dont you apply to the lines trust  then do you mean to say that there really is such a thing jackson said incredulously why i thought it was all a rag  i know you did its the rotten sort of thing you would think rag by jove look at this now do you understand that this is a genuine concern  he got up and went to the cupboard which filled the space between the stove and the bookshelf from this restingplace he extracted a great pile of manuscript and dumped it down on the table with a bang which caused a good deal of jacksons tea to spring from its native cup on to its owners trousers  when youve finished protested jackson mopping himself with a handkerchief that had seen better days  sorry but look at these what did you say your impot was oh i remember here you are two pages of quatrevingt treize i dont know which two pages but i suppose any will do  jackson was amazed  great scott what a wad of stuff when did you do it all  oh at odd times dunstables got just as much over at days so you see the trust is a jolly big show here are your two pages that looks just like your scrawl doesnt it these would be fourpence in the ordinary way but you can have em for nothing this time  oh i say said jackson gratefully thats awfully good of you  after that the locksley lines supplying trust ltd went ahead with a rush the brilliant success which attended its first specimenm gaudinois took jacksons imposition without a murmurpromoted confidence in the public and they rushed to buy orders poured in from all the houses and by the middle of the term the organisers of the scheme were able to divide a substantial sum  how are you getting on round your way asked linton of dunstable at the end of the sixth week of term  ripping selling like hot cakes  so are mine said linton ive almost come to the end of my stock i ought to have written some more but ive been a bit slack lately  yes buck up we must keep a lot in hand  i say did you hear that about merrett in our house asked linton  what about him  why he tried to start a rival show wrote a prospectus and everything but it didnt catch on a bit the only chap who bought any of his lines was young shoeblossom he wanted a couple of hundred for appleby appleby was on to them like bricks spotted shoeblossom hadnt written them and asked who had he wouldnt say so he got them doubled everyone in the house is jolly sick with merrett they think he ought to have owned up  did that smash up merretts show is he going to turn out any more  rather not whod buy em  it would have been better for the lines supplying trust if merrett had not received this crushing blow and had been allowed to carry on a rival business on legitimate lines locksley was conservative in its habits and would probably have continued to support the old firm  as it was the baffled merrett a youth of vindictive nature brooded over his defeat and presently hit upon a scheme whereby things might be levelled up  one afternoon shortly before lockup dunstable was surprised by the advent of linton to his study in a bruised and dishevelled condition one of his expressive eyes was closed and blackened he also wore what is known in ring circles as a thick ear  what on earths up inquired dunstable amazed at these phenomena have you been scrapping  yesmerretti won what are you up towriting lines you may as well save yourself the trouble they wont be any good dunstable stared  the trusts bust said linton  he never wasted words in moments of emotion  what  bust was what i said that beast merrett gave the show away  what did he do surely he didnt tell a master  well he did the next thing to it he hauled out that prospectus and started reading it in form i watched him do it he kept it under the desk and made a foul row laughing over it appleby couldnt help spotting him of course he told him to bring him what he was reading up went merrett with the prospectus  was appleby sick  i dont believe he was really at least he laughed when he read the thing but he hauled me up after school and gave me a long jaw and made me take all the lines id got to his house he burnt them i had it out with merrett just now he swears he didnt mean to get the thing spotted but i knew he did  where did you scrag him  in the dormitory he chucked it after the third round  there was a knock at the door  come in shouted dunstable  buxton appeared a member of applebys house  oh dunstable appleby wants to see you  all right said dunstable wearily  mr appleby was in facetious mood he chaffed dunstable genially about his prospectus and admitted that it had amused him dunstable smiled without enjoyment it was a good thing perhaps that mr appleby saw the humorous rather than the lawless side of the trust but all the quips in the world could not save that institution from ruin  presently mr applebys manner changed i am a funny dog i know he seemed to say but duty is duty and must be done  how many lines have you at your house dunstable he asked  about eight hundred sir  then you had better write me eight hundred lines and show them up to me in this room atshall we say at ten minutes to five it is now a quarter to so that you will have plenty of time  dunstable went and returned five minutes later bearing an armful of manuscript  i dont think i shall need to count them said mr appleby kindly take them in batches of ten sheets and tear them in half dunstable  yes sir  the last sheet fluttered in two sections into the surfeited wastepaper basket  its an awful waste sir said dunstable regretfully  mr appleby beamed  we must however he said always endeavour to look on the bright side dunstable the writing of these eight hundred lines will have given you a fine grip of the rhythm of virgil the splendid prose of victor hugo and the unstudied majesty of the greek numerals goodnight dunstable  goodnight sir said the president of the locksley lines supplying trust ltd     the autograph hunters   dunstable had his reasons for wishing to obtain mr montagu watsons autograph but admiration for that gentlemans novels was not one of them  it was nothing to him that critics considered mr watson one of the most remarkable figures in english literature since scott if you had told him of this he would merely have wondered in his coarse material way how much mr watson gave the critics for saying so to the reviewer of the weekly booklover the great mans latest effort the soul of anthony carrington popgood and grooly 6s seemed a work that speaks eloquently in every line of a genius that time cannot wither nor custom stale to dunstable who got it out of the school library where it had been placed at the request of a literary prefect and read the first eleven pages it seemed rot and he said as much to the librarian on returning it  yet he was very anxious to get the novelists autograph the fact was that mr day his housemaster a man whose private life was in other ways unstained by vicious habits collected autographs also mr day had behaved in a square manner towards dunstable on several occasions in the past and dunstable always ready to punish bad behaviour in a master was equally anxious to reward and foster any good trait which he might exhibit  on the occasion of the announcement that mr watson had taken the big white house near chesterton a couple of miles from the school mr day had expressed in dunstables hearing a wish that he could add that celebritys signature to his collection dunstable had instantly determined to play the part of a benevolent providence he would get the autograph and present it to the housemaster as who should say see what comes of being good it would be pleasant to observe the innocent joy of the recipient his childlike triumph and his amazement at the donors ingenuity in securing the treasure a touching scenewell worth the trouble involved in the quest  and there would be trouble for mr montagu watson was notoriously a foe to the autographhunter his curt typewritten replies signed by a secretary had damped the ardour of scores of brave men andmore or lessfair women a genuine montagu watson was a prize in the autograph market  dunstable was a man of action when mark the bootboy at days carried his burden of letters to the post that evening there nestled among them one addressed to m watson esq the white house chesterton looking at it casually few of his friends would have recognised dunstables handwriting for it had seemed good to that man of guile to adopt for the occasion the role of a backward youth of twelve years old he thought tender years might touch mr watsons heart  this was the letter      dear siri am only a littel boy but i think your     books ripping i often wonder how you think of it all will you     please send me your ortograf i like your books very much i have     named my white rabit montagu after you i punched jones ii in     the eye today becos he didnt like your books i have spent the     only penny i have on the stampe for this letter which i might have     spent on tuck i want to be like maltby in the soul of anthony     carrington when i grow up                              your sincere reader                              p a dunstable  it was a little unfortunate perhaps that he selected maltby as his ideal character that gentleman was considered by critics a masterly portrait of the cynical roué but it was the only name he remembered  hot stuff said dunstable to himself as he closed the envelope  little beast said mr watson to himself as he opened it it arrived by the morning post and he never felt really himself till after breakfast  here morrison he said to his secretary later in the morning just answer this will you the usual thingthanks and most deeply grateful yknow  next day the following was included in dunstables correspondence      mr montagu watson presents his compliments to mr p a dunstable     and begs to thank him for all the kind things he says about his     work in his letter of the 18th inst for which he is deeply grateful  foiled said dunstable and went off to seymours to see his friend linton  got any notepaper he asked  heaps said linton why want some  then get out a piece i want to dictate a letter  linton stared  whats up hurt your hand  dunstable explained  day collects autographs you know and he wants montagu watsons badly pining away and all that sort of thing wont smile until he gets it i had a shot at it yesterday and got this  linton inspected the document  so i cant send up another myself you see  why worry  oh id like to put day one up hes not been bad this term come on  all right let her rip  dunstable let her rip      dear siri cannot refrain from writing to tell you what     an inestimable comfort your novels have been to me during years     of sore tribulation and distress  look here interrupted linton with decision at this point if you think im going to shove my name at the end of this rot youre making the mistake of a lifetime  of course not youre a widow who has lost two sons in south africa well think of a good name afterwards ready      ever since my darling charles herbert and percy lionel were     taken from me in that dreadful war i have turned for consolation     to the pages of the soul of anthony carrington and  what another asked linton  theres one called pancakes  sure sounds rummy  thats all right you have to get a queer title nowadays if you want to sell a book  go on then jam it down      and pancakes i hate to bother you but if you could send me     your autograph i should be more grateful than words can say yours     admiringly  whats a good name how would dorothy maynard do  you want something more aristocratic what price hilda foulkeponsonby  dunstable made no objection and linton signed the letter with a flourish  they installed mrs foulkeponsonby at spikings in the high street it was not a very likely address for a lady whose blood was presumably of the bluest but they could think of none except that obliging stationer who would take in letters for them  there was a letter for mrs foulkeponsonby next day whatever his other defects as a correspondent mr watson was at least prompt with his responses  mr montagu watson presented his compliments and was deeply grateful for all the kind things mrs foulkeponsonby had said about his work in her letter of the 19th inst he was however afraid that he scarcely deserved them her opportunities of deriving consolation from the soul of anthony carrington had been limited by the fact that that book had only been published ten days before while as for pancakes to which she had referred in such flattering terms he feared that another author must have the credit of any refreshment her bereaved spirit might have extracted from that volume for he had written no work of such a name his own pan wakes would he hoped administer an equal quantity of balm  mr secretary morrison had slept badly on the night before he wrote this letter and had expended some venom upon its composition  sold again said dunstable  youd better chuck it now its no good said linton  ill have another shot then ill try and think of something else  two days later mr morrison replied to mr edgar habbeshammorley of 3a green street park lane to the effect that mr montagu watson was deeply grateful for all the kind things etc  3a green street was dunstables home address  at this juncture the watsondunstable correspondence ceases and the relations become more personal  on the afternoon of the twentythird of the month mr watson taking a meditative stroll through the wood which formed part of his property was infuriated by the sight of a boy  he was not a man who was fond of boys even in their proper place and the sight of one in the middle of his wood prancing lightly about among the nesting pheasants stirred his never too placid mind to its depths  he shouted  the apparition paused  here hi you boy  sir said the stripling with a winning smile lifting his cap with the air of a dorsay  what business have you in my wood  not business corrected the visitor pleasure  come here shrilled the novelist  the stranger receded coyly  mr watson advanced at the double  his quarry dodged behind a tree  for five minutes the great man devoted his powerful mind solely to the task of catching his visitor  the latter however proved as elusive as the point of a halfformed epigram and at the end of the five minutes he was no longer within sight  mr watson went off and addressed his keeper in terms which made that worthy envious for a week  its eddication he said subsequently to a friend at the cowslip inn you and me couldnt talk like that it wants eddication  for the next few days the keepers existence was enlivened by visits from what appeared to be a most enthusiastic birdsnester by no other theory could he account for it only a boy with a collection to support would run such risks  to the keepers mind the human boy up to the age of twenty or so had no object in life except to collect eggs after twenty of course he took to poaching this was a boy of about seventeen  on the fifth day he caught him and conducted him into the presence of mr montagu watson  mr watson was brief and to the point he recognised his visitor as the boy for whose benefit he had made himself stiff for two days  the keeper added further damaging facts  bin here every day he as sir for the last week well i says to myself supposition is hell come once too often hell come once too often i says and then i says ill cotch him and i cotched him  the keepers narrative style had something of the classic simplicity of julius caesars  mr watson bit his pen  what you boys come for i cant understand he said irritably youre from the school of course  yes said the captive  well i shall report you to your housemaster what is your name  dunstable  your house  days  very good that is all  dunstable retired  his next appearance in public life was in mr days study mr day had sent for him after preparation he held a letter in his hand and he looked annoyed  come in dunstable i have just received a letter complaining of you it seems that you have been trespassing  yes sir  i am surprised dunstable that a sensible boy like you should have done such a foolish thing it seems so objectless you know how greatly the headmaster dislikes any sort of friction between the school and the neighbours and yet you deliberately trespass in mr watsons wood  im very sorry sir  i have had a most indignant letter from himyou may see what he says you do not deny it  dunstable ran his eye over the straggling untidy sentences  no sir its quite true  in that case i shall have to punish you severely you will write me out the greek numerals ten times and show them up to me on tuesday  yes sir  that will do  at the door dunstable paused  well dunstable said mr day  erim glad youve got his autograph after all sir he said  then he closed the door  as he was going to bed that night dunstable met the housemaster on the stairs  dunstable said mr day  yes sir  on second thoughts it would be better if instead of the greek numerals ten times you wrote me the first ode of the first book of horace the numerals would be a little long perhaps     pillingshot detective   life at st austins was rendered somewhat hollow and burdensome for pillingshot by the fact that he fagged for scott not that scott was the beetlebrowed bully in any way far from it he showed a kindly interest in pillingshots welfare and sometimes even did his latin verses for him but the noblest natures have flaws and scotts was no exception he was by way of being a humorist and pillingshot with his rather serious outlook on life was puzzled and inconvenienced by this  it was through this defect in scotts character that pillingshot first became a detective  he was toasting muffins at the study fire one evening while scott seated on two chairs and five cushions read sherlock holmes when the prefect laid down his book and fixed him with an earnest eye  do you know pillingshot he said youve got a bright intelligent face i shouldnt wonder if you werent rather clever why do you hide your light under a bushel  pillingshot grunted  we must find some way of advertising you why dont you go in for a junior scholarship  too old said pillingshot with satisfaction  senior then  too young  i believe by sitting up all night and swotting  here i say said pillingshot alarmed  youve got no enterprise said scott sadly what are those muffins well well i suppose i had better try and peck a bit  he ate four in rapid succession and resumed his scrutiny of pillingshots countenance  the great thing he said is to find out your special line till then we are working in the dark perhaps its music singing sing me a bar or two  pillingshot wriggled uncomfortably  left your music at home said scott never mind then perhaps its all for the best what are those still muffins hand me another after all one must keep ones strength up you can have one if you like  pillingshots face brightened he became more affable he chatted  theres rather a row on downstairs he said in the junior dayroom  there always is said scott if it grows too loud i shall get in amongst them with a swaggerstick i attribute half my success at bringing off latecuts to the practice i have had in the junior dayroom it keeps the wrist supple  i dont mean that sort of row its about evans  what about evans  hes lost a sovereign  silly young ass  pillingshot furtively helped himself to another muffin  he thinks some ones taken it he said  what stolen it  pillingshot nodded  what makes him think that  he doesnt see how else it could have gone  oh i dontby jove  scott sat up with some excitement  ive got it he said i knew we should hit on it sooner or later heres a field for your genius you shall be a detective pillingshot i hand this case over to you i employ you  pillingshot gaped  i feel certain thats your line ive often noticed you walking over to school looking exactly like a bloodhound get to work as a start youd better fetch evans up here and question him  but look here  buck up man buck up dont you know that every moment is precious  evans a small stout youth was not disposed to be reticent the gist of his rambling statement was as follows rich uncle impecunious nephew visit of former to latter handsome tip one sovereign impecunious nephew pouches sovereign and it vanishes  and i call it beastly rot concluded evans volubly and if i could find the cad whos pinched it id jolly well  less of it said scott now then pillingshot ill begin this thing just to start you off what makes you think the quid has been stolen evans  because i jolly well know it has  what you jolly well know isnt evidence we must thresh this thing out to begin with where did you last see it  when i put it in my pocket  good make a note of that pillingshot wheres your notebook not got one here you are then you can tear out the first few pages the ones ive written on ready carry on evans when  when what  when did you put it in your pocket  yesterday afternoon  what time  about five  same pair of bags youre wearing now  no my cricket bags i was playing at the nets when my uncle came  ah cricket bags put it down pillingshot thats a clue work on it where are they  theyve gone to the wash  about time too i noticed them how do you know the quid didnt go to the wash as well  i turned both the pockets inside out  any hole in the pocket  no  well when did you take off the bags did you sleep in them  i wore em till bedtime and then shoved them on a chair by the side of the bed it wasnt till next morning that i remembered the quid was in them  but it wasnt objected scott  i thought it was it ought to have been  he thought it was thats a clue young pillingshot work on it well  well when i went to take the quid out of my cricket bags it wasnt there  what time was that  halfpast seven this morning  what time did you go to bed  ten  then the theft occurred between the hours of ten and seventhirty mind you im giving you a jolly good legup young pillingshot but as its your first case i dont mind thatll be all from you evans pop off  evans disappeared scott turned to the detective  well young pillingshot he said what do you make of it  i dont know  what steps do you propose to take  i dont know  youre a lot of use arent you as a start youd better examine the scene of the robbery i should say  pillingshot reluctantly left the room  well said scott when he returned any clues  no  you thoroughly examined the scene of the robbery  i looked under the bed  under the bed whats the good of that did you go over every inch of the strip of carpet leading to the chair with a magnifyingglass  hadnt got a magnifyingglass  then youd better buck up and get one if youre going to be a detective do you think sherlock holmes ever moved a step without his not much well anyhow did you find any footprints or tobaccoash  there was a jolly lot of dust about  did you preserve a sample  no  my word youve a lot to learn now weighing the evidence does anything strike you  no  youre a bright sort of sleuthhound arent you it seems to me im doing all the work on this case ill have to give you another legup considering the time when the quid disappeared i should say that somebody in the dormitory must have collared it how many fellows are there in evans dormitory  i dont know  cut along and find out  the detective reluctantly trudged off once more  well said scott on his return  seven said pillingshot counting evans  we neednt count evans if hes ass enough to steal his own quids he deserves to lose them who are the other six  theres trent hes prefect  the napoleon of crime watch his every move yes  simms  a dangerous man sinister to the core  and green berkeley hanson and daubeny  every one of them well known to the police why the place is a perfect thieves kitchen look here we must act swiftly young pillingshot this is a black business well take them in alphabetical order run and fetch berkeley  berkeley interrupted in a game of halma came unwillingly  now then pillingshot put your questions said scott this is a black business berkeley young evans has lost a sovereign  if you think ive taken his beastly quid said berkeley warmly  make a note that on being questioned the man berkeley exhibited suspicious emotion go on jam it down  pillingshot reluctantly entered the statement under berkeleys indignant gaze  now then carry on  you know its all rot protested pillingshot i never said berkeley had anything to do with it  never mind ask him what his movements were on the night of thewhat was yesterdayon the night of the sixteenth of july  pillingshot put the question nervously  i was in bed of course you silly ass  were you asleep inquired scott  of course i was  then how do you know what you were doing pillingshot make a note of the fact that the man berkeleys statement was confused and contradictory its a clue work on it whos next daubeny berkeley send daubeny up here  all right pillingshot you wait was berkeleys exit speech  daubeny when examined exhibited the same suspicious emotion that berkeley had shown and hanson simms and green behaved in a precisely similar manner  this said scott somewhat complicates the case we must have further clues youd better pop off now pillingshot ive got a latin prose to do bring me reports of your progress daily and dont overlook the importance of trifles why in silver blaze it was a burnt match that first put holmes on the scent  entering the junior dayroom with some apprehension the sleuthhound found an excited gathering of suspects waiting to interview him  one sentiment animated the meeting each of the five wanted to know what pillingshot meant by it  whats the row queried interested spectators rallying round  that cad pillingshots been accusing us of bagging evans quid  whats scott got to do with it inquired one of the spectators  pillingshot explained his position  all the same said daubeny you neednt have dragged us into it  i couldnt help it he made me  awful ass scott admitted green  pillingshot welcomed this sign that the focus of popular indignation was being shifted  shoving himself into other peoples business grumbled pillingshot  trying to be funny berkeley summed up  rotten at cricket too  cant play a yorker for nuts  see him drop that sitter on saturday  so that was all right as far as the junior dayroom was concerned pillingshot felt himself vindicated  but his employer was less easily satisfied pillingshot had hoped that by the next day he would have forgotten the subject but when he went into the study to get tea ready up it came again  any clues yet pillingshot  pillingshot had to admit that there were none  hullo this wont do you must bustle about you must get your nose to the trail have you crossexamined trent yet no well there you are then nip off and do it now  but i say scott hes a prefect  in the dictionary of crime said scott sententiously there is no such word as prefect all are alike go and take down trents statement  to tax a prefect with having stolen a sovereign was a task at which pillingshots imagination boggled he went to trents study in a sort of dream  a hoarse roar answered his feeble tap there was no doubt about trent being in inspection revealed the fact that the prefect was working and evidently illattuned to conversation he wore a haggard look and his eye as it caught that of the collector of statements was dangerous  well said trent scowling murderously  pillingshots legs felt perfectly boneless  well said trent  pillingshot yammered  well  the roar shook the window and pillingshots presence of mind deserted him altogether  have you bagged a sovereign he asked  there was an awful silence during which the detective his limbs suddenly becoming active again banged the door and shot off down the passage  he reentered scotts study at the double  well said scott what did he say  nothing  get out your notebook and put down under the heading trent suspicious silence a very bad lot trent keep him under constant espionage its a clue work on it  pillingshot made a note of the silence but later on when he and the prefect met in the dormitory felt inclined to erase it for silence was the last epithet one would have applied to trent on that occasion as he crawled painfully into bed pillingshot became more than ever convinced that the path of the amateur detective was a thorny one  this conviction deepened next day  scotts help was possibly well meant but it was certainly inconvenient his theories were of the brilliant dashing order and pillingshot could never be certain who and in what rank of life the next suspect would be he spent that afternoon shadowing the greaser the combination of bootboy and butler who did the odd jobs about the school house and in the evening seemed likely to be about to move in the very highest circles this was when scott remarked in a dreamy voice you know im told the old man has been spending a good lot of money lately  to which the burden of pillingshots reply was that he would do anything in reason but he was blowed if he was going to crossexamine the headmaster  it seems to me said scott sadly that you dont want to find that sovereign dont you like evans or what is it  it was on the following morning after breakfast that the close observer might have noticed a change in the detectives demeanour he no longer looked as if he were weighed down by a secret sorrow his manner was even jaunty  scott noticed it  whats up he inquired got a clue  pillingshot nodded  what is it lets have a look  shhh said pillingshot mysteriously  scotts interest was aroused when his fag was making tea in the afternoon he questioned him again  out with it he said whats the point of all this silent mystery business  sherlock holmes never gave anything away  out with it  walls have ears said pillingshot  so have you replied scott crisply and ill smite them in half a second  pillingshot sighed resignedly and produced an envelope from this he poured some dried mud  here steady on with my tablecloth said scott whats this  mud  what about it  where do you think it came from  how should i know road i suppose  pillingshot smiled faintly  eighteen different kinds of mud about here he said patronisingly this is flowerbed mud from the house frontgarden  well what about it  shhh said pillingshot and glided out of the room                                        well asked scott next day clues pouring in all right  rather  what got another  pillingshot walked silently to the door and flung it open he looked up and down the passage then he closed the door and returned to the table where he took from his waistcoatpocket a used match  scott turned it over inquiringly  whats the idea of this  a clue said pillingshot see anything queer about it see that rummy brown stain on it  yes  blood snorted pillingshot  whats the good of blood theres been no murder  pillingshot looked serious  i never thought of that  you must think of everything the worst mistake a detective can make is to get switched off on to another track while hes working on a case this match is a clue to something else you cant work on it  i suppose not said pillingshot  dont be discouraged youre doing fine  i know said pillingshot i shall find that quid all right  nothing like sticking to it  pillingshot shuffled then rose to a point of order  ive been reading those sherlock holmes stories he said and sherlock holmes always got a fee if he brought a thing off i think i ought to too  mercenary young brute  it has been a beastly sweat  done you good supplied you with a serious interest in life well i expect evans will give you somethinga jewelled snuffbox or somethingif you pull the thing off  i dont  well hell buy you a tea or something  he wont hes not going to break the quid hes saving up for a camera  well what are you going to do about it  pillingshot kicked the leg of the table  you put me on to the case he said casually  what if you think im going to squander  i think you ought to let me off fagging for the rest of the term  scott reflected  theres something in that all right  thanks  dont mention it you havent found the quid yet  i know where it is  where  ah  fool said scott                                        after breakfast next day scott was seated in his study when pillingshot entered  here you are said pillingshot  he unclasped his right hand and exhibited a sovereign scott inspected it  is this the one he said  yes said pillingshot  how do you know  it is ive sifted all the evidence  who had bagged it  i dont want to mention names  oh all right as he didnt spend any of it it doesnt much matter not that its much catch having a thief roaming at large about the house anyhow what put you on to him how did you get on the track youre a jolly smart kid young pillingshot how did you work it  i have my methods said pillingshot with dignity  buck up i shall have to be going over to school in a second  i hardly like to tell you  tell me dash it all i put you on to the case im your employer  you wont touch me up if i tell you  i will if you dont  but not if i do  no  and how about the fee  thats all right go on  all right then well i thought the whole thing over and i couldnt make anything out of it at first because it didnt seem likely that trent or any of the other fellows in the dormitory had taken it and then suddenly something evans told me the day before yesterday made it all clear  what was that  he said that the matron had just given him back his quid which one of the housemaids had found on the floor by his bed it had dropped out of his pocket that first night  scott eyed him fixedly pillingshot coyly evaded his gaze  that was it was it said scott  pillingshot nodded  it was a clue he said i worked on it
