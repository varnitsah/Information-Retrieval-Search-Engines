51359823	poor miss finch   by  wilkie collins     to mrs elliot  of the deanery bristol  will you honor me by accepting the dedication of this book in remembrance of an uninterrupted friendship of many years  more than one charming blind girl in fiction and in the drama has preceded poor miss finch but so far as i know blindness in these cases has been always exhibited more or less exclusively from the ideal and the sentimental point of view the attempt here made is to appeal to an interest of another kind by exhibiting blindness as it really is i have carefully gathered the information necessary to the execution of this purpose from competent authorities of all sorts whenever lucilla acts or speaks in these pages with reference to her blindness she is doing or saying what persons afflicted as she is have done or said before her of the other features which i have added to produce and sustain interest in this central personage of my story it does not become me to speak it is for my readers to say if lucilla has found her way to their sympathies in this character and more especially again in the characters of nugent dubourg and madame pratolungo i have tried to present human nature in its inherent inconsistencies and selfcontradictionsin its intricate mixture of good and evil of great and smallas i see it in the world about me but the faculty of observing character is so rare the curiously mistaken tendency to look for logical consistency in human motives and human actions is so general that i may possibly find the execution of this part of my task misunderstoodsometimes even resentedin certain quarters however time has stood my friend in relation to other characters of mine in other booksand who can say that time may not help me again here perhaps one of these days i may be able to make use of some of the many interesting stories of events that have really happened which have been placed in my hands by persons who could speak as witnesses to the truth of the narrative thus far i have not ventured to disturb the repose of these manuscripts in the locked drawer allotted to them the true incidents are so farfetched and the conduct of the real people is so grossly improbable  as for the object which i have had in view in writing this story it is i hope plain enough to speak for itself i subscribe to the article of belief which declares that the conditions of human happiness are independent of bodily affliction and that it is even possible for bodily affliction itself to take its place among the ingredients of happiness these are the views which poor miss finch is intended to advocateand this is the impression which i hope to leave on the mind of the reader when the book is closed  w c  january 16th 1872    note to the present edition  in expressing my acknowledgments for the favorable reception accorded to the previous editions of this story i may take the present opportunity of adverting to one of the characters not alluded to in the letter of dedication the german oculistherr grossehas impressed himself so strongly as a real personage on the minds of some of my readers afflicted with blindness or suffering from diseases of the eye that i have received several written applications requesting me to communicate his present address to patients desirous of consulting him sincerely appreciating the testimony thus rendered to the truth of this little study of character i have been obliged to acknowledge to my correspondentsand i may as well repeat it herethat herr grosse has no individual living prototype like the other persons of the drama in this book and in the books which have preceded it he is drawn from my general observation of humanity i have always considered it to be a mistake in art to limit the delineation of character in fiction to a literary portrait taken from any one sitter the result of this process is generally to my mind to produce a caricature instead of a character

herself  you are here invited to read the story of an event which occurred in an outoftheway corner of england some years since  the persons principally concerned in the event area blind girl two twin brothers a skilled surgeon and a curious foreign woman i am the curious foreign woman and i take it on myselffor reasons which will presently appearto tell the story  so far we understand each other good i may make myself known to you as briefly as i can  i am madame pratolungowidow of that celebrated south american patriot doctor pratolungo i am french by birth before i married the doctor i went through many vicissitudes in my own country they ended in leaving me at an age which is of no consequence to anybody with some experience of the world with a cultivated musical talent on the pianoforte and with a comfortable little fortune unexpectedly bequeathed to me by a relative of my dear dead mother which fortune i shared with good papa and with my younger sisters to these qualifications i added another the most precious of all when i married the doctor namelya strong infusion of ultraliberal principles vive la r√©publique  some people do one thing and some do another in the way of celebrating the event of their marriage having become man and wife doctor pratolungo and i took ship to central americaand devoted our honeymoon in those disturbed districts to the sacred duty of destroying tyrants  ah the vital air of my noble husband was the air of revolutions from his youth upwards he had followed the glorious profession of patriot wherever the people of the southern new world rose and declared their independenceand in my time that fervent population did nothing elsethere was the doctor selfdevoted on the altar of his adopted country he had been fifteen times exiled and condemned to death in his absence when i met with him in paristhe picture of heroic poverty with a brown complexion and one lame leg who could avoid falling in love with such a man i was proud when he proposed to devote me on the altar of his adopted country as well as himselfme and my money for alas everything is expensive in this world including the destruction of tyrants and the saving of freedom all my money went in helping the sacred cause of the people dictators and filibusters flourished in spite of us before we had been a year married the doctor had to fly for the sixteenth time to escape being tried for his life my husband condemned to death in his absence and i with my pockets empty this is how the republic rewarded us and yet i love the republic ah you monarchypeople sitting fat and contented under tyrants respect that  this time we took refuge in england the affairs of central america went on without us  i thought of giving lessons in music but my glorious husband could not spare me away from him i suppose we should have starved and made a sad little paragraph in the english newspapersif the end had not come in another way my poor pratolungo was in truth worn out he sank under his sixteenth exile i was left a widowwith nothing but the inheritance of my husbands noble sentiments to console me  i went back for awhile to good papa and my sisters in paris but it was not in my nature to remain and be a burden on them at home i returned again to london with recommendations and encountered inconceivable disasters in the effort to earn a living honorably of all the wealth about methe prodigal insolent ostentatious wealthnone fell to my share what right has anybody to be rich i defy you whoever you may be to prove that anybody has a right to be rich  without dwelling on my disasters let it be enough to say that i got up one morning with three pounds seven shillings and fourpence in my purse with my fervid temper and my republican principlesand with absolutely nothing in prospect that is to say with not a halfpenny more to come to me unless i could earn it for myself  in this sad case what does an honest woman who is bent on winning her own independence by her own work do she takes three and sixpence out of her little humble store and she advertises herself in a newspaper  one always advertises the best side of oneself ah poor humanity my best side was my musical side in the days of my vicissitudes before my marriage i had at one time had a share in a millinery establishment in lyons at another time i had been bedchamberwoman to a great lady in paris but in my present situation these sides of myself were for various reasons not so presentable as the pianoforte side i was not a great playerfar from it but i had been soundly instructed and i had what you call a competent skill on the instrument brief i made the best of myself i promise you in my advertisement  the next day i borrowed the newspaper to enjoy the pride of seeing my composition in print  ah heaven what did i discover i discovered what other wretched advertising people have found out before me above my own advertisement the very thing i wanted was advertised for by somebody else look in any newspaper and you will see strangers who if i may so express myself exactly fit each other advertising for each other without knowing it i had advertised myself as accomplished musical companion for a lady with cheerful temper to match and there above me was my unknown necessitous fellowcreature crying out in printers typeswanted a companion for a lady must be an accomplished musician and have a cheerful temper testimonials to capacity and firstrate references required exactly what i had offered apply by letter only in the first instance exactly what i had said fie upon me i had spent three and sixpence for nothing i threw down the newspaper in a transport of anger like a fooland then took it up again like a sensible woman and applied by letter for the offered place  my letter brought me into contact with a lawyer the lawyer enveloped himself in mystery it seemed to be a professional habit with him to tell nobody anything if he could possibly help it  drop by drop this wearisome man let the circumstances out the lady was a young lady she was the daughter of a clergyman she lived in a retired part of the country more even than that she lived in a retired part of the house her father had married a second time having only the young lady as child by his first marriage he had i suppose by way of a change a large family by his second marriage circumstances rendered it necessary for the young lady to live as much apart as she could from the tumult of a houseful of children so he went on until there was no keeping it in any longerand then he let it out the young lady was blind  younglonelyblind i had a sudden inspiration i felt i should love her  the question of my musical capacity was in this sad case a serious one the poor young lady had one great pleasure to illumine her dark lifemusic her companion was wanted to play from the book and play worthily the works of the great masters whom this young creature adoredand she listening would take her place next at the piano and reproduce the music morsel by morsel by ear a professor was appointed to pronounce sentence on me and declare if i could be trusted not to misinterpret mozart beethoven and the other masters who have written for the piano through this ordeal i passed with success as for my references they spoke for themselves not even the lawyer though he tried hard could pick holes in them it was arranged on both sides that i should in the first instance go on a months visit to the young lady if we both wished it at the end of the time i was to stay on terms arranged to my perfect satisfaction there was our treaty  the next day i started for my visit by the railway  my instructions directed me to travel to the town of lewes in sussex arrived there i was to ask for the ponychaise of my young ladys fatherdescribed on his card as reverend tertius finch the chaise was to take me to the rectoryhouse in the village of dimchurch and the village of dimchurch was situated among the south down hills three or four miles from the coast  when i stepped into the railway carriage this was all i knew after my adventurous lifeafter the volcanic agitations of my republican career in the doctors timewas i about to bury myself in a remote english village and live a life as monotonous as the life of a sheep on a hill ah with all my experience i had yet to learn that the narrowest human limits are wide enough to contain the grandest human emotions i had seen the drama of life amid the turmoil of tropical revolutions i was to see it again with all its palpitating interest in the breezy solitudes of the south down hills    chapter the second  madame pratolungo makes a voyage on land  a wellfed boy with yellow saxon hair a little shabby green chaise and a rough brown ponythese objects confronted me at the lewes station i said to the boy are you reverend finchs servant and the boy answered i be he  we drove through the towna hilly town of desolate clean houses no living creatures visible behind the jealouslyshut windows no living creatures entering or departing through the sadcolored closed doors no theater no place of amusement except an empty townhall with a sad policeman meditating on its spruce white steps no customers in the shops and nobody to serve them behind the counter even if they had turned up here and there on the pavements an inhabitant with a capacity for staring and apparently a capacity for nothing else i said to reverend finchs boy is this a rich place reverend finchs boy brightened and answered that it be good at any rate they dont enjoy themselves herethe infamous rich  leaving this town of unamused citizens immured in domestic tombs we got on a fine high roadstill ascendingwith a spacious open country on either side of it  a spacious open country is a country soon exhausted by a sightseers eye i have learnt from my poor pratolungo the habit of searching for the political convictions of my fellowcreatures when i find myself in contact with them in strange places having nothing else to do i searched finchs boy his political programme i found to beas much meat and beer as i can contain and as little work to do for it as possible in return for this to touch my hat when i meet the squire and to be content with the station to which it has pleased god to call me miserable finchs boy  we reached the highest point of the road on our right hand the ground sloped away gently into a fertile valleywith a village and a church in it and beyond an abominable privileged enclosure of grass and trees torn from the community by a tyrant and called a park with the palace in which this enemy of mankind caroused and fattened standing in the midst on our left hand spread the open countrya magnificent prospect of grand grassy hills rolling away to the horizon bounded only by the sky to my surprise finchs boy descended took the pony by the head and deliberately led him off the high road and on to the wilderness of grassy hills on which not so much as a footpath was discernible anywhere far or near the chaise began to heave and roll like a ship on the sea it became necessary to hold with both hands to keep my place i thought first of my luggagethen of myself  how much is there of this i asked  three mile ont answered finchs boy  i insisted on stopping the shipi mean the chaiseand on getting out we tied my luggage fast with a rope and then we went on again the boy at the ponys head and i after them on foot  ah what a walk it was what air over my head what grass under my feet the sweetness of the inner land and the crisp saltness of the distant sea were mixed in that delicious breeze the short turf fragrant with odorous herbs rose and fell elastic underfoot the mountainpiles of white cloud moved in sublime procession along the blue field of heaven overhead the wild growth of prickly bushes spread in great patches over the grass was in a glory of yellow bloom on we went now up now down now bending to the right and now turning to the left i looked about me no house no road no paths fences hedges walls no landmarks of any sort all round us turn which way we might nothing was to be seen but the majestic solitude of the hills no living creatures appeared but the white dots of sheep scattered over the soft green distance and the skylark singing his hymn of happiness a speck above my head truly a wonderful place distant not more than a mornings drive from noisy and populous brightona stranger to this neighborhood could only have found his way by the compass exactly as if he had been sailing on the sea the farther we penetrated on our landvoyage the more wild and the more beautiful the solitary landscape grew the boy picked his way as he chosethere were no barriers here plodding behind i saw nothing at one time but the back of the chaise tilted up in the air both boy and pony being invisibly buried in the steep descent of the hill at other times the pitch was all the contrary way the whole interior of the ascending chaise was disclosed to my view and above the chaise the pony and above the pony the boyand ah my luggage swaying and rocking in the frail embraces of the rope that held it twenty times did i confidently expect to see baggage chaise pony boy all rolling down into the bottom of a valley together but no not the least little accident happened to spoil my enjoyment of the day politically contemptible finchs boy had his merithe was master of his subject as guide and ponyleader among the south down hills  arrived at the top of as it seemed to me our fiftieth grassy summit i began to look about for signs of the village  behind me rolled back the long undulations of the hills with the cloudshadows moving over the solitudes that we had left before me at a break in the purple distance i saw the soft white line of the sea beneath me at my feet opened the deepest valley i had noticed yetwith one first sign of the presence of man scored hideously on the face of nature in the shape of a square brown patch of cleared and ploughed land on the grassy slope i asked if we were getting near the village now finchs boy winked and answered yes we be  astonishing finchs boy ask him what questions i might the resources of his vocabulary remained invariably the same still this youthful oracle answered always in three monosyllabic words  we plunged into the valley  arrived at the bottom i discovered another sign of man behold the first road i had seen yeta rough wagonroad ploughed deep in the chalky soil we crossed this and turned a corner of a hill more signs of human life two small boys started up out of a ditchapparently posted as scouts to give notice of our approach they yelled and set off running before us by some short cut known only to themselves we turned again round another winding of the valley and crossed a brook i considered it my duty to make myself acquainted with the local names what was the brook called it was called the cockshoot and the great hill here on my right it was called the overblow five minutes more and we saw our first houselonely and littlebuilt of mortar and flint from the hills a name to this also certainly name of browndown another ten minutes of walking involving us more and more deeply in the mysterious green windings of the valleyand the great event of the day happened at last finchs boy pointed before him with his whip and said even at this supreme moment still in three monosyllabic words  here we be  so this is dimchurch i shake out the chalkdust from the skirts of my dress i long quite vainly for the least bit of lookingglass to see myself in here is the population to the number of at least five or six gathered together informed by the scoutsand it is my womans business to produce the best impression of myself that i can we advance along the little road i smile upon the population the population stares at me in return on one side i remark three or four cottages and a bit of open ground also an inn named the crosshands and a bit more of open ground also a tiny tiny butchers shop with sanguinary insides of sheep on one blue piedish in the window and no other meat than that and nothing to see beyond but again the open ground and again the hills indicating the end of the village this side on the other side there appears for some distance nothing but a long flint wall guarding the outhouses of a farm beyond this comes another little group of cottages with the seal of civilization set on them in the form of a postoffice the postoffice deals in general commoditiesin boots and bacon biscuits and flannel crinoline petticoats and religious tracts farther on behold another flint wall a garden and a private dwellinghouse proclaiming itself as the rectory farther yet on rising ground a little desolate church with a tiny white circular steeple topped by an extinguisher in red tiles beyond this the hills and the heavens once more and there is dimchurch  as for the inhabitantswhat am i to say i suppose i must tell the truth  i remarked one born gentleman among the inhabitants and he was a sheepdog he alone did the honors of the place he had a stump of a tail which he wagged at me with extreme difficulty and a good honest white and black face which he poked companionably into my hand welcome madame pratolungo to dimchurch and excuse these male and female laborers who stand and stare at you the good god who makes us all has made them too but has not succeeded so well as with you and me i happen to be one of the few people who can read dogs language as written in dogs faces i correctly report the language of the gentleman sheepdog on this occasion  we opened the gate of the rectory and passed in so my landvoyage over the south down hills came prosperously to its end    chapter the third  poor miss finch  the rectory resembled in one respect this narrative that i am now writing it was in two parts part the first in front composed of the everlasting flint and mortar of the neighborhood failed to interest me part the second running back at a right angle asserted itself as ancient it had been in its time as i afterwards heard a convent of nuns here were snug little gothic windows and dark ivycovered walls of venerable stone repaired in places at some past period with quaint red bricks i had hoped that i should enter the house by this side of it but no the boyafter appearing to be at a loss what to do with meled the way to a door on the modern side of the building and rang the bell  a slovenly young maidservant admitted me to the house  possibly this person was new to the duty of receiving visitors possibly she was bewildered by a sudden invasion of children in dirty frocks darting out on us in the hall and then darting away again into invisible back regions screeching at the sight of a stranger at any rate she too appeared to be at a loss what to do with me after staring hard at my foreign face she suddenly opened a door in the wall of the passage and admitted me into a small room two more children in dirty frocks darted screaming out of the asylum thus offered to me i mentioned my name as soon as i could make myself heard the maid appeared to be terrified at the length of it i gave her my card the maid took it between a dirty finger and thumblooked at it as if it was some extraordinary natural curiosityturned it round exhibiting correct black impressions in various parts of it of her finger and thumbgave up understanding it in despair and left the room she was stopped outside as i gathered from the sounds by a returning invasion of children in the hall there was whispering there was giggling there was every now and then a loud thump on the door prompted by the children as i supposepushed in by them certainlythe maid suddenly reappeared with a jerk oh if you please come this way she said the invasion of children retreated again up the stairsone of them in possession of my card and waving it in triumph on the first landing we penetrated to the other end of the passage again a door was opened unannounced i entered another and a larger room what did i see  fortune had favored me at last my lucky star had led me to the mistress of the house  i made my best curtsey and found myself confronting a large lighthaired languid lymphatic ladywho had evidently been amusing herself by walking up and down the room at the moment when i appeared if there can be such a thing as a damp womanthis was one there was a humid shine on her colorless white face and an overflow of water in her pale blue eyes her hair was not dressed and her lace cap was all on one side the upper part of her was clothed in a loose jacket of blue merino the lower part was robed in a dimity dressing gown of doubtful white in one hand she held a dirty dogseared book which i at once detected to be a circulating library novel her other hand supported a baby enveloped in flannel sucking at her breast such was my first experience of reverend finchs wifedestined to be also the experience of all aftertime never completely dressed never completely dry always with a baby in one hand and a novel in the othersuch was finchs wife  oh madame pratolungo yes i hope somebody has told miss finch you are here she has her own establishment and manages everything herself have you had a pleasant journey these words were spoken vacantly as if her mind was occupied with something else my first impression of her suggested that she was a weak goodnatured woman and that she must have originally occupied a station in the humbler ranks of life  thank you mrs finch i said i have enjoyed most heartily my journey among your beautiful hills  oh you like the hills excuse my dress i was half an hour late this morning when you lose half an hour in this house you never can pick it up again try how you may i soon discovered that mrs finch was always losing half an hour out of her day and that she never by any chance succeeded in ending it again as she had just told me  i understand madam the cares of a numerous family  ah thats just where it is this was a favorite phrase with mrs finch theres finch he gets up in the morning and goes and works in the garden then theres the washing of the children and the dreadful waste that goes on in the kitchen and finch he comes in without any notice and wants his breakfast and of course i cant leave the baby and half an hour does slip away so easily that how to overtake it again i do assure you i really dont know here the baby began to exhibit symptoms of having taken more maternal nourishment than his infant stomach could comfortably contain i held the novel while mrs finch searched for her handkerchieffirst in her bedgown pocket secondly here there and everywhere in the room  at this interesting moment there was a knock at the door an elderly woman appearedwho offered a most refreshing contrast to the members of the household with whom i had made acquaintance thus far she was neatly dressed and she saluted me with the polite composure of a civilized being  i beg your pardon maam my young lady has only this moment heard of your arrival will you be so kind as to follow me  i turned to mrs finch she had found her handkerchief and had put her overflowing baby to rights again i respectfully handed back the novel thank you said mrs finch i find novels compose my mind do you read novels too remind meand ill lend you this one tomorrow i expressed my acknowledgments and withdrew at the door i look round saluting the lady of the house mrs finch was promenading the room with the baby in one hand and the novel in the other and the dimity bedgown trailing behind her  we ascended the stairs and entered a bare whitewashed passage with drabcolored doors in it leading as i presumed into the sleeping chambers of the house  every door opened as we passed children peeped out at me screamed at me and banged the door to again what family has the present mrs finch i asked the decent elderly woman was obliged to stop and consider including the baby maam and two sets of twins and one seven months child of deficient intellectfourteen in all hearing this i beganthough i consider priests kings and capitalists to be the enemies of the human raceto feel a certain exceptional interest in reverend finch did he never wish that he had been a priest of the roman catholic church mercifully forbidden to marry at all while the question passed through my mind my guide took out a key and opened a heavy oaken door at the further end of the passage  we are obliged to keep the door locked maam she explained or the children would be in and out of our part of the house all day long  after my experience of the children i own i looked at the oaken door with mingled sentiments of gratitude and respect  we turned a corner and found ourselves in the vaulted corridor of the ancient portion of the house  the casement windows on one sidesunk deep in recesseslooked into the garden each recess was filled with groups of flowers in pots on the other side the old wall was gaily decorated with hangings of bright chintz the doors were colored of a creamy white with gilt moldings the brightly ornamented matting under our feet i at once recognized as of south american origin the ceiling above was decorated in delicate pale blue with borderings of flowers nowhere down the whole extent of the place was so much as a single morsel of dark color to be seen anywhere  at the lower end of the corridor a solitary figure in a pure white robe was bending over the flowers in the window this was the blind girl whose dark hours i had come to cheer in the scattered villages of the south downs the simple people added their word of pity to her name and called her compassionatelypoor miss finch as for me i can only think of her by her pretty christian name she is lucilla when my memory dwells on her let me call her lucilla here  when my eyes first rested on her she was picking off the dead leaves from her flowers her delicate ear detected the sound of my strange footstep long before i reached the place at which she was standing she lifted her headand advanced quickly to meet me with a faint flush on her face which came and died away again in a moment i happen to have visited the picture gallery at dresden in former years as she approached me nearer and nearer i was irresistibly reminded of the gem of that superb collectionthe matchless virgin of raphael called the madonna di san sisto the fair broad forehead the peculiar fullness of the flesh between the eyebrow and the eyelid the delicate outline of the lower face the tender sensitive lips the color of the complexion and the hairall reflected with a startling fidelity the lovely creature of the dresden picture the one fatal point at which the resemblance ceased was in the eyes the divinelybeautiful eyes of raphaels virgin were lost in the living likeness of her that confronted me now there was no deformity there was nothing to recoil from in my blind lucilla the poor dim sightless eyes had a faded changeless inexpressive lookand that was all above them below them round them to the very edges of her eyelids there was beauty movement life in themdeath a more charming creaturewith that one sad drawbacki never saw there was no other personal defect in her she had the fine height the wellbalanced figure and the length of the lower limbs which make all a womans movements graceful of themselves her voice was deliciousclear cheerful sympathetic this and her smilewhich added a charm of its own to the beauty of her mouthwon my heart before she had got close enough to me to put her hand in mine ah my dear i said in my headlong way i am so glad to see you the instant the words passed my lips i could have cut my tongue out for reminding her in that brutal manner that she was blind  to my relief she showed no sign of feeling it as i did may i see you in my way she asked gentlyand held up her pretty white hand may i touch your face  i sat down at once on the windowseat the soft rosy tips of her fingers seemed to cover my whole face in an instant three separate times she passed her hand rapidly over me her own face absorbed all the while in breathless attention to what she was about speak again she said suddenly holding her hand over me in suspense i said a few words she stopped me by a kiss no more she exclaimed joyously your voice says to my ears what your face says to my fingers i know i shall like you come in and see the rooms we are going to live in together  as i rose she put her arm round my waistthen instantly drew it away again and shook her fingers impatiently as if something had hurt them  a pin i asked  no no what colored dress have you got on  purple  ah i knew it pray dont wear dark colors i have my own blind horror of anything that is dark dear madame pratolungo wear pretty bright colors to please me she put her arm caressingly round me againround my neck however this time where her hand could rest on my linen collar you will change your dress before dinnerwont you she whispered let me unpack for you and choose which dress i like  the brilliant decorations of the corridor were explained to me now  we entered the rooms her bedroom my bedroom and our sittingroom between the two i was prepared to find them what they proved to beas bright as lookingglasses and gilding and gailycolored ornaments and cheerful knickknacks of all sorts could make them they were more like rooms in my lively native country than rooms in sober colorless england the one thing which i own did still astonish me was that all this sparkling beauty of adornment in lucillas habitation should have been provided for the express gratification of a young lady who could not see experience was yet to show me that the blind can live in their imaginations and have their favorite fancies and illusions like the rest of us  to satisfy lucilla by changing my dark purple dress it was necessary that i should first have my boxes so far as i knew finchs boy had taken my luggage along with the pony to the stables before lucilla could ring the bell to make inquiries my elderly guide who had silently left us while we were talking together in the corridor reappeared followed by the boy and a groom carrying my things these servants also brought with them certain parcels for their young mistress purchased in the town together with a bottle wrapped in fair white paper which looked like a bottle of medicineand which had a part of its own to play in our proceedings later in the day  this is my old nurse said lucilla presenting her attendant to me zillah can do a little of everythingcooking included she has had lessons at a london club you must like zillah madame pratolungo for my sake are your boxes open  she went down on her knees before the boxes as she asked the question no girl with the full use of her eyes could have enjoyed more thoroughly than she did the trivial amusement of unpacking my clothes this time however her wonderful delicacy of touch proved to be at fault of two dresses of mine which happened to be exactly the same in texture though widely different in color she picked out the dark dress as being the light one i saw that i disappointed her sadly when i told her of her mistake the next guess she made however restored the tips of her fingers to their place in her estimation she discovered the stripes in a smart pair of stockings of mine and brightened up directly dont be long dressing she said on leaving me we shall have dinner in half an hour french dishes in honor of your arrival i like a nice dinneri am what you call in your country gourmande see the sad consequence she put one finger to her pretty chin i am getting fat i am threatened with a double chinat two and twenty shocking shocking  so she left me and such was the first impression produced on my mind by poor miss finch    chapter the fourth  twilight view of the man  our nice dinner had long since come to an end we had chattered chattered chatteredas usual with womenall about ourselves the day had declined the setting sun was pouring its last red luster into our pretty sittingroomwhen lucilla started as if she had suddenly remembered something and rang the bell  zillah came in the bottle from the chemists said lucilla i ought to have remembered it hours ago  are you going to take it to susan yourself my dear  i was glad to hear the old nurse address her young lady in that familiar way it was so thoroughly unenglish down with the devilish system of separation between the classes in this countrythat is what i say  yes i am going to take it to susan myself  shall i go with you  no no not the least occasion she turned to me i suppose you are too tired to go out again after your walk on the hills she said  i had dined i had rested i was quite ready to go out again and i said so  lucillas face brightened for some reason of her own she had apparently attached a certain importance to persuading me to go out with her  its only a visit to a poor rheumatic woman in the village she said i have got an embrocation for her and i cant very well send it she is old and obstinate if i take it to her she will believe in the remedy if anybody else takes it she will throw it away i had utterly forgotten her in the interest of our nice long talk shall we get ready  i had hardly closed the door of my bedroom when there was a knock at it lucilla no the old nurse entering on tiptoe with a face of mystery and a finger confidentially placed on her lips  i beg your pardon maam she began in a whisper i think you ought to know that my young lady has a purpose in taking you out with her this evening she is burning with curiositylike all the rest of us for that matter she took me out and used my eyes to see with yesterday evening and they have not satisfied her she is going to try your eyes now  what is miss lucilla so curious about i inquired  its natural enough poor dear pursued the old woman following her own train of thought without the slightest reference to my question we none of us can find out anything about him he usually takes his walk at twilight you are pretty sure to meet him tonight and you will judge for yourself maamwith an innocent young creature like miss lucillawhat it may be best to do  this extraordinary answer set my curiosity in a flame  my good creature i said you forget that i am a stranger i know nothing about it has this mysterious man got a name who is he  as i said that there was another knock at the door zillah whispered eagerly dont tell upon me maam you will see for yourself i only speak for my young ladys good she hobbled away and opened the doorand there was lucilla with her smart garden hat on waiting for me  we went out by our own door into the garden and passing through a gate in the wall entered the village  after the caution which the nurse had given me it was impossible to ask any questions except at the risk of making mischief in our little household on the first day of my joining it i kept my eyes wide open and waited for events i also committed a blunder at startingi offered lucilla my hand to lead her she burst out laughing  my dear madame pratolungo i know my way better than you do i roam all over the neighborhood with nothing to help me but this  she held up a smart ivory walkingcane with a bright silk tassel attached with her cane in one hand and her chemical bottle in the otherand her roguish little hat on the top of her headshe made the quaintest and prettiest picture i had seen for many a long day you shall guide me my dear i saidand took her arm we went on down the village  nothing in the least like a mysterious figure passed us in the twilight the few scattered laboring people whom i had already seen i saw againand that was all lucilla was silentsuspiciously silent as i thought after what zillah had told me she had as i fancied the look of a person who was listening intently arrived at the cottage of the rheumatic woman she stopped and went in while i waited outside the affair of the embrocation was soon over she was out again in a minuteand this time she took my arm of her own accord  shall we go a little farther she said it is so nice and cool at this hour of the evening  her object in view whatever it might be was evidently an object that lay beyond the village in the solemn peaceful twilight we followed the lonely windings of the valley along which i had passed in the morning when we came opposite the little solitary house which i had already learnt to know as browndown i felt her hand unconsciously tighten on my arm aha i said to myself has browndown anything to do with this  does the view look very lonely tonight she asked waving her cane over the scene before us  the true meaning of that question i took to be do you see anybody walking out tonight it was not my business to interpret her meaning before she had thought fit to confide her secret to me to my mind my dear was all i said it is a very beautiful view  she fell silent again and absorbed herself in her own thoughts we turned into a new winding of the valleyand there walking towards us from the opposite direction was a human figure at lastthe figure of a solitary man  as we got nearer to each other i perceived that he was a gentleman dressed in a light shootingjacket and wearing a felt hat of the conical italian shape a little nearerand i saw that he was young nearer stilland i discovered that he was handsome though in rather an effeminate way at the same moment lucilla heard his footstep her color instantly rose and once again i felt her hand tighten involuntarily round my arm good here was the mysterious object of zillahs warning to me found at last  i have and i dont mind acknowledging it an eye for a handsome man i looked at him as he passed us now i solemnly assure you i am not an ugly woman nevertheless as our eyes met i saw the strange gentlemans face suddenly contract with an expression which told me plainly that i had produced a disagreeable impression on him with some difficultyfor my companion was holding my arm and seemed to be disposed to stop altogetheri quickened my pace so as to get by him rapidly showing him i dare say that i thought the change in his face when i looked at him an impertinence on his part however that may be after a momentary interval i heard his step behind the man had turned and had followed us  he came close to me on the opposite side to lucilla and took off his hat  i beg your pardon maam he said you looked at me just now  at the first sound of his voice i felt lucilla start her hand began to tremble on my arm with some sudden agitation inconceivable to me in the double surprise of discovering this and of finding myself charged so abruptly with the offense of looking at a gentleman i suffered the most exceptional of all losses where a woman is concernedthe loss of my tongue  he gave me no time to recover myself he proceeded with what he had to sayspeaking mind in the tone of a perfectly wellbred man with nothing wild in his look and nothing odd in his manner  excuse me if i venture on asking you a very strange question he went on did you happen to be at exeter on the third of last month  i must have been more or less than woman if i had not recovered the use of my tongue now  i never was at exeter in my life sir i answered may i ask on my side why you put the question to me  instead of replying he looked at lucilla  pardon me once more perhaps this young lady  he was plainly on the point of inquiring next whether lucilla had been at exeterwhen he checked himself in the breathless interest which she felt in what was going on she had turned her full face upon him there was still light enough left for her eyes to tell their own sad story in their own mute way as he read the truth in them the mans face changed from the keen look of scrutiny which it had worn thus far to an expression of compassioni had almost said of distress he again took off his hat and bowed to me with the deepest respect  i beg your pardon he said very earnestly i beg the young ladys pardon pray forgive me my strange behavior has its excuseif i could bring myself to explain it you distressed me when you looked at me i cant explain why good evening  he turned away hastily like a man confused and ashamed of himselfand left us i can only repeat that there was nothing strange or flighty in his manner a perfect gentleman in full possession of his sensesthere is the unexaggerated and the just description of him  i looked at lucilla she was standing with her blind face raised to the sky lost in herself like a person wrapped in ecstasy  who is that man i asked  my question brought her down suddenly from heaven to earth oh she said reproachfully i had his voice still in my earsand now i have lost it who is he she added after a moment repeating my question nobody knows tell mewhat is he like is he beautiful he must be beautiful with that voice  is this the first time you have heard his voice i inquired  yes he passed us yesterday when i was out with zillah but he never spoke what is he like do pray tell mewhat is he like  there was a passionate impatience in her tone which warned me not to trifle with her the darkness was coming i thought it wise to propose returning to the house she consented to do anything i liked as long as i consented on my side to describe the unknown man  all the way back i was questioned and crossquestioned till i felt like a witness under skillful examination in a court of law lucilla appeared to be satisfied so far with the results ah she exclaimed letting out the secret which her old nurse had confided to me you can use your eyes zillah could tell me nothing  when we got home again her curiosity took another turn exeter she said considering with herself he mentioned exeter i am like youi never was there what will books tell us about exeter she despatched zillah to the other side of the house for a gazetteer i followed the old woman into the corridor and set her mind at ease in a whisper i have kept what you told me a secret i said the man was out in the twilight as you foresaw i have spoken to him and i am quite as curious as the rest of you get the book  lucilla had to confess the truth infected me with her idea that the gazetteer might help us in interpreting the strangers remarkable question relating to the third of last month and his extraordinary assertion that i had distressed him when i looked at him with the nurse breathless on one side of me and lucilla breathless on the other i opened the book at the letter e and found the place and read aloud these lines as follows  exeter a city and seaport in devonshire formerly the seat of the west saxon kings it has a large foreign and home commerce population 33738 the assizes for devonshire are held at exeter in the spring and summer  is that all asked lucilla  i shut the book and answered like finchs boy in three monosyllabic words  that is all    chapter the fifth  candlelight view of the man  there had been barely light enough left for me to read by zillah lit the candles and drew the curtains the silence which betokens a profound disappointment reigned in the room  who can he be repeated lucilla for the hundredth time and why should your looking at him have distressed him guess madame pratolungo  the last sentence in the gazetteers description of exeter hung a little on my mindin consequence of there being one word in it which i did not quite understandthe word assizes i have i hope shown that i possess a competent knowledge of the english language by this time but my experience fails a little on the side of phrases consecrated to the use of the law i inquired into the meaning of assizes and was informed that it signified movable courts for trying prisoners at given times in various parts of england hearing this i had another of my inspirations i guessed immediately that the interesting stranger was a criminal escaped from the assizes  worthy old zillah started to her feet convinced that i had hit him off as the english saying is to a t mercy preserve us cried the nurse i havent bolted the garden door  she hurried out of the room to defend us from robbery and murder before it was too late i looked at lucilla she was leaning back in her chair with a smile of quiet contempt on her pretty face madame pratolungo she remarked that is the first foolish thing you have said since you have been here  wait a little my dear i rejoined you have declared that nothing is known of this man now you mean by thatnothing which satisfies you he has not dropped down from heaven i suppose the time when he came here must be known also whether he came alone or not also how and where he has found a lodging in the village before i admit that my guess is completely wrong i want to hear what general observation in dimchurch has discovered on the subject of this gentleman how long has he been here  lucilla did not at first appear to be much interested in the purely practical view of the question which i had just placed before her  he has been here a week she answered carelessly  did he come as i came over the hills  yes  with a guide of course  lucilla suddenly sat up in her chair  with his brother she said his twin brother madame pratolungo  i sat up in my chair the appearance of his twinbrother in the story was a complication in itself two criminals escaped from the assizes instead of one  how did they find their way here i asked next  nobody knows  where did they go to when they got here  to the crosshandsthe little publichouse in the village the landlord told zillah he was perfectly astonished at the resemblance between them it was impossible to know which was whichit was wonderful even for twins they arrived early in the day when the taproom was empty and they had a long talk together in private at the end of it they rang for the landlord and asked if he had a bedroom to let in the house you must have seen for yourself that the crosshands is a mere beershop the landlord had a room that he could sparea wretched place not fit for a gentleman to sleep in one of the brothers took the room for all that  what became of the other brother  he went away the same dayvery unwillingly the parting between them was most affecting the brother who spoke to us tonight insisted on itor the other would have refused to leave him they both shed tears  they did worse than that said old zillah reentering the room at the moment i have made all the doors and windows fast downstairs he cant get in now my dear if he tries  what did they do that was worse than crying i inquired  kissed each other said zillah with a look of profound disgust two men foreigners of course  our man is no foreigner i said did they give themselves a name  the landlord asked the one who stayed behind for his name replied lucilla he said it was dubourg  this confirmed me in my belief that i had guessed right dubourg is as common a name in my country as jones or thompson is in englandjust the sort of feigned name that a man in difficulties would give among us was he a criminal countryman of mine no there had been nothing foreign in his accent when he spoke pure englishthere could be no doubt of that and yet he had given a french name had he deliberately insulted my nation yes not content with being stained by innumerable crimes he had added to the list of his atrocitieshe had insulted my nation  well i resumed we have left this undetected ruffian deserted in the publichouse is he there still  bless your heart cried the old nurse he is settled in the neighborhood he has taken browndown  i turned to lucilla browndown belongs to somebody i said hazarding another guess did somebody let it without a reference  browndown belongs to a gentleman at brighton answered lucilla and the gentleman was referred to a wellknown name in londonone of the great city merchants here is the most provoking part of the whole mystery the merchant said i have known mr dubourg from his childhood he has reasons for wishing to live in the strictest retirement i answer for his being an honorable man to whom you can safely let your house more than this i am not authorized to tell you my father knows the landlord of browndown and that is what the reference said to him word for word isnt it provoking the house was let for six months certain the next day it is wretchedly furnished mr dubourg has had several things that he wanted sent from brighton besides the furniture a packingcase from london arrived at the house today it was so strongly nailed up that the carpenter had to be sent for to open it he reports that the case was full of thin plates of gold and silver and it was accompanied by a box of extraordinary tools the use of which was a mystery to the carpenter himself mr dubourg locked up these things in a room at the back of the house and put the key in his pocket he seemed to be pleasedhe whistled a tune and said now we shall do the landlady at the crosshands is our authority for this she does what little cooking he requires and her daughter makes his bed and so on they go to him in the morning and return to the inn in the evening he has no servant with him he is all by himself at night isnt it interesting a mystery in real life it baffles everybody  you must be very strange people my dear i said to make a mystery of such a plain case as this  plain repeated lucilla in amazement  certainly the gold and silver plates and the strange tools and the living in retirement and the sending the servants away at nightall point to the same conclusion my guess is the right one the man is an escaped criminal and his form of crime is coining false money he has been discovered at exeterhe has escaped the officers of justiceand he is now going to begin again here you can do as you please if i happen to want change i wont get it in this neighborhood  lucilla laid herself back in her chair again i could see that she gave me up in the matter of mr dubourg as a person willfully and incorrigibly wrong  a coiner of false money recommended as an honorable man by one of the first merchants in london she exclaimed we do some very eccentric things in england occasionallybut there is a limit to our national madness madame pratolungo and you have reached it shall we have some music  she spoke a little sharply mr dubourg was the hero of her romance she resentedseriously resentedany attempt on my part to lower him in her estimation  i persisted in my unfavorable opinion of him nevertheless the question between us as i might have told her was a question of believing or not believing in the merchant of london to her mind it was a sufficient guarantee of his integrity that he was a rich man to my mind speaking as a good socialist that very circumstance told dead against him a capitalist is a robber of one sort and a coiner is a robber of another sort whether the capitalist recommends the coiner or the coiner the capitalist is all one to me in either case to quote the language of an excellent english play the honest people are the soft easy cushions on which these knaves repose and fatten it was on the tip of my tongue to put this large and liberal view of the subject to lucilla but alas it was easy to see that the poor child was infected by the narrow prejudices of the class amid which she lived how could i find it in my heart to run the risk of a disagreement between us on the first day noit was not to be done i gave the nice pretty blind girl a kiss and we went to the piano together and i put off making a good socialist of lucilla till a more convenient opportunity  we might as well have left the piano unopened the music was a failure  i played my best from mozart to beethoven from beethoven to schubert from schubert to chopin she listened with all the will in the world to be pleased she thanked me again and again she tried at my invitation to play herself choosing the familiar compositions which she knew by ear no the abominable dubourg having got the uppermost place in her mind kept it she tried and tried and triedand could do nothing his voice was still in her earsthe only music which could possess itself of her attention that night i took her place and began to play again she suddenly snatched my hands off the keys is zillah here she whispered i told her zillah had left the room she laid her charming head on my shoulder and sighed hysterically i cant help thinking of him she burst out i am miserable for the first time in my lifeno i am happy for the first time in my life oh what must you think of me i dont know what i am talking about why did you encourage him to speak to us i might never have heard his voice but for you she lifted her head again with a little shiver and composed herself one of her hands wandered here and there over the keys of the piano playing softly his charming voice she whispered dreamily while she played oh his charming voice she paused again her hand dropped from the piano and took mine is this love she said half to herself half to me  my duty as a respectable woman lay clearly before memy duty was to tell her a lie  it is nothing my dear but too much excitement and too much fatigue i said tomorrow you shall be my young lady again tonight you must be only my child come and let me put you to bed  she yielded with a weary sigh ah how lovely she looked in her pretty nightdress on her knees at the bedsidethe innocent afflicted creaturesaying her prayers  i am let me own an equally headlong woman at loving and hating when i had left her for the night i could hardly have felt more tenderly interested in her if she had been really a child of my own you have met with people of my sortunless you are a very forbidding person indeedwho have talked to you in the most confidential manner of all their private affairs on meeting you in a railway carriage or sitting next to you at a tabledh√¥te for myself i believe i shall go on running up sudden friendships with strangers to my dying day infamous dubourg if i could have got into browndown that night i should have liked to have done to him what a mexican maid of mine at the central american period of my career did to her drunken husbandwho was a kind of peddler dealing in whips and sticks she sewed him strongly up one night in the sheet while he lay snoring off his liquor in bed and then she took his whole stockintrade out of the corner of the room and broke it on him to the last article on sale until he was beaten to a jelly from head to foot  not having this resource open to me i sat myself down in my bedroom to considerif the matter of dubourg went any furtherwhat it was my business to do next  i have already mentioned that lucilla and i had idled away the whole afternoon womanlike in talking of ourselves you will best understand what course my reflections took if i here relate the chief particulars which lucilla communicated to me concerning her own singular position in her fathers house    chapter the sixth  a cage of finches  large families areas my experience goesof two sorts we have the families whose members all admire each other and we have the families whose members all detest each other for myself i prefer the second sort their quarrels are their own affair and they have a merit which the first sort are never known to possessthe merit of being sometimes able to see the good qualities of persons who do not possess the advantage of being related to them by blood the families whose members all admire each other are families saturated with insufferable conceit you happen to speak of shakespeare among these people as a type of supreme intellectual capacity a female member of the family will not fail to convey to you that you would have illustrated your meaning far more completely if you had referred her to dear papa you are out walking with a male member of the household and you say of a woman who passes what a charming creature your companion smiles at your simplicity and wonders whether you have ever seen his sister when she is dressed for a ball these are the families who cannot be separated without corresponding with each other every day they read you extracts from their letters and say where is the writer by profession who can equal this they talk of their private affairs in your presenceand appear to think that you ought to be interested too they enjoy their own jokes across you at tableand wonder how it is that you are not amused in domestic circles of this sort the sisters sit habitually on the brothers knees and the husbands inquire into the wives ailments in public as unconcernedly as if they were closeted in their own room when we arrive at a more advanced stage of civilization the state will supply cages for these intolerable people and notices will be posted at the corners of streets beware of number twelve a family in a state of mutual admiration is hung up there  i gathered from lucilla that the finches were of the second order of large families as mentioned above hardly one of the members of this domestic group was on speaking terms with the other and some of them had been separated for years without once troubling her majestys post office to convey even the slightest expression of sentiment from one to the other  the first wife of reverend finch was a miss batchford the members of her family limited at the time of the marriage to her brother and her sister strongly disapproved of her choice of a husband the rank of a finch i laugh at these contemptible distinctions was decided in this case to be not equal to the rank of a batchford nevertheless miss married her brother and sister declined to be present at the ceremony first quarrel  lucilla was born reverend finchs elder brother on speaking terms with no other member of the family interfered with a christian proposalnamelyto shake hands across the babys cradle adopted by the magnanimous batchfords first reconciliation  time passed reverend finchthen officiating in a poor curacy near a great manufacturing townfelt a want the want of money and took a liberty the liberty of attempting to borrow of his brotherinlaw mr batchford being a rich man regarded this overture it is needless to say in the light of an insult miss batchford sided with her brother second quarrel  time passed as before mrs finch the first died reverend finchs elder brother still at daggers drawn with the other members of the family made a second christian proposalnamelyto shake hands across the wifes grave adopted once more by the bereaved batchfords second reconciliation  another lapse of time reverend finch left a widower with one daughter became personally acquainted with an inhabitant of the great city near which he ministered who was also a widower with one daughter the status of the parent in this casesocialpoliticalreligiouswas shoemakerradicalbaptist reverend finch still wanting money swallowed it all and married the daughter with a dowry of three thousand pounds this proceeding alienated from him for ever not the batchfords only but the peacemaking elder brother as well that excellent christian ceased to be on speaking terms now with his brother the clergyman as well as with all the rest of the family the complete isolation of reverend finch followed regularly every year did the second mrs finch afford opportunities of shaking hands not only over one cradle but sometimes over two vain and meritorious fertility nothing came of it but a kind of compromise lucilla quite overlooked among the rectors rapidlyincreasing second family was allowed to visit her maternal uncle and aunt at stated periods in every year born to all appearance with the full possession of her sight the poor child had become incurably blind before she was a year old in all other respects she presented a striking resemblance to her mother bachelor uncle batchford and his old maiden sister both conceived the strongest affection for the child our niece lucilla they said has justified our fondest hopesshe is a batchford not a finch lucillas father promoted by this time to the rectory of dimchurch let them talk wait a bit and money will come of it was all he said truly money was wantedwith fruitful mrs finch multiplying cradles year after year till the doctor himself employed on contract got tired of it and said one day it is not true that there is an end to everything there is no end to the multiplying capacity of mrs finch  lucilla grew up from childhood to womanhood she was twenty years old before her fathers expectations were realized and the money came of it at last  uncle batchford died a single man he divided his fortune between his maiden sister and his niece when she came of age lucilla was to have an income of fifteen hundred pounds a yearon certain conditions which the will set forth at great length the effect of these conditions was first to render it absolutely impossible for reverend finch under any circumstances whatever to legally inherit a single farthing of the moneyand secondly to detach lucilla from her fathers household and to place her under the care of her maiden aunt so long as she remained unmarried for a period of three months in every year  the will avowed the object of this last condition in the plainest words i die as i have lived wrote uncle batchford a high churchman and a tory my legacy to my niece shall only take effect on these termsnamelythat she shall be removed at certain stated periods from the dissenting and radical influences to which she is subjected under her fathers roof and shall be placed under the care of an english gentlewoman who unites to the advantages of birth and breeding the possession of high and honorable principlesetcetera etcetera can you conceive reverend finchs feelings sitting with his daughter by his side among the company while the will was read and hearing this he got up like a true englishman and made them a speech ladies and gentlemen he said i admit that i am a liberal in politics and that my wifes family are dissenters as an example of the principles thus engendered in my household i beg to inform you that my daughter accepts this legacy with my full permission and that i forgive mr batchford with that he walked out with his daughter on his arm he had heard enough please to observe to satisfy him that lucilla while she lived unmarried could do what she liked with her income before they had got back to dimchurch reverend finch had completed a domestic arrangement which permitted his daughter to occupy a perfectly independent position in the rectory and which placed in her fathers pocketsas miss finchs contribution to the housekeepingfive hundred a year  do you know what i felt when i heard this i felt the deepest regret that finch of the liberal principles had not made a third with my poor pratolungo and me in central america with him to advise us we should have saved the sacred cause of freedom without spending a single farthing on it  the old side of the rectory hitherto uninhabited was put in order and furnishedof course at lucillas expense on her twentyfirst birthday the repairs were completed the first installment of the housekeeping money was paid and the daughter was established as an independent lodger in her own fathers house  in order to thoroughly appreciate finchs ingenuity it is necessary to add here that lucilla had shown as she grew up an increasing dislike of living at home in her blind state the endless turmoil of the children distracted her she and her stepmother did not possess a single sympathy in common her relations with her father were in much the same condition she could compassionate his poverty and she could treat him with the forbearance and respect due to him from his child as to really venerating and loving himthe less said about that the better her happiest days had been the days she spent with her uncle and aunt her visits to the batchfords had grown to be longer and longer visits with every succeeding year if the father in appealing to the daughters sympathies had not dexterously contrived to unite the preservation of her independence with the continuance of her residence under his roof she would on coming of age either have lived altogether with her aunt or have set up an establishment of her own as it was the rector had secured his five hundred a year on terms acceptable to both sidesand more than that he had got her safe under his own eye for remark there was one terrible possibility threatening him in the futurethe possibility of lucillas marriage  such was the strange domestic position of this interesting creature at the time when i entered the house  you will now understand how completely puzzled i was when i recalled what had happened on the evening of my arrival and when i asked myselfin the matter of the mysterious strangerwhat course i was to take next i had found lucilla a solitary beinghelplessly dependent in her blindness on othersand in that sad condition without a mother without a sister without a friend even in whose sympathies she could take refuge in whose advice she could trust i had produced a first favorable impression on her i had won her liking at once as she had won mine i had accompanied her on an evening walk innocent of all suspicion of what was going on in her mind i had by pure accident enabled a stranger to intensify the imaginary interest which she felt in him by provoking him to speak in her hearing for the first time in a moment of hysterical agitationand in sheer despair of knowing who else to confide inthe poor foolish blind lonely girl had opened her heart to me what was i to do  if the case had been an ordinary one the whole affair would have been simply ridiculous  but the case of lucilla was not the case of girls in general  the minds of the blind are by cruel necessity forced inward on themselves they live apart from usah how hopelessly far apartin their own dark sphere of which we know nothing what relief could come to lucilla from the world outside none it was part of her desolate liberty to be free to dwell unremittingly on the ideal creature of her own dream within the narrow limit of the one impression that it had been possible for her to derive of this manthe impression of the beauty of his voiceher fancy was left to work unrestrained in the changeless darkness of her life what a picture i shudder as i draw it oh yes it is easy i know to look at it the other wayto laugh at the folly of a girl who first excites her imagination about a total stranger and then when she hears him speak falls in love with his voice but add that the girl is blind that the girl lives habitually in the world of her own imagination that the girl has nobody at home who can exercise a wholesome influence over her is there nothing pitiable in such a state of things as this for myself though i come of a lighthearted nation that laughs at everythingi saw my own face looking horribly grave and old as i sat before the glass that night brushing my hair  i looked at my bed bah what was the use of going to bed she was her own mistress she was perfectly free to take her next walk to browndown alone and to place herself for all i knew to the contrary at the mercy of a dishonorable and designing man what was i only her companion i had no right to interfereand yet if anything happened i should be blamed it is so easy to say you ought to have done something whom could i consult the worthy old nurse only held the position of servant could i address myself to the lymphatic lady with the baby in one hand and the novel in the other absurd her stepmother was not to be thought of her father judging by hearsay i had not derived a favorable impression of the capacity of reverend finch for interfering successfully in a matter of this sort however he was her father and i could feel my way cautiously with him at first hearing zillah moving about the corridor i went out to her in the course of a little gossip i introduced the name of the master of the house how was it i had not seen him yet for an excellent reason he had gone to visit a friend at brighton it was then tuesday he was expected back on sermondaythat is to say on saturday in the same week  i returned to my room a little out of temper in this state my mind works with wonderful freedom i had another of my inspirations mr dubourg had taken the liberty of speaking to me that evening good i determined to go alone to browndown the next morning and take the liberty of speaking to mr dubourg  was this resolution solely inspired by my interest in lucilla or had my own curiosity been all the time working under the surface and influencing the course of my reflections unknown to myself i went to bed without inquiring i recommend you to go to bed without inquiring too    chapter the seventh  daylight view of the man  when i put out my candle that night i made a mistakei trusted entirely to myself to wake in good time in the morning i ought to have told zillah to call me  hours passed before i could close my eyes it was broken rest when it came until the day dawned then i fell asleep at last in good earnest when i woke and looked at my watch i was amazed to find that it was ten oclock  i jumped out of bed and rang for the old nurse was lucilla at home no she had gone out for a little walk by herself yesby herself in what direction up the valley towards browndown  i instantly arrived at my own conclusion  she had got the start of methanks to my laziness in sleeping away the precious hours of the morning in bed the one thing to do was to follow her as speedily as possible in half an hour more i was out for a little walk by myselfand what do you think my direction also was up the valley towards browndown  a pastoral solitude reigned round the lonely little house i went on beyond it into the next winding of the valley not a human creature was to be seen i returned to browndown to reconnoiter ascending the rising ground on which the house was built i approached it from the back the windows were all open i listened do you suppose i felt scruples in such an emergency as this oh pooh pooh who but a fool would have felt anything of the sort i listened with both my ears through a window at the side of the house i heard the sound of voices advancing noiselessly on the turf i heard the voice of dubourg he was answered by a woman aha i had caught her lucilla herself  wonderful i heard him say i believe you have eyes in the ends of your fingers take this nowand try if you can tell me what it is  a little vase she answeredspeaking i give you my word of honor as composedly as if she had known him for years wait what metal is it silver no gold did you really make this yourself as well as the box  yes it is an odd taste of mineisnt itto be fond of chasing in gold and silver years ago i met with a man in italy who taught me it amused me thenand it amuses me now when i was recovering from an illness last spring i shaped that vase out of the plain metal and made the ornaments on it  another mystery revealed she exclaimed now i know what you wanted with those gold and silver plates that came to you from london are you aware of what a character you have got here there are some of us who suspect you of coining false money  they both burst out laughing as gaily as a couple of children i declare i wished myself one of the party but no i had my duty to do as a respectable woman my duty was to steal a little nearer and see if any familiarities were passing between these two merry young people one half of the open window was sheltered on the outer side by a venetian blind i stood behind the blind and peeped in duty oh dear me painful but necessary duty dubourg was sitting with his back to the window lucilla faced me opposite to him her cheeks were flushed with pleasure she held in her lap a pretty little golden vase her clever fingers were passing over it rapidly exactly as they had passed the previous evening over my face  shall i tell you what the pattern is on your vase she went on  can you really do that  you shall judge for yourself the pattern is made of leaves with birds placed among them at intervals stop i think i have felt leaves like these on the old side of the rectory against the wall ivy  amazing it is ivy  the birds she resumed i shant be satisfied till i have told you what the birds are havent i got silver birds like themonly much largerfor holding pepper and mustard and sugar and so on owls she exclaimed with a cry of triumph little owls sitting in ivynests what a delightful pattern i never heard of anything like it before  keep the vase he said you will honor me you will delight me if you will keep the vase  she rose and shook her headwithout giving him back the vase however  i might take it if you were not a stranger she said why dont you tell us who you are and what your reason is for living all by yourself in this dull place  he stood before her with his head down and sighed bitterly  i know i ought to explain myself he answered i cant be surprised if people are suspicious of me he paused and added very earnestly i cant tell it to you oh nonot to you  why not  dont ask me  she felt for the table with her ivory cane and put the vase down on itvery unwillingly  good morning mr dubourg she said  he opened the door of the room for her in silence waiting close against the side of the house i saw them appear under the porch and cross the little walled enclosure in front as she stepped out on the open turf beyond she turned and spoke to him again  if you wont tell me your secret she said will you tell it to some one else will you tell it to a friend of mine  to what friend he asked  to the lady whom you met with me last night  he hesitated i am afraid i offended the lady he said  so much the more reason for your explaining yourself she rejoined if you will only satisfy her i might ask you to come and see usi might even take the vase with that strong hint she actually gave him her hand at parting her perfect selfpossession her easy familiarity with this strangerso bold and yet so innocentpetrified me i shall send my friend to you this morning she said imperiously striking her cane on the turf i insist on your telling her the whole truth  with that she signed to him that he was to follow her no farther and went her way back to the village  does it not surprise you as it surprised me instead of her blindness making her nervous in the presence of a man unknown to her it appeared to have exactly the contrary effect it made her fearless  he stood on the spot where she had left him watching her as she receded in the distance his manner towards her in the house and out of the house had exhibited it is only fair to say the utmost consideration and respect whatever shyness there had been between them was shyness entirely on his side i had a short stuff dress on which made no noise over the grass i skirted the wall of the enclosure and approached him unsuspected from behind the charming creature he said to himself still following her with his eyes as the words passed his lips i struck him smartly on the shoulder with my parasol  mr dubourg i said i am waiting to hear the truth  he started violentlyand confronted me in speechless dismay his color coming and going like the color of a young girl anybody who understands women will understand that this behavior on his part far from softening me towards him only encouraged me to bully him  in your present position in this place sir i went on do you think it honorable conduct on your part to decoy a young lady to whom you are a perfect stranger into your housea young lady who claims in right of her sad affliction even more than the usual forbearance and respect which a gentleman owes to her sex  his shifting color settled for the time into an angry red  you are doing me a great injustice maam he answered it is a shame to say that i have failed in respect to the young lady i feel the sincerest admiration and compassion for her circumstances justify me in what i have done i could not have acted otherwise i refer you to the young lady herself  his voice rose higher and higherhe was thoroughly offended with me need i add seeing the prospect not far off of his bullying me that i unblushingly shifted my ground and tried a little civility next  if i have done you an injustice sir i ask your pardon i answered having said so much i have only to add that i shall be satisfied if i hear what the circumstances are from yourself  this soothed his offended dignity his gentler manner began to show itself again  the truth is he said that i owe my introduction to the young lady to an illtempered little dog belonging to the people at the inn the dog had followed the person here who attends on me and it startled the lady by flying out and barking at her as she passed this house after i had driven away the dog i begged her to come in and sit down until she had recovered herself am i to blame for doing that i dont deny that i felt the deepest interest in her and that i did my best to amuse her while she honored me by remaining in my house may i ask if i have satisfied you  with the best will in the world to maintain my unfavorable opinion of him i was by this time fairly forced to acknowledge to myself that the opinion was wrong his explanation was in tone and manner as well as in language the explanation of a gentleman  and besidesthough he was a little too effeminate for my tastehe really was such a handsome young man his hair was of a fine bright chestnut color with a natural curl in it his eyes were of the lightest brown i had ever seenwith a singularly winning gentle modest expression in them as for his complexionso creamy and spotless and fairhe had no right to it it ought to have been a womans complexion or at least a boys he looked indeed more like a boy than a man his smooth face was quite uncovered either by beard whisker or mustache if he had asked me i should have guessed him though he was really three years older to have been younger than lucilla  our acquaintance has begun rather oddly sir i said you spoke strangely to me last night and i have spoken hastily to you this morning accept my excusesand let us try if we cant do each other justice in the end i have something more to say to you before we part will you think me a very extraordinary woman if i suggest that you may as well invite me next to take a chair in your house  he laughed with the pleasantest good temper and led the way in  we entered the room in which he had received lucilla and sat down together on the two chairs near the windowwith this differencethat i contrived to possess myself of the seat which he had occupied and so to place him with his face to the light  mr dubourg i began you will already have guessed that i overheard what miss finch said to you at parting  he bowed in silent acknowledgment that it was soand began to toy nervously with the gold vase which lucilla had left on the table  what do you propose to do i went on you have spoken of the interest you feel in my young friend if it is a true interest it will lead you to merit her good opinion by complying with her request tell me plainly if you please will you come and see us in the character of a gentleman who has satisfied two ladies that they can receive him as a neighbor and a friend or will you oblige me to warn the rector of dimchurch that his daughter is in danger of permitting a doubtful character to force his acquaintance on her  he put the vase back on the table and turned deadly pale  if you knew what i have suffered he said if you had gone through what i have been compelled to endure his voice failed him his soft brown eyes moistened his head drooped he said no more  in common with all women i like a man to be a man there was to my mind something weak and womanish in the manner in which this dubourg met the advance which i had made to him he not only failed to move my pityhe was in danger of stirring up my contempt  i too have suffered i answered i too have been compelled to endure but there is this difference between us my courage is not worn out in your place if i knew myself to be an honorable man i would not allow the breath of suspicion to rest on me for an instant cost what it might i would vindicate myself i should be ashamed to cryi should speak  that stung him he started up on his feet  have you been stared at by hundreds of cruel eyes he burst out passionately have you been pointed at without mercy wherever you go have you been put in the pillory of the newspapers has the photograph proclaimed your infamous notoriety in all the shopwindows he dropped back into his chair and wrung his hands in a frenzy oh the public he exclaimed the horrible public i cant get away from themi cant hide myself even here you have had your stare at me like the rest he cried turning on me fiercely i knew it when you passed me last night  i never saw you out of this place i answered as for the portraits of you whoever you may be i know nothing about them i was far too anxious and too wretched to amuse myself by looking into shopwindows before i came here you and your name are equally strange to me if you have any respect for yourself tell me who you are out with the truth sir you know as well as i do that you have gone too far to stop  i seized him by the hand i was wrought up by the extraordinary outburst that had escaped him to the highest pitch of excitement i was hardly conscious of what i said or did at that supreme moment we enraged we maddened each other his hand closed convulsively on my hand his eyes looked wildly into mine  do you read the newspapers he asked  yes  have you seen  i have not seen the name of dubourg  my name is not dubourg  what is it  he suddenly stooped over me and whispered his name in my ear  in my turn i started thunderstruck to my feet  good god i cried you are the man who was tried for murder last month and who was all but hanged on the false testimony of a clock    chapter the eighth  the perjury of the clock  we looked at one another in silence both alike we were obliged to wait a little and recover ourselves  i may occupy the interval by answering two questions which will arise in your minds in this place how did dubourg come to be tried for his life and what was the connection between this serious matter and the false testimony of a clock  the reply to both these inquiries is to be found in the story which i call the perjury of the clock  in briefly relating this curious incidental narrative which i take from a statement of the circumstances placed in my possession i shall speak of our new acquaintance at browndownand shall continue to speak of him throughout these pagesby his assumed name in the first place it was the maiden name of his mother and he had a right to take it if he pleased in the second place the date of our domestic drama at dimchurch goes back as far as the years fiftyeight and fiftynine and real names are now that it is all over of no consequence to anybody with dubourg we have begun with dubourg let us go on to the end  on a summer evening some years ago a man was found murdered in a field near a certain town in the west of england the name of the field was pardons piece  the man was a small carpenter and builder in the town who bore an indifferent character on the evening in question a distant relative of his employed as farmbailiff by a gentleman in the neighborhood happened to be passing a stile which led from the field into a road and saw a gentleman leaving the field by way of this stile rather in a hurry he recognized the gentleman as mr dubourg  the two passed each other on the road in opposite directions after a certain lapse of timeestimated as being half an hourthe farmbailiff had occasion to pass back along the same road on reaching the stile he heard an alarm raised and entered the field to see what was the matter he found several persons running from the farther side of pardons piece towards a boy who was standing at the back of a cattleshed in a remote part of the enclosure screaming with terror at the boys feet lay face downwards the dead body of a man with his head horribly beaten in his watch was under him hanging out of his pocket by the chain it had stoppedevidently in consequence of the concussion of its owners fall on itat halfpast eight the body was still warm all the other valuables like the watch were left on it the farmbailiff instantly recognized the man as the carpenter and builder mentioned above  at the preliminary inquiry the stoppage of the watch at halfpast eight was taken as offering good circumstantial evidence that the blow which had killed the man had been struck at that time  the next question wasif any one had been seen near the body at halfpast eight the farmbailiff declared that he had met mr dubourg hastily leaving the field by the stile at that very time asked if he had looked at his watch he owned that he had not done so certain previous circumstances which he mentioned as having impressed themselves on his memory enabled him to feel sure of the truth of his assertion without having consulted his watch he was pressed on this important point but he held to his declaration at halfpast eight he had seen mr dubourg hurriedly leave the field at halfpast eight the watch of the murdered man had stopped  had any other person been observed in or near the field at that time  no witness could be discovered who had seen anybody else near the place had the weapon turned up with which the blow had been struck it had not been found was anyone known robbery having plainly not been the motive of the crime to have entertained a grudge against the murdered man it was no secret that he associated with doubtful characters male and female but suspicion failed to point to any one of them in particular  in this state of things there was no alternative but to request mr dubourgwell known in and out of the town as a young gentleman of independent fortune bearing an excellent characterto give some account of himself  he immediately admitted that he had passed through the field but in contradiction to the farmbailiff he declared that he had looked at his watch at the moment before he crossed the stile and that the time by it was exactly a quarter past eight five minutes laterthat is to say ten minutes before the murder had been committed on the evidence of the dead mans watchhe had paid a visit to a lady living near pardons piece and had remained with her until his watch consulted once more on leaving the ladys house informed him that it was a quarter to nine  here was the defense called an alibi it entirely satisfied mr dubourgs friends to satisfy justice also it was necessary to call the lady as a witness in the meantime another purely formal question was put to mr dubourg did he know anything of the murdered man  with some appearance of confusion mr dubourg admitted that he had been induced by a friend to employ the man on some work further interrogation extracted from him the following statement of facts  that the work had been very badly donethat an exorbitant price had been charged for itthat the man on being remonstrated with had behaved in a grossly impertinent mannerthat an altercation had taken place between themthat mr dubourg had seized the man by the collar of his coat and had turned him out of the housethat he had called the man an infernal scoundrel being in a passion at the time and had threatened to thrash him within an inch of his life or words to that effect if he ever presumed to come near the house again that he had sincerely regretted his own violence the moment he recovered his selfpossession and lastly that on his oath the altercation having occurred six weeks ago he had never spoken to the man or set eyes on the man since  as the matter then stood these circumstances were considered as being unfortunate circumstances for mr dubourgnothing more he had his alibi to appeal to and his character to appeal to and nobody doubted the result  the lady appeared as witness  confronted with mr dubourg on the question of time and forced to answer she absolutely contradicted him on the testimony of the clock on her own mantelpiece in substance her evidence was simply this she had looked at her clock when mr dubourg entered the room thinking it rather a late hour for a visitor to call on her the clock regulated by the maker only the day before pointed to twentyfive minutes to nine practical experiment showed that the time required to walk the distance at a rapid pace from the stile to the ladys house was just five minutes here then was the statement of the farmbailiff himself a respectable witness corroborated by another witness of excellent position and character the clock on being examined next was found to be right the evidence of the clockmaker proved that he kept the key and that there had been no necessity to set the clock and wind it up again since he had performed both those acts on the day preceding mr dubourgs visit the accuracy of the clock thus vouched for the conclusion on the evidence was irresistible mr dubourg stood convicted of having been in the field at the time when the murder was committed of having by his own admission had a quarrel with the murdered man not long before terminating in an assault and a threat on his side and lastly of having attempted to set up an alibi by a false statement of the question of time there was no alternative but to commit him to take his trial at the assizes charged with the murder of the builder in pardons piece  the trial occupied two days  no new facts of importance were discovered in the interval the evidence followed the course which it had taken at the preliminary examinationswith this difference only that it was more carefully sifted mr dubourg had the double advantage of securing the services of the leading barrister on the circuit and of moving the irrepressible sympathies of the jury shocked at his position and eager for proof of his innocence by the end of the first day the evidence had told against him with such irresistible force that his own counsel despaired of the result when the prisoner took his place in the dock on the second day there was but one conviction in the minds of the people in courteverybody said the clock will hang him  it was nearly two in the afternoon and the proceedings were on the point of being adjourned for half an hour when the attorney for the prisoner was seen to hand a paper to the counsel for the defense  the counsel rose showing signs of agitation which roused the curiosity of the audience he demanded the immediate hearing of a new witness whose evidence in the prisoners favor he declared to be too important to be delayed for a single moment after a short colloquy between the judge and the banisters on either side the court decided to continue the sitting  the witness appearing in the box proved to be a young woman in delicate health on the evening when the prisoner had paid his visit to the lady she was in that ladys service as housemaid the day after she had been permitted by previous arrangement with her mistress to take a weeks holiday and to go on a visit to her parents in the west of cornwall while there she had fallen ill and had not been strong enough since to return to her employment having given this preliminary account of herself the housemaid then stated the following extraordinary particulars in relation to her mistresss clock  on the morning of the day when mr dubourg had called at the house she had been cleaning the mantelpiece she had rubbed the part of it which was under the clock with her duster had accidentally struck the pendulum and had stopped it having once before done this she had been severely reproved fearing that a repetition of the offense only the day after the clock had been regulated by the maker might lead perhaps to the withdrawal of her leave of absence she had determined to put matters right again if possible by herself  after poking under the clock in the dark and failing to set the pendulum going again properly in that way she next attempted to lift the clock and give it a shake it was set in a marble case with a bronze figure on the top and it was so heavy that she was obliged to hunt for something which she could use as a lever the thing proved to be not easy to find on the spur of the moment having at last laid her hand on what she wanted she contrived so to lift the clock a few inches and drop it again on the mantelpiece as to set it going once more  the next necessity was of course to move the hands on here again she was met by an obstacle there was a difficulty in opening the glasscase which protected the dial after uselessly searching for some instrument to help her she got from the footman without telling him what she wanted it for a small chisel with this she opened the caseafter accidentally scratching the brass frame of itand set the hands of the clock by guess she was flurried at the time fearing that her mistress would discover her later in the day she found that she had overestimated the interval of time that had passed while she was trying to put the clock right she had in fact set it exactly a quarter of an hour too fast  no safe opportunity of secretly putting the clock right again had occurred until the last thing at night she had then moved the hands back to the right time at the hour of the evening when mr dubourg had called on her mistress she positively swore that the clock was a quarter of an hour too fast it had pointed as her mistress had declared to twentyfive minutes to ninethe right time then being as mr dubourg had asserted twenty minutes past eight  questioned why she had refrained from giving this extraordinary evidence at the inquiry before the magistrate she declared that in the remote cornish village to which she had gone the next day and in which her illness had detained her from that time nobody had heard of the inquiry or the trial she would not have been then present to state the vitally important circumstances to which she had just sworn if the prisoners twinbrother had not found her out on the previous dayhad not questioned her if she knew anything about the clockand had not hearing what she had to tell insisted on her taking the journey with him to the court the next morning  this evidence virtually decided the trial there was a great burst of relief in the crowded assembly when the womans statement had come to an end  she was closely crossexamined as a matter of course her character was inquired into corroborative evidence relating to the chisel and the scratches on the frame was sought for and was obtained the end of it was that at a late hour on the second evening the jury acquitted the prisoner without leaving their box it was not too much to say that his life had been saved by his brother his brother alone had persisted from first to last in obstinately disbelieving the clockfor no better reason than that the clock was the witness which asserted the prisoners guilt he had worried everybody with incessant inquirieshe had discovered the absence of the housemaid after the trial had begunand he had started off to interrogate the girl knowing nothing and suspecting nothing simply determined to persist in the one everlasting question with which he persecuted everybody belonging to the house the clock is going to hang my brother can you tell me anything about the clock  four months later the mystery of the crime was cleared up one of the disreputable companions of the murdered man confessed on his deathbed that he had done the deed there was nothing interesting or remarkable in the circumstances chance which had put innocence in peril had offered impunity to guilt an infamous woman a jealous quarrel and an absence at the moment of witnesses on the spotthese were really the commonplace materials which had composed the tragedy of pardons piece    chapter the ninth  the hero of the trial  you have forced it out of me now you have had your way never mind my feelingsgo  those were the first words the hero of the trial said to me when he was able to speak again he withdrew with a curious sullen resignation to the farther end of the room there he stood looking at me as a man might have looked who carried some contagion about him and who wished to preserve a healthy fellowcreature from the peril of touching him  why should i go i asked  you are a bold woman he said to remain in the same room with a man who has been pointed at as a murderer and who has been tried for his life  the same unhealthy state of mind which had brought him to dimchurch and which had led him to speak to me as he had spoken on the previous evening was as i understood it now irritating him against me as a person who had made his own quick temper the means of entrapping him into letting out the truth how was i to deal with a man in this condition i decided to perform the feat which you call in england taking the bull by the horns  i see but one man here i said a man honorably acquitted of a crime which he was incapable of committing a man who deserves my interest and claims my sympathy shake hands mr dubourg  i spoke to him in a good hearty voice and i gave him a good hearty squeeze the poor weak lonely persecuted young fellow dropped his head on my shoulder like a child and burst out crying  dont despise me he said as soon as he had got his breath again it breaks a man down to have stood in the dock and to have had hundreds of hardhearted people staring at him in horrorwithout his deserving it besides i have been very lonely maam since my brother left me  we sat down again side by side he was the strangest compound of anomalies i had ever met with throw him into one of those passions in which he flamed out so easilyand you would have said this is a tiger wait till he had cooled down again to his customary mild temperatureand you would have said with equal truth this is a lamb  one thing rather surprises me mr dubourg i went on i cant quite understand  dont call me mr dubourg he interposed you remind me of the disgrace which has forced me to change my name call me by my christian name its a foreign name you are a foreigner by your accentyou will like me all the better for having a foreign name i was christened oscarafter my mothers brother my mother was a jersey woman call me oscarwhat is it you dont understand  in your present situation i resumed i dont understand your brother leaving you here all by yourself  he was on the point of flaming out again at that  not a word against my brother he exclaimed fiercely my brother is the noblest creature that god ever created you must own that yourselfyou know what he did at the trial i should have died on the scaffold but for that angel i insist on it that he is not a man he is an angel  i admitted that his brother was an angel the concession instantly pacified him  people say there is no difference between us he went on drawing his chair companionably close to mine ah people are so shallow personally i grant you we are exactly alike you have heard that we are twins but there it ends unfortunately for me nugentmy brother was christened nugent after my fathernugent is a hero nugent is a genius i should have died if he hadnt taken care of me after the trial i had nobody but him we are orphans we have no brothers or sisters nugent felt the disgrace even more than i felt itbut he could control himself it fell more heavily on him than it did on me ill tell you why nugent was in a fair way to make our family namethe name that we have been obliged to dropfamous all over the world he is a paintera landscape painter have you never heard of him ah you soon will where do you think he has gone to he has gone to the wilds of america in search of new subjects he is going to found a school of landscape painting on an immense scale a scale that has never been attempted yet dear fellow shall i tell you what he said when he left me here noble wordsi call them noble words oscar i go to make our assumed name famous you shall be honorably knownyou shall be illustrious as the brother of nugent dubourg do you think i could stand in the way of such a career as that after what he has sacrificed for me could i let such a man stagnate herefor no better purpose than to keep me company what does it matter about my feeling lonely who am i oh if you had seen how he bore with the horrible notoriety that followed us after the trial he was constantly stared at and pointed at for me not a word of complaint escaped him he snapped his fingers at it that for public opinion he said what strength of mindeh from one place after another we moved and moved and still there were the photographs and the newspapers and the whole infamous story romance in real life they called it known beforehand to everybody he never lost heart we shall find a place yet that was the cheerful way he put it you have nothing to do with it oscar you are safe in my hands i promise you exactly the place of refuge you want it was he who got all the information and found out this lonely part of england where you live i thought it pretty as we wandered about the hillsit wasnt half grand enough for him we lost ourselves i began to feel nervous he didnt mind it a bit you have me with you he said my luck is always to be depended on mark what i say we shall stumble on a village you will hardly believe mein ten minutes more we stumbled exactly as he had foretold on this place he didnt leave mewhen i had prevailed on him to gowithout a recommendation he recommended me to the landlord of the inn here he said my brother is delicate my brother wishes to live in retirement you will oblige me by looking after my brother wasnt it kind the landlord seemed to be quite affected by it nugent cried when he took leave of me ah what would i not give to have a heart like his and a mind like his its somethingisnt itto have a face like him i often say that to myself when i look in the glass excuse my running on in this way when i once begin to talk of nugent i dont know when to leave off  one thing at any rate was plainly discernible in this otherwise inscrutable young man he adored his twinbrother  it would have been equally clear to me that mr nugent dubourg deserved to be worshipped if i could have reconciled to my mind his leaving his brother to shift for himself in such a place as dimchurch i was obliged to remind myself of the admirable service which he had rendered at the trial before i could decide to do him the justice of suspending my opinion of him in his absence having accomplished this act of magnanimity i took advantage of the first opportunity to change the subject the most tiresome information that i am acquainted with is the information which tells us of the virtues of an absent personwhen that absent person happens to be a stranger  is it true that you have taken browndown for six months i asked are you really going to settle at dimchurch  yesif you keep my secret he answered the people here know nothing about me dont pray dont tell them who i am you will drive me away if you do  i must tell miss finch who you are i said  no no no he exclaimed eagerly i cant bear the idea of her knowing it i have been so horribly degraded what will she think of me he burst into another explosion of rhapsodies on the subject of lucillamixed up with renewed petitions to me to keep his story concealed from everybody i lost all patience with his want of common fortitude and common sense  young oscar i should like to box your ears i said you are in a villainously unwholesome state about this matter have you nothing else to think of have you no profession are you not obliged to work for your living  i spoke as you perceive with some force of expressionaided by a corresponding asperity of voice and manner  mr oscar dubourg looked at me with the puzzled air of a man who feels an overflow of new ideas forcing itself into his mind he modestly admitted the degrading truth from his childhood upwards he had only to put his hand in his pocket and to find the money there without any preliminary necessity of earning it first his father had been a fashionable portraitpainter and had married one of his sittersan heiress oscar and nugent had been left in the detestable position of independent gentlemen the dignity of labor was a dignity unknown to these degraded young men i despise a wealthy idler i said to oscar with my republican severity you want the ennobling influence of labor to make a man of you nobody has a right to be idlenobody has a right to be rich you would be in a more wholesome state of mind about yourself my young gentleman if you had to earn your bread and cheese before you ate it  he stared at me piteously the noble sentiments which i had inherited from doctor pratolungo completely bewildered mr oscar dubourg  dont be angry with me he said in his innocent way i couldnt eat my cheese if i did earn it i cant digest cheese besides i employ myself as much as i can he took his little golden vase from the table behind him and told me what i had already heard him tell lucilla while i was listening at the window you would have found me at work this morning he went on if the stupid people who send me my metal plates had not made a mistake the alloy in the gold and silver both is all wrong this time i must return the plates to be melted again before i can do anything with them they are all ready to go back today when the cart comes if there are any laboring people here who want money im sure i will give them some of mine with the greatest pleasure it isnt my fault maam that my father married my mother and how could i help it if he left two thousand a year each to my brother and me  two thousand a year each to his brother and him and the illustrious pratolungo had never known what it was to have five pounds sterling at his disposal before his union with me  i lifted my eyes to the ceiling in my righteous indignation i forgot lucilla and her curiosity about oscari forgot oscar and his horror of lucilla discovering who he was i opened my lips to speak in another moment i should have launched my thunderbolts against the whole infamous system of modern society when i was silenced by the most extraordinary and unexpected interruption that ever closed a womans lips    chapter the tenth  first appearance of jicks  there walked in at the open door of the roomsoftly suddenly and composedlya chubby female child who could not possibly have been more than three years old she had no hat or cap on her head a dirty pinafore covered her from her chin to her feet this amazing apparition advanced into the middle of the room holding hugged under one arm a ragged and disreputablelooking doll stared hard first at oscar then at me advanced to my knees laid the disreputable doll on my lap and pointing to a vacant chair at my side claimed the rights of hospitality in these words  jicks will sit down  how was it possible under these circumstances to attack the infamous system of modern society it was only possible to kiss jicks  do you know who this is i inquired as i lifted our visitor on to the chair  oscar burst out laughing like me he now saw this mysterious young lady for the first time like me he wondered what the extraordinary nickname under which she had presented herself could possibly mean  we looked at the child the childwith its legs stretched out straight before it terminating in a pair of little dusty boots with holes in themlifted its large round eyes overshadowed by a penthouse of unbrushed flaxen hair looked gravely at us in return and made a second call on our hospitality as follows  jicks will have something to drink  while oscar ran into the kitchen for some milk i succeeded in discovering the identity of jicks  somethingi cannot well explain whatin the manner in which the child had drifted into the room with her doll reminded me of the lymphatic lady of the rectory drifting backwards and forwards with the baby in one hand and the novel in the other i took the liberty of examining jickss pinafore and discovered the mark in one cornerselina finch exactly as i had supposed here was a member of mrs finchs numerous family rather a young member as it struck me to be wandering hatless round the environs of dimchurch all by herself  oscar returned with the milk in a mug the childinsisting on taking the mug into her own handssteadily emptied it to the last droprecovered her breath with a gasplooked at me with a white mustache of milk on her upper lipand announced the conclusion of her visit in these terms  jicks will get down again  i deposited our young friend on the floor she took her doll and stood for a moment deep in thought what was she going to do next we were not kept long in suspense she suddenly put her little hot fat hand into mine and tried to pull me after her out of the room  what do you want i asked  jicks answered in one untranslatable compound word  mangeegee  i suffered myself to be pulled out of the roomto see mangeegee to play mangeegee or to eat mangeegee it was impossible to tell which i was pulled along the passagei was pulled out to the front door therehaving approached the house inaudibly to us over the grassstood the horse cart and man waiting to take the case of gold and silver plates back to london i looked at oscar who had followed me we now understood not only the masterly compound word of jicks signifying man and horse and passing over cart as unimportant but the polite attention of jicks in entering the house to inform us after a rest and a drink of a circumstance which had escaped our notice the driver of the cart had on his own acknowledgment been investigated and questioned by this extraordinary child strolling up to the door of browndown to see what he was doing there jicks was a public character at dimchurch the driver knew all about her she had been nicknamed gipsy from her wandering habits and had shortened the name in her own dialect into jicks there was no keeping her in at the rectory try how you might they had long since abandoned the effort in despair sooner or later she turned up againor somebody brought her backor one of the sheepdogs found her asleep under a bush and gave the alarm what goes on in that childs head said the driver regarding jicks with a sort of superstitious admiration the lord only knows she has a will of her own and a way of her own she is a child and she aint a child at three years of age shes a riddle none of us can guess and thats the long and the short of what i know about her  while this explanation was in progress the carpenter who had nailed up the case and the carpenters son accompanying him joined us in front of the house they followed oscar in and came out again bearing the heavy burden of precious metalmore than one man could conveniently liftbetween them  the case deposited in the cart carpenter senior and carpenter junior got in after it wanting a lift to brighton  carpenter senior a big burly man made a joke its a lonely country between this and brighton sir he said to oscar three of us will be none too many to see your precious packingcase safe into the railway station oscar took it seriously are there any robbers in this neighborhood he asked lord love you sir said the driver robbers would starve in these parts we have got nothing worth thieving here jicksstill watching the proceedings with an interest which allowed no detail to escape unnoticedassumed the responsibility of starting the men on their journey the odd child waved her chubby hand imperiously to her friend the driver and cried in her loudest voice away the driver touched his hat with comic respect all right misstimes money aint it he cracked his whip and the cart rolled off noiselessly over the thick close turf of the south downs  it was time for me to go back to the rectory and to restore the wandering jicks for the time being to the protection of home i returned to oscar to say goodbye  i wish i was going back with you he said  you will be as free as i am to come and to go at the rectory i answered when they know what has passed this morning between you and me in your own interests i am determined to tell them who you are you have nothing to fear and everything to gain by my speaking out clear your mind of fancies and suspicions that are unworthy of you by tomorrow we shall be good neighbors by the end of the week we shall be good friends for the present as we say in france au revoir  i turned to take jicks by the hand while i had been speaking to oscar the child had slipped away from me not a sign of her was to be seen  before we could stir a step to search for our lost gipsy her voice reached our ears raised shrill and angry in the regions behind us at the side of the house  go away we heard the child cry out impatiently ugly men go away  we turned the corner and discovered two shabby strangers resting themselves against the side wall of the house their cadaverous faces their brutish expressions and their frowzy clothes proclaimed them to my eye as belonging to the vilest blackguard type that the civilized earth has yet producedthe blackguard of london growth there they lounged with their hands in their pockets and their backs against the wall as if they were airing themselves on the outer side of a publichouseand there stood jicks with her legs planted wide apart on the turf asserting the rights of property even at that early age and ordering the rascals off  what are you doing there asked oscar sharply  one of the men appeared to be on the point of making an insolent answer the otherthe younger and the vilerlooking villain of the twochecked him and spoke first  weve had a longish walk sir said the fellow with an impudent assumption of humility and weve took the liberty of resting our backs against your wall and feasting our eyes on the beauty of your young lady here  he pointed to the child jicks shook her fist at him and ordered him off more fiercely than ever  theres an inn in the village said oscar rest there if you pleasemy house is not an inn  the elder man made a second effort to speak beginning with an oath the younger checked him again  shut up jim said the superior blackguard of the two the gentleman recommends the tap at the inn come and drink the gentlemans health he turned to the child and took off his hat to her with a low bow wish you good morning miss youre just the style you are that i admire please dont engage yourself to be married till i come back  his savage companion was so tickled by this delicate pleasantry that he burst suddenly into a roar of laughter arm in arm the two ruffians walked off together in the direction of the village our funny little jicks became a tragic and terrible jicks all on a sudden the child resented the insolence of the two men as if she really understood it i never saw so young a creature in such a furious passion before she picked up a stone and threw it at them before i could stop her she screamed and stamped her tiny feet alternately on the ground till she was purple in the face she threw herself down and rolled in fury on the grass nothing pacified her but a rash promise of oscars which he was destined to hear of for many a long day afterwards to send for the police and to have the two men soundly beaten for daring to laugh at jicks she got up from the ground and dried her eyes with her knuckles and fixed a warning look on oscar mind said this curious child with her bosom still heaving under the dirty pinafore the men are to be beaten and jicks is to see it  i said nothing to oscar at the time but i felt some secret uneasiness on the way homean uneasiness inspired by the appearance of the two men in the neighborhood of browndown  it was impossible to say how long they might have been lurking about the outside of the house before the child discovered them they might have heard through the open window what oscar had said to me on the subject of his plates of precious metal and they might have seen the heavy packingcase placed in the cart i felt no apprehension about the safe arrival of the case at brighton the three men in the cart were men enough to take good care of it my fears were for the future oscar was living entirely by himself in a lonely house more than half a mile distant from the village his fancy for chasing in the precious metals might have its dangers as well as its attractions if it became known beyond the pastoral limits of dimchurch advancing from one suspicion to another i asked myself if the two men had roamed by mere accident into our remote part of the worldor whether they had deliberately found their way to browndown with a purpose in view having this doubt in my mind and happening to encounter the old nurse zillah in the garden as i entered the rectory gates with my little charge i put the question to her plainly do you see many strangers at dimchurch  strangers repeated the old woman excepting yourself maam we see no strangers here from one years end to another  i determined to say a warning word to oscar before his precious metals were sent back to browndown    chapter the eleventh  blind love  lucilla was at the piano when i entered the sittingroom  i wanted you of all things she said i have sent all over the house in search of you where have you been  i told her  she sprang to her feet with a cry of delight  you have persuaded him to trust youyou have discovered everything you only said i have been at browndownand i heard it in your voice out with it out with it  she never movedshe seemed hardly to breathewhile i was telling her all that had passed at the interview between oscar and me as soon as i had done she got up in a violent hurryflushed and eagerand made straight for her bedroom door  what are you going to do i asked  i want my hat and my stick she answered  you are going out  yes  where  can you ask the question to browndown of course  i begged her to wait a moment and hear a word or two that i had to say it is i suppose almost needless to add that my object in speaking to her was to protest against the glaring impropriety of her paying a second visit in one day to a man who was a stranger to her i declared in the plainest terms that such a proceeding would be sufficient in the estimation of any civilized community to put her reputation in peril the result of my interference was curious and interesting in the extreme it showed me that the virtue called modesty i am not speaking of decency mind is a virtue of purely artificial growth and that the successful cultivation of it depends in the first instance not on the influence of the tongue but on the influence of the eye  suppose the case of an average young lady conscious of feeling a first love to whom i might have spoken in the sense that i have just mentionedwhat would she have done  she would assuredly have shown some natural and pretty confusion and would in all human probability have changed color more or less while she was listening to me lucillas charming face revealed but one expressionan expression of disappointment slightly mixed perhaps with surprise i believed her to be then what i knew her to be afterwards as pure a creature as ever walked the earth and yet of the natural and becoming confusion of the little inevitable feminine changes of color which i had expected to see not so much as a vestige appearedand this remember in the case of a person of unusually sensitive and impulsive nature quick on the most trifling occasions to feel and to express its feeling in no ordinary degree  what did it mean  it meant that here was one strange side shown to me of the terrible affliction that darkened her life it meant that modesty is essentially the growth of our own consciousness of the eyes of others judging usand that blindness is never bashful for the one simple reason that blindness cannot see the most modest girl in existence is bolder with her lover in the dark than in the light the female model who sits for the first time in a drawing academy and who shrinks from the ordeal is persuaded in the last resort to enter the students room by having a bandage bound over her eyes my poor lucilla had always the bandage over her eyes my poor lucilla was never to meet her lover in the light she had grown up with the passions of a womanand yet she had never advanced beyond the fearless and primitive innocence of a child ah if ever there was a sacred charge confided to any mortal creature here surely was a sacred charge confided to me i could not endure to see the poor pretty blind face turned so insensibly towards mine after such words as i had just said to her she was standing within my reach i took her by the arm and made her sit on my knee my dear i said very earnestly you must not go to him again today  i have got so much to say to him she answered impatiently i want to tell him how deeply i feel for him and how anxious i am to make his life a happier one if i can  my dear lucilla you cant say this to a young man it is as good as telling him in plain words that you are fond of him  i am fond of him  hush hush keep it to yourself until you are sure that he is fond of you it is the mans place my lovenot the womansto own the truth first in matters of this sort  that is very hard on the women if they feel it first they ought to own it first she paused for a moment considering with herselfand abruptly got off my knee i must speak to him she burst out i must tell him that i have heard his story and that i think all the better of him after it instead of the worse  she was again on her way to get her hat my only chance of stopping her was to invent a compromise  write him a note i saidand then suddenly remembered that she was blind you shall dictate i added and i will hold the pen be content with that for today for my sake lucilla  she yieldednot very willingly poor thing but she jealously declined to let me hold the pen  my first note to him must be all written by me she said i can writein my own roundabout way its long and tiresome but still i can do it come and see  she led the way to a writingtable in a corner of the room and sat for awhile with the pen in her hand thinking her irresistible smile broke suddenly like a glow of light over her ah she exclaimed i know how to tell him what i think  guiding the pen in her right hand with the fingers of her left she wrote slowly in large childish characters these wordsdear mr oscari have heard all about you please send the little gold vaseyour friend lucilla  she enclosed and directed the letter and clapped her hands for joy he will know what that means she said gaily  it was useless to attempt making a second remonstrance i rang the bell under protest imagine her receiving a present from a gentleman to whom she had spoken for the first time that morningand the groom was sent off to browndown with the letter in making this concession i privately said to myself i shall keep a tight hand over oscar he is the manageable person of the two  the interval before the return of the groom was not an easy interval to fill up i proposed some music lucilla was still too full of her new interest to be able to give her attention to anything else she suddenly remembered that her father and her stepmother ought both to be informed that mr dubourg was a perfectly presentable person at the rectory she decided on writing to her father  on this occasion she made no difficulty about permitting me to hold the pen while she told me what to write we produced between us rather a flighty enthusiastic highflown sort of letter i felt by no means sure that we should raise a favorable impression of our new neighbor in the mind of reverend finch that was however not my affair i appeared to excellent advantage in the matter as the judicious foreign lady who had insisted on making inquiries for the rest it was a point of honor with mewriting for a person who was blindnot to change a single word in the sentences which lucilla dictated to me the letter completed i wrote the address of the house in brighton at which mr finch then happened to be staying and i was next about to close the envelope in due coursewhen lucilla stopped me  wait a little she said dont close the letter yet  i wondered why the envelope was to be left open and why lucilla looked a little confused when she forbade me to close it another unexpected revelation of the influence of their affliction on the natures of the blind was waiting to enlighten me on those two points  after consultation between us it had been decided at lucillas express request that i should inform mrs finch that the mystery at browndown was now cleared up lucilla openly owned to having no great relish for the society of her stepmother or for the duty invariably devolving on anybody who was long in the company of that fertile lady of either finding her handkerchief or holding her baby a duplicate key of the door of communication between the two sides of the house was given to me and i left the room  before performing my errand i went for a minute into my bedchamber to put away my hat and parasol returning into the corridor and passing the door of the sittingroom i found that it had been left ajar by some one who had entered after i had left and i heard lucillas voice say take that letter out of the envelope and read it to me  i pursued my way along the passagevery slowly i ownand i heard the first sentences of the letter which i had written under lucillas dictation read aloud to her in the old nurses voice the incurable suspicion of the blindalways abandoned to the same melancholy distrust of the persons about them always doubting whether some deceit is not being practiced on them by the happy people who can seehad urged lucilla even in the trifling matter of the letter to put me to the test behind my back she was using zillahs eyes to make sure that i had really written all that she had dictated to meexactly as on many an after occasion she used my eyes to make sure of zillahs complete performance of tasks allotted to her in the house no experience of the faithful devotion of those who live with them ever thoroughly satisfies the blind ah poor things always in the dark always in the dark  in opening the door of communication it appeared as if i had also opened all the doors of all the bedchambers in the rectory the moment i stepped into the passage out popped the children from one room after another like rabbits out of their burrows  where is your mamma i asked  the rabbits answered by one universal shriek and popped back again into their burrows  i went down the stairs to try my luck on the ground floor the window on the landing had a view over the front garden i looked out and saw the irrepressible arab of the family our small chubby jicks wandering in the garden all by herself evidently on the watch for her next opportunity of escaping from the house this curious little creature cared nothing for the society of the other children indoors she sat gravely retired in corners taking her meals whenever she could on the floor out of doors she roamed till she could walk no longer and then lay down anywhere like a little animal to sleep she happened to look up as i stood at the window seeing me she waved her hand indicatively in the direction of the rectory gate what is it i asked the arab answered jicks wants to get out  at the same moment the screaming of a baby below informed me that i was in the near neighborhood of mrs finch  i advanced towards the noise and found myself standing before the open door of a large storeroom at the extreme end of the passage in the middle of the room issuing household commodities to the cook sat mrs finch she was robed this time in a petticoat and a shawl and she had the baby and the novel laid together flat on their backs in her lap  eight pounds of soap where does it all go to i wonder groaned mrs finch to the accompaniment of the babys screams five pounds of soda for the laundry one would think we did the washing for the whole village six pounds of candles you must eat candles like the russians who ever heard of burning six pounds of candles in a week ten pounds of sugar who gets it all i never taste sugar from one years end to another waste nothing but waste here mrs finch looked my way and saw me at the door oh madame pratolungo how dye do dont go awayive just done a bottle of blacking my shoes are a disgrace to the house five pounds of rice if i had indian servants five pounds of rice would last them for a year there take the things away into the kitchen excuse my dress madame pratolungo how am i to dress with all i have got to do what do you say my time must indeed be fully occupied ah thats just where it is when you have lost half an hour in the morning and cant pick it up againto say nothing of having the storeroom on your mind and the childrens dinner late and the baby fractiousone slips on a petticoat and a shawl and gives it up in despair what can i have done with my handkerchief would you mind looking among those bottles behind you oh here it is under the baby might i trouble you to hold my book for one moment i think the baby will be quieter if i put him the other way here mrs finch turned the baby over on his stomach and patted him briskly on the back at this change in his circumstances the unappeasable infant only roared louder than ever his mother appeared to be perfectly unaffected by the noise this resigned domestic martyr looked placidly up at me as i stood before her bewildered with the novel in my hand ah thats a very interesting story she went on plenty of love in it you know you have come for it havent you i remember i promised to lend it to you yesterday before i could answer the cook appeared again in search of more household commodities mrs finch repeated the womans demands one by one as she made them in tones of despair another bottle of vinegar i believe you water the garden with vinegar more starch the queens washing im firmly persuaded doesnt come to so much as ours sandpaper sandpaper means wastepaper in this profligate house i shall tell your master i really can not make the housekeeping money last at this rate dont go madame pratolungo i shall have done directly what you must go oh then put the book back on my lap pleaseand look behind that sack of flour the first volume slipped down there this morning and i havent had time to pick it up since sandpaper do you think im made of sandpaper have you found the first volume ah thats it all over flour theres a hole in the sack i suppose twelve sheets of sandpaper used in a week what for i defy any of you to tell me what for waste waste shameful sinful waste at this point in mrs finchs lamentations i made my escape with the book and left the subject of oscar dubourg to be introduced at a fitter opportunity the last words i heard through the screams of the baby as i ascended the stairs were words still relating to the weeks prodigal consumption of sandpaper let us drop a tear if you please over the woes of mrs finch and leave the british matron apostrophizing domestic economy in the odorous seclusion of her own storeroom  i had just related to lucilla the failure of my expedition to the other side of the house when the groom returned bringing with him the gold vase and a letter  oscars answer was judiciously modeled to imitate the brevity of lucillas note you have made me a happy man again when may i follow the vase there in two sentences was the whole letter  i had another discussion with lucilla relating to the propriety of our receiving oscar in reverend finchs absence it was only possible to persuade her to wait until she had at least heard from her father by consenting to take another walk towards browndown the next morning this new concession satisfied her she had received his present she had exchanged letters with himthat was enough to content her for the time  do you think he is getting fond of me she asked the last thing at night taking her gold vase to bed with her poor dearexactly as she might have taken a new toy to bed with her when she was a child give him time my love i answered it isnt everybody who can travel at your pace in such a serious matter as this my banter had no effect upon her go away with your candle she said the darkness makes no difference to me i can see him in my thoughts she nestled her head comfortably on the pillows and tapped me saucily on the cheek as i bent over her own the advantage i have over you now she said you cant see at night without your candle i could go all over the house at this moment without making a false step anywhere  when i left her that night i sincerely believe poor miss finch was the happiest woman in england    chapter the twelfth  mr finch smells money  a domestic alarm deferred for some hours our proposed walk to browndown  the old nurse zillah was taken ill in the night she was so little relieved by such remedies as we were able to apply that it became necessary to summon the doctor in the morning he lived at some distance from dimchurch and he had to send back to his own house for the medicines required as a necessary result of these delays it was close on one oclock in the afternoon before the medical remedies had their effect and the nurse was sufficiently recovered to permit of our leaving her in the servants care  we had dressed for our walk lucilla being ready long before i was and had got as far as the garden gate on our way to browndownwhen we heard on the other side of the wall a mans voice pitched in superbly deep bass tones pronouncing these words  believe me my dear sir there is not the least difficulty i have only to send the cheque to my bankers at brighton  lucilla started and caught hold of me by the arm  my father she exclaimed in the utmost astonishment who is he talking to  the key of the gate was in my possession what a grand voice your father has got i said as i took the key out of my pocket i opened the gate there confronting us on the threshold arm in arm as if they had known each other from childhood stood lucillas father andoscar dubourg  reverend finch opened the proceedings by folding his daughter affectionately in his arms  my dear child he said i received your letteryour most interesting letterthis morning the moment i read it i felt that i owed a duty to mr dubourg as pastor of dimchurch it was clearly incumbent on me to comfort a brother in affliction i really felt so to speak a longing to hold out the right hand of friendship to this sorelytried man i borrowed my friends carriage and drove straight to browndown we have had a long and cordial talk i have brought mr dubourg home with me he must be one of us my dear child mr dubourg must be one of us let me introduce you my eldest daughtermr dubourg  he performed the ceremony of presentation with the most impenetrable gravity as if he really believed that oscar and his daughter now met each other for the first time  never had i set my eyes on a meanerlooking man than this rector in height he barely reached up to my shoulder in substance he was so miserably lean that he looked the living picture of starvation he would have made his fortune in the streets of london if he had only gone out and shown himself to the public in ragged clothes his face was deeply pitted with the smallpox his short grisly hair stood up stiff and straight on his head like hair fixed in a broom his small whitishgrey eyes had a restless inquisitive hungry look in them indescribably irritating and uncomfortable to see the one personal distinction he possessed consisted in his magnificent bass voicea voice which had no sort of right to exist in the person who used it until one became accustomed to the contrast there was something perfectly unbearable in hearing those superb big tones come out of that contemptible little body the famous latin phrase conveys after all the best description i can give of reverend finch he was in very truthvoice and nothing else  madame pratolungo no doubt he went on turning to me delighted to make the acquaintance of my daughters judicious companion and friend you must be one of uslike mr dubourg let me introduce you madame pratolungomr dubourg this is the old side of the rectory my dear sir we had it put in repairlet me see how long sincewe had it put in repair just after mrs finchs last confinement but one i soon discovered that mr finch reckoned time by his wifes confinements you will find it very curious and interesting inside lucilla my child it has pleased providence mr dubourg to afflict my daughter with blindness inscrutable providence lucilla this is your side of the house take mr dubourgs arm and lead the way do the honors my child madame pratolungo let me offer you my arm i regret that i was not present when you arrived to welcome you at the rectory consider yourselfdo pray consider yourselfone of us he stopped and lowered his prodigious voice to a confidential growl delightful person mr dubourg i cant tell you how pleased i am with him and what a sad story cultivate mr dubourg my dear madam as a favor to mecultivate mr dubourg  he said this with an appearance of the deepest anxietyand more he emphasized it by affectionately squeezing my hand  i have met with a great many audacious people in my time but the audacity of reverend finchpersisting to our faces in the assumption that he had been the first to discover our neighbor and that lucilla and i were perfectly incapable of understanding and appreciating oscar unassisted by himwas entirely without a parallel in my experience i asked myself what his conduct in this matterso entirely unexpected by lucilla as well as by mecould possibly mean my knowledge of his character obtained through his daughter and my memory of what we heard him say on the other side of the wall suggested that his conduct might meanmoney  we assembled in the sittingroom  the only person among us who was quite at his ease was mr finch he never let his daughter and his guest alone for a single moment my child show mr dubourg this show mr dubourg that mr dubourg my daughter possesses this my daughter possesses that so he went on all round the room oscar appeared to feel a little daunted by the overwhelming attentions of his new friend lucilla was as i could see secretly irritated at finding herself authorized by her father to pay those attentions to oscar which she would have preferred offering to him of her own accord as for me i was already beginning to weary of the patronizing politeness of the little priest with the big voice it was a relief to us all when a message on domestic affairs arrived in the midst of the proceedings from mrs finch requesting to see her husband immediately on the rectory side of the house  forced to leave us reverend finch made his farewell speech taking oscars hand into a kind of paternal custody in both his own hands he spoke with such sonorous cordiality that the china and glass ornaments on lucillas chiffonier actually jingled an accompaniment to his booming bass notes  come to tea my dear sir without ceremony tonight at six we must keep up your spirits mr dubourg cheerful society and a little music lucilla my dear child you will play for mr dubourg wont you madame pratolungo will do the sameat my requesti am sure we shall make even dull dimchurch agreeable to our new neighbor before we have done what does the poet say fixed to no spot is happiness sincere tis nowhere to be found or everywhere how cheering how true good day good day  the glasses left off jingling mr finchs wizen little legs took him out of the room  the moment his back was turned we both assailed oscar with the same question what had passed at the interview between the rector and himself men are all alike incompetent to satisfy women when the question between the sexes is a question of small details a woman in oscars position would have been able to relate to us not only the whole conversation with the rector but every little trifling incident which had noticeably illustrated it as things were we could only extract from our unsatisfactory man the barest outline of the interview the coloring and the fillingin we were left to do for ourselves  oscar had on his own confession acknowledged his visitors kindness by opening his whole heart to the sympathizing rector and placing that wary priest and excellent man of business in possession of the completest knowledge of all his affairs in return reverend finch had spoken in the frankest manner on his side he had drawn a sad picture of the povertystricken condition of dimchurch viewed as an ecclesiastical endowment and he had spoken in such feeling terms of the neglected condition of the ancient and interesting church that poor simple oscar smitten with pity had produced his chequebook and had subscribed on the spot towards the fund for repairing the ancient round tower they had been still occupied with the subject of the tower and the subscription when we had opened the garden gate and had let them in hearing this i now understood the motives under which our reverend friend was acting as well as if they had been my own it was plain to my mind that the rector had taken his financial measure of oscar and had privately satisfied himself that if he encouraged the two young people in cultivating each others society money to use his own phrase might come of it he had as i believed put forward the round tower in the first instance as a feeler and he would follow it up in due time by an appeal of a more personal nature to oscars wellfilled purse brief he was in my opinion quite sharp enough after having studied his young friends character to foresee an addition to his income rather than a subtraction from it if the relations between oscar and his daughter ended in a marriage  whether lucilla arrived on her side at the same conclusion as mine is what i cannot venture positively to declare i can only relate that she looked ill at ease as the facts came out and that she took the first opportunity of extinguishing her father viewed as a topic of conversation  as for oscar it was enough for him that he had already secured his place as friend of the house he took leave of us in the highest spirits i had my eye on them when he and lucilla said goodbye she squeezed his hand i saw her do it at the rate at which things were now going on i began to ask myself whether reverend finch would not appear at teatime in his robes of office and celebrate the marriage of his sorelytried young friend between the first cup and the second  at our little social assembly in the evening nothing passed worthy of much remark  lucilla and i i cannot resist recording this were both beautifully dressed in honor of the occasion mrs finch serving us to perfection by way of contrast she had made an immense effortshe was half dressed her evening costume was an ancient green silk skirt with traces of past babies visible on it to an experienced eye topped by the everlasting blue merino jacket i lose everything belonging to me mrs finch whispered in my ear i have got a body to this dress and it cant be found anywhere the rectors prodigious voice was never silent the pompous and plausible little man talked talked talked in deeper and deeper bass until the very teacups on the table shuddered under the influence of him the elder children admitted to the family festival ate till they could eat no more stared till they could stare no more yawned till they could yawn no moreand then went to bed oscar got on well with everybody mrs finch was naturally interested in him as one of twinsthough she was also surprised and disappointed at hearing that his mother had begun and ended with his brother and himself as for lucilla she sat in silent happiness absorbed in the inexhaustible delight of hearing oscars voice she found as many varieties of expression in listening to her beloved tones as the rest of us find in looking at our beloved face we had music later in the eveningand i then heard for the first time how charmingly lucilla played she was a born musician with a delicacy and subtlety of touch such as few even of the greatest virtuosi possess oscar was enchanted in a word the evening was a success  i contrived when our guest took his departure to say my contemplated word to him in private on the subject of his solitary position at browndown  those doubts of oscars security in his lonely house which i have described as having been suggested to me by the discovery of the two ruffians lurking under the wall still maintained their place in my mind and still urged me to warn him to take precautions of some sort before the precious metals which he had sent to london to be melted came back to him again he gave me the opportunity i wanted by looking at his watch and apologizing for protracting his visit to a terribly late hour for the countrythe hour of midnight  is your servant sitting up for you i asked assuming to be ignorant of his domestic arrangements  he pulled out of his pocket a great clumsy key  this is my only servant at browndown he said by four or five in the afternoon the people at the inn have done all for me that i want after that time there is nobody in the house but myself  he shook hands with us the rector escorted him as far as the front door i slipped out while they were saying their last words and joined oscar when he advanced alone into the garden  i want a breath of fresh air i said ill go with you as far as the gate  he began to talk of lucilla directly i surprised him by returning abruptly to the subject of his position at browndown  do you think its wise i asked to be all by yourself at night in such a lonely house as yours why dont you have a manservant  i detest strange servants he answered i infinitely prefer being by myself  when do you expect your gold and silver plates to be returned to you  in about a week  what would be the value of them in moneyat a rough guess  at a rough guessabout seventy or eighty pounds  in a weeks time then i said you will have seventy or eighty pounds worth of property at browndown property which a thief need only put into the meltingpot to have no fear of its being traced into his hands  oscar stopped and looked at me  what can you be thinking of he asked there are no thieves in this primitive place  there are thieves in other places i answered and they may come here have you forgotten those two men whom we caught hanging about browndown yesterday  he smiled i had recalled to him a humourous associationnothing more  it was not we who caught them he said it was that strange child what do you say to my having jicks to sleep in the house and take care of me  i am not joking i rejoined i never met with two more illlooking villains in my life the window was open when you were telling me about the necessity for melting the plates again they may know as well as we do that your gold and silver will be returned to you after a time  what an imagination you have got he exclaimed you see a couple of shabby excursionists from brighton who have wandered to dimchurchand you instantly transform them into a pair of housebreakers in a conspiracy to rob and murder me you and my brother nugent would just suit each other his imagination runs away with him exactly like yours  take my advice i answered gravely dont persist in sleeping at browndown without a living creature in the house with you  he was in wild good spirits he kissed my hand and thanked me in his voluble exaggerated way for the interest that i took in him all right he said as he opened the gate ill have a living creature in the house with me ill get a dog  we parted i had told him what was on my mind i could do no more after all it might be quite possible that his view was the right one and mine the wrong    chapter the thirteenth  second appearance of jicks  five more days passed  during that interval we saw our new neighbor constantly either oscar came to the rectory or we went to browndown reverend finch waited with a masterly assumption of suspecting nothing until the relations between the two young people were ripe enough to develop into relations of acknowledged love they were already under lucillas influence advancing rapidly to that point you are not to blame my poor blind girl if you please for frankly encouraging the man she loved he was the most backward manviewed as a suitorwhom i ever met with the fonder he grew of her the more timid and selfdistrustful he became i own i dont like a modest man and i cannot honestly say that mr oscar dubourg on closer acquaintance advanced himself much in my estimation however lucilla understood him and that was enough she was determined to have the completest possible image of him in her mind everybody in the house who had seen him the children included she examined and crossexamined on the subject of his personal appearance as she had already examined and crossexamined me his features and his color his height and his breadth his ornaments and his clotheson all these points she collected evidence in every direction and in the smallest detail it was an especial relief and delight to her to hear on all sides that his complexion was fair there was no reasoning with her against her blind horror of dark shades of color whether seen in men women or things she was quite unable to account for it she could only declare it  i have the strangest instincts of my own about some things she said to me one day for instance i knew that oscar was bright and fairi mean i felt it in myselfon that delightful evening when i first heard the sound of his voice it went straight from my ear to my heart and it described him just as the rest of you have described him to me since mrs finch tells me his complexion is lighter than mine do you think so too i am so glad to hear that he is fairer than i am did you ever meet before with a person like me i have the oddest ideas in this blind head of mine i associate life and beauty with light colors and death and crime with dark colors if i married a man with a dark complexion and if i recovered my sight afterwards i should run away from him  this singular prejudice of hers against dark people was a little annoying to me on personal grounds it was a sort of reflection on my own taste between ourselves the late doctor pratolungo was of a fine mahogany brown all over  as for affairs in general at dimchurch my chronicle of the five days finds little to dwell on that is worth recording  we were not startled by any second appearance of the two ruffians at browndownneither was any change made by oscar in his domestic establishment he was favored with more than one visit from our little wandering jicks on each occasion the child gravely reminded him of his rash promise to appeal to the police and visit with corporal punishment the two ugly strangers who had laughed at her when were the men to be beaten and when was jicks to see it such were the serious questions with which this young lady regularly opened the proceedings on each occasion when she favored oscar with a morning call  on the sixth day the gold and silver plates were returned to browndown from the manufactory in london  the next morning a note arrived for me from oscar it ran thus  dear madame pratolungoi regret to inform you that nothing happened to me last night my locks and bolts are in their usual good order my gold and silver plates are safe in the workshop and i myself am now eating my breakfast with an uncut throatyours ever  oscar  after this there was no more to be said jicks might persist in remembering the two illlooking strangers older and wiser people dismissed them from all further consideration  saturday camemaking the tenth day since the memorable morning when i had forced oscar to disclose himself to me in the little sideroom at browndown  in the forenoon we had a visit from him at the rectory in the afternoon we went to browndown to see him begin a new piece of chasing in golda casket for holding glovesdestined to take its place on lucillas toilettable when it was done we left him industriously at work determined to go on as long as the daylight lasted  early in the evening lucilla sat down at her pianoforte and i paid a visit by appointment to the rectory side of the house  unhappy mrs finch had determined to institute a complete reform of her wardrobe she had entreated me to give her the benefit of my french taste in the capacity of confidential critic and adviser i cant afford to buy any new things said the poor lady but a deal might be done in altering what i have got by me if a clever person took the matter up who could resist that piteous appeal i resigned myself to the baby the novel and the children in general and reverend finch being out of the way writing his sermon i presented myself in mrs finchs parlor full of ideas with my scissors and my patternpaper ready in my hand  we had only begun our operations when one of the elder children arrived with a message from the nursery  it was teatime and as usual jicks was missing she was searched for first in the lower regions of the house secondly in the garden not a trace of her was to be discovered in either quarter nobody was surprised or alarmed we said oh dear she has gone to browndown againand immersed ourselves once more in the shabby recesses of mrs finchs wardrobe  i had just decided that the blue merino jacket was an article of wearing apparel which had done its duty and earned its right to final retirement from the scenewhen a plaintive cry reached my ear through the open door which led into the back garden  i stopped and looked at mrs finch  the cry was repeated louder and nearer recognizable this time as a cry in a childs voice the door of the room had been left ajar when we sent the messenger back to the nursery i threw it open and found myself face to face with jicks in the passage  i felt every nerve in my body shudder at the sight of the child  the poor little thing was white and wild with terror she was incapable of uttering a word when i knelt down to fondle and soothe her she caught convulsively at my hand and attempted to raise me i got on my feet again she repeated her dumb cry more loudlyand tried to drag me out of the house she was so weak that she staggered under the effort i took her up in my arms one of my hands as i embraced her touched the top of her frock just below the back of her neck i felt something on my fingers i looked at them gracious god i was stained with blood  i turned the child round my own blood froze her mother standing behind me screamed with horror  the dear little things white frock was spotted and splashed with wet blood not her own blood there was not a scratch on her i looked closer at the horrid marks they had been drawn purposely on herdrawn as it seemed with a finger i took her out into the light it was writing a word had been feebly traced on the back of her frock i made out something like the letter h then a letter which it was impossible to read  then another next to it which might have been l or might have been j then a last letter which i guessed to be p  was the wordhelp  yestraced on the back of the childs frock with a finger dipped in bloodhelp    chapter the fourteenth  discoveries at browndown  it is needless to tell you at what conclusion i arrived as soon as i was sufficiently myself to think at all  thanks to my adventurous past life i have got the habit of deciding quickly in serious emergencies of all sorts in the present emergencyas i saw itthere were two things to be done one to go instantly with help to browndown the other to keep the knowledge of what had happened from lucilla until i could get back again and prepare her for the discovery  i looked at mrs finch she had dropped helplessly into a chair rouse yourself i saidand shook her it was no time for sympathizing with swoons and hysterics the child was still in my arms fast yielding poor little thing to the exhaustion of fatigue and terror i could do nothing until i had relieved myself of the charge of her mrs finch looked up at me trembling and sobbing i put the child in her lap jicks feebly resisted being parted from me but soon gave up and dropped her weary little head on her mothers bosom can you take off her frock i asked with another shakea good one this time the prospect of a domestic occupation of any sort appeared to rouse mrs finch she looked at the baby in its cradle in one corner of the room and at the novel reposing on a chair in another corner of the room the presence of these two familiar objects appeared to encourage her she shivered she swallowed a sob she recovered her breath she began to undo the frock  put it away carefully i said and say nothing to anybody of what has happened until i come back you can see for yourself that the child is not hurt soothe her and wait here is mr finch in the study  mrs finch swallowed another sob and said yes the child made a last effort jicks will go with you said the indomitable little arab faintly i ran out of the room and left the three babiesbig little and leasttogether  after knocking at the study door without getting any reply i opened it and went in reverend finch comfortably prostrate in a large armchair with his sermonpaper spread out in fair white sheets by his side started up and confronted me in the character of a clergyman that moment awakened from a sound sleep  the rector of dimchurch instantly recovered his dignity  i beg your pardon madame pratolungo i was deep in thought please state your business briefly saying those words he waved his hand magnificently over his empty sheets of paper and added in his deepest bass sermonday  i told him in the plainest words what i had seen on his childs frock and what i feared had happened at browndown he turned deadly pale if i ever yet set my two eyes on a man thoroughly frightened reverend finch was that man  do you anticipate danger he inquired is it your opinion that criminal persons are in or near the house  it is my opinion that there is not a moment to be lost i answered we must go to browndown and we must get what help we can on the way  i opened the door and waited for him to come out with me mr finch still apparently preoccupied with the question of the criminal persons looked as if he wished himself a hundred miles from his own rectory at that particular moment but he was the master of the house he was the principal man in the placehe had no other alternative as matters now stood than to take his hat and go  we went out together into the village my reverend companion was silent for the first time in my limited experience of him we inquired for the one policeman who patrolled the district he was away on his rounds we asked if anybody had seen the doctor no it was not the doctors day for visiting dimchurch i had heard the landlord of the gross hands described as a capable and respectable man and i suggested stopping at the inn and taking him with us mr finch instantly brightened at that proposal his sense of his own importance rose again like the mercury in a thermometer when you put it into a warm bath  exactly what i was about to suggest he said gootheridge of the gross hands is a very worthy personfor his station in life let us have gootheridge by all means dont be alarmed madame pratolungo we are all in the hands of providence it is most fortunate for you that i was at home what would you have done without me now dont pray dont be alarmed in case of criminal personsi have my stick as you see i am not tall but i possess immense physical strength i am so to speak all muscle feel  he held out one of his wizen little arms it was about half the size of my arm if i had not been far too anxious to think of playing tricks i should certainly have declared that it was needless with such a tower of strength by my side to disturb the landlord i dare not assert that mr finch actually detected the turn my thoughts were takingi can only declare that he did certainly shout for gootheridge in a violent hurry the moment we were in sight of the inn  the landlord came out and hearing what our errand was instantly consented to join us  take your gun said mr finch  gootheridge took his gun we hastened on to the house  were mrs gootheridge or your daughter at browndown today i asked  yes maamthey were both at browndown they finished up their work as usualand left the house more than an hour since  did anything out of the common happen while they were there  nothing that i heard of maam  i considered with myself for a minute and ventured on putting a few more questions to mr gootheridge  have any strangers been seen here this evening i inquired  yes maam nearly an hour ago two strangers drove by my house in a chaise  in what direction  coming from brighton way and going towards browndown  did you notice the men  not particularly maam i was busy at the time  a sickening suspicion that the two strangers in the chaise might be the two men whom i had seen lurking under the wall forced its way into my mind i said no more until we reached the house  all was quiet the one sign of anything unusual was in the plain traces of the passage of wheels over the turf in front of browndown the landlord was the first to see them the chaise must have stopped at the house sir he said addressing himself to the rector  reverend finch was suffering under a second suspension of speech all he could say as we approached the door of the silent and solitary buildingand he said that with extreme difficultywas pray let us be careful  the landlord was the first to reach the door i was behind him the rectorat some little distanceacted as rearguard with the south downs behind him to retreat upon gootheridge rapped smartly on the door and called out mr dubourg there was no answer there was only a dreadful silence the suspense was more than i could endure i pushed by the landlord and turned the handle of the unlocked door  let me go first maam said gootheridge  he pushed by me in his turn i followed him close we entered the house and called again again there was no answer we looked into the little sittingroom on one side of the passage and into the diningroom on the other both were empty we went on to the back of the house where the room was situated which oscar called his workshop when we tried the door of the workshop it was locked  we knocked and called again the horrid silence was all that followedas before  i tried the keyhole with my finger the key was not in the lock i knelt down and looked through the keyhole the next instant i was up again on my feet wild and giddy with horror  burst open the door i screamed i can just see his hand lying on the floor  the landlord like the rector was a little man and the door like everything else at browndown was of the clumsiest and heaviest construction unaided by instruments we should all three together have been too weak to burst it open in this difficulty reverend finch proved to befor the first time and also for the lastof some use  stay he said my friends if the back garden gate is open we can get in by the window  neither the landlord nor i had thought of the window we ran round to the back of the house seeing the marks of the chaisewheels leading in the same direction the gate in the wall was wide open we crossed the little garden the window of the workshopopening to the groundgave us admission as the rector had foretold we entered the room  there he laypoor harmless unlucky oscarsenseless in a pool of his own blood a blow on the left side of his head had to all appearance felled him on the spot the wound had split the scalp whether it had also split the skull was more than i was surgeon enough to be able to say i had gathered some experience of how to deal with wounded men when i served the sacred cause of freedom with my glorious pratolungo cold water vinegar and linen for bandagesthese were all in the house and these i called for gootheridge found the key of the door flung aside in a corner of the room he got the water and the vinegar while i ran upstairs to oscars bedroom and provided myself with some of his handkerchiefs in a few minutes i had a cold water bandage over the wound and was bathing his face in vinegar and water he was still insensible but he lived reverend finchnot of the slightest help to anybodyassumed the duty of feeling oscars pulse he did it as if under the circumstances this was the one meritorious action that could be performed he looked as if nobody could feel a pulse but himself most fortunate he said counting the slow faint throbbing at the poor fellows wristmost fortunate that i was at home what would you have done without me  the next necessity was of course to send for the doctor and to get help in the meantime to carry oscar upstairs to his bed  gootheridge volunteered to borrow a horse and to ride off for the doctor we arranged that he was to send his wife and his wifes brother to help me this settled the one last embarrassment left to deal with was the embarrassment of mr finch now that we were free from all fear of encountering bad characters in the house the boomboom of the little mans big voice went on unintermittingly like a machine at work in the neighborhood i had another of my inspirationssitting on the floor with oscars head on my lap i gave my reverend companion something to do look about the room i said see if the packingcase with the gold and silver plates is here or not  mr finch did not quite relish being treated like an ordinary mortal and being told what he was to do  compose yourself madame pratolungo he said no hysterical activity if you please this business is in my hands quite needless maam to tell me to look for the packingcase  quite needless i agreed i know beforehand the packingcase is gone  that answer instantly set him fussing about the room not a sign of the case was to be seen  all doubt in my mind was at an end now the two ruffians lounging against the wall had justified horribly justified my worst suspicions of them  on the arrival of mrs gootheridge and her brother we carried him up to his room we laid him on the bed with his necktie off and his throat free and the air blowing over him from the open window he showed no sign yet of coming to his senses but still the pulse went faintly on no change was discernible for the worse  it was useless to hope for the doctors arrival before another hour at least i felt the necessity of getting back at once to the rectory so as to be able to tell lucilla with all needful preparation the melancholy truth otherwise the news of what had happened would get abroad in the village and might come to her ears in the worst possible way through one of the servants to my infinite relief mr finch when i rose to go excused himself from accompanying me he had discovered that it was his duty as rector to give the earliest information of the outrage at browndown to the legal authorities he went his way to the nearest magistrate and i went mineleaving oscar under the care of mrs gootheridge and her brotherback to the house mr finchs last words at parting reminded me once more that we had one thing at least to be thankful for under the circumstancessad as they otherwise were  most fortunate madame pratolungo that i was at home what would you have done without me    chapter the fifteenth  events at the bedside  i am if you will be so good as to remember constitutionally frenchand therefore constitutionally averse to distressing myself if i can possibly help it for this reason i really cannot summon courage to describe what passed between my blind lucilla and me when i returned to our pretty sittingroom she made me cry at the time and she would make me and perhaps you cry again now if i wrote the little melancholy story of what this tender young creature suffered when i told her my miserable news i wont write it i am dead against tears they affect the nose and my nose is my best feature let us use our eyes my fair friends to conquer not to cry  be it enough to say that when i went back to browndown lucilla went with me  i now observed her for the first time to be jealous of the eyes of us happy people who could see the instant she entered she insisted on being near enough to the bed to hear us or to touch us as we waited on the injured man this was at once followed by her taking the place occupied by mrs gootheridge at the bedhead and herself bathing oscars face and forehead she was even jealous of me when she discovered that i was moistening the bandages on the wound i irritated her into boldly kissing the poor insensible face in our presence the landlady of the cross hands was one of my sort she took cheerful views of things sweet on himeh maam she whispered in my ear we shall have a wedding in dimchurch in presence of these kissings and whisperings mrs gootheridges brother as the only man present began to look very uncomfortable this worthy creature belonged to that large and respectable order of englishmen who dont know what to do with their hands or how to get out of a room i took pity on himhe was i assure you a fine man smoke your pipe sir in the garden i said we will call to you from the window if we want you up here mrs gootheridges brother cast on me one look of unutterable gratitudeand escaped as if he had been let out of a trap  at last the doctor came  his first words were an indescribable relief to us the skull of our poor oscar was not injured there was concussion of the brain and there was a scalpwoundinflicted evidently with a blunt instrument as to the wound i had done all that was necessary in the doctors absence as to the injury to the brain time and care would put everything right again make your minds easy ladies said this angel of a man there is no reason for feeling the slightest alarm about him  he came to his sensesthat is to say he opened his eyes and looked vacantly about himbetween four and five hours after the time when we had found him on the floor of the workshop  his mind poor fellow was still all astray he recognized nobody he imitated the action of writing with his finger and said very earnestly over and over again go home jicks go home go home fancying himself as i suppose lying helpless on the floor and sending the child back to us to give the alarm later in the night he fell asleep all through the next day he still wandered in his mind when he spoke it was not till the day after that he began feebly to recover his reason the first person he recognized was lucilla she was engaged at the moment in brushing his beautiful chestnut hair to her unutterable joy he patted her hand and murmured her name  she bent over him and under cover of the hairbrush whispered something in his ear which made the young fellows pale face flush and his dull eyes brighten with pleasure a day or two afterwards she owned to me that she had said get well for my sake she was not in the least ashamed of having spoken to that plain purpose on the contrary she triumphed in it leave him to me said lucilla in the most positive manner i mean first to cure him and then i mean to be his wife  in a week more he was in complete possession of his facultiesbut still wretchedly weak and only gaining ground very slowly after the shock that he had suffered  he was now able to tell us by a little at a time of what had happened in the workshop  after mrs gootheridge and her daughter had quitted the house at their usual hour he had gone up to his room had remained there some little time and had then gone downstairs again on approaching the workshop he heard voices talking in whispers in the room the idea instantly occurred to him that something was wrong he softly tried the door and found it lockedthe robbers having no doubt taken that precaution to prevent their being surprised at their thieving work by any person in the house the one other way of getting into the room was the way that we had tried he went round to the back garden and found an empty chaise drawn up outside the door this circumstance thoroughly puzzled him but for the mysterious locking of the workshop door it would have suggested to him nothing more alarming than the arrival of some unexpected visitors eager to solve the mystery he crossed the garden and entering the room found himself face to face with the same two men whom jicks had discovered ten days previously lounging against the wall  as he approached the window they were both busily engaged with their backs towards him in cording up the packingcase which contained the metal plates  they rose and faced him as he stepped into the room the act of robbery which he found them coolly perpetrating in broad daylight instantly set his irritable temper in a flame he rushed at the younger of the two menbeing the one nearest to him the ruffian sprang aside out of his reach snatched up from the table on which it was lying ready a short loaded staff of leather called a lifepreserver and struck him with it on the head before he had recovered himself and could face his man once more  from that moment he remembered nothing until he had regained his consciousness after the first shock of the blow  he found himself lying giddy and bleeding on the floor and he saw the child who must have strayed into the room while he was senseless standing petrified with fear looking at him the idea of making use of heras the only living being nearto give the alarm came to him instinctively the moment he recognized her he coaxed the little creature to venture within reach of his hand and dipping his finger in the blood that was flowing from him sent us the terrible message which i had spelt out on the back of her frock that done he exerted his last remains of strength to push her gently towards the open window and direct her to go home he fainted from loss of blood while he was still repeating the words go home go homeand still seeing or fancying that he saw the child stopping obstinately in the room stupefied with terror of the time at which she found the courage and the sense to run home and of all that had happened after that he was necessarily ignorant his next conscious impression was the impression already recorded of seeing lucilla sitting by his bedside  the account of the matter thus given by oscar was followed by a supplementary statement provided by the police  the machinery of the law was put in action and the village was kept in a fever of excitement for days together never was there a more complete investigationand never was a poorer result achieved substantially nothing was discovered beyond what i had already found out for myself the robbery was declared to have been as i had supposed a planned thing though we had none of us noticed them at the rectory it was ascertained that the thieves had been at dimchurch on the day when the unlucky plates were first delivered at browndown having taken their time to examine the house and to make themselves acquainted with the domestic habits of the persons in it the rogues had paid their second visit to the villageno doubt to commit the robberyon the occasion when we had discovered them foiled by the unexpected return of the gold and silver to london they had waited again had followed the plates back to browndown and had effected their objectthanks to the lonely situation of the house and to the murderous blow which had stretched oscar insensible on the floor  more than one witness had met them on the road back to brighton with the packingcase in the chaise but when they returned to the liverystables from which they had hired the vehicle the case was not to be seen accomplices in brighton had in all probability assisted them in getting rid of it and in shifting the plates into ordinary articles of luggage which would attract no special attention at the railway station this was the explanation given by the police right or wrong the one fact remains that the villains were not caught and that the assault and robbery at oscars house may be added to the long list of crimes cleverly enough committed to defy the vengeance of the law  for ourselves we all agreedled by lucillato indulge in no useless lamentations and to be grateful that oscar had escaped without serious injury the mischief was done and there was an end of it  in this philosophical spirit we looked at the affair while our invalid was recovering we all plumed ourselves on our excellent good senseand ah poor stupid human wretches we were all fatally wrong so far from the mischief being at an end the mischief had only begun the true results of the robbery at browndown were yet to show themselves and were yet to be felt in the strangest and the saddest way by every member of the little circle assembled at dimchurch    chapter the sixteenth  first result of the robbery  between five and six weeks passed oscar was out of his bedroom and was well of his wound  during this lapse of time lucilla steadily pursued that process of her own of curing him which was to end in marrying him never had i seen such nursing beforenever do i expect to see such nursing again from morning to night she interested him and kept him in good spirits the charming creature actually made her blindness a means of lightening the weary hours of the man she loved  sometimes she would sit before oscars lookingglass and imitate all the innumerable tricks artifices and vanities of a coquette arraying herself for conquestwith such wonderful truth and humour of mimicry that you would have sworn she possessed the use of her eyes sometimes she would show him her extraordinary power of calculating by the sound of a persons voice the exact position which that person occupied towards her in a room selecting me as the victim she would first provide herself with one of the nosegays always placed by her own hands at oscars bedside and would then tell me to take up my position noiselessly in any part of the room that i pleased and to say lucilla the instant the words were out of my mouth the nosegay flew from her hand and hit me on the face she never once missed her aim on any one of the occasions when this experiment was triedand she never once flagged in her childish enjoyment of the exhibition of her own skill  nobody was allowed to pour out oscars medicine but herself she knew when the spoon into which it was to be measured was full by the sound which the liquid made in falling into it when he was able to sit up in his bed and when she was standing at the pillowside she could tell him how near his head was to hers by the change which he produced when he bent forward or when he drew back in the action of the air on her face in the same way she knew as well as he knew when the sun was out and when it was behind a cloudjudging by the differing effect of the air at such times on her forehead and on her cheeks  all the litter of little objects accumulating in a sickroom she kept in perfect order on a system of her own she delighted in putting the room tidy late in the evening when we helpless people who could see were beginning to think of lighting the candles the time when we could just discern her flitting to and fro in the dusk in her bright summer dressnow visible as she passed the window now lost in the shadows at the end of the roomwas the time when she began to clear the tables of the things that had been wanted in the day and to replace them by the things which would be wanted at night we were only allowed to light the candles when they showed us the room magically put in order during the darkness as if the fairies had done it she laughed scornfully at our surprise and said she sincerely pitied the poor useless people who could only see  the same pleasure which she had in arranging the room in the dark she also felt in wandering all over the house in the dark and in making herself thoroughly acquainted with every inch of it from top to bottom as soon as oscar was well enough to go downstairs she insisted on leading him  you have been so long up in your bedroom she said that you must have forgotten the rest of the house take my armand come along now we are out in the passage mind there is a step down just at this place and now a step up again here is a sharp corner to turn at the top of the staircase and there is a rod out of the staircarpet and an awkward fold in it that might throw you down so she took him into his own drawingroom as if it was he that was blind and she who had the use of her eyes who could resist such a nurse as this is it wonderful that i heard a sound suspiciously like the sound of a kiss on that first day of convalescence when i happened for a moment to be out of the room i strongly suspected her of leading the way in that also she was so wonderfully composed when i came backand he was so wonderfully flurried  in a week from his convalescence lucilla completed the cure of the patient in other words she received from oscar an offer of marriage i have not the slightest doubt in my own mind that he required assistance in bringing this delicate matter to a climaxand that lucilla helped him  i may be right or i may be wrong about this but i can at least certify that lucilla was in such mad high spirits when she told me the news out in the garden on a lovely autumn morning that she actually danced for joyand more improper still she made me at my discreet time of life dance too she took me round the waist and we waltzed on the grassmrs finch standing by in the condemned blue merino jacket with the baby in one hand and the novel in the other and warning us both that if we lost half an hour out of our day in whirling each other round the lawn we should never succeed in picking it up again in that house we went on whirling for all that until we were both out of breath nothing short of downright exhaustion could tame lucilla as for me i am i sincerely believe the rashest person of my age now in existence what is my age ah i am always discreet about that it is the one exception set down my rashness to my french nationality my easy conscience and my excellent stomachand let us go on with our story  there was a private interview at browndown later on that day between oscar and reverend finch  of what passed on that occasion i was not informed the rector came back among us with his head high in the air strutting magnificently on his wizen little legs he embraced his daughter in pathetic silence and gave me his hand with a serene smile of condescension worthy of the greatest humbug say louis the fourteenth that ever sat on a throne when he got the better of his paternal emotion and began to speak his voice was so big that i really thought it must have burst him the vapor of words in which he enveloped himself condensed on paper amounted to these two statements first that he hailed in oscar not having i suppose children enough already of his own the advent of another son secondly that he saw the finger of providence in everything that had happened alas for me my irreverent french nature saw nothing but the finger of finchin oscars pocket  the weddingday was not then actually fixed it was only generally arranged that the marriage should take place in about six weeks  this interval was intended to serve a double purpose it was to give the lawyers time to prepare the marriage settlements and to give oscar time to completely recover his health some anxiety was felt by all of us on this latter subject his wound was well and his mind was itself again but still there was something wrong with him for all that  those curious contradictions in his character which i have already mentioned showed themselves more strangely than ever the man who had found the courage when his blood was up to measure himself alone and unarmed against two robbers was now unable to enter the room in which the struggle had taken place without trembling from head to foot he who had laughed at me when i begged him not to sleep in the house by himself now had two men a gardener and an indoor servant domiciled at browndown to protect himand felt no sense of security even in that he was constantly dreaming that the ruffian with the lifepreserver was attacking him again or that he was lying bleeding on the floor and coaxing jicks to venture within reach of his hand if any of us hinted at his occupying himself once more with his favorite art he stopped his ears and entreated us not to renew his horrible associations with the past he would not even look at his box of chasing tools the doctorsummoned to say what was the matter with himtold us that his nervous system had been shaken and frankly acknowledged that there was nothing to be done but to wait until time set it right again  i am afraid i must confess that i myself took no very indulgent view of the patients case  it was his duty to exert himselfas i thought he appeared to me to be too indolent to make a proper effort to better his own condition lucilla and i had more than one animated discussion about him on a certain evening when we were at the piano gossiping and playing in the intervals she was downright angry with me for not sympathizing with her darling as unreservedly as she did i have noticed one thing madame pratolungo she said to me with a flushed face and a heightened tone you have never done oscar justice from the first  mark those trifling words the time is coming when you will hear of them again  the preparations for the contemplated marriage went on the lawyers produced their sketch of the settlement and oscar wrote to an address in new york given to him by nugent to tell his brother of the approaching change in his life and of the circumstances which had brought it about  the marriage settlement was not shown to me but from certain signs and tokens i guessed that oscars perfect disinterestedness on the question of money had been turned to profitable account by oscars future fatherinlaw reverend finch was reported to have shed tears when he first read the document and lucilla came out of the study after an interview with her father more thoroughly and vehemently indignant than i had ever seen her yet dont ask what is the matter she said to me between her teeth i am ashamed to tell you when oscar came in a little later she fell on her kneesliterally on her kneesbefore him some overmastering agitation was in possession of her whole being which made her for the moment reckless of what she said or did i worship you she burst out hysterically kissing his hand you are the noblest of living men i can never never be worthy of you the interpretation of these highflown sayings and doings was to my mind briefly this oscars money in the rectors pocket and the rectors daughter used as the means  the interval expired the weeks succeeded each other all had been long since ready for the marriageand still the marriage did not take place  far from becoming himself again with time to help himas the doctor had foretoldoscar steadily grew worse all the nervous symptoms to use the medical phrase which i have already described strengthened instead of loosening their hold on him he grew thinner and thinner and paler and paler early in the month of november we sent for the doctor again the question to be put to him this time was the question suggested by lucilla of trying as a last remedy change of air  somethingi forget whatdelayed the arrival of our medical man oscar had given up all idea of seeing him that day and had come to us at the rectorywhen the doctor drove into dimchurch he was stopped before he went on to browndown and he and his patient saw each other alone in lucillas sittingroom  they were a long time together lucilla waiting with me in my bedchamber grew impatient she begged me to knock at the sittingroom door and inquire when she might be permitted to assist at the consultation  i found doctor and patient standing together at the window talking quietly evidently nothing had passed to excite either of them in the smallest degree oscar looked a little pale and wearybut he like his medical adviser was perfectly composed  there is a young lady in the next room i said who is getting anxious to hear what your consultation has ended in  the doctor looked at oscar and smiled  there is really nothing to tell miss finch he said mr dubourg and i have gone all over the case againand nothing new has come of it his nervous system has not recovered its balance so soon as i expected i am sorrybut i am not in the least alarmed at his age things are sure to come right in the end he must be patient and the young lady must be patient i can say no more  do you see any objection to his trying change of air i inquired  none whatever let him go where he likes and amuse himself as he likes you are all of you a little disposed to take mr dubourgs case too seriously except the nervous derangement unpleasant enough in itself i grant there is really nothing the matter with him he has not a trace of organic disease anywhere the pulse continued the doctor laying his fingers lightly on oscars wrist is perfectly satisfactory i never felt a quieter pulse in my life  as the words passed his lips a frightful contortion fastened itself on oscars face  his eyes turned up hideously  from head to foot his whole body was wrenched round as if giant hands had twisted it towards the right  before i could speak he was in convulsions on the floor at his doctors feet  good god what is this i cried out  the doctor loosened his cravat and moved away the furniture that was near him that done he waitedlooking at the writhing figure on the floor  can you do nothing more i asked  he shook his head gravely nothing more  what is it  an epileptic fit    chapter the seventeenth  the doctors opinion  before another word had been exchanged between us lucilla entered the room we looked at each other if we could have spoken at that moment i believe we should both have said thank god she is blind  have you all forgotten me she asked oscar where are you what does the doctor say  she advanced into the room in a moment more she would have stumbled against the prostrate man still writhing on the floor i laid my hand on her arm and stopped her  she suddenly caught my hand in hers why did you tremble she asked when you took me by the arm why are you trembling now her delicate sense of touch was not to be deceived i vainly denied that anything had happened my hand had betrayed me there is something wrong she exclaimed oscar has not answered me  the doctor came to my assistance  there is nothing to be alarmed about he said mr dubourg is not very well today  she turned on the doctor with a sudden burst of anger  you are deceiving me she cried something serious has happened to him the truth tell me the truth oh its shameful its heartless of both of you to deceive a wretched blind creature like me  the doctor still hesitated i told her the truth  where is he she asked seizing me by the two shoulders and shaking me in the violence of her agitation  i entreated her to wait a little i tried to place her in a chair she pushed me contemptuously away and went down on the floor on her hands and knees i shall find him she said to herself i shall find him in spite of them she began to crawl over the floor feeling the empty space before her with her hand it was horrible i followed her and raised her again by main force  dont struggle with her said the doctor let her come here he is quiet now  i looked at oscar the worst of it was over he was exhaustedhe was quite still now the doctors voice guided her to the place she sat down by oscar on the floor and laid his head on her lap the moment she touched him the same effect was produced on her which would be produced if our eyes were bandaged on you or me when the bandage was taken off an instant sense of relief diffused itself through her whole being she became her gentler and sweeter self again i am sorry i lost my temper she said with the simplicity of a child but you dont know how hard it is to be deceived when you are blind she stooped as she said those words and passed her handkerchief lightly over his forehead doctor she asked will this happen again  i hope not  are you sure not  i cant say that  what has brought it on  i am afraid the blow he received on the head has brought it on  she asked no more questions her eager face passed suddenly into a state of repose something seemed to have come into her mindafter the doctors answer to her own questionwhich absorbed her in herself when oscar recovered his consciousness she left it to me to answer the first natural questions which he put when he personally addressed her she spoke to him kindly but briefly something in her at that moment seemed to keep her apart even from him when the doctor proposed taking him back to browndown she did not insist as i had anticipated on going with them she took leave of him tenderlybut still she let him go while he yet lingered near the door looking back at her she moved away slowly to the further end of the room selfwithdrawn into her own dark worldshut up in her thoughts from him and from us  the doctor tried to rouse her  you must not think too seriously of this he said following her to the window at which she stood and dropping his voice so that oscar could not hear him he has himself told you that he feels lighter and better than he felt before the fit it has relieved instead of injuring him there is no danger i assure you on my honor there is nothing to fear  can you assure me on your honor of one other thing she asked lowering her voice on her side can you honestly tell me that this is not the first of other fits that are to come  the doctor parried the question  we will have another medical opinion he answered before we decide the next time i go to see him a physician from brighton shall go with me  oscar who had thus far waited wondering at the change in her now opened the door the doctor returned to him they left us  she sat down on the windowseat with her elbows on her knees and her hands grasping her forehead a long moaning cry burst from her she said to herself bitterly the one wordfarewell  i approached her feeling the necessity of reminding her that i was in the room  farewell to what i asked taking my place by her side  to his happiness and to mine she answered without lifting her head from her hands the dark days are coming for oscar and for me  why should you think that you heard what the doctor said  the doctor doesnt know what i know  what do you know  she paused before she answered me do you believe in fate she said suddenly breaking the silence  i believe in nothing which encourages people to despair of themselves i replied  she went on without heeding me  what caused the fit which seized him in this room the blow that struck him on the head how did he receive the blow in trying to defend what was his and what was mine what had he been doing on the day when the thieves entered the house he had been working on the casket which was meant for me do you see those events linked together in one chain i believe the fit will be followed by some next event springing out of it something else is coming to darken his life and to darken mine there is no weddingday near for us the obstacles are rising in front of him and in front of me the next misfortune is very near us you will see you will see she shivered as she said those words and shrinking away from me huddled herself up in a corner of the windowseat  it was useless to dispute with her and worse than useless to sit there and encourage her to say more i got up on my feet  there is one thing i believe in i said cheerfully i believe in the breeze on the hills come for a walk  she shrank closer into her corner and shook her head  let me be she broke out impatiently leave me by myself she rose repenting the words the moment they were utteredshe put her arm round my neck and kissed me i didnt mean to speak so harshly said the gentle affectionate creature sister my heart is heavy my life to come never looked so dark to my blind eyes as it looks now a tear dropped from those poor sightless eyes on my cheek she turned her head aside abruptly forgive me she murmured and let me go before i could answer she hurried away to hide herself in her room the sweet girl how you would have pitied herhow you would have loved her  i went out alone for my walk she had not infected me with her superstitious foreboding of ill things to come but there was one sad word that she had said in which i could not but agree after what i had witnessed in that room the weddingday did indeed look further off than ever    chapter the eighteenth  family troubles  in four or five days more lucillas melancholy doubts about oscar were confirmed he was attacked by a second fit  the promised consultation with the physician from brighton took place our new doctor did not encourage us to hope the second fit following so close on the first was in his opinion a bad sign he gave general directions for the treatment of oscar and left him to decide for himself whether he would or would not try change of scene no change the physician appeared to think would exert any immediate influence on the recurrence of the epileptic attacks the patients general health might be benefited and that was all as for the question of the marriage he declared without hesitation that we must for the present dismiss all consideration of it from our minds  lucilla received the account of what passed at the visit of the doctors with a stubborn resignation which it distressed me to see remember what i told you when the first attack seized him she said our summertime is ended our winter is come  her manner while she spoke was the manner of a person who is waiting without hopewho feels deliberately that calamity is near she only roused herself when oscar came in he was naturally enough in miserable spirits under the sudden alteration in all his prospects lucilla did her best to cheer him and succeeded on my side i tried vainly to persuade him to leave browndown and amuse himself in some gayer place he shrank from new faces and new scenes between these two unelastic young people i felt even my native good spirits beginning to sink if we had been all three down in the bottom of a dry well in a wilderness we could hardly have surveyed a more dismal prospect than the prospect we were contemplating now by good luck oscar like lucilla was passionately fond of music we turned to the piano as our best resource in those days of our adversity lucilla and i took it in turns to play and oscar listened i have to report that we got through a great deal of music i have also to acknowledge that we were very dull    as for reverend finch he talked his way through his share of the troubles that were trying us now at the full compass of his voice  if you had heard the little priest in those days you would have supposed that nobody could feel our domestic misfortunes as he felt them and grieve over them as he grieved he was a sight to see on the day of the medical consultation strutting up and down his wifes sittingroom and haranguing his audiencecomposed of his wife and myself mrs finch sat in one corner with the baby and the novel and the petticoat and the shawl i occupied the other corner summoned to consult with the rector in plain words summoned to hear mr finch declare that he was the person principally overshadowed by the cloud which hung on the household  i despair madame pratolungoi assure you i despairof conveying any idea of how i feel under this most melancholy state of things you have been very good you have shown the sympathy of a true friend but you cannot possibly understand how this blow has fallen on me i am crushed madame pratolungo he appealed to me in my corner mrs finch he appealed to his wife in her corneri am crushed there is no other word to express it but the word i have used crushed he stopped in the middle of the room he looked expectantly at mehe looked expectantly at his wife his face and manner said plainly if both these women faint i shall consider it a natural and becoming proceeding on their parts after what i have just told them i waited for the lead of the lady of the house mrs finch did not roll prostrate with the baby and the novel on the floor thus encouraged i presumed to keep my seat the rector still waited for us i looked as miserable as i could mrs finch cast her eyes up reverentially at her husband as if she thought him the noblest of created beings and silently put her handkerchief to her eyes mr finch was satisfied mr finch went on my health has sufferedi assure you madame pratolungo my health has suffered since this sad occurrence my stomach has given way my balance is lostmy usual regularity is gone i am subjectentirely through this miserable businessto fits of morbid appetite i want things at wrong timesbreakfast in the middle of the night dinner at four in the morning i want something now mr finch stopped horrorstruck at his condition pondering with his eyebrows fiercely knit and his hand pressed convulsively on the lower buttons of his rusty black waistcoat mrs finchs watery blue eyes looked across the room at me in a moist melancholy of conjugal distress the rector suddenly enlightened after his consultation with his stomach strutted to the door flung it wide open and called down the kitchen stairs with a voice of thunder poach me an egg he came back into the roomheld another consultation keeping his eyes severely fixed on mestrutted back in a furious hurry to the doorand bellowed a counterorder down the kitchenstairs no egg do me a red herring he came back for the second time with his eyes closed and his hand laid distractedly on his head he appealed alternately to mrs finch and to me see for yourselvesmrs finch madame pratolungosee for yourselves what a state i am in its simply pitiable i hesitate about the most trifling things first i think i want a poached eggthen i think i want a red herringnow i dont know what i want upon my word of honor as a clergyman and a gentleman i dont know what i want morbid appetite all day morbid wakefulness all nightwhat a condition i cant rest i disturb my wife at night mrs finch i disturb you at night how many timessince this misfortune fell upon usdo i turn in bed before i fall off to sleep eight times are you certain of it dont exaggerate are you certain you counted very well good creature i never rememberi assure you madame pratolungo i never remembersuch a complete upset as this before the nearest approach to it was some years since at my wifes last confinement but four mrs finch was it at your last confinement but four or your last but five your last but four are you sure are you certain you are not misleading our friend here very well good creature pecuniary difficulties madame pratolungo were at the bottom of it on that last occasion i got over the pecuniary difficulties how am i to get over this my plans for oscar and lucilla were completely arranged my relations with my wedded children were pleasantly laid out i saw my own future i saw the future of my family what do i see now all so to speak annihilated at a blow inscrutable providence he paused and lifted his eyes and hands devotionally to the ceiling the cook appeared with the red herring inscrutable providenceproceeded mr finch a tone lower eat it dear said mrs finch while its hot the rector paused again his unresting tongue urged him to proceed his undisciplined stomach clamored for the herring the cook uncovered the dish mr finchs nose instantly sided with mr finchs stomach he stopped at inscrutable providenceand peppered his herring  having reported how the rector spoke in the presence of the disaster which had fallen on the family i have only to complete the picture by stating next what he did he borrowed two hundred pounds of oscar and left off commanding red herrings in the day and disturbing mrs finch at night immediately afterwards    the dull autumn days ended and the long nights of winter began  no change for the better appeared in our prospects the doctors did their best for oscarwithout avail the horrible fits came back again and again day after day our dull lives went monotonously on i almost began now to believe with lucilla that a crisis of some sort must be at hand this cannot last i used to say to myselfgenerally when i was very hungry something will happen before the year comes to an end  the month of december began and something happened at last the family troubles at the rectory were matched by family troubles of my own a letter arrived for me from one of my younger sisters at paris it contained alarming news of a person very dear to mealready mentioned in the first of these pages as my good papa  was the venerable author of my being dangerously ill of a mortal disease alas he was not exactly thatbut the next worst thing to it he was dangerously in love with a disreputable young woman at what age at the age of seventyfive what can we say of my surviving parent we can only say this is a vigorous nature papa has an evergreen heart  i am grieved to trouble you with my family concerns but they mix themselves up intimately as you will see in due time with the concerns of oscar and lucilla it is my unhappy destiny that i cannot possibly take you through the present narrative without sooner or later disclosing the one weakness amiable weakness of the gayest and brightest and bestpreserved man of his time  ah i am now treading on eggshells i know the english specter called propriety springs up rampant on my writingtable and whispers furiously in my ear madame pratolungo raise a blush on the cheek of innocence and it is all over from that moment with you and your story oh inflammable cheek of innocence be goodnatured for once and i will rack my brains to try if i can put it to you without offense may i picture good papa as an elder in the temple of venus burning incense inexhaustibly on the altar of love no temple of venus is pagan altar of love is not propertake them out let me only say of my evergreen parent that his life from youth to age had been one unintermitting recognition of the charms of the sex and that my sisters and i being of the sex could not find it in our hearts to abandon him on that account so handsome so affectionate so sweettempered with only one faultand that a compliment to the women who naturally adored him in return we accepted our destiny for years past since the death of mamma we accustomed ourselves to live in perpetual dread of his marrying some one of the hundreds of unscrupulous hussies who took possession of him and worse if possible than that of his fighting duels about them with men young enough to be his grandsons papa was so susceptible papa was so brave over and over again i had been summoned to interfere as the daughter who had the strongest influence over him i had succeeded in effecting his rescue now by one means and now by another ending always however in the same sad way by the sacrifice of money for damageson which damages when the woman is shameless enough to claim them my verdict is serve her right  on the present occasion it was the old story over again my sisters had done their best to stop it and had failed i had no choice but to appear on the sceneto begin perhaps by boxing her ears to end certainly by filling her pockets  my absence at this time was something more than an annoyanceit was a downright grief to my blind lucilla on the morning of my departure she clung to me as if she was determined not to let me go  what shall i do without you she said it is hard in these dreary days to lose the comfort of hearing your voice i shall feel all my security gone when i feel you no longer near me how many days shall you be away  a day to get to paris i answered and a day to get backtwo five days if i can do it in the time to thunderstrike the hussy and to rescue papaseven let us say if possible a week  you must be back no matter what happen before the new year  why  i have my yearly visit to pay to my aunt it has been twice put off i must absolutely go to london on the last day of the old year and stay there my allotted three months in miss batchfords house i had hoped to be oscars wife before the time came round again she waited a moment to steady her voice that is all over now we must be parted if i cant leave you here to console him and to take care of him come what may of iti shall stay at dimchurch  her staying at dimchurch while she was still unmarried meant under the terms of her uncles will sacrificing her fortune if reverend finch had heard her he would not even have been able to say inscrutable providencehe would have lost his senses on the spot  dont be afraid i said i shall be back lucilla before you go besides oscar may get better he may be able to follow you to london and visit you at your aunts  she shook her head with such a sad sad doubt of it that the tears came into my eyes i gave her a last kissand hurried away  my route was to newhaven and then across the channel to dieppe i dont think i really knew how fond i had grown of lucilla until i lost sight of the rectory at the turn in the road to brighton my natural firmness deserted me i felt torturing presentiments that some great misfortune would happen in my absence i astonished myselfi the widow of the spartan pratolungoby having a good cry like any other woman  sooner or later we susceptible people pay with the heartache for the privilege of loving no matter heartache or not one must have something to love in this world as long as one lives in it i have lived in itnever mind how many yearsand i have got lucilla before lucilla i had the doctor before the doctorah my friends we wont look back beyond the doctor    chapter the nineteenth  second result of the robbery  the history of my proceedings in paris can be dismissed in a very few words it is only necessary to dwell in detail on one among the many particulars which connect themselves in my memory with the rescue of good papa  the affair this time assumed the gravest possible aspect the venerable victim had gone the length of renewing his youth in respect of his teeth his hair his complexion and his figure this last involving the purchase of a pair of stays i declare i hardly knew him again he was so outrageously and unnaturally young the utmost stretch of my influence was exerted over him in vain he embraced me with the most touching fervour he expressed the noblest sentimentsbut in the matter of his contemplated marriage he was immovable life was only tolerable to him on one condition the beloved object or deathsuch was the programme of this volcanic old man  to make the prospect more hopeless still the beloved object proved on this occasion to be a bold enough woman to play her trump card at starting  i give the jade her due she assumed a perfectly unassailable attitude we had her full permission to break off the matchif we could i refer you to your father pray understand that i dont wish to marry him if his daughters object to it he has only to say release me from that moment he is free there was no contending against such a system of defence as this we knew as well as she did that our fascinated parent would not say the word our one chance was to spend money in investigating the antecedent indiscretions of the ladys life and to produce against her proof so indisputable that not even an old mans infatuation could say this is a lie  we disbursed we investigated we secured our proof it took a fortnight at the end of that time we had the necessary materials in hand for opening the eyes of good papa  in the course of the inquiry i was brought into contact with many strange peopleamong others with a man who startled me at our first interview by presenting a personal deformity which with all my experience of the world i now saw oddly enough for the first time  the mans face instead of exhibiting any of the usual shades of complexion was hideously distinguished by a superhumani had almost said a devilishcolouring of livid blackish blue he proved to be a most kind intelligent and serviceable person but when we first confronted each other his horrible color so startled me that i could not repress a cry of alarm he not only passed over my involuntary act of rudeness in the most indulgent mannerhe explained to me the cause which had produced his peculiarity of complexion so as to put me at my ease before we entered on the delicate private inquiry which had brought us together  i beg your pardon said this unfortunate man for not having warned you of my disfigurement before i entered the room there are hundreds of people discolored as i am in the various parts of the civilized world and i supposed that you had met in the course of your experience with other examples of my case the blue tinge in my complexion is produced by the effect on the blood of nitrate of silvertaken internally it is the only medicine which relieves sufferers like me from an otherwise incurable malady we have no alternative but to accept the consequences for the sake of the cure  he did not mention what his malady had been and i abstained it is needless to say from questioning him further i got used to his disfigurement in the course of my relations with him and i should no doubt have forgotten my blue man in attending to more absorbing matters of interest if the effects of nitrate of silver as a medicine had not been once more unexpectedly forced on my attention in another quarter and under circumstances which surprised me in no ordinary degree  having saved papa on the brink oflet us say his twentieth precipice it was next necessary to stay a few days longer and reconcile him to the hardship of being rescued in spite of himself you would have been greatly shocked if you had seen how he suffered he gnashed his expensive teeth he tore his beautifully manufactured hair in the fervour of his emotions i have no doubt he would have burst his new staysif i had not taken them away and sold them halfprice and made to that small extent a profit out of our calamity to set against the loss do what one may in the detestable system of modern society the pivot on which it all turns is money money when you are saving freedom money when you are saving papa is there no remedy for this a word in your ear wait till the next revolution  during the time of my absence i had of course corresponded with lucilla  her letters to mevery sad and very shortreported a melancholy state of things at dimchurch while i had been away the dreadful epileptic seizures had attacked oscar with increasing frequency and increasing severity the moment i could see my way to getting back to england i wrote to lucilla to cheer her with the intimation of my return two days only before my departure from paris i received another letter from her i was weak enough to be almost afraid to open it her writing to me again when she knew that we should be reunited at such an early date suggested that she must have some very startling news to communicate my mind misgave me that it would prove to be news of the worst sort  i summoned courage to open the envelope ah what fools we are for once that our presentments come right they prove a hundred times to be wrong instead of distressing me the letter delighted me our gloomy prospect was brightening at last  thusfeeling her way over the paper in her large childish characterslucilla wrote  dearest friend and sisteri cannot wait until we meet to tell you my good news the brighton doctor has been dismissed and a doctor from london has been tried instead my dear for intellect there is nothing like london the new man sees thinks and makes up his mind on the spot he has a way of his own of treating oscars case and he answers for curing him of the horrible fits there is news for you come back and let us jump for joy together how wrong i was to doubt the future never never never will i doubt it again this is the longest letter i have ever written  your affectionate  lucilla  to this a postscript was added in oscars handwriting as follows  lucilla has told you that there is some hope for me at last what i write in this place is written without her knowledgefor your private ear only take the first opportunity you can find of coming to see me at browndown without allowing lucilla to hear of it i have a great favor to ask of you my happiness depends on your granting it you shall know what it is when we meet  oscar  this postscript puzzled me  it was not in harmony with the implicit confidence which i had observed oscar to place habitually in lucilla it jarred on my experience of his character which presented him to me as the reverse of a reserved secretive man his concealment of his identity when he first came among us had been a forced concealmentdue entirely to his horror of being identified with the hero of the trial in all the ordinary relations of life he was open and unreserved to a fault that he could have a secret to keep from lucilla and to confide to me was something perfectly unintelligible to my mind it highly excited my curiosity it gave me a new reason for longing to get back  i was able to make all my arrangements and to bid adieu to my father and my sisters on the evening of the twentythird early on the morning of the twentyfourth i left paris and reached dimchurch in time for the final festivities in celebration of christmas eve  the first hour of christmas day had struck on the clock in our own pretty sittingroom before i could prevail upon lucilla to let me rest after my journey in bed she was now once more the joyous lighthearted creature of our happier time and she had so much to say to me that not even her father himself on this occasion could have talked her down the next morning she paid the penalty of exciting herself overnight when i went into her room she was suffering from a nervous headache and was not able to rise at her usual hour she proposed of her own accord that i should go alone to browndown to see oscar on my return it is only doing common justice to myself to say that this was a relief to me if she had had the use of her eyes my conscience would have been easy enoughbut i shrank from deceiving my dear blind girl even in the slightest things  so with lucillas knowledge and approval i went to oscar alone  i found him fretful and anxiousready to flame out into one of his sudden passions on the smallest provocation not the slightest reflection of lucillas recovered cheerfulness appeared in lucillas lover  has she said anything to you about the new doctor were the first words he addressed to me  she has told me that she feels the greatest faith in him i answered she firmly believes that he speaks the truth in saying he can cure you  did she show any curiosity to know how he is curing me  not the slightest curiosity that i could see it is enough for her that you are to be cured the rest she leaves to the doctor  my last answer appeared to relieve him he sighed and leaned back in his chair thats right he said to himself im glad to hear that  is the doctors treatment of you a secret i asked  it must be a secret from lucilla he said speaking very earnestly if she attempts to find it out she must be keptfor the present at leastfrom all knowledge of it nobody has any influence over her but you i look to you to help me  is this the favor you had to ask me  yes  am i to know the secret of the medical treatment  certainly how can i expect you to help me unless you know what a serious reason there is for keeping lucilla in the dark  he laid a strong emphasis on the two words serious reason i began to feel a little uneasy i had never yet taken the slightest advantage of my poor lucillas blindness and here was her promised husbandof all the people in the worldproposing to me to keep her in the dark  is the new doctors treatment dangerous i inquired  not in the least  is it not so certain as he has led lucilla to believe  it is quite certain  did the other doctors know of it  yes  why did they not try it  they were afraid  afraid what is the treatment  medicine  many medicines or one  only one  what is the name of it  nitrate of silver  i started to my feet looked at him and dropped back into my chair  my mind reverted the instant i recovered myself to the effect produced on me when the blue man in paris first entered my presence in informing me of the effect of the medicine he had you will remember concealed from me the malady for which he had taken it it had been left to oscar of all the people in the world to enlighten meand that by a reference to his own case i was so shocked that i sat speechless  with his quick sensibilities there was no need for me to express myself in words my face revealed to him what was passing in my mind  you have seen a person who has taken nitrate of silver he exclaimed  have you i asked  i know the price i pay for being cured he answered quietly  his composure staggered me how long have you been taking this horrible drug i inquired  a little more than a week  i see no change in you yet  the doctor tells me there will be no visible change for weeks and weeks to come  those words roused a momentary hope in me there is time to alter your mind i said for heavens sake reconsider your resolution before it is too late  he smiled bitterly weak as i am he answered for once my mind is made up  i suppose i took a womans view of the matter i lost my temper when i looked at his beautiful complexion and thought of the future  are you in your right senses i burst out do you mean to tell me that you are deliberately bent on making yourself an object of horror to everybody who sees you  the one person whose opinion i care for he replied will never see me  i understood him at last that was the consideration which had reconciled him to it  lucillas horror of dark people and dark shades of color of all kinds was it is needless to say recalled to my memory by the turn the conversation was taking now had she confessed it to him as she had confessed it to me no i remembered that she had expressly warned me not to admit him into our confidence in this matter at an early period of their acquaintance she had asked him which of his parents he resembled this led him into telling her that his father had been a dark man lucillas delicacy had at once taken the alarm he speaks very tenderly of his dead father she said to me it may hurt him if he finds out the antipathy i have to dark people let us keep it to ourselves as things now were it was on the tip of my tongue to remind him that lucilla would hear of his disfigurement from other people and then to warn him of the unpleasant result that might follow on reflection however i thought it wiser to wait a little and sound his motives first  before you tell me how i can help you i said i want to know one thing more have you decided in this serious matter entirely by yourself have you taken no advice  i dont want advice he answered sharply my case admits of no choice even such a nervous undecided creature as i am can judge for himself where there is no alternative  did the doctors tell you there was no alternative i asked  the doctors were afraid to tell me i had to force it out of them i said i appeal to your honor to answer a plain question plainly is there any certain prospect of my getting the better of the fits they only said at your time of life we may reasonably hope so i pressed them closercan you fix a date to which i may look forward as the date of my deliverance they could neither of them do it all they could say was our experience justifies us in believing that you will grow out of it but it does not justify us in saying when then i may be years growing out of it they were obliged to own that it might be so or i may never grow out of it at all they tried to turn the conversation i wouldnt have it i said tell me honestly is that one of the possibilities in my case the dimchurch doctor looked at the london doctor the london man said if you will have it it is one of the possibilities just consider the prospect which his answer placed before me day after day week after week month after month always in danger go where i may of falling down in a fitis that a miserable position or is it not  how could i answer him what could i say  he went on  add to that wretched state of things that i am engaged to be married the hardest disappointment which can fall on a man falls on me the happiness of my life is within my reachand i am forbidden to enjoy it it is not only my health that is broken up my prospects in life are ruined as well the woman i love is a woman forbidden to me while i suffer as i suffer now realize thatand then fancy you see a man sitting at this table here with pen ink and paper before him who has only to scribble a line or two and to begin the cure of you from that moment deliverance in a few months from the horror of the fits marriage in a few months to the woman you love that heavenly prospect in exchange for the hellish existence that you are enduring now and the one price to pay for it a discolored face for the rest of your lifewhich the one person who is dearest to you will never see would you have hesitated when the doctor took up the pen to write the prescriptiontell me if you had been in my place would you have said no  i still sat silent my obstinacywomen are such mulesdeclined to give way even when my conscience told me that he was right  he sprang to his feet in the same fever of excitement which i remembered so well when i had irritated him at browndown into telling me who he really was  would you have said no he reiterated stooping over me flushed and heated as he had stooped on that first occasion when he had whispered his name in my ear would you he repeated louder and louderwould you  at the third reiteration of the words the frightful contortion that i knew so well seized on his face the wrench to the right twisted his body he dropped at my feet good god who could have declared that he was wrong with such an argument in his favor as i saw at that moment who would not have said that any disfigurement would be welcome as a refuge from this  the servant ran in and helped me to move the furniture to a safe distance from him there wont be much more of it maam said the man noticing my agitation and trying to compose me in a month or two the doctor says the medicine will get hold of him i could say nothing on my sidei could only reproach myself bitterly for disputing with him and exciting him and leading perhaps to the hideous seizure which had attacked him in my presence for the second time  the fit on this occasion was a short one perhaps the drug was already beginning to have some influence over him in twenty minutes he was able to resume his chair and to go on talking to me  you think i shall horrify you when my face has turned blue he said with a faint smile dont i horrify you now when you see me in convulsions on the floor  i entreated him to dwell on it no more  god knows i said you have convinced meobstinate as i am let us try to think of nothing now but of the prospect of your being cured what do you wish me to do  you have great influence over lucilla he said if she expresses any curiosity in future conversations with you about the effect of the medicine check her at once keep her as ignorant of it as she is now  why  why if she knows what you know how will she feel shocked and horrified as you felt what will she do she will come straight here and try as you have tried to persuade me to give it up is that true or not  impossible to deny that it was true  i am so fond of her he went on that i can refuse her nothing she would end in making me give it up the instant her back was turned i should repent my own weakness and return to the medicine here is a perpetual struggle in prospect for a man who is already worn out is it desirable after what you have just seen to expose me to that  it would have been useless cruelty to expose him to it how could i do otherwise than consent to make his sacrifice of himselfhis necessary sacrificeas easy as i could at the same time i implored him to remember one thing  mind i said we can never hope to keep her in ignorance of the change in you when the change comes sooner or later some one will let the secret out  i only want it to be concealed from her while the disfigurement of me is in progress he answered when nothing she can say or do will alter iti will tell her myself she is so happy in the hope of my recovery what good can be gained by telling her beforehand of the penalty that i pay for my deliverance my ugly color will never terrify my poor darling as for other persons i shall not force myself on the view of the world it is my one wish to live out of the world the few people about me will soon get reconciled to my face lucilla will set them the example she wont trouble herself long about a change in me that she can neither feel nor see  ought i to have warned him here of lucillas inveterate prejudice and of the difficulty there might be in reconciling her to the change in him when she heard of it i dare say i ought i daresay i was to blame in shrinking from inflicting new anxieties and new distresses on a man who had already suffered so much the simple truth isi could not do it would you have done it ah if you would i hope i may never come in contact with you what a horrid wretch you must be the end of it was that i left the housepledged to keep lucilla in ignorance of the cost at which oscar had determined to purchase his cure until oscar thought fit to enlighten her himself    chapter the twentieth  good papa again  the promise i had given did not expose me to the annoyance of being kept long on the watch against accidents if we could pass safely over the next five days we might feel pretty sure of the future on the last day of the old year lucilla was bound by the terms of the will to go to london and live her allotted three months under the roof of her aunt  in the brief interval that elapsed before her departure she twice approached the dangerous subject  on the first occasion she asked me if i knew what medicine oscar was taking i pleaded ignorance and passed at once to other matters on the second occasion she advanced still further on the way to discovery of the truth she now inquired if i had heard how the physic worked the cure having been already informed that the fits proceeded from a certain disordered condition of the brain she was anxious to know whether the medical treatment was likely to affect the patients head this question which i was of course unable to answer she put to both the doctors already warned by oscar they quieted her by declaring that the process of cure acted by general means and did not attack the head from that moment her curiosity was satisfied her mind had other objects of interest to dwell on before she left dimchurch she touched on the perilous topic no more  it was arranged that i was to accompany lucilla to london oscar was to follow us when the state of his health permitted him to take the journey as betrothed husband of lucilla he had his right of entry during her residence in her aunts house as for me i was admitted at lucillas intercession she declined to be separated from me for three months  miss batchford wrote most politely to offer me a hospitable welcome during the day she had no second spareroom at her disposalso we settled that i was to sleep at a lodginghouse in the neighborhood in this same house oscar was also to be accommodated when the doctors sanctioned his removal to london it was now thought likelyif all went wellthat the marriage might be celebrated at the end of the three months from miss batchfords residence in town  three days before the date of lucillas departure these plansso far as i was concerned in themwere all overthrown  a letter from paris reached me with more bad news my absence had produced the worst possible effect on good papa  the moment my influence had been removed he had become perfectly unmanageable my sisters assured me that the abominable woman from whom i had rescued him would most certainly end in marrying him after all unless i reappeared immediately on the scene what was to be done nothing was to be done but to fly into a rageto grind my teeth and throw down all my things in the solitude of my own roomand then to go back to paris  lucilla behaved charmingly when she saw how angry and how distressed i was she suppressed all exhibition of disappointment on her side with the truest and kindest consideration for my feelings write to me often said the charming creature and come back to me as soon as you can her father took her to london two days before they left i said goodbye at the rectory and at browndown and startedonce more by the newhaven and dieppe routefor paris  i was in no humour as your english saying is to mince matters in controlling this new outbreak on the part of my evergreen parent i insisted on instantly removing him from paris and taking him on a continental tour i was proof against his paternal embraces i was deaf to his noble sentiments he declared he should die on the road when i look back at it now i am amazed at my own cruelty i said en route papaand packed him up and took him to italy  he became enamored at intervals now of one fair traveler and now of another all through the journey from paris to rome wonderful old man arrived at romethat hotbed of the enemies of mankindi saw my way to putting a moral extinguisher on the author of my being the eternal city contains three hundred and sixtyfive churches and say three million and sixtyfive pictures i insisted on his seeing them allat the advanced age of seventyfive years the sedative result followed exactly as i had anticipated i stupefied good papa with churches and picturesand then i tried him with a marble woman to begin with he fell asleep before the venus of the capitol when i saw that i said to myself now he will do don juan is reformed at last  lucillas correspondence with meat first cheerfulgradually assumed a desponding tone  six weeks had passed since her departure from dimchurch and still oscars letters held out no hope of his being able to join her in london his recovery was advancing but not so rapidly as his medical adviser had anticipated it was possibleto look the worst in the face boldlythat he might not get the doctors permission to leave browndown before the time arrived for lucillas return to the rectory in this event he could only entreat her to be patient and to remember that though he was gaining ground but slowly he was still getting on under these circumstances lucilla was naturally vexed and dejected she had never she wrote from her girlhood upward spent such a miserable time with her aunt as she was spending now  on reading this letter i instantly smelt something wrong  i corresponded with oscar almost as frequently as with lucilla his last letter to me flatly contradicted his last letter to his promised wife in writing to my address he declared himself to be rapidly advancing towards recovery under the new treatment the fits succeeded each other at longer and longer intervals and endured a shorter and shorter time here then was plainly a depressing report sent to lucilla and an encouraging report sent to me  what did it mean  oscars next letter to me answered the question  i told you in my last he wrote that the discoloration of my skin had begun the complexion which you were once so good as to admire has disappeared for ever i am now of a livid ashen colorso like death that i sometimes startle myself when i look in the glass in about six weeks more as the doctor calculates this will deepen to a blackish blue and then the saturation as he calls it will be complete  so far from feeling any useless regrets at having taken the medicine which is producing these ugly effects i am more grateful to my nitrate of silver than words can say if you ask for the secret of this extraordinary exhibition of philosophy on my part i can give it in one line for the last ten days i have not had a fit in other words for the last ten days i have lived in paradise i declare i would have cheerfully lost an arm or a leg to gain the blessed peace of mind the intoxicating confidence in the futureit is nothing lessthat i feel now  still there is a drawback which prevents me from enjoying perfect tranquillity even yet when was there ever a pleasure in this world without a lurking possibility of pain hidden away in it somewhere  i have lately discovered a peculiarity in lucilla which is new to me and which has produced a very unpleasant impression on my mind my proposed avowal to her of the change in my personal appearance has now become a matter of far more serious difficulty than i had anticipated when the question was discussed between you and me at browndown  have you ever found out that the strongest antipathy she has is her purely imaginary antipathy to dark people and to dark shades of color of all kinds this strange prejudice is the result as i suppose of some morbid growth of her blindness quite as inexplicable to herself as to other people explicable or not there it is in her read the extract that follows from one of her letters to her father which her father showed to meand you will not be surprised to hear that i tremble for myself when the time comes for telling her what i have done  thus she writes to mr finch  i am sorry to say i have had a little quarrel with my aunt it is all made up now but it has hardly left us such good friends as we were before last week there was a dinnerparty here and among the guests was a hindoo gentleman converted to christianity to whom my aunt has taken a great fancy while the maid was dressing me i unluckily inquired if she had seen the hindooand hearing that she had i still more unfortunately asked her to tell me what he was like she described him as being very tall and lean with a dark brown complexion and glittering black eyes my mischievous fancy instantly set to work on this horrid combination of darknesses try as i might to resist it my mind drew a dreadful picture of the hindoo as a kind of monster in human form i would have given worlds to have been excused from going down into the drawingroom at the last moment i was sent for and the hindoo was introduced to me the instant i felt him approaching my darkness was peopled with brown demons he took my hand i tried hard to control myselfbut i really could not help shuddering and starting back when he touched me to make matters worse he sat next to me at dinner in five minutes i had long lean blackeyed beings all round me perpetually growing in numbers and pressing closer and closer on me as they grew it ended in my being obliged to leave the table when the guests were all gone my aunt was furious i admitted my conduct was unreasonable in the last degree at the same time i begged her to make allowances for me i reminded her that i was blind at a year old and that i had really no idea of what any person was like except by drawing pictures of them in my imagination from description and from my own knowledge obtained by touch i appealed to her to remember that situated as i am my fancy is peculiarly liable to play me tricks and that i have no sight to see with and to show meas other peoples eyes show themwhen they have taken a false view of persons and things it was all in vain my aunt would admit of no excuse for me i was so irritated by her injustice that i reminded her of an antipathy of her own quite as ridiculous as minean antipathy to cats she who can see that cats are harmless shudders and turns pale for all that if a cat is in the same room with her set my senseless horror of dark people against her senseless horror of catsand say which of us has the right to be angry with the other  such was the quotation from lucillas letter to her father at the end of it oscar resumed as follows  i wonder whether you will now understand me if i own to you that i have made the worst of my case in writing to lucilla it is the only excuse i can produce for not joining her in london weary as i am of our long separation i cannot prevail on myself to run the risk of meeting her in the presence of strangers who would instantly notice my frightful color and betray it to her think of her shuddering and starting back from my hand when it took hers no no i must choose my own opportunity in this quiet place of telling her what i suppose must be toldwith time before me to prepare her mind for the disclosure if it must come and with nobody but you near to see the first mortifying effect of the shock which i shall inflict on her  i have only to add before i release you that i write these lines in the strictest confidence you have promised not to mention my disfigurement to lucilla unless i first give you leave i now more than ever hold you to that promise the few people about me here are all pledged to secrecy as you are if it is really inevitable that she should know the truthi alone must tell it in my own way and at my own time    if it must come if it is really inevitablethese phrases in oscars letter satisfied me that he was already beginning to comfort himself with an insanely delusive ideathe idea that it might be possible permanently to conceal the ugly personal change in him from lucillas knowledge  if i had been at dimchurch i have no doubt i should have begun to feel seriously uneasy at the turn which things appeared to be taking now  but distance has a very strange effect in altering ones customary way of thinking of affairs at home being in italy instead of in england i dismissed lucillas antipathies and oscars scruples as both alike unworthy of serious consideration sooner or later time i considered would bring these two troublesome young people to their senses their marriage would follow and there would be an end of it in the meanwhile i continued to feast good papa on holy families and churches ah poor dear how he yawned over caraccis and cupolas and how fervently he promised never to fall in love again if i would only take him back to paris  we set our faces homeward a day or two after the receipt of oscars letter i left my reformed father resting his aching old bones in his own easychair capable perhaps even yet of contracting a platonic attachment to a lady of his own time of lifebut capable as i firmly believed of nothing more oh my child let me rest he said when i wished him goodbye and never show me a church or a picture again as long as i live    chapter the twentyfirst  madame pratolungo returns to dimchurch  i reached london in the last week of lucillas residence under her aunts roof and waited in town until it was time to take her back to dimchurch  as soon as it had become obviously too late for oscar to risk the dreaded meeting with lucilla before strangers his correspondence had as a matter of course assumed a brighter tone she was in high spirits once more poor thing when we metand full of delight at having me near her again we thoroughly enjoyed our few days in londonand took our fill of music at operas and concerts i got on excellently well with the aunt until the last day when something happened which betrayed me into an avowal of my political convictions  the old ladys consternation when she discovered that i looked hopefully forward to a coming extermination of kings and priests and a general redistribution of property all over the civilized globe is unutterable in words on that occasion i made one more aristocrat tremble i also closed miss batchfords door on me for the rest of my life no matter the day is coming when the batchford branch of humanity will not possess a door to close all europe is drifting nearer and nearer to the pratolungo programme cheer up my brothers without land and my sisters without money in the funds we will have it out with the infamous rich yet long live the republic  early in the month of april lucilla and i took leave of the metropolis and went back to dimchurch  as we drew nearer and nearer to the rectory as lucilla began to flush and fidget in eager anticipation of her reunion with oscar that uneasiness of mind which i had so readily dismissed while i was in italy began to find its way back to me again my imagination now set to work at drawing picturesstartling pictures of oscar as a changed being as a medusas head too terrible to be contemplated by mortal eyes where would he meet us at the entrance to the village no at the rectory gate no in the quieter part of the garden which was at the back of the house yes there he stood waiting for usalone  lucilla flew into his arms with a cry of delight i stood behind and looked at them  ah how vividly i rememberat the moment when she embraced himthe first shock of seeing the two faces together the drug had done its work i saw her fair cheek laid innocently against the livid blackish blue of his discolored skin heavens how cruelly that first embrace marked the contrast between what he had been when i left him and what he had changed to when i saw him now his eyes turned from her face to mine in silent appeal to me while he held her in his arms their look told me the thought in him as eloquently as if he had put it into words you who love her saycan we ever be cruel enough to tell her of this  i approached to take his hand at the same moment lucilla suddenly drew back from him laid her left hand on his shoulder and passed her right hand rapidly over his face  for an instant i felt my heart stand still her miraculous sensitiveness of touch had detected the dark color of my dress on the day when we first met would it serve her this time as truly as it had served her then  she paused after the first passage of her fingers over his face with the breathless attention to what she was about which in my own case i remembered so well a second time she passed her hand over himconsidered againand turned my way next  what does his face tell you she asked it tells me that he has something on his mind what is it  we were safeso far the hateful medicine in altering the color had not affected the texture of his skin as her touch had left it on her departure so her touch found it again on her return  before i could reply to lucilla oscar answered for himself  nothing is wrong my darling he said my nerves are a little out of order today and the joy of seeing you again has overcome me for the momentthat is all  she shook her head impatiently  no she said its not all she touched his heart why is it beating so fast she took his hand in hers why has it turned so cold i must know i will know come indoors  at that awkward moment the most wearisome of living men suddenly proved himself to be the most welcome of living men the rector appeared in the garden to receive his daughter on her return enfolded in reverend finchs paternal embraces harangued by reverend finchs prodigious voice lucilla was effectually silencedthe subject was inevitably changed oscar drew me aside out of hearing while her attention was diverted from him  i saw you he said you were horrified at the first sight of me you were relieved when you found that her touch told her nothing help me to keep her from suspecting it for two months moreand you will be the best friend that ever man had  two months i repeated  yes if there is no return of the fits in two months the doctor will consider my recovery complete lucilla and i may be married at the end of the time  my friend oscar are you contemplating a fraud on lucilla  what do you mean  come come you know what i mean is it honorable first to entrap her into marrying youand then to confess to her the color of your face  he sighed bitterly  i shall fill her with horror of me if i confess it look at me look at me he said lifting his ghastly hands in despair to his blue face  i was determined not to give wayeven to that  be a man i said own it boldly what is she going to marry you for for your face that she can never see no for your heart that is one with her own trust to her natural good senseand better than that to the devoted love that you have inspired in her she will see her stupid prejudice in its true light when she feels it trying to part her from you  no no no remember her letter to her father i shall lose her for ever if i tell her now  i took his arm and endeavored to lead him to lucilla she as already trying to escape from her father she was already longing to hear the sound of oscars voice again  he obstinately shrank back i began to feel angry with him in another moment i should have said or done something that i might have repented of afterwardsif a new interruption had not happened before i could open my lips  another person appeared in the gardenthe manservant from browndown with a letter for his master in his hand  this has just come sir said the man by the afternoon post it is marked immediate i thought i had better bring it to you here  oscar took the letter and looked at the address my brothers writing he exclaimed a letter from nugent  he opened the letterand burst out with a cry of joy which brought lucilla instantly to his side  what is it she asked eagerly  nugent is coming back nugent will be here in a week oh lucilla my brother is coming to stay with me at browndown  he caught her in his arms and kissed her in the first rapture of receiving that welcome news she forced herself away from him without answering a word she turned her poor blind face round and round in the search for me  here i am i said  she roughly and angrily put her arm in mine i saw the jealous misery in her face as she dragged me away with here to the house never yet had oscars voice in her experience of him sounded the note of happiness that she heard in it now never yet had she felt oscars heart on oscars lips as she felt it when he kissed her in the first joy of anticipating nugents return  can he hear me she whispered when we had left the lawn and she felt the gravel under her feet  no what is it  i hate his brother    chapter the twentysecond  the twinbrothers letter  little thinking what a storm he had raised poor innocent oscarpaternally escorted by the rectorfollowed us into the house with his open letter in his hand  judging by certain signs visible in my reverend friend i concluded that the announcement of nugent dubourgs coming visit to dimchurchregarded by the rest of us as heralding the appearance of a twinbrotherwas regarded by mr finch as promising the arrival of a twinfortune oscar and nugent shared the comfortable paternal inheritance finch smelt money  compose yourself i whispered to lucilla as the two gentlemen followed us into the sittingroom your jealousy of his brother is a childish jealousy there is room enough in his heart for his brother as well as for you  she only repeated obstinately with a vicious pinch on my arm i hate his brother  come and sit down by me said oscar approaching her on the other side i want to run over nugents letter its so interesting there is a message in it to you too deeply absorbed in his subject to notice the sullen submission with which she listened to him he placed her on a chair and began reading the first lines he explained relate to nugents return to england and to his delightful idea of coming to stay with me at browndown then he goes on i found all your letters waiting for me on my return to new york need i tell you my dearest brother  lucilla stopped him at those words by rising abruptly from her seat  what is the matter he asked  i dont like this chair  oscar got her anotheran easychair this timeand returned to the letter  need i tell you my dearest brother how deeply you have interested me by the announcement of your contemplated marriage your happiness is my happiness i feel with you i congratulate you i long to see my future sisterinlaw  lucilla got up again oscar in astonishment asked what was wrong now  i am not comfortable at this end of the room  she walked to the other end of the room patient oscar walked after her with his precious letter in his hand he offered her a third chair she petulantly declined to take it and selected another chair for herself oscar returned to the letter  how melancholy and yet how interesting it is to hear that she is blind my sketches of american scenery happened to be lying about in the room when i read your letter the first thought that came to me on hearing of miss finchs affliction was suggested by my sketches i said to myself sad sad my sisterinlaw will never see my works the true artist oscar is always thinking of his works i shall bring back let me tell you some very remarkable studies for future pictures they will not be so numerous perhaps as you may expect i prefer to trust to my intellectual perception of beauty rather than to mere laborious transcripts from nature in certain moods of mine speaking as an artist nature puts me out there oscar paused and appealed to me what writingeh i always told you madame pratolungo that nugent was a genius you see it now dont get up lucilla i am going on there is a message to you in this part of the letter so neatly expressed  lucilla persisted in getting up the announcement of the neatlyexpressed message to be read next produced no effect on her she walked to the window and trifled impatiently with the flowers placed in it oscar looked in mild astonishment first at methen at the rector reverend finchlistening thus far with the complimentary attention due to the correspondence of one young man of fortune with another young man of fortuneinterfered in oscars interests to secure him a patient hearing  my dear lucilla endeavor to control your restlessness you interfere with our enjoyment of this interesting letter i could wish to see fewer changes of place my child and a more undivided attention to what oscar is reading to you  i am not interested in what he is reading to me in the nervous irritation which produced this ungracious answer she overthrew one of the flowerpots oscar set it up again for her with undiminished goodtemper  not interested he exclaimed wait a little you havent heard nugents message yet listen to this present my best and kindest regards to the future mrs oscar dear fellow and say that she has given me a new interest in hastening my return to england there isnt that prettily put come lucilla own that nugent is worth listening to when he writes about you  she turned towards him for the first time the charm of the tone in which he spoke those words subdued her in spite of herself  i am much obliged to your brother she answered gently and very much ashamed of myself for what i said just now she stole her hand into his and whispered you are so fond of nugenti begin to be almost afraid there will be no love left for me  oscar was enchanted wait till you see him and you will be as fond of him as i am he said nugent is not like me he fascinates people the moment they come in contact with him nobody can resist nugent  she still held his hand with a perplexed and saddened face the admirable absence of any jealousy on his sidehis large and generous confidence in her love for himwas just the rebuke to her that she could feel just the rebuke also in my opinion that she had deserved  go on oscar said the rector in his deepest notes of encouragement what next dear boy what next  another interesting bit of quite a new kind oscar replied there is a little mystery to stir us up on the last page of the letter nugent saysi have become acquainted here in new york with a very remarkable man a german who has made a great deal of money in the united states he proposes visiting england early in the present year and he will write and let me know when he has arrived i shall feel particular pleasure in presenting him to you and your future wife it is quite possible that you may have special reason to congratulate yourselves on making his acquaintance for the present no more of my new friend until we meet at browndownspecial reason to congratulate ourselves on making his acquaintance repeated oscar folding up the letter nugent never writes in that way without a reason for it who can the german gentleman be  mr finch suddenly lifted his head and looked at oscar with a certain appearance of alarm  your brother mentions that he has made his fortune in america said the reverend gentleman i hope he is not connected with the moneymarket he might infect mr nugent with the spirit of reckless speculation which is so to speak the national sin of the united states your brother having no doubt the same generous disposition as yours  a far finer disposition than mine mr finch interposed oscar  possessed like you of the gifts of fortune proceeded the rector with mounting enthusiasm  once possessed of them said oscar far from being overburdened with the gifts of fortune now  what cried mr finch with a start of consternation  nugent has run through his fortune proceeded oscar quite composedly i lent him the money to go to america my brother is a genius mr finch when did you ever hear of a genius who could keep within limits nugent is not content to live in my humble way he has the tastes of a princemoney is nothing to him it doesnt matter he will make a new fortune out of his pictures and in the meantime you know i can always lend him something to go on with  mr finch rose from his seat with the air of a man whose just anticipations have not been realizedwhose innocent confidence has been scandalously betrayed here was a prospect another person in perpetual want of money going to settle under the shadow of the rectory another man likely to borrow of oscarand that man his brother  i fail to take your light view of your brothers extravagance said the rector addressing oscar with his loftiest severity of manner at the door i deplore and reprehend mr nugents misuse of the bounty bestowed on him by an allwise providence you will do well to consider before you encourage your brothers extravagance by lending him money what does the great poet of humanity say of lenders the bard of avon tells us that loan oft loses both itself and friend lay that noble line to heart oscar lucilla be on your guard against that restlessness which i have already had occasion to reprove i find i must leave you madame pratolungo i had forgotten my parish duties my parish duties are waiting for me good day good day  he looked round on us all three in turn with a very sour face and walked out surely i thought to myself this brother of oscars is not beginning well first the daughter takes offense at him and now the father follows her example even on the other side of the atlantic mr nugent dubourg exercises a malignant influence and disturbs the family tranquillity before he has shown his nose in the house    nothing more that is worth recording happened on that day we had a very dull evening lucilla was out of spirits as for me i had not yet had time to accustom myself to the shocking spectacle of oscars discolored face i was serious and silent you would never have guessed me to be a frenchwoman if you had seen me for the first time on the occasion of my return to the rectory  the next day a small domestic event happened which must be chronicled in this place  our dimchurch doctor always dissatisfied with his position in an obscure country place had obtained an appointment in india which offered great professional advantages to an ambitious man he called to take leave of us on his departure i found an opportunity of speaking to him about oscar he entirely agreed with me that the attempt to keep the change produced in his former patient by the nitrate of silver from lucillas knowledge was simply absurd the truth would reach her he said before many days were over our heads with that prediction addressed to my private ear he left us the removal of him from the scene was you will please to bear in mind the removal of an important local witness to the medical treatment of oscar and was as such an incident with a bearing of its own on the future which claims a place for it in the present narrative  two more days passed and nothing happened on the morning of the third day the doctors prophecy was all but fulfilled through the medium of the wandering arab of the family our funny little jicks  while lucilla and i were strolling about the garden with oscar the child suddenly darted out on us from behind a tree and seizing oscar round the legs hailed him affectionately at the top of her voice as the blue man lucilla instantly stopped and said who do you call the blue man jicks answered boldly oscar lucilla caught the child up in her arms why do you call oscar the blue man she asked jicks pointed to oscars face and then remembering lucillas blindness appealed to me you tell her said jicks in high glee oscar seized my hand and looked at me imploringly i determined not to interfere it was bad enough to remain passive and to let her be kept in the dark actively i was resolved to take no part in deceiving her her color rose she put jicks down on the ground are you both dumb she asked oscar i insist on knowing ithow have you got the nickname of the blue man left helpless oscar to my disgust took refuge in a lieand worse still a clumsy lie he declared that he had got his nickname in the nursery at the time of lucillas absence in london by one day painting his face in the character of bluebeard to amuse the children if lucilla had felt the faintest suspicion of the truth blind as she was she must now have discovered it as things were oscar annoyed and irritated her i could see that it cost her a struggle to suppress something like a feeling of contempt for him amuse the children the next time in some other way she said though i cant see you still i dont like to hear of your disfiguring your face by painting it blue with that answer she walked away a little by herself evidently disappointed in her betrothed husband for the first time in her experience of him  he cast another imploring look at me did you hear what she said about my face he whispered  you have lost an excellent opportunity of speaking out i answered i believe you will bitterly regret the folly and the cruelty of deceiving her  he shook his head with the immovable obstinacy of a weak man  nugent doesnt think as you do he said handing me the letter read that bit therenow lucilla is out of hearing  i paused for a moment before i could read the resemblance between the twins extended even to their handwritings if i had picked nugents letter up i should have handed it to oscar as a letter of oscars own writing  the paragraph to which he pointed only contained these linesyour last relieves my anxiety about your health i entirely agree with you that any personal sacrifice which cures you of those horrible attacks is a sacrifice wisely made as to your keeping the change a secret from the young lady i can only say that i suppose you know best how to act in this emergency i will abstain from forming any opinion of my own until we meet  i handed oscar back the letter  there is no very warm approval there of the course you are taking i said the only difference between your brother and me is that he suspends his opinion and that i express mine  i have no fear of my brother oscar answered nugent will feel for me and understand me when he comes to browndown in the meantime this shall not happen again  he stooped over jicks the child while we were talking had laid herself down luxuriously on the grass and was singing to herself little snatches of a nursery song oscar pulled her up on her legs rather roughly he was out of temper with her as well as with himself  what are you going to do i asked  i am going to see mr finch he answered and to have jicks kept for the future out of lucillas garden  does mr finch approve of your silence  mr finch madame pratolungo leaves me to decide on a matter which concerns nobody but lucilla and myself  after that reply there was an end of all further remonstrance from me as a matter of course  oscar walked off with his prisoner to the house jicks trotted along by his side unconscious of the mischief she had done singing another verse of the nursery song i rejoined lucilla with my mind made up as to the line of conduct i should adopt in the future if oscar did succeed in keeping the truth concealed from her i was positively resolved come what might of it to enlighten her before they were married with my own lips what after pledging myself to keep the secret yes perish the promise which makes me false to a person whom i love i despise such promises from the bottom of my heart  two days more slipped byand then a telegram found its way to browndown oscar came running to us at the rectory with his news nugent had landed at liverpool oscar was to expect him at dimchurch on the next day    chapter the twentythird  he sets us all right  i have thus far quite inadvertently omitted to mention one of the prominent virtues of reverend finch he was an accomplished master of that particular form of human persecution which is called reading aloud and he inflicted his accomplishment on his family circle at every available opportunity of what we suffered on these occasions i shall say nothing let it be enough to mention that the rector thoroughly enjoyed the pleasure of hearing his own magnificent voice  there was no escaping mr finch when the rage for reading seized on him now on one pretense and now on another he descended on us unfortunate women book in hand seated us at one end of the room placed himself at the other opened his dreadful mouth and fired words at us like shots at a target by the hour together sometimes he gave us poetical readings from shakespeare or milton and sometimes parliamentary speeches by burke or sheridan read what he might he made such a noise and such a fuss over it he put his own individuality so prominently in the foremost place and he kept the poets or the orators whom he was supposed to be interpreting so far in the back ground that they lost every trace of character of their own and became one and all perfectly intolerable reflections of mr finch i date my first unhappy doubts of the supreme excellence of shakespeares poetry from the rectors readings and i attribute to the same exasperating cause my implacable hostility on every question of the time to the policy of mr burke on the evening when nugent dubourg was expected at browndownand when we particularly wanted to be left alone to dress ourselves and to gossip by anticipation about the expected visitormr finch was seized with one of his periodical rages for firing off words at his family after tea he selected hamlet as the medium for exhibiting his voice on this occasion and he declared as the principal motive for taking his elocutionary exercise that the object he especially had in view was the benefit of poor me  my good creature i accidentally heard you reading to lucilla the other day it was very nice as far as it wentvery nice indeed but you will allow meas a person madame pratolungo possessing considerable practice in the art of reading aloudto observe that you might be benefited by a hint or two i will give you a few ideas mrs finch i propose giving madame pratolungo a few ideas pay particular attention if you please to the pauses and to the management of the voice at the end of the lines lucilla my child you are interested in this the perfecting of madame pratolungo is a matter of considerable importance to you dont go away  lucilla and i happened on that evening to be guests at the rectory table it was one of the regular occasions on which we left our own side of the house and joined the family at what mr finch called the pastors evening meal he had got his wife he had got his eldest daughter he had got your humble servant a horrid smile of enjoyment overspread the reverend gentlemans face as he surveyed us from the opposite end of the room and opened his vocal fire on his audience of three  hamlet act the first scene the first elsinore a platform before the

let that domestic person tremble nonot a servant guestsheavens be praised guests welcome gentlemenwelcome no more hamlet tonight thanks to you enter two characters who must be instantly attended tomr oscar dubourg introducing his twinbrother from america mr nugent dubourg    astonishment at the extraordinary resemblance between them was the one impression felt by all three of us as the brothers entered the room  exactly alike in their height in their walk in their features and in their voices both with the same colored hair and the same beardless faces oscars smile exactly reflected on nugents lips oscars odd little semiforeign tricks of gesticulation with his hands exactly reproduced in the hands of nugent and to crown it all there was the complexion which oscar had lost for ever just a shade darker perhaps found again on nugents cheeks the one difference which made it possible to distinguish between them at the moment when they first appeared together in the room was also the one difference which lucilla was physically incapable of detectingthe terrible contrast of color between the brother who bore the blue disfigurement of the drug and the brother who was left as nature had made him  delighted to make your acquaintance mrs finchi have long wished for this pleasure thank you mr finch for all your kindness to my brother madame pratolungo i presume permit me to shake hands it is needless to say i have heard of your illustrious husband aha heres a baby yours mrs finch girl or boy maam a fine childif a bachelor may be allowed to pronounce an opinion tweettweettweet  he chirruped to the baby as if he had been a family man and snapped his fingers gaily poor oscars blue face turned in silent triumph towards me what did i tell you his look asked did i not say nugent fascinated everybody at first sight most true an irresistible man so utterly different in his manner from oscarexcept when he was in reposeand yet so like oscar in other respects i can only describe him as his brother completed he had the pleasant lively flow of spirits the easy winning gentlemanlike confidence in himself which oscar wanted and then what excellent taste he possessed he liked children he respected the memory of my glorious pratolungoin half a minute from the time when he entered the room nugent dubourg had won mrs finchs heart and mine  he turned from the baby to mr finch and pointed to the open shakespeare on the table  you were reading to the ladies he said i am afraid we have interrupted you   dont mention it said the rector with his lofty politeness another time will do it is a habit of mine mr nugent to read aloud in my family circle as a clergyman and a lover of poetry in both capacities i have long cultivated the art of elocution  my dear sir excuse me you have cultivated it all wrong  mr finch paused thunderstruck a man in his presence presuming to have an opinion of his own a man in the rectory parlor capable of interrupting the rector in the middle of a sentence guilty of the insane audacity of telling him as a readerwith shakespeare open before themthat he read wrong  oh we heard you as we came in proceeded nugent with the most undiminished confidence expressed in the most gentlemanlike manner you read it like this he took up hamlet and read the opening line of the fourth scene the air bites shrewdly it is very cold with an irresistiblyaccurate imitation of mr finch thats nor the way hamlet would speak no man in his position would remark that it was very cold in that bowwow manner what is shakespeare before all things true to nature always true to nature what condition is hamlet in when he is expecting to see the ghost he is nervous and he feels the cold let him show it naturally let him speak as any other man would speak under the circumstances look here quick and quietlike this the air bites shrewdlythere hamlet stops and shiverspurrerrer it is very cold thats the way to read shakespeare  mr finch lifted his head into the air as high as it could possibly go and brought the flat of his hand down with a solemn and sounding smack on the open book  allow me to say sir he began  nugent stopped him again more goodhumouredly than ever  you dont agree with me all right quite useless to dispute about it i dont know what you may bei am the most opinionated man in existence sheer waste of time my dear sir to attempt convincing me now just look at that child here mr nugent dubourgs attention was suddenly attracted by the baby he twisted round on his heel and addressed mrs finch i take the liberty of saying maam that a more senseless dress doesnt exist than the dress that is put in this country on infants of tender years what are the three main functions which that childthat charming child of yoursperforms he sucks he sleeps and he grows at the present moment he isnt sucking he isnt sleepinghe is growing with all his might under those interesting circumstances what does he want to do to move his limbs freely in every direction you let him swing his arms to his hearts contentand you deny him freedom to kick his legs you clothe him in a dress three times as long as himself he tries to throw his legs up in the air as he throws his arms and he cant do it there is his senseless long dress entangling itself in his toes and making an effort of what nature intended to be a luxury can anything be more absurd what are mothers about why dont they think for themselves take my adviceshort petticoats mrs finch liberty glorious liberty for my young friends legs room heaps of room for that infant martyrs toes  mrs finch listened helplesslylifted the babys long petticoats and looked at themstared piteously at nugent dubourgopened her lips to speakand thinking better of it turned her watery eyes on her husband appealing to him to take the matter up mr finch made another attempt to assert his dignitya ponderously satirical attempt this time  in offering your advice to my wife mr nugent said the rector you must permit me to remark that it would have had more practical force if it had been the advice of a married man i beg to remind you  you beg to remind me that it is the advice of a bachelor oh come that really wont do at this time of day doctor johnson settled that argument at once and for ever a century since sir he said to somebody of your way of thinking you may scold your carpenter when he has made a bad table though you cant make a table yourself i say to youmr finch you may point out a defect in a babys petticoats though you havent got a baby yourself doesnt that satisfy you all right take another illustration look at your room here i can see in the twinkling of an eye that its badly lit you have only got one windowyou ought to have two is it necessary to be a practical builder to discover that absurd are you satisfied now no take another illustration whats this printed paper here on the chimneypiece assessed taxes ha assessed taxes will do youre not in the house of commons youre not chancellor of the exchequerbut havent you an opinion of your own about taxation in spite of that must you and i be in parliament before we can presume to see that the feeble old british constitution is at its last gasp  and the vigorous young republic drawing its first breath of life i burst in introducing the pratolungo programme as my way is at every available opportunity  nugent dubourg instantly wheeled round in my direction and set me right on my subject just as he had set the rector right on reading hamlet and mrs finch right on clothing babies  not a bit of it he pronounced positively the young republic is the ricketty child of the political family give him up maam you will never make a man of him  i tried to assert myself as the rector had tried before mewith precisely the same result i appealed indignantly to the authority of my illustrious husband  doctor pratolungo i began  was an honest man interposed nugent dubourg i am an advanced liberal myselfi respect him but he was quite wrong all sincere republicans make the same mistake they believe in the existence of public spirit in europe amiable delusion public spirit is dead in europe public spirit is the generous emotion of young nations of new peoples in selfish old europe private interest has taken its place when your husband preached the republic on what ground did he put it on the ground that the republic was going to elevate the nation pooh ask me to accept the republic on the ground that i elevate myselfand supposing you can prove it i will listen to you if you are ever to set republican institutions going in the old worldthere is the only motive power that will do it  i was indignant at such sentiments my glorious husband i began again  would have died rather than appeal to the meanest instincts of his fellowcreatures just so there was his mistake thats why he never could make anything of the republic thats why the republic is the ricketty child of the political family quod erat demonstrandum said nugent dubourg finishing me off with a pleasant smile and an easy indicative gesture of the hand which said now i have settled these three people in succession i am equally well satisfied with myself and with them  his smile was irresistible bent as i was on disputing the degrading conclusions at which he had arrived i really had not fire enough in me at the moment to feed my own indignation as to reverend finch he sat silently swelling in a corner digesting as he best might the discovery that there was another man in the world besides the rector of dimchurch with an excellent opinion of himself and with perfectly unassailable confidence and fluency in expressing it in the momentary silence that now followed oscar got his first opportunity of speaking he had thus far been quite content to admire his clever brother he now advanced to me and asked what had become of lucilla  the servant told me she was here he said i am so anxious to introduce her to nugent  nugent put his arm affectionately round his brothers neck and gave him a hug dear old boy i am just as anxious as you are  lucilla went out a little while since i said to take a turn in the garden  ill go and find her said oscar wait here nugent ill bring her in  he left the room before he could close the door one of the servants appeared to claim mrs finchs private ear on some mysterious domestic emergency nugent facetiously entreated her as she passed him to clear her mind of prejudice and consider the question of infant petticoats on its own merits mr finch took offense at this second reference to the subject he rose to follow his wife  when you are a married man mr dubourg said the rector severely you will learn to leave the management of an infant in its mothers hands  theres another mistake remarked nugent following him with unabated good humour to the door a married mans idea of another man as a husband always begins and ends with his idea of himself he turned to me as the door closed on mr finch now we are alone madame pratolungo he said i want to speak to you about miss finch there is an opportunity before she comes in oscars letter only told me that she was blind i am naturally interested in everything that relates to my brothers future wife i am particularly interested about this affliction of hers may i ask how long she has been blind  since she was a year old i replied  through an accident  no  after a fever or a disease of any other sort  i began to feel a little surprised at his entering into these medical details  i never heard that it was through a fever or other illness i said so far as i know the blindness came on unexpectedly from some cause that did not express itself to the people about her at the time  he drew his chair confidentially nearer to mine how old is she he asked  i began to feel more than a little surprised and i showed it i suppose on telling him lucillas age  as things are now he explained there are reasons which make me hesitate to enter on the question of miss finchs blindness either with my brother or with any members of the family i must wait to speak about it to them until i can speak to good practical purpose there is no harm in my starting the subject with you when she first lost her sight no means of restoring it were left untried of course  i should suppose not i replied its so long since i have never asked  so long since he repeatedand then considered for a moment  his reflections ended in a last question  she is resigned i supposeand everybody about her is resignedto the idea of her being hopelessly blind for life  instead of answering him i put a question on my side my heart was beginning to beat rapidlywithout my knowing why  mr nugent dubourg i said what have you got in your mind about lucilla  madame pratolungo he replied i have got something in my mind which was put into it by a friend of mine whom i met in america  the friend you mentioned in your letter to your brother  the same  the german gentleman whom you propose to introduce to oscar and lucilla  yes  may i ask who he is  nugent dubourg looked at me attentively considered with himself for the second time and answered in these words  he is the greatest living authority and the greatest living operator in diseases of the eye  the idea in his mind burst its way into my mind in a moment  gracious god i exclaimed are you mad enough to suppose that lucillas sight can be restored after a blindness of oneandtwenty years  he suddenly held up his hand in sign to me to be silent  at the same moment the door opened and lucilla followed by oscar entered the room    chapter the twentyfourth  he sees lucilla  the first impression which poor miss finch produced on nugent dubourg was precisely the same as the first impression which she had produced on me  good heavens he cried the dresden madonna the virgin of san sisto  lucilla had already heard from me of her extraordinary resemblance to the chief figure in raphaels renowned picture nugents blunt outburst of recognition passed unnoticed by her she stopped short in the middle of the roomstartled the instant he spoke by the extraordinary similarity of his tone and accent to the tone and accent of his brothers voice  oscar she asked nervously are you behind me or in front of me oscar laughed and answered herespeaking behind her she turned her head towards the place in front of her from which nugent had spoken your voice is wonderfully like oscars she said addressing him timidly is your face exactly like his face too may i judge for myself of the likeness between you i can only do it in one wayby my touch  oscar advanced and placed a chair for his brother by lucillas side  she has eyes in the tips of her fingers he said sit down nugent and let her pass her hand over your face  nugent obeyed him in silence now that the first impression of surprise had passed away i observed that a marked change was beginning to assert itself in his manner  little by little an unnatural constraint got possession of him his fluent tongue found nothing to talk about his easy movements altered in the strangest way until they almost became the movements of a slow awkward man he was more like his brother than ever as he sat down in the chair to submit himself to lucillas investigation she had produced at first sightas well as i could judgesome impression on him for which he had not been prepared causing some mental disturbance in him which he was for the moment quite unable to control his eyes looked up at her spellbound his color came and went his breath quickened audibly when her fingers touched his face  whats the matter said oscar looking at him in surprise  nothing is the matter he answered in the low absent tone of a man whose mind was secretly pursuing its own train of thought  oscar said no more once twice three times lucillas hand passed slowly over nugents face he submitted to it silently gravely immovablya perfect contrast to the talkative lively young man of half an hour since lucilla employed a much longer time in examining him than she had occupied in examining me  while the investigation was proceeding i had leisure to think again over what had passed between nugent and me on the subject of lucillas blindness before she entered the room my mind had by this time recovered its balance i was able to ask myself what this young fellows daring idea was really worth was it within the range of possibility that a sense so delicate as the sense of sight lost for oneandtwenty years could be restored by any means short of a miracle it was monstrous to suppose it the thing could not be if there had been the faintest chance of giving my poor dear back the blessing of sight that chance would have been tried by competent persons years and years since i was ashamed of myself for having been violently excited at the moment by the new thought which nugent had started in my mind i was honestly indignant at his uselessly disturbing me with the vainest of all vain hopes the one wise thing to do in the future was to caution this flighty and inconsequent young man to keep his mad notion about lucilla to himselfand to dismiss it from my own thoughts at once and for ever  just as i arrived at that sensible resolution i was recalled to what was going on in the room by lucillas voice addressing me by my name  the likeness is wonderful she said still i think i can find a difference between them  the only difference between them was in the contrast of complexion and in the contrast of mannerboth these being dissimilarities which appealed more or less directly to the eye  what difference do you find i asked  she slowly came towards me with an anxious perplexed face pondering as she advanced  i cant explain it she answeredafter a long silence  when lucilla left him nugent rose from his chair he abruptlyalmost roughlytook his brothers hand he spoke to his brother in a strangely excited feverish headlong way  my dear fellow now i have seen her i congratulate you more heartily than ever she is charming she is unique oscar i could almost envy you if you were anyone else  oscar was radiant with delight his brothers opinion ranked above all human opinions in his estimation before he could say a word in return nugent left him as abruptly as he had approached him walking away by himself to the windowand standing there looking out  lucilla had not heard him she was still pondering with the same perplexed face the likeness between the twins was apparently weighing on her mindan unsolved problem that vexed and irritated it without anything said by me to lead to resuming the subject she returned obstinately to the assertion that she had just made  i tell you again i am sensible of a difference between them she repeatedthough you dont seem to believe me  i interpreted this uneasy reiteration as meaning that she was rather trying to convince herself than to convince me in her blind condition it was doubly and trebly embarrassing not to know one brother from the other i understood her unwillingness to acknowledge thisi felt in her position how it would have irritated me she was waitingimpatiently waitingfor me to say something on my side i am as you know already an indiscreet woman i innocently said one of my rash things  i believe whatever you tell me my dear i answered you can find out a difference between them i have no doubt still i own i should like to see it put to the proof  her color rose how she asked abruptly  try your touch alternately on both their faces i suggested without knowing beforehand which position they each of them occupy make three trialsleaving them to change their places or not between each trial just as they please if you guess which is which correctly three times following there will be the proof that you can really lay your hand on a difference between them  lucilla shrank from accepting the challenge she drew back a step and silently shook her head nugent who had overheard me turned round suddenly from the window and supported my proposal  a capital notion he burst out lets try it you dont object oscardo you  i object cried oscaramazed at the bare idea of his opposing any assertion of his will to the assertion of his brothers will if lucilla is willing i say yes with all my heart  the two brothers approached us arm in arm lucilla very reluctantly allowed herself to be persuaded into trying the experiment two chairs exactly alike were placed in front of her at a sign from nugent oscar silently took the chair on her right by this arrangement the hand which she had used in touching nugents face would be now the hand that she would employ in touching oscars face when they were both seated i announced that we were ready lucilla placed her hands on their faces right and left without the faintest idea in her mind of the positions which the two relatively occupied  after first touching them with both hands and both together she tried them separately next beginning with oscar and using her right hand only she left him for nugent again using her right handthen came back to him againthen returned to nugenthesitateddecidedtapped nugent lightly on the head  oscar she said  nugent burst out laughing the laugh told her before any of us could speak that she had made a mistake at the first attempt  try again lucilla said oscar kindly  never she answered angrily stepping back from both of them one mystification is enough  nugent tried next to persuade her to renew the experiment she checked him sternly at the first word  do you think if i wont do it for oscar she said that i would do it for you you laughed at me what was there to laugh at your brothers features are your features your brothers hair is your hair your brothers height is your height what is there so very ridiculouswith such a resemblance as thatin a poor blind girl like me mistaking you one for the other i wish to preserve a good opinion of you for oscars sake dont turn me into ridicule againor i shall be forced to think that your brothers good heart is not yours also  nugent and oscar looked at each other petrified by this sudden outbreak nugent of the two being the most completely overwhelmed by it  i attempted to interfere and put things right my easy philosophy and my volatile french nature failed to see any adequate cause for this vehement exhibition of resentment on lucillas part something in my tone as i suppose only added to her irritation i in my turn was checked sternly at the first word you proposed it she said you are the most to blame i hastened to make my apologies inwardly remarking that the habit of raising a storm in a teacup is a growing habit with the rising generation in england nugent followed me with more apologies on his side oscar supported us with his superior influence he took lucillas handkissed itand whispered something in her ear the kiss and the whisper acted like a charm she held out her hand to nugent she put her arm round my neck and embraced me with all her own grace and sweetness forgive me she said to us gently i wish i could learn to be patient but oh mr nugent it is sometimes so hard to be blind i can repeat the words but i can give no idea of the touching simplicity with which they were spokenof her innocently earnest anxiety to win her pardon she so affected nugent that he tooafter a look at oscar which said may ikissed the hand that she offered to him as his lips touched her she started the bright flush which always indicated the sudden rising of a thought in her mind flew over her face she unconsciously held nugents hand in her own absorbed in the interest of realizing the new thought for a moment she stood still as a statue consulting with herself the moment passed she dropped nugents hand and turned gaily to me  will you think me very obstinate she asked  why my love  i am not satisfied yet i want to try again  no no at any rate not today  i want to try again she repeated not in your way in a way of my own that has just come into my head she turned to oscar will you humour me in this it is needless to set down oscars reply she turned to nugent will you  only say what you wish me to do he answered  go with your brother she said to the other end of the room i know where you are each of you standing at this end madame pratolungo will lead me to the place and will put me just within reach of both your hands i want each of you in turn arrange by a sign between yourselves which is to begin to take my hand and hold it for a moment and then drop it i have an idea that i can distinguish between you in that wayand i want very much to try it  the brothers went silently to the other end of the room i led lucilla after them to the place in which they stood at my suggestion nugent was the first to take her hand as she had requested to hold it for a moment and then to drop it  nugent she said without the slightest hesitation  quite right i answered  she laughed gaily go on puzzle me if you possibly can  the brothers noiselessly changed places oscar took her hand standing exactly where nugent had stood  oscar she said  right again i told her  at a sign from nugent oscar took her hand for the second time she repeated his name at a sign from me the brothers noiselessly placed themselves one on either side of heroscar on the left nugent on the right i gave them the signal and they each took one of her hands at the same moment this time she waited a little longer before she spoke when she did speak she was right once more she turned smiling towards the left side pointed to him as he stood by her and said oscar  we were all three equally surprised i examined oscars hand and nugents hand alternately except the fatal difference in the color they were to all intents and purposes the same handsthe same size the same shape the same texture of skin no scar or mark on the hand of one to distinguish it from the hand of the other by what mysterious process of divination had she succeeded in discovering which was which  she was unwilling or unable to reply to that question plainly  something in me answers to one of them and not to the other she said  what is it i asked  i dont know it answers to oscar it doesnt answer to nugentthats all  she stopped any further inquiries by proposing that we should finish the evening with some music in her own sittingroom on the other side of the house when we were seated together at the pianofortewith the twinbrothers established as our audience at the other end of the roomshe whispered in my ear  ill tell you  tell me what  how i know which is which when they both of them take my hand when oscar takes it a delicious tingle runs from his hand into mine and steals all over me i cant describe it any better than that  i understand and when nugent takes your hand what do you feel  nothing  and that is how you found out the difference between them downstairs  that is how i shall always find out the difference between them if oscars brother ever attempts to play tricks upon my blindness he is quite capable of ithe laughed at my blindness that is how i shall find him out i told you before i saw him that i hated him i hate him still  my dear lucilla  i hate him still  she struck the first chords on the piano with an obstinate frown on her pretty brow our little evening concert began    chapter the twentyfifth  nugent puzzles madame pratolungo  i was far from sharing lucillas opinion of nugent dubourg his enormous selfconfidence was to my mind too amusing to be in the least offensive i liked the spirit and gaiety of the young fellow he came much nearer than his brother did to my ideal of the dash and resolution which ought to distinguish a man on the right side of thirty so far as my experience of them went nugent was in the popular english phrase good companyand oscar was not my nationality leads me to attach great importance to social qualities the higher virtues of a man only show themselves occasionally on compulsion his social qualities come familiarly in contact with us every day of our lives i like to be cheerful i am all for the social qualities  there was one little obstacle in those early days which set itself up between my sympathies and nugent  i was thoroughly at a loss to understand the impression which lucilla had produced on him  the same constraint which had in such a marked manner subdued him at his first interview with her still fettered him in the time when they became better acquainted with one another he was never in high spirits in her presence mr finch could talk him down without difficulty if mr finchs daughter happened to be by even when he was vaporing about himself and telling us of the wonderful things he meant to do in painting lucillas appearance was enough to check him if she happened to come into the room on the first day when he showed me his american sketches i define them if you ask my private opinion as false pretenses of art by a dashing amateuron that day he was in full flow marching up and down the room smacking his forehead and announcing himself quite gravely as the coming man in landscape painting  my mission madame pratolungo is to reconcile humanity and nature i propose to show on an immense scale how nature in her grandest aspects can adapt herself to the spiritual wants of mankind in your joy or your sorrow nature has subtle sympathies with you if you only know where to look for them my picturesno my poems in colorwill show you multiply my works as they certainly will be multiplied by means of printsand what does art become in my hands a priesthood in what aspect do i present myself to the public as a mere landscape painter no as grand consoler in the midst of this rhapsody how wonderfully he resembled oscar in his bursts of excitement while he was talkingin the full torrent of his predictions of his own coming greatness lucilla quietly entered the room the grand consoler shut up his portfolio dropped painting on the spot asked for music and sat down a model of conventional propriety in a corner of the room i inquired afterwards why he had checked himself when she came in did i he said i dont know why the thing was really inexplicable he honestly admired herone had only to notice him when he was looking at her to see it he had not the faintest suspicion of her dislike for himshe carefully concealed it for oscars sake he felt genuine sympathy for her in her afflictionhis mad idea that her sight might yet be restored was the natural offspring of a true feeling for her he was not unfavorable to his brothers marriageon the contrary he ruffled the rectors dignity he was always giving offense to mr finch by suggesting that the marriage might be hastened i heard him say the words myselfthe church is close by why cant you put on your surplice and make oscar happy tomorrow after breakfast more even than this he showed the most vivid interestlike a womans interest rather than a mansin learning how the loveaffair between oscar and lucilla had begun i referred him so far as oscar was concerned to his brother as the fountainhead of information he did not decline to consult his brother he did not own to me that he felt any difficulty in doing so he simply dropped oscar in silence and asked about lucilla how had it begun on her side i reminded him of his brothers romantic position at dimchurch and told him to judge for himself of the effect it would produce on the excitable imagination of a young girl he declined to judge for himself he persisted in appealing to me when i told the little lovestory of the two young people one event in it appeared to make a very strong impression on him the effect produced on lucilla when she first heard it by the sound of his brothers voice dwelt strangely on his mind he failed to understand it he ridiculed it he declined to believe it i was obliged to remind him that lucilla was blind and that love which in other cases first finds its way to the heart through the eyes could only in her case first find its way through the ears my explanation thus offered had its effect it set him thinking the sound of his voice he said to himself still turning the problem over and over in his mind people say my voice is exactly like oscars he added suddenly addressing himself to me do you think so too i answered that there could be no doubt of it he got up from his chair with a quick little shudder like a man who feels a chilland changed the subject on the next occasion when he and lucilla metso far from being more familiar with her he was more constrained than ever as it had begun between these two so it seemed likely to continue to the end in my society he was always at his ease in lucillas society never  what was the obvious conclusion which a person with my experience ought to have drawn from all this  i know well enough what it was now on my oath as an honest woman i failed to see it at the time we are not always suffer me to remind you consistent with ourselves the cleverest people commit occasional lapses into stupidityjust as the stupid people light up with gleams of intelligence at certain times you may have shown your usual good sense in conducting your affairs on monday tuesday and wednesday in the week but it doesnt at all follow from this that you may not make a fool of yourself on thursday account for it as you mayfor a much longer time than it suits my selfesteem to reckon up i suspected nothing and discovered nothing i noted his behavior in lucillas presence as odd behavior and unaccountable behaviorand that was all    during the first fortnight just mentioned the london doctor came to see oscar  he left again perfectly satisfied with the results of his treatment the dreadful epileptic malady would torture the patient and shock the friends about him no more the marriage might safely be celebrated at the time agreed on oscar was cured  the doctors visitreviving our interest in observing the effect of the medicinealso revived the subject of oscars false position towards lucilla nugent and i held a debate about it between ourselves i opened the interview by suggesting that we should unite our forces to persuade his brother into taking the frank and manly course nugent neither said yes nor no to that proposal at the outset he who made up his mind at a moments notice about everything else took time to decide on this one occasion  there is something that i want to know first he said i want to understand this curious antipathy of lucillas which my brother regards with so much alarm can you explain it  has oscar attempted to explain it i inquired on my side  he mentioned it in one of his letters to me and he tried to explain it when i asked on my arrival at browndown if lucilla had discovered the change in his complexion but he failed entirely to meet my difficulty in understanding the case  what is your difficulty  this so far as i can see she fails to discover intuitively the presence of dark people in a room or of dark colors in the ornaments of a room it is only when she is told that such persons or such things are present that her prejudice declares itself in what state of mind does such a strange feeling as this take its rise it seems impossible that she can have any conscious associations with colors pleasant or painfulif it is true that she was blind at a year old how do you account for it can there be such a thing as a purely instinctive antipathy remaining passive until external influences rouse it and resting on no sort of practical experience whatever  i think there may be i replied why when i was a child just able to walk did i shrink away from the first dog i saw who barked at me i could not have known at that age either by experience or teaching that a dogs bark is sometimes the prelude to a dogs bite my terror on that occasion was purely instinctive surely  ingeniously put he said but i am not satisfied yet  you must also remember i continued that she has a positively painful association with dark colors on certain occasions they sometimes produce a disagreeable impression on her nerves through her sense of touch she discovered in that way that i had a dark gown on on the day when i first saw her  and yet she touches my brothers face and fails to discover any alteration in it  i met that objection alsoto my own satisfaction though not to his  i am far from sure that she might not have made the discovery i said if she had touched him for the first time since the discoloration of his face but she examines him now with a settled impression in her mind derived from previous experience of what she has felt in touching his skin allow for the modifying influence of that impression on her sense of touchand remember at the same time that it is the color and not the texture of the skin that is changedand his escape from discovery becomes to my mind intelligible  he shook his head he owned he could not dispute my view but he was not content for all that  have you made any inquiries he asked about the period of her infancy before she was blind she may be still feeling indirectly and unconsciously the effect of some shock to her nervous system in the time when she could see  i have never thought of making inquiries  is there anybody within our reach who was familiarly associated with her in the first year of her life it is hardly likely i am afraid at this distance of time  there is a person now in the house i said her old nurse is still living  send for her directly  zillah appeared after first explaining what he wanted with her nugent went straight to the inquiry which he had in view  was your young lady ever frightened when she was a baby by any dark person or any dark thing suddenly appearing before her  never sir i took good care to let nothing come near her that could frighten herso long poor little thing as she could see  are you quite sure you can depend on your memory  quite sure sirwhen its a long time ago  zillah was dismissed nugentthus far unusually grave and unusually anxiousturned to me with an air of relief  when you proposed to me to join you in forcing oscar to speak out he said i was not quite easy in my mind about the consequences after what i have just heard my fear is removed  what fear i asked  the fear of oscars confession producing an estrangement between them which might delay the marriage i am against all delays i am especially anxious that oscars marriage should not be put off when we began our conversation i own to you i was of oscars opinion that he would do wisely to let marriage make him sure of his position in her affections before he risked the disclosure nowafter what the nurse has told usi see no risk worth considering  in short i said you agree with me  i agree with youthough i am the most opinionated man living the chances now seem to me to be all in oscars favor lucillas antipathy is not what i feared it wasan antipathy firmly rooted in a constitutional malady it is nothing more serious said nugent deciding the question at once and for ever with the air of a man profoundly versed in physiologyit is nothing more serious than a fanciful growth a morbid accident of her blindness she may live to get over itshe would i believe certainly get over it if she could see in two words after what i have found out this morning i say as you sayoscar is making a mountain out of a molehill he ought to have put himself right with lucilla long since i have unbounded influence over him it shall back your influence oscar shall make a clean breast of it before the week is out  we shook hands on that bargain as i looked at himbright and dashing and resolute oscar as i had always wished oscar to bei own to my shame i privately regretted that we had not met nugent in the twilight on that evening of ours which had opened to lucilla the gates of a new life  having said to each other all that we had to sayour two lovers being away together at the time for a walk on the hillswe separated as i then supposed for the rest of the day nugent went to the inn to look at a stable which he proposed converting into a studio no room at browndown being half large enough for the first prodigious picture with which the grand consoler in art proposed to astonish the world as for me having nothing particular to do i went out to see if i could meet oscar and lucilla on their return from their walk  failing to find them i strolled back by way of browndown nugent was sitting alone on the low wall in front of the house smoking a cigar he rose and came to meet me with his finger placed mysteriously on his lips  you mustnt come in he said you mustnt speak loud enough to be heard he pointed round the corner of the house to the little room at the side already familiar to you in these pages oscar and lucilla are shut up together there and oscar is making his confession to her at this moment  i lifted my hands and eyes in astonishment nugent went on  i see you want to know how it has all come about you shall knowwhile i was looking at the stable it isnt half big enough for a studio for me oscars servant brought me a little pencil note entreating me in oscars name to go to him directly at browndown i found him waiting out here dreadfully agitated he cautioned me just as i have cautioned you not to speak loud for the same reason too lucilla was in the house  i thought they had gone out for a walk i interposed  they did go out for a walk but lucilla complained of fatigue and oscar brought her back to browndown to rest well i inquired what was the matter the answer informed me that the secret of oscars complexion had forced its way out for the second time in lucillas hearing  jicks again i exclaimed  nonot jicks oscars own manservant this time  how did it happen  it happened through one of the boys in the village oscar and lucilla found the little imp howling outside the house they asked what was the matter the imp told them that the servant at browndown had beaten him lucilla was indignant she insisted on having the thing inquired into oscar left her in the drawingroom unluckily as it turned out without shutting the door called the man up into the passage and asked what he meant by illusing the boy the man answered i boxed his ears sir as an example to the rest of them what did he do rapped at the door sir with a stick he is not the first who has done it when you are out and asked if blue face was at home lucilla heard every word of it through the open door need i tell you what happened next  it was quite needless to relate that part of the story i remembered too well what had happened on the former occasion in the garden i saw too plainly that lucilla must have connected the two occurrences in her mind and must have had her ready suspicion roused to serious action as the necessary result  i understand i said of course she insisted on an explanation of course oscar compromised himself by a clumsy excuse and wanted you to help him what did you do  what i told you i should do this morning he had counted confidently on my taking his sideit was pitiable to see him poor fellow still for his own sake i refused to yield i left him the choice of giving her the true explanation himself or of leaving me to do it there wasnt a moment to lose she was in no humour to be trifled with i can tell you oscar behaved very well about ithe always behaves well when i drive him into a corner in one word he was man enough to feel that he was the right person to make a clean breast of itnot i i gave the poor old boy a hug to encourage him pushed him into the room shut the door on him and came out here he ought to have done it by this time he has done it here he comes  oscar ran out bareheaded from the house there were signs of disturbance in him as he approached us which warned me that something had gone wrong before he opened his lips  nugent spoke first  whats amiss now he asked have you told her the truth  i have tried to tell her the truth  tried what do you mean  oscar put his arm round his brothers neck and laid his head on his brothers shoulder without answering one word  i put a question to him on my side  did lucilla refuse to listen to you i asked  no  has she said anything or done anything  he lifted his head from his brothers shoulder and stopped me before i could finish the sentence  you need feel no anxiety about lucilla lucillas curiosity is satisfied  nugent and i gazed at one another in complete bewilderment lucilla had heard it all lucillas curiosity was satisfied he had that incredibly happy result to communicate to usand he announced it with a look of humiliation in a tone of despair nugents patience gave way  let us have an end of this mystification he said putting oscar back from him sharply at arms length i want a plain answer to a plain question she knows that the boy knocked at the door and asked if blue face was at home does she know what the boys impudence meant yes or no  yes  does she know that it is you who are blue face  no  no who else does she think it is  as he asked the question lucilla appeared at the door of the house she moved her blind face inquiringly first one way then the other oscar she called out why have you left me alone where are you  oscar turned trembling to his brother  for gods sake forgive me nugent he said she thinks its you    chapter the twentysixth  he proves equal to the occasion  at that astounding confession abruptly revealed in those plain words even resolute nugent lost all power of selfcontrol he burst out with a cry which reached lucillas ears she instantly turned towards us and instantly assumed that the cry had come from oscars lips  ah there you are she exclaimed oscar oscar what is the matter with you today  oscar was incapable of answering her he had cast one glance of entreaty at his brother as lucilla came nearer to us the mute reproach which had answered him in nugents eyes had broken down his last reserves of endurance he was crying silently on nugents breast  it was necessary that one of us should make his or her voice heard i spoke first  nothing is the matter my dear i said advancing to meet lucilla we were passing the house and oscar ran out to stop us and bring us in  my excuses roused a new alarm in her  us she repeated who is with you  nugent is with me  the result of the deplorable misunderstanding which had taken place instantly declared itself she turned deadly pale under the horror of feeling that she was in the presence of the man with the blue face  take me near enough to speak to him but not to touch him she whispered i have heard what he is like oh if you saw him as i see him in the dark i must control myself i must speak to oscars brother for oscars sake  she seized my arm and held me close to her what ought i to have said what ought i to have done i neither knew what to say or what to do i looked from lucilla to the twin brothers there was oscar the weak overwhelmed by the humiliating position in which he had placed himself towards the woman whom he was to marry towards the brother whom he loved and there was nugent the strong master of himself with his arm round his brother with his head erect with his hand signing to me to keep silence he was right i had only to look back at lucillas face to see that the delicate and perilous work of undeceiving her was not work to be done at a moments notice on the spot  you are not yourself today i said to her let us go home  no she answered i must accustom myself to speak to him i will begin today take me to himbut dont let him touch me  nugent disengaged himself from oscarwhose unfitness to help us through our difficulties was too manifest to be mistakenas he saw us approaching he pointed to the low wall in front of the house and motioned to his brother to wait there out of the way before lucilla could speak to him again the wisdom of this proceeding was not long in asserting itself lucilla asked for oscar the moment after he had left us nugent answered that oscar had gone back to the house to get his hat  the sound of nugents voice helped her to calculate her distance from him without assistance from me still holding my arm she stopped and spoke to him  nugent she said i have made oscar tell mewhat he ought to have told me long since she paused between each sentence painfully controlling herself painfully catching her breath he has discovered a foolish antipathy of mine i dont know how i tried to keep it a secret from him i need not tell you what it is  she made a longer pause at those words holding me closer and closer to her struggling more and more painfully against the irresistible nervous loathing that had got possession of her  he listened on his side with the constraint which always fell upon him in her presence more marked than ever his eyes were on the ground he seemed reluctant even to look at her  i think i understand she went on why oscar was unwilling to tell me she stopped at a loss how to express herself without running the risk of hurting his feelingsto tell me she resumed what it is in you which is not like other people he was afraid my stupid weakness might prejudice me against you i wish to say that i wont let it do that i never was more ashamed of it than now i too have my misfortune i ought to sympathize with you instead of  her voice had been growing fainter and fainter as she proceeded she leaned against me heavily one glance at her told me that if i let it go on any longer she would fall into a swoon tell your brother that we have gone back to the rectory i said to nugent he looked up at lucilla for the first time  you are right he answered take her home he repeated the sign by which he had already hinted to me to be silentand joined oscar at the wall in front of the house  has he gone she asked  he has gone  the moisture stood thick on her forehead i passed my handkerchief over her face and turned her towards the wind  are you better now  yes  can you walk home  easily  i put her arm in mine after advancing with me a few steps she suddenly stoppedwith a blind apprehension as it seemed of something in front of her she lifted her little walkingcane and moved it slowly backwards and forwards in the empty air with the action of some one who is clearing away an encumbrance to a free advancesay the action of a person walking in a thick wood and pushing aside the lower twigs and branches that intercept the way  what are you about i asked  clearing the air she answered the air is full of him i am in a forest of hovering figures with faces of blackblue give me your arm come through  lucilla  dont be angry with me i am coming to my senses again nobody knows what folly what madness it is better than i do i have a will of my own suffer as i may i promise to break myself of it this time i cant and wont let oscars brother see that he is an object of horror to me she stopped once more and gave me a little propitiatory kiss blame my blindness dear dont blame me if i could only see ah how can i make you understand me you who dont live in the dark she went on a few paces silent and thoughtfuland then spoke again you wont laugh at me if i say something  you know i wont  suppose yourself to be in bed at night  yes  i have heard people say that they have sometimes woke in the middle of the night on a sudden without any noise to disturb them and they have fancied without anything particular to justify it that there was something or somebody in the dark room has that ever happened to you  certainly my loveit has happened to most people to fancy what you say when their nerves are a little out of order  very well there is my fancy and there are my nerves when it happened to you what did you do  i struck a light and satisfied myself that i was wrong  suppose yourself without candle or matches in a night without end left alone with your fancy in the dark there you have me it would not be easy would it to satisfy yourself if you were in that helpless condition you might suffer under itvery unreasonablyand yet very keenly for all that she lifted her little cane with a sad smile you might be almost as great a fool as poor lucilla and clear the air before you with this  the charm of her voice and her manner added to the touching simplicity the pathetic truth of those words she made me realize as i had never realized before what it is to have at one and the same time the blessing of imagination and the curse of blindness for a moment i was absorbed in my admiration and my love for her for a moment i forgot the terrible position in which we were all placed she unconsciously recalled it to me when she spoke next  perhaps i was wrong to force the truth out of oscar she said putting her arm again in mine and walking on i might have reconciled myself to his brother if i had never known what his brother was like and yet i felt there was something strange in him without being told and without knowing what it was there must have been a reason in me for the dislike that i felt for him from the first  those words appeared to me to indicate the state of mind which had led to lucillas deplorable mistake i cautiously put some questions to her to test the correctness of my own idea  you spoke just now of forcing the truth out of oscar i said what made you suspect that he was concealing the truth from you  he was so strangely embarrassed and confused she answered anybody in my place would have suspected him of concealing the truth  so far the answer was conclusive  and how came you to find out what the truth really was i asked next  i guessed at it she replied from something he said in referring to his brother you know that i took a fanciful dislike to nugent dubourg before he came to dimchurch  yes  and you remember that my prejudice against him was confirmed on the first day when i passed my hand over his face to compare it with his brothers  i remember  wellwhile oscar was rambling and contradicting himselfhe said something a mere trifle which suggested to me that the person with the blue face must be his brother there was the explanation that i had sought for in vainthe explanation of my persistent dislike to nugent that horrid dark face of his must have produced some influence on me when i first touched it like the influence which your horrid purple dress produced on me when i first touched that dont you see  i saw but too plainly oscar had been indebted for his escape from discovery entirely to lucillas misinterpretation of his language and lucillas misinterpretation now stood revealed as the natural product of her anxiety to account for her prejudice against nugent dubourg although the mischief had been donestill for the quieting of my own conscience i made an attempt to shake her faith in the false conclusion at which she had arrived  there is one thing i dont see yet i said i dont understand oscars embarrassment in speaking to you as you interpret him what had he to be afraid of  she smiled satirically  what has become of your memory my dear she asked what were you afraid of you certainly never said a word to me of this poor mans deformity you felt yourself i suppose just as oscar felt himself placed between a choice of difficulties on one side my dislike of dark colors and dark people warned oscar to hold his tongue on the other my hatred of having advantage taken of my blindness to keep things secret from me pressed him to speak out isnt that enoughwith his shy disposition poor fellowto account for his being embarrassed besides she added speaking more seriously perhaps he saw in my manner towards him that he had disappointed and pained me  how i asked  dont you remember his once acknowledging in the garden that he had painted his face in the character of bluebeard to amuse the children it was not delicate it was not affectionateit was not like himto show such insensibility as that to his brothers shocking disfigurement he ought to have remembered it he ought to have respected it there we will say no more we will go indoors and open the piano and try to forget  even oscars clumsy excuse in the gardeninstead of confirming her suspicionhad lent itself to strengthen the foregone conclusion rooted in her mind at that critical momentbefore i had consulted with the twinbrothers as to what was to be done nextit was impossible to say more i felt seriously alarmed when i thought of the future when she was toldas told she must beof the dreadful delusion into which she had fallen what would be the result to oscar what would be the effect on herself i own i shrank from pursuing the inquiry  when we reached the turn in the valley i looked back at browndown for the last time the twinbrothers were still in the place at which we had left them though the faces were indistinguishable i could still see the figures plainlyoscar sitting crouched up on the wall nugent erect at his side with one hand laid on his shoulder even at that distance the types of the two characters were expressed in the attitudes of the two men as we entered the new winding of the valley which shut them out from view i felt so easy is it to comfort a woman that the commanding position of nugent had produced its encouraging impression on my mind he will find a way out of it i said to myself nugent will help us through    chapter the twentyseventh  he finds a way out of it  we sat down at the piano as lucilla had proposed she wished me to play first and to play alone i was teaching her at the time one of the sonatas of mozart and i now tried to go on with the lesson never before or since have i played so badly as on that day the divine serenity and completeness by which mozarts music is to my mind raised above all other music that ever was written can only be worthily interpreted by a player whose whole mind is given undividedly to the work devoured as i then was by my own anxieties i might profane those heavenly melodiesi could not play them lucilla accepted my excuses and took my place  half an hour passed without news from browndown  calculated by reference to itself half an hour is no doubt a short space of time calculated by reference to your own suspense while your own interests are at stake half an hour is an eternity every minute that passed leaving lucilla still undisturbed in her delusion was a minute that pricked me in the conscience the longer we left her in ignorance the more painful to all of us the hard duty of enlightening her would become i began to get restless lucilla on her side began to complain of fatigue after the agitation that she had gone through the inevitable reaction had come i recommended her to go to her room and rest she took my advice in the state of my mind at that time it was an inexpressible relief to me to be left by myself  after pacing backwards and forwards for some little time in the sittingroom and trying vainly to see my way through the difficulties that now beset us i made up my mind to wait no longer for the news that never came the brothers were still at browndown to browndown i determined to return  i peeped quietly into lucillas room she was asleep after a word to zillah recommending her young mistress to her care i slipped out as i crossed the lawn i heard the gardengate opened in a minute more the man of all others whom i most wanted to see presented himself before me in the person of nugent dubourg he had borrowed oscars key and had set off alone for the rectory to tell me what had passed between his brother and himself  this is the first stroke of luck that has fallen to me today he said i was wondering how i should contrive to speak to you privately and here you areaccessible and alone where is lucilla can we depend on having the garden to ourselves  i satisfied him on both those points he looked sadly pale and worn before he opened his lips i saw that he too had had his mind disturbed and his patience tried since i had left him there was a summerhouse at the end of the garden with a view over the breezy solitude of the downs here we established ourselves and here in my headlong way i opened the interview with the one formidable questionwho is to tell her of the mistake she has made  nobody is to tell her  that answer staggered me at the outset i looked at nugent in silent astonishment  there is nothing to be surprised at he said let me put my point of view before you in two words i have had a serious talk with oscar  women are proverbially bad listenersand i am no better than the rest of them i interrupted him before he could get any farther  i suppose oscar has told you how the mistake happened i said  he has no idea how it happened he ownswhen he found himself face to face with herthat his presence of mind completely failed him he didnt himself know what he was saying at the time he lost his head and she lost her patience think of his nervous confusion in collision with her nervous irritabilityand the result explains itself nothing could come of it but misapprehension and mistake i turned the thing over in my mind after you had left us and the one course to take that i could see was to accept the position patiently and to make the best instead of the worst of it having reached this conclusion i settled the matter as i settle most other difficultiesby cutting the gordian knot i said to oscar would it be a relief to your mind to leave her present impression undisturbed until you are married you know himi neednt tell you what his answer was very well i said dry your eyes and compose yourself i have begun as blue face as blue face i will go on till further notice i spare you the description of oscars gratitude i proposed and he accepted there is the way out of the difficulty as i see it  your way out of the difficulty is an unworthy way and a false way i answered i protest against taking that cruel advantage of lucillas blindness i refuse to have anything to do with it  he opened his case and took out a cigar  do as you please he said you saw the pitiable state she was in when she forced herself to speak to me you saw how her disgust and horror overpowered her at the end transfer that disgust and horror to oscar with indignation and contempt added in his case expose him to the result of rousing those feelings in her before he is fortified by a husbands influence over her mind and a husbands place in her affectionsif you dare i love the poor fellow and i darent may i smoke  i gave him his permission to smoke by a gesture before i said anything more to this inscrutable gentleman i felt the necessity of understanding himif i could  there was no difficulty in accounting for his readiness to sacrifice himself in the interests of oscars tranquillity he never did things by halveshe liked dashing at difficulties which would have made other men pause the same zeal in his brothers service which had saved oscars life at the trial might well be the zeal that animated him now the perplexity that i felt was not roused in me by the course that he had takenbut by the language in which he justified himself and more still by his behavior to me while he was speaking the wellbred brilliant young fellow of my previous experience had now turned as dogged and as ungracious as a man could be he waited to hear what i had to say to him next with a hard defiance and desperation of manner entirely uncalled for by the circumstances and entirely out of harmony with his character so far as i had observed it that there was something lurking under the surface some inner motive at work in him which he was concealing from his brother and concealing from me was as plainly visible as the sunshine and shade on the view that i was looking at from the summerhouse but what that something was or what that inner motive might be it baffled my utmost sagacity to guess not the faintest idea of the terrible secret that he was hiding from me crossed my mind innocent of all suspicion of the truth there i sat opposite to him the unconscious witness of that unhappy mans final struggle to be true to the brother whom he loved and to master the devouring passion that consumed him so long as lucilla falsely believed him to be disfigured by the drug so long the commonest consideration for her tranquillity would in the estimation of others excuse and explain his keeping out of her presence in that separation lay his last chance of raising an insurmountable barrier between lucilla and himself he had already tried uselessly to place another obstacle in the wayhe had vainly attempted to hasten the marriage which would have made lucilla sacred to him as his brothers wife that effort having failed there was but one honorable alternative left to himto keep out of her society until she was married to oscar he had accepted the position in which oscar had placed him as the one means of reaching the end in view without exciting suspicion of the truthand he had encountered as his reward for the sacrifice my ignorant protest my stupid opposition set as obstacles in his way there were the motivesthe pure the noble motiveswhich animated him as i know them now there is the right reading of the dogged language that mystified me of the defiant manner that offended me interpreted by the one light that i have to guide my penthe light of later events  well he said are we allies or not are you with me or against me  i gave up attempting to understand him and answered that plain question plainly  i dont deny that the consequences of undeceiving her may be serious i said but for all that i will have no share in the cruelty of keeping her deceived  nugent held up his forefinger warningly  pause and reflect madame pratolungo the mischief that you may do as matters stand now may be mischief that you can never repair its useless to ask you to alter your mind i only ask you to wait a little there is plenty of time before the weddingday something may happen which will spare you the necessity of enlightening lucilla with your own lips  what can happen i asked  lucilla may yet see him as we see him nugent answered lucillas own eyes may discover the truth  what have you not abandoned the mad notion of curing her blindness yet  i will abandon my notion when the german surgeon tells me it is mad not before  have you said anything about it to oscar  not a word i shall say nothing about it to anybody but you until the german is safe on the shores of england  do you expect him to arrive before the marriage  certainly he would have left new york with me but for one patient who still required his care no new patients will tempt him to stay in america his extraordinary success has made his fortune the ambition of his life is to see england and he can afford to gratify it he may be here by the next steamer that reaches liverpool  and when he does come you mean to bring him to dimchurch  yesunless lucilla objects to it  suppose oscar objects she is resigned to be blind for life if you disturb that resignation with no useful result you may make an unhappy woman of her for the rest of her days in your brothers place i should object to running that risk  my brother is doubly interested in running the risk i repeat what i have already told you the physical result will not be the only result if her sight can be restored there will be a new mind put into her as well as a new sense oscar has everything to dread from this morbid fancy of hers as long as she is blind only let her eyes correct her fancyonly let her see him as we see him and get used to him as we have got used to him and oscars future with her is safe will you leave things as they are for the present on the chance that the german surgeon may get here before the weddingday  i consented to that being influenced in spite of myself by the remarkable coincidence between what nugent had just said of lucilla and what lucilla had said to me of herself earlier in the day it was impossible to deny that nugents theory wild as it sounded found its confirmation so far in lucillas view of her own case having settled the difference between us in this way for the time being i shifted our talk next to the difficult question of nugents relations towards lucilla how are you to meet her again i said after the effect you produced on her at the meeting today  he spoke far more pleasantly in discussing this side of the subject his language and his manner both improved together  if i could have had my own way he said lucilla would have been relieved by this time of all fear of meeting with me again she would have heard from you or from oscar that business had obliged me to leave dimchurch  does oscar object to let you go  he wont hear of my going i did my best to persuade himi promised to return for the marriage quite useless if you leave me here by myself he said to think over the mischief i have done and the sacrifices i have forced on youyou will break my heart you dont know what an encouragement your presence is to me you dont know what a blank you will leave in my life if you go i am as weak as oscar is when oscar speaks to me in that way against my own convictions against my own wishes i yielded i should have been better awayfar far better away  he said those closing words in a tone that startled me it was nothing less than a tone of despair how little i understood him then how well i understand him now in those melancholy accents spoke the last of his honor the last of his truth miserable innocent lucia miserable guilty nugent  and now you remain at dimchurch i resumed what are you to do  i must do my best to spare her the nervous suffering which i unwillingly inflicted on her today the morbid repulsion that she feels in my presence is not to be controlledi can see that plainly i shall keep out of her way gradually withdrawing myself so as not to force my absence on her attention i shall pay fewer and fewer visits at the rectory and remain longer and longer at browndown every day after they are married he suddenly stopped the words seemed to stick in his throat he busied himself in relighting his cigar and took a long time to do it  after they are married i repeated what then  when oscar is married oscar will not find my presence indispensable to his happiness i shall leave dimchurch  you will have to give a reason  i shall give the true reason i can find no studio here big enough for meas i have told you and even if i could find a studio i should be doing no good if i remained at dimchurch my intellect would contract my brains would rust in this remote place let oscar live his quiet married life here and let me go to the atmosphere that is fitter for methe atmosphere of london or paris  he sighed and fixed his eyes absently on the open hilly view from the summerhouse door  its strange to see you depressed i said your spirits seemed to be quite inexhaustible on that first evening when you interrupted mr finch over hamlet  he threw away the end of his cigar and laughed bitterly  we artists are always in extremes he said what do you think i was wishing just before you spoke to me  i cant guess  i was wishing i had never come to dimchurch  before i could return a word on my side lucillas voice reached our ears calling to me from the garden nugent instantly sprang to his feet  have we said all we need say he asked  yesfor today at any rate  for today thengoodbye  he leapt up caught the crossbar of wood over the entrance to the summerhouse and swinging himself on to the low gardenwall beyond disappeared in the field on the other side i answered lucillas call and hastened away to find her we met on the lawn she looked wild and pale as if something had frightened her  anything wrong at the rectory i asked  nothing wrong she answeredexcept with me the next time i complain of fatigue dont advise me to go and lie down on my bed  why not i looked in at you before i came out here you were fast asleepthe picture of repose  repose you never were more mistaken in your life i was in the agony of a horrid dream  you were perfectly quiet when i saw you  it must have been after you saw me then let me come and sleep with you tonight i darent be by myself if i dream of it again  what did you dream of  i dreamt that i was standing in my wedding dress before the altar of a strange church and that a clergyman whose voice i had never heard before was marrying me she stopped impatiently waving her hand before her in the air blind as i am she said i see him again now  the bridegroom  yes  oscar  no  who then  oscars brother nugent dubourg  have i mentioned before that i am sometimes a great fool if i have not i beg to mention it now i burst out laughing  what is there to laugh at she asked angrily i saw his hideous discolored facei am never blind in my dreams i felt his blue hand put the ring on my finger wait the worst part of it is to come i married nugent dubourg willinglymarried him without a thought of my engagement to oscar yes yes i know its only a dream i cant bear to think of it for all that i dont like to be false to oscar even in a dream let us go to him i want to hear him tell me that he loves me come to browndown im so nervous i dont like going by myself come to browndown  i have another humiliating confession to makei tried to get off going to browndown so like those unfeeling french people isnt it  but i had my reason too if i disapproved of the resolution at which nugent had arrived i viewed far more unfavorably the selfish weakness on oscars part which had allowed his brother to sacrifice himself lucillas lover had sunk to something very like a despicable character in my estimation i felt that i might let him see what i thought of him if i found myself in his company at that moment  considering the object that you have in view my dear i said to lucilla do you think you want me at browndown  havent i already told you she asked impatiently i am so nervousso completely upsetthat i dont feel equal to going out by myself have you no sympathy for me suppose you had dreamed that you were marrying nugent instead of oscar  ah bah what of that i should only have dreamed that i was marrying the most agreeable man of the two  the most agreeable man of the two there you are againalways unjust to oscar  my love if you could see for yourself you would learn to appreciate nugents good qualities as i do  i prefer appreciating oscars good qualities  you are prejudiced lucilla  so are you  you happen to have met oscar first  that has nothing to do with it  yes yes if nugent had followed us instead of oscar if of those two charming voices which are both the same one had spoken instead of the other  i wont hear a word more  tralalala it happens to have been oscar turn it the other wayand nugent might have been the man  madame pratolungo i am not accustomed to be insulted i have no more to say to you  with that dignified reply and with the loveliest color in her face that you ever saw in your life my darling lucilla turned her pretty back on me and set off for browndown by herself  ah my rash tongue ah my nasty foreign temper why did i let her irritate me i the elder of the twowhy did i not set her an example of selfcontrol who can tell when does a woman know why she does anything did eve knowwhen mr serpent offered her the applewhy she ate it not she  what was to be done now two things were to be done first thingto cool myself down second thingto follow lucilla and kiss and make it up  either i took some time to coolor in the irritation of the moment lucilla walked faster than usual she had got to browndown before i could overtake her on opening the housedoor i heard them talking it would hardly do to disturb themespecially now i was in disgrace while i was hesitating and wondering what my next proceeding had better be my eye was attracted by a letter lying on the halltable i looked one is always inquisitive in those idle moments when one doesnt know what to doi looked at the address the letter was directed to nugent and the postmark was liverpool  i drew the inevitable conclusion the german oculist was in england    chapter the twentyeighth  he crosses the rubicon  i was still in doubt whether to enter the room or to wait outside until she left browndown to return to the rectorywhen lucillas keen sense of hearing decided the question which i had been unable to settle for myself the door of the room opened and oscar advanced into the hall  lucilla insisted that she heard somebody outside he said who could have guessed it was you why did you wait in the hall come in come in  he held open the door for me and i went in oscar announced me to lucilla it was madame pratolungo you heard he said she took no notice either of him or of me a heap of flowers from oscars garden lay in her lap with the help of her clever fingers she was sorting them to make a nosegay as quickly and as tastefully as if she had possessed the sense of sight in all my experience of that charming face it had never looked so hard as it looked now nobody would have recognized her likeness to the madonna of raphaels picture offendedmortally offended with mei saw it at a glance  i hope you will forgive my intrusion lucilla when you know my motive i said i have followed you here to make my excuses  oh dont think of making excuses she rejoined giving threefourths of her attention to the flowers and onefourth to me its a pity you took the trouble of coming here i quite agree with what you said in the garden considering the object i had in view at browndown i could not possibly expect you to accompany me true quite true  i kept my temper not that i am a patient woman not that i possess a meek disposition very far from it i regret to say nevertheless i kept my temperso far  i wish to apologize for what i said in the garden i resumed i spoke thoughtlessly lucilla it is impossible that i could intentionally offend you  i might as well have spoken to one of the chairs the whole of her attention became absorbed in the breathless interest of making her nosegay  was i offended she said addressing herself to the flowers excessively foolish of me if i was she suddenly became conscious of my existence you had a perfect right to express your opinion she said loftily accept my excuses if i appeared to dispute it  she tossed her pretty head she showed her brightest color she tapped her nice little foot briskly on the floor oh lucilla lucilla i still kept my temper more by this time i admit for oscars sake than for her sake he looked so distressed poor fellowso painfully anxious to interfere without exactly knowing how  my dear lucilla he began surely you might answer madame pratolungo  she petulantly interrupted him with another toss of the heada little higher than the last  i dont attempt to answer madame pratolungo i prefer admitting that madame pratolungo may have been quite right i dare say i am ready to fall in love with the first man who comes my way i dare sayif i had met your brother before i met youi should have fallen in love with him quite likely  quite likelyas you sayanswered poor oscar humbly i am sure i think it very lucky for me that you didnt meet nugent first  she threw her lapful of flowers away from her on the table at which she was sitting she became perfectly furious with him for taking my side i permitted myself the poor child could not see it remember the harmless indulgence of a smile  you agree with madame pratolungo she said to him viciously madame pratolungo thinks your brother a much more agreeable man than you  humble oscar shook his head in melancholy acknowledgment of this selfevident fact there can be no two opinions about that he said resignedly  she stamped her foot on the carpetand raised quite a little cloud of dust my lungs are occasionally delicate i permitted myself another harmless indulgenceindulgence in a slight cough she heard the second indulgenceand suddenly controlled herself the instant it reached her ears i am afraid she took my cough as my commentary on what was going on  come here oscar she said with a complete change of tone and manner come and sit down by me  oscar obeyed  put your arm round my waist  oscar looked at me having the use of his sight he was sensible of the absurd side of the demonstration required of himin the presence of a third person she poor soul strong in her blind insensibility to all shafts of ridicule shot from the eye cared nothing for the presence of a third person she repeated her commands in a tone which said sharply embrace mei am not to be trifled with  oscar timidly put his arm round her waistwith an appealing look at me she issued another command instantly  say you love me  oscar hesitated  say you love me  oscar whispered it  out loud  endurance has its limits i began to lose my temper she could not have been more superbly indifferent to my presence if there had been a cat in the room instead of a lady  permit me to inform you i said that i have not as you appear to suppose left the room  she took no notice she went on with her commands rising irrepressibly from one amatory climax to another  give me a kiss  unhappy oscarsacrificed between usblushed stop dont revel prematurely in the greatest enjoyment a reader hasnamely catching a writer out in a mistake i have not forgotten that his disfigured complexion would prevent his blush from showing on the surface i beg to say i saw it under the surfacesaw it in his expression i repeathe blushed  i felt it necessary to assert myself for the second time  i have only one object in remaining in the room miss finch i merely wish to know whether you refuse to accept my excuses  oscar give me a kiss  he still hesitated she threw her arm round his neck my duty to myself was plainmy duty was to go  good afternoon mr dubourg i saidand turned to the door she heard me cross the room and called to me to stop i paused there was a glass on the wall opposite to me on the authority of the glass i beg to mention that i paused in my most becoming manner grace tempered with dignity dignity tempered with grace  madame pratolungo  miss finch  this is the man who is not half so agreeable as his brother look  she tightened her hold round his neck and gave himostentatiously gave himthe kiss which he was ashamed to give her i advanced in contemptuous silence to the door my attitude expressed disgust accompanied by sorrow sorrow accompanied by disgust  madame pratolungo  i made no answer  this is the man whom i should never have loved if i had happened to meet his brother first look  she put both arms round his neck and gave him a shower of kisses all in one i indignantly withdrew the door had been imperfectly closed when i had entered the room it was ajar i pulled it openand found myself face to face with nugent dubourg standing by the table with his letter from liverpool in his hand he must have certainly heard lucilla cast my own words back in my teethif he had heard no more  i stopped short looking at him in silent surprise he smiled and held out the open letter to me before we could speak we heard the door of the room closed oscar had followed me out shutting the door behind him to apologize for lucillas behavior to me he explained what had happened to his brother nugent nodded and tapped his open letter smartly leave me to manage it i shall give you something better to do than quarreling among yourselves you will hear what it is directly in the meantime i have got a message for our friend at the inn gootheridge is on his way here to speak to me about altering the stable run and tell him i have other business on hand and i cant keep my appointment today stop give him this at the same time and ask him to leave it at the rectory  he took one of his visiting cards out of the case wrote a few lines on it in pencil and handed it to his brother oscar always ready to go on errands for nugent hurried out to meet the landlord nugent turned to me  the german is in england he said now i may open my lips  at once i exclaimed  at once i have put off my own business as you heard in favor of this my friend will be in london tomorrow i mean to get my authority to consult him today and to start tomorrow for town prepare yourself to meet one of the strangest characters you ever set eyes on you saw me write on my card it was a message to mr finch asking him to join us immediately on important family business at browndown as lucillas father he has a voice in the matter when oscar comes back and when the rector joins us our domestic privy council will be complete  he spoke with his customary spirit he moved with his customary brisknesshe had become quite himself again since i had seen him last  i am stagnating in this place he went on seeing that i noticed the change in him it puts me in spirits again having something to do i am not like oscari must have action to stir my bloodaction to keep me from fretting over my anxieties how do you think i found the witness to my brothers innocence at the trial in that way i said to myself i shall go mad if i dont do something i did somethingand saved oscar i am going to do something again mark my words now i am stirring in it lucilla will recover her sight  this is a serious matter i said pray give it serious consideration  consideration he repeated i hate the word i always decide on the instant if i am wrong in my view of lucillas case consideration is of no earthly use if i am right every days delay is a day of sight lost to the blind ill wait for oscar and mr finch and then ill open the business why are we talking in the hall come in  he led the way to the sittingroom i had a new interest now in going back still lucillas behavior hung on my mind suppose she treated me with renewed coldness and keener contempt i remained standing at the table in the hall nugent looked back at me over his shoulder  nonsense he said ill set things right its beneath a woman like you to take notice of what a girl says in a pet come in  i doubt if i should have yielded to please any other living man but there is no denying it some people have a magnetic attracting power over others nugent had that power over me against my own willfor i was really hurt and offended by her usage of mei went back with him into the room  lucilla was still sitting in the place which she had occupied when i withdrew on hearing the door open and a mans footsteps entering she of course assumed that the man was oscar she had penetrated his object in leaving her to follow me out and it had not improved her temper  oh she said you have come back at last i thought you had offered yourself as madame pratolungos escort to the rectory she stopped with a sudden frown her quick ears had detected my return into the room oscar she exclaimed what does this mean madame pratolungo and i have nothing more to say to each other what has she come back for why dont you answer this is infamous i shall leave the room  the utterance of that final threat was followed so rapidly by its execution that before nugent standing between her and the door could get out of her way she came in violent contact with him she instantly caught him by the arm and shook him angrily what does your silence mean is it at madame pratolungos instigation that you are insulting me  i had just opened my lips to make one more attempt at reconciliation by saying some pacifying words to herwhen she planted that last sting in me french flesh and blood whatever english flesh and blood might have done could bear no more i silently turned my back on her in a rage  at the same moment nugents eyes brightened as if a new idea had struck him he gave me one significant lookand answered her in his brothers character whether he was possessed at the moment by some demon of mischief or whether he had the idea of trying to make oscars peace for him before oscar returnedwas more than i could say at the time i ought to have stopped iti know but my temper was in a flame i was as spiteful as a cat and as fierce as a bear i said to myself in your english idiom she wants taking down a peg quite right mr nugent do it shocking shameful no words are bad enough for me give it me well ah heaven what is a human being in a rage on my sacred word of honor nothing but a human beast the next time it happens to you look at yourself in the glass and you will find your soul gone out of you at your face and nothing left but an animaland a bad a villainous bad animal too  you ask what my silence means said nugent  he had only to model his articulation on his brothers slower manner of speaking as distinguished from his own to be his brother himself in saying those few first words he did it so dexterously that i could have swornif i had not seen him standing before meoscar was in the room  yes she said i ask that  i am silent he answered because i am waiting  what are you waiting for  to hear you make your apologies to madame pratolungo  she started back a step submissive oscar was taking a peremptory tone with her for the first time in his life submissive oscar instead of giving her time to speak sternly went on  madame pratolungo has made her excuses to you you ought to receive them you ought to reciprocate them it is distressing to see you and hear you you are behaving ungratefully to your best friend  she raised her face she raised her hands in blank amazement she looked as if she distrusted her own ears  oscar she exclaimed  here i am said oscar opening the door at the same moment  she turned like lightning towards the place from which he had spoken she detected the deception which nugent had practiced on her with a cry of indignation that rang through the room  oscar ran to her in alarm she thrust him back violently  a trick she cried a mean vile cowardly trick played upon my blindness oscar your brother has been imitating you your brother has been speaking to me in your voice and that woman who calls herself my friendthat woman stood by and heard him and never told me she encouraged it she enjoyed it the wretches take me away from them they are capable of any deceit she always hated you dear from the firstshe took up with your brother the moment he came here when you marry me it mustnt be at dimchurch it must be in some place they dont know of there is a conspiracy between them against you and against me beware of them beware of them she said i should have fallen in love with your brother if i had met him first there is a deeper meaning in that my love than you can see it means that they will part us if they can ha i hear somebody moving has he changed places with you is it you whom i am speaking to now oh my blindness my blindness oh god of all your creatures the most helpless the most miserable is the creature who cant see  i never heard anything in all my life so pitiable and so dreadful as the frantic suspicion and misery which tore their way out from her in those words she cut me to the heart i had spoken rashlyi had behaved badlybut had i deserved this no no no i had not deserved it i threw myself into a chair and burst out crying my tears scalded me my sobs choked me if i had had poison in my hand i would have drunk iti was so furious and so wretched so hurt in my honor so wounded at my heart  the only voice that answered her was nugents reckless what the consequences might bespeaking in his own proper person from the opposite end of the roomhe asked the allimportant question which no human being had ever put to her yet  are you sure lucilla that you are blind for life  a dead silence followed the utterance of those words  i brushed away the tears from my eyes and looked up  oscar had beenas i supposedholding her in his arms silently soothing her when his brother spoke at the moment when i saw her she had just detached herself from him she advanced a step towards the part of the room in which nugent stoodand stopped with her face turned towards him every faculty in her seemed to be suspended by the silent passage into her mind of the new idea that he had called up through childhood girlhood womanhoodnever once waking or dreaming had the prospect of restoration to sight presented itself within her range of contemplation until now not a trace was left in her countenance of the indignation which nugent had roused in her hardly more than a moment since not a sign appeared indicating a return of the nervous suffering which the sense of his presence had inflicted on her earlier in the day the one emotion in possession of her was astonishmentastonishment that had struck her dumb astonishment that waited helplessly and mechanically to hear more  i observed oscar next his eyes were fixed on lucillaabsorbed in watching her he spoke to nugent without looking at him animated as it seemed by a vague fear for lucilla which was slowly developing into a vague fear for himself  mind what you are doing he said look at her nugentlook at her  nugent approached his brother circuitously so as to place oscar between lucilla and himself  have i offended you he asked  oscar looked at him in surprise offended with you he answered after what you have forgiven and what you have suffered for my sake  still persisted the other there is something wrong  i am startled nugent  startledby what  by the question you have just put to lucilla  you will understand me and she will understand me directly  while those words were passing between the brothers my attention remained fixed on lucilla her head had turned slowly towards the new position which nugent occupied when he spoke to oscar with this exception no other movement had escaped her no sense of what the two men were saying to each other seemed to have entered her mind to all appearance she had heard nothing since nugent had started the first doubt in her whether she was blind for life  speak to her i said for gods sake dont keep her in suspense now  nugent spoke  you have had reason to be offended with me lucilla let me if i can give you reason to be grateful to me before i have done when i was in new york i became acquainted with a german surgeon who had made a reputation and a fortune in america by his skill in treating diseases of the eye he had been especially successful in curing cases of blindness given up as hopeless by other surgeons i mentioned your case to him he could say nothing positively as a matter of course without examining you all he could do was to place his services at my disposal when he came to england i for one lucilla decline to consider you blind for life until this skillful man sees no more hope for you than the english surgeons have seen if there is the faintest chance still left of restoring your sight his is i firmly believe the one hand that can do it he is now in england say the wordand i will bring him to dimchurch  she slowly lifted her hands to her head and held it as if she was holding her reason in its place her color changed from pale to redfrom red to pale once more she drew a long deep heavy breathand dropped her hands again recovering from the shock the change that followed held us all three breathless it was beautiful to see her it was awful to see her a mute ecstasy of hope transfigured her face a heavenly smile played serenely on her lips she was among us and yet apart from us in the still light of evening shining in on her from the window she stood absorbed in her own rapturethe silent creature of another sphere there was a moment when she overcame me with admiration and another moment when she overcame me with fear both the men felt it both signed to me to speak to her first  i advanced a few steps i tried to consider with myself what i should say it was useless i could neither think nor speak i could only look at her i could only say nervously  lucilla  she came back to the worldshe came back to uswith a little start and a faint flush of color in her cheeks she turned herself towards the place from which i had spoken and whispered  come  in a moment my arms were round her her head sank on my bosom we were reconciled without a word we were friends again sisters again in an instant  have i been fainting have i been sleeping she said to me in low bewildered tones am i just awake is this browndown she suddenly lifted her head nugent are you there  yes  she gently withdrew herself from me and approached nugent  did you speak to me just now was it you who put the doubt into my mind whether i am really doomed to be blind for life surely i have not fancied it surely you said the man was coming and the time coming her voice suddenly rose the man who may cure me the time when i may see  i said it lucilla i meant it lucilla  oscar oscar oscar  i stepped forward to lead her to him nugent touched me and pointed to oscar as i took her hand he was standing before the glasswith an expression of despair which i see again while i write these lineshe was standing close to the glass looking in silence at the hideous reflection of his face in sheer pity i hesitated to take her to him she stepped forward and stretching out her hand touched his shoulder the reflection of her charming face appeared behind his face in the glass she raised herself on tiptoe with both hands on him and said the time is coming my darling when i may see you  with a cry of joy she drew his face to her and kissed him on the forehead his head fell on his breast when she released it he covered his face with his hands and stifled for the moment all outward expression of the pang that wrung him i drew her rapidly away before her quick sensibilities had time to warn her that something was wrong even as it was she resisted me even as it was she asked suspiciously why do you take me away from him  what excuse could i make i was at my wits end  she repeated the question for once fortune favored us a timely knock at the door stopped her just as she was trying to release herself from me somebody coming in i said the servant entered as i spoke with a letter from the rectory    chapter the twentyninth  parliamentary summary  oh the welcome interruption after the agitation that we had suffered we all stood equally in need of some such relief as this it was absolutely a luxury to fall back again into the commonplace daily routine of life i asked to whom the letter was addressed nugent answered the letter is addressed to me and the writer is mr finch  having read the letter he turned to lucilla  i sent a message to your father asking him to join us here he said mr finch writes back to say that his duties keep him at home and to suggest that the rectory is the fitter place for the discussion of family matters have you any objection to return to the house and do you mind going on first with madame pratolungo  lucillas quick suspicion was instantly aroused  why not with oscar she asked  your fathers note suggests to me replied nugent that he is a little hurt at the short notice i gave him of our discussion here i thoughtif you and madame pratolungo went on firstthat you might make our peace with the rector and assure him that we meant no disrespect before oscar and i appeared dont you think yourself you would make it easier for us if you did that  having contrived in this dexterous way to separate oscar and lucilla and to gain time for composing and fortifying his brother before they met again nugent opened the door for us to go out lucilla and i left the twins together in the modest little room which had witnessed a scene alike memorable to all of us for its interest at the time and for the results which were to come of it in the future  half an hour later we were all assembled at the rectory  our adjourned debateexcepting one small suggestion emanating from myselfwas a debate which led to nothing it may be truly described as resolving itself into the delivery of an oration by mr finch subject the assertion of mr finchs dignity  on this occasion having matters of more importance on hand i take the liberty of cutting the reverend gentlemans speech by the pattern of the reverend gentlemans stature short in figure the rector shall be here for the first time in his life short in language too  reverend finch rose and saidhe objected to everything to receiving a message on a card instead of a proper note to being expected to present himself at browndown at a moments notice to being the last person informed instead of the first of mr nugent dubourgs exaggerated and absurd view of the case of his afflicted child to the german surgeon as being certainly a foreigner and a stranger and possibly a quack to the slur implied on british surgery by bringing the foreigner to dimchurch to the expense involved in the same proceeding finally to the whole scope and object of mr nugent dubourgs proposal which had for its origin rebellion against the decrees of an allwise providence and for its result the disturbance of his daughters mindunder my influence sir a mind in a state of christian resignation under your influence a mind in a state of infidel revolt with those concluding remarks the reverend gentleman sat downand paused for a reply  a remarkable result followed which might be profitably permitted to take place in some other parliaments nobody replied  mr nugent dubourg roseno satand said he declined to take any part in the proceedings he was quite ready to wait until the end justified the means which he proposed to employ for the rest his conscience was at ease and he was entirely at miss finchs service  mr oscar dubourg sitting hidden from notice behind his brother followed his brothers example the decision in the matter under discussion rested with miss finch alone he had no opinion of his own to offer on it  miss finch herself appealed to nexthad but one reply to give with all possible respect for her father she ventured to think that neither he nor any one possessing the sense of vision could quite enter into her feelings as the circumstances then were if there really was any chance of her recovering her sight the least she could do would be to give that chance a fair trial she entreated mr nugent dubourg not to lose one unnecessary moment in bringing the german surgeon to dimchurch  mrs finch called upon next spoke after some little delay caused by the loss of her pockethandkerchief would not presume to differ in opinion with her husband whom she had never yet known to be otherwise than perfectly right about everything but if the german surgeon did come and if mr finch saw no objection to it she would much like to consult him gratis if possible on the subject of babys eyes mrs finch was proceeding to explain that there was happily nothing the matter that she could see with the infants eyes at that particular moment and that she merely wished to take a skilled medical opinion in the event of something happening on some future occasionwhen she was called to order by mr finch the reverend gentleman at the same time appealed to madame pratolungo to close the debate by giving frank expression to her own opinion  madame pratolungo speaking in conclusion remarked  that the question of consulting the german surgeon appeared after what had fallen from miss finch to be a question which had passed beyond the range of any expression of feeling on the part of other persons that she proposed accordingly to look beyond the consultation at the results which might follow it that contemplating these possible results she held very strong views of her own and would proceed to give frank expression to them as follows that in her opinion the proposed investigation of the chances which might exist of restoring miss finchs sight involved consequences far too serious to be trusted to the decision of any one man no matter how skillful or how famous he might be that in pursuance of this view she begged to suggest 1 the association of an eminent english oculist with the eminent german oculist 2 an examination of miss finchs case by both the professional gentlemen consulting on it together and 3 a full statement of the opinions at which they might respectively arrive to be laid before the meeting now assembled and to become the subject of a renewed discussion before any decisive measures were taken  lastly that this proposal be now submitted in the form of a resolution and forthwith if necessary put to the vote  resolution as above put to the vote  majorityayes  miss finch mr nugent dubourg mr oscar dubourg madame pratolungo  minoritynoes  no on the score of expense mr finch no because mr f says no mrs finch  resolution carried by a majority of two debate adjourned to a day to be hereafter decided on  by the first train the next morning nugent dubourg started for london  at luncheon the same day a telegram arrived reporting his proceedings in the following terms  i have seen my friend he is at our service he is also quite willing to consult with any english oculist whom we may choose i am just off to find the man expect a second telegram later in the day  the second telegram reached us in the evening and ran thus  everything is settled the german oculist and the english oculist leave london with me by the twelveforty train tomorrow afternoon  after reading this telegram to lucilla i sent it to oscar at browndown judge for yourself how he slept and how we slept that night    chapter the thirtieth  herr grosse  several circumstances deserving to be mentioned here took place in the early part of the day on which we expected the visit of the two oculists i have all the will to relate thembut the capacity to do it completely fails me  when i look back at that eventful morning i recall a scene of confusion and suspense the bare recollection of which seems to upset my mind again even at this distance of time things and persons all blend distractedly one with another i see the charming figure of my blind lucilla robed in rosecolor and white flitting hither and thither in the house and out of the houseat one time mad with impatience for the arrival of the surgeons at another shuddering with apprehension of the coming ordeal and the coming disappointment which might follow a moment moreand just as my mind has seized it the fair figure melts and merges into the miserable apparition of oscar hovering and hesitating between browndown and the rectory painfully conscious of the new complications introduced into his position towards lucilla by the new state of things and yet not man enough even yet to seize the opportunity and set himself right another moment passes and a new figurea little strutting consequential figure forces its way into the foreground before i am ready for it i hear a big voice booming in my ear with big language to correspond no madame pratolungo nothing will induce me to sanction by my presence this insane medical consultation this extravagant and profane attempt to reverse the decrees of an allwise providence by purely human means my foot is downi use the language of the people observe to impress it the more strongly on your mindmy foot is down another moment yet and finch and finchs foot disappear over my mental horizon just as my eye has caught them damp mrs finch and the baby whose everlasting programme is suction and sleep take the vacant place mrs finch pledges me with watery earnestness to secrecy and then confides her intention of escaping her husbands supervision if she can and bringing british surgery and german surgery to bear both together gratis on babys eyes conceive these persons all twisting and turning in the convolutions of my brains as if those brains were a labyrinth with the sayings and doings of one confusing themselves with the sayings and doings of the otherwith a thin stream of my own private anxieties comprehending luncheon on a sidetable for the doctors trickling at intervals through it alland you will not wonder if i take a jump like a sheep over some six hours of precious time and present my solitary self to your eye posted alone in the sittingroom to receive the council of surgeons on its arrival at the house i had but two consolations to sustain me  first a mayonnaise of chicken of my own making on the luncheontable which as a work of art was simply adorablei say no more secondly my green silk dress trimmed with my mothers famous laceanother work of art equally adorable with the first whether i looked at the luncheontable or whether i looked in the glass i could feel that i worthily asserted my nation i could say to myself even in this remote corner of the earth the pilgrim of civilization searching for the elegant luxuries of life looks and seesfrance supreme    the clock chimed the quarter past three lucilla wearying for the hundredth time of waiting in her own room put her head in at the door and still repeated the neverchanging questionno signs of them yet  none my love  oh how much longer will they keep us waiting  patience lucillapatience  she disappeared again with a weary sigh five minutes more passed and old zillah peeped into the room next  here they are maam in a chaise at the gate  i shook out the skirts of my green silk i cast a last inspiriting glance at the mayonnaise nugents cheerful voice reached me from the garden conducting the strangers this way gentlemenfollow me a pause steps outside the door opened nugent brought them in  herr grosse from america mr sebright of london  the german gave a little start when my name was mentioned the englishman remained perfectly unaffected by it herr grosse had heard of my glorious pratolungo mr sebright was barbarously ignorant of his existence i shall describe herr grosse first and shall take the greatest pains with him  a squat broad sturdy body waddling on a pair of short bandy legs slovenly shabby unbrushed clothes a big square biliousyellow face surmounted by a mop of thick irongrey hair dark beetlebrows a pair of staring fierce black goggle eyes with huge circular spectacles standing up like fortifications in front of them a shaggy beard and mustache of mixed black white and grey a prodigious cameo ring on the forefinger of one hairy hand the other hand always in and out of a deep silver snuffbox like a small teacaddy a rough rasping voice a diabolically humourous smile a curtly confident way of speaking resolution independence power expressed all over him from head to footthere is the portrait of the man who held in his hands if nugent was to be trusted the restoration of lucillas sight  the english oculist was as unlike his german colleague as it is possible for one human being to be to another  mr sebright was slim and spare and scrupulously painfully clean and neat his smooth light hair was carefully parted his wellshaved face exhibited two little crisp morsels of whisker about two inches long and no hair more his decent black clothes were perfectly made he wore no ornaments not even a watchchain he moved deliberately he spoke gravely and quietly disciplined attention looked coldly at you out of his light grey eyes and said here i am if you want me in every movement of his thin finelycut lips a thoroughly capable man beyond all doubtbut defend me from accidentally sitting next to him at dinner or traveling with him for my only companion on a long journey  i received these distinguished persons with my best grace herr grosse complimented me in return on my illustrious name and shook hands mr sebright said it was a beautiful day and bowed the german the moment he was at liberty to look about him looked at the luncheontable the englishman looked out of window  will you take some refreshment gentlemen  herr grosse nodded his shock head in high approval his wild eyes glared greedily at the mayonnaise through his prodigious spectacles aha i like that said the illustrious surgeon pointing at the dish with his ringed forefinger you know how to make himyou make him with creams is he chickens or lobsters i like lobsters best but chickens is goot too the garnish is lofelyanchovy olive beetroots brown green red on a fat white sauce this i call a heavenly dish he is nicecool in two different ways nicecool to the eye nicecool to the taste soh we will break into his inside madame pratolungo you shall begin here goes for the liverwings  in this extraordinary englishturning words in the singular into words in the plural and banishing from the british vocabulary the copulative conjunction andherr grosse announced his readiness to sit down to lunch he was politely recalled from the mayonnaise to the patient by his discreet english colleague  i beg your pardon said mr sebright would it not be advisable to see the young lady before we do anything else i am obliged to return to london by the next train  herr grossewith a fork in one hand and a spoon in the other and a napkin tied round his neckstared piteously shook his shock head and turned his back on the mayonnaise with a heavy heart at parting  goot we shall do our works first then eat our lunches afterwards where is the patients comebeginbegin he removed the napkin blew a sigh there is no other way of expressing itand plunged his finger and thumb into his teacaddy snuffbox where is the patients he repeated irritably why is she not closehandy in here  she is waiting in the next room i said i will bring her in directly you will make allowances for her gentlemen i am sure if you find her a little nervous i added looking at both the oculists silent mr sebright bowed herr grosse grinned diabolically and said make your mind easy my goot creature i am not such a brutes as i look  where is oscar asked nugent as i passed him on my way to lucillas room  after altering his mind a dozen times at least i replied he has decided on not being present at the examination  i had barely said the words before the door opened and oscar entered the room he had altered his mind for the thirteenth timeand here he was as the result of it  herr grosse burst out with an exclamation in his own language at the sight of oscars face ach gott he exclaimed he has been taking nitrates of silvers his complexions is spoilt poor boys poor boys he shook his shaggy headturnedand spat compassionately into a corner of the room oscar looked offended mr sebright looked disgusted nugent thoroughly enjoyed it i left the room and closed the door behind me  i had not taken two steps in the corridor when i heard the door opened again looking back directly i found myself to my amazement face to face with herr grossestaring ferociously at me through his spectacles and offering me his arm  hosh said the famous oculist in a heavy whisper say nothing to nobody i am come to help you  to help me i repeated  herr grosse nodded vehementlyso vehemently that his prodigious spectacles hopped up and down on his nose  what did you tell me just now he asked you told me the patient was nervous goot i am come to go with you to the patients and help you to fetch her soh soh i am not such a brutes as i look comebeginbegin where is she  i hesitated for a moment about introducing this remarkable ambassador into lucillas bedroom one look at him decided me after all he was a doctorand such an ugly one i took his arm  we went together into lucillas room she started up from the sofa on which she was reclining when she heard the strange footsteps entering side by side with mine  who is it she cried  it is me my dears said herr grosse ach gott what

delightful nugent whispered behind me pointing to his friend escorted by herr grosse we made a magnificent entry into the room our german doctor had done lucilla good already the examination was relieved of all its embarrassments and its terrors at the outset herr grosse had made her laughherr grosse had set her completely at her ease  mr sebright and oscar were talking together in a perfectly friendly way when we returned to the sittingroom the reserved englishman appeared to have his attraction for the shy oscar even mr sebright was struck by lucilla his cold face lit up with interest when he was presented to her he placed a chair for her in front of the window there was a warmth in his tone which i had not heard yet when he begged her to be seated in that place she took the chair mr sebright thereupon drew back and bowed to herr grosse with a courteous wave of his hand towards lucilla which signified you first  herr grosse met this advance with a counterwave of the hand and a vehement shake of his shockhead which signified i couldnt think of such a thing  pardon me entreated mr sebright as my senior as a visitor to england as a master in our art  herr grosse responded by regaling himself with three pinches of snuff in rapid successiona pinch as senior a pinch as visitor to england a pinch as master in the art an awful pause followed neither of the surgeons would take precedence of the other nugent interfered  miss finch is waiting he said come grosse you were first presented to her you examine her first  herr grosse took nugents ear between his finger and thumb and gave it a goodhumoured pinch you clever boys he said you have the right word always at the tips of your tongue he waddled to lucillas chair and stopped short with a scandalized look oscar was bending over her and whispering to her with her hand in his hey what cried herr grosse is this a third surgeonoptic what sir you treat young misss eyes by taking hold of young misss hand you are a quack get out oscar withdrewnot very graciously herr grosse took a chair in front of lucilla and removed his spectacles as a shortsighted man he had necessarily excellent eyes for all objects which were sufficiently near to him he bent forward with his face close to lucillas and parted her eyelids alternately with his finger and thumb peering attentively first into one eye then into the other  it was a moment of breathless interest who could say what an influence on her future life might be exercised by this quaint kindly uncouth little foreign man how anxiously we watched those shaggy eyebrows those piercing goggle eyes and oh heavens how disappointed we were at the first result lucilla suddenly gave a little irrepressible shudder of disgust herr grosse drew back from her and glared at her benignantly with his diabolical smile  aha he said i see what it is i snuff i smoke i reek of tobaccos the pretty miss smells me she says in her inmost heartach gott how he stink  lucilla burst into a fit of laughter herr grosse unaffectedly amused on his side grinned with delight and snatched her handkerchief out of her apronpocket gif me scents said this excellent german i shall stop up her nose with her handkerchiefs so she will not smell my tobaccostinksall will be niceright againwe shall go on i gave him some lavenderwater from a scentbottle on the table he gravely drenched the handkerchief with it and popped it suddenly on lucillas nose hold him there miss you cannot for the life of you smell grosse now goot we may go on again  he took a magnifying glass out of his waistcoat pocket and waited till lucilla had fairly exhausted herself with laughing then the examinationso cruelly grotesque in itself so terribly serious in the issues which it involvedresumed its course herr grosse glaring at his patient through his magnifying glass lucilla leaning back in the chair holding the handkerchief over her nose  a minute or more passedand the ordeal of the examination came to an end  herr grosse put back his magnifying glass with a grunt which sounded like a grunt of relief and snatched the handkerchief away from lucilla  ach what a nasty smell he said holding the handkerchief to his nose with a grimace of disgust tobaccos is much better than this he solaced his nostrils offended by the lavenderwater with a huge pinch of snuff now i am going to talk he went on see i keep my distance you dont want your handkerchiefsyou smell me no more  am i blind for life said lucilla pray pray tell me sir am i blind for life  will you kees me if i tell you  oh do consider how anxious i am pray pray pray tell me  she tried to go down on her knees before him he held her back firmly and kindly in her chair  now now now you be nicegoot and tell me this first when you are out in the garden taking your little lazy ladys walks on a shinysunny day is it all the same to your eyes as if you were lying in your bed in the middles of the night  no  hah you know it is nicelight at one time you know it is horriddark at the odder  yes  then why you ask me if you are blind for life if you can see as much as that you are not properly blind at all  she clasped her hands with a low cry of delight oh where is oscar she said softly where is oscar i looked round for him he was gone while his brother and i had been hanging spellbound over the surgeons questions and the patients answers he must have stolen silently out of the room  herr grosse rose and vacated the chair in favor of mr sebright in the ecstasy of the new hope now confirmed in her lucilla seemed to be unconscious of the presence of the english oculist when he took his colleagues place his grave face looked more serious than ever as he too produced a magnifying glass from his pocket and gently parting the patients eyelids entered on the examination of her blindness in his turn  the investigation by mr sebright lasted a much longer time than the investigation by herr grosse he pursued it in perfect silence when he had done he rose without a word and left lucilla as he had found her rapt in the trance of her own happinessthinking thinking thinking of the time when she should open her eyes in the new morning and see  well said nugent impatiently addressing mr sebright what do you say  i say nothing yet with that implied reproof to nugent he turned to me i understand that miss finch was blindor as nearly blind as could be discoveredat a year old  i have always heard so i replied  is there any person in the houseparent or relative or servantwho can speak to the symptoms noticed when she was an infant  i rang the bell for zillah her mother is dead i said and there are reasons which prevent her father from being present today her old nurse will be able to give you all the information you want  zillah appeared mr sebright put his questions  were you in the house when miss finch was born  yes sir  was there anything wrong with her eyes at her birth or soon afterwards  nothing sir  how did you know  i knew by seeing her take notice sir she used to stare at the candles and clutch at things that were held before her as other babies do  how did you discover it when she began to get blind  in the same way sir there came a time poor little thing when her eyes looked glazedlike and try her as we might morning or evening it was all the sameshe noticed nothing  did the blindness come on gradually  yes sirbit by bit as you may say slowly worse and worse one week after another she was a little better than a year old before we clearly made it out that her sight was gone  was her fathers sight or her mothers sight ever affected in any way  never sir that i heard of  mr sebright turned to herr grosse sitting at the luncheontable resignedly contemplating the mayonnaise do you wish to ask the nurse any questions he said  herr grosse shrugged his shoulders and pointed backwards with his thumb at the place in which lucilla was sitting  her case is as plain to me as twos and twos make fours ach gott what do i want with the nurse he turned again longingly towards the mayonnaise my fine appetites is going when shall we lonch  mr sebright dismissed zillah with a frigid inclination of the head his discouraging manner made me begin to feel a little uneasy i ventured to ask if he had arrived at a conclusion yet permit me to consult with my colleague before i answer you said the impenetrable man i roused lucilla she again inquired for oscar i said i supposed we should find him in the gardenand so took her out nugent followed us i heard herr grosse whisper to him piteously as we passed the luncheontable for the lofe of heaven come back soon and let us lonch we left the illassorted pair to their consultation in the sittingroom    chapter the thirtyfirst  who shall decide when doctors disagree  we had certainly not been more than ten minutes in the garden when we were startled by an extraordinary outbreak of shouting in broken english proceeding from the window of the sittingroom hihihoi hoihi hoihi we looked up and discovered herr grosse frantically waving a huge red silk handkerchief at the window lonch lonch cried the german surgeon the consultations is done come beginbegin  obedient to this peremptory summons lucilla nugent and i returned to the sittingroom we had as i had foreseen found oscar wandering alone in the garden he had entreated me by a sign not to reveal our discovery of him to lucilla and had hurried away to hide himself in one of the sidewalks his agitation was pitiable to see he was totally unfit to be trusted in lucillas presence at that anxious moment  when we had left the oculists together i had sent zillah with a little written message to reverend finch entreating him if it was only for forms sake to reconsider his resolution and be present on the allimportant occasion to his daughter of the delivery of the medical opinions on her case at the bottom of the stairs on our return my answer was handed to me on a slip of sermonpaper mr finch declined to submit a question of principle to any considerations dictated by mere expediency he desired seriously to remind madame pratolungo of what he had already told her in other words he would repeat and he would beg her to remember this time that his foot was down  on reentering the room we found the eminent oculists seated as far apart as possible one from the other both gentlemen were engaged in reading mr sebright was reading a book herr grosse was reading the mayonnaise  i placed lucilla close by me and took her hand it was as cold as ice my poor dear trembled pitiably for her what moments of unutterable suffering were those moments of suspense before the surgeons delivered their sentence i pressed her little cold hand in mine and whispered courage truly i can say it though i am not usually one of the sentimental sort my heart bled for her  well gentlemen said nugent what is the result are you both agreed  no said mr sebright putting aside his book  no said herr grosse ogling the mayonnaise lucilla turned her face towards me her color shifting and changing her bosom rising and falling more and more rapidly i whispered to her to compose herself one of them at any rate i said thinks you will recover your sight she understood me and became quieter directly nugent went on with his questions addressed to the two oculists  what do you differ about he asked will you let us hear your opinions  the wearisome contest of courtesy was renewed between our medical advisers mr sebright bowed to herr grosse  you first herr grosse bowed to mr sebright noyou my impatience broke through this cruel and ridiculous professional restraint speak both together gentlemen if you like i said sharply do anything for gods sake but keep us in suspense is it or is it not possible to restore her sight  yes said herr grosse  lucilla sprang to her feet with a cry of joy  no said mr sebright  lucilla dropped back again into her chair and silently laid her head on my shoulder  are you agreed about the cause of her blindness asked nugent  cataracts is the cause answered herr grosse  so far i agree said mr sebright cataract is the cause  cataracts is curable pursued the german  i agree again continued the englishmanwith a reservation cataract is sometimes curable  this cataracts is curable cried herr grosse  with all possible deference said mr sebright i dispute that conclusion the cataract in miss finchs case is not curable  can you give us your reasons sir for saying that i inquired  my reasons are based on surgical considerations which it requires a professional training to understand mr sebright replied i can only tell you that i am convincedafter the most minute and careful examinationthat miss finchs sight is irrevocably gone any attempt to restore it by an operation would be in my opinion an unwarrantable proceeding the young lady would not only have the operation to undergo she would be kept secluded afterwards for at least six weeks or two months in a darkened room during that time it is needless for me to remind you that she would inevitably form the most confident hope of her restoration to sight remembering this and believing as i do that the sacrifice demanded of her would end in failure i think it most undesirable to expose our patient to the moral consequences of a disappointment which must seriously try her she has been resigned from childhood to her blindness as an honest man who feels bound to speak out and to speak strongly i advise you not further to disturb that resignation i declare it to be in my opinion certainly useless and possibly dangerous to allow her to be operated on for the restoration of her sight  in those uncompromising words the englishman delivered his opinion  lucillas hand closed fast on mine cruel cruel she whispered to herself angrily i gave her a little squeeze recommending patienceand looked in silent expectation just as nugent was looking too at herr grosse the german rose deliberately to his feet and waddled to the place in which lucilla and i were sitting together  has goot mr sebrights done he asked  mr sebright only replied by his everlasting neverchanging bow  goot i have now my own word to put in said herr grosse it shall be one little wordno more with my best compliments to mr sebrights i set up against what he only thinks what igrossewith these hands of mine have done the cataracts of miss there is a cataracts that i have cut into before a cataracts that i have cured before now look he suddenly wheeled round to lucilla tucked up his cuffs laid a forefinger of each hand on either side of her forehead and softly turned down her eyelids with his two big thumbs i pledge you my word as surgeonoptic he resumed my knife shall let the light in here this lofablenice girls shall be more lofablenicer than ever my pretty feench must be first in her best goot health she must next gif me my own ways with herand then one two threeping my pretty feench shall see he lifted lucillas eyelids again as he said the last wordglared fiercely at her through his spectaclesgave her the loudest kiss on the forehead that i ever heard given in my lifelaughed till the room rang againand returned to his post as sentinel on guard over the mayonnaise now cried herr grosse cheerfully the talkings is all done gott be thanked the eatings may begin  lucilla left her chair for the second time  herr grosse she said where are you  here my dears  she crossed the room to the table at which he was sitting already occupied in carving his favorite dish  did you say you must use a knife to make me see she asked quite calmly  yes yes dont you be frightened of that not much pains to bearnot much pains  she tapped him smartly on the shoulder with her hand  get up herr grosse she said if you have your knife about you here am ido it at once  nugent started mr sebright started her daring amazed them both as for me i am the greatest coward living in the matter of surgical operations performed on myself or on others lucilla terrified me i ran headlong across the room to her i was even fool enough to scream  before i could reach her herr grosse had risen obedient to command with a choice morsel of chicken on the end of his fork you charming little fools he said i dont cut into cataracts in such a hurry as that i perform but one operations on you today it is this he unceremoniously popped the morsel of chicken into lucillas mouth aha bite him well he is nicegoot now then sit down all of you lonch lonch  he was irresistible we all sat down at table  the rest of us ate herr grosse gobbled from mayonnaise to marmalade tart from marmalade tart back again to mayonnaise from mayonnaise forward again to ham sandwiches and blancmange and then back once more on the word of an honest woman to mayonnaise his drinking was on the same scale as his eating beer wine brandynothing came amiss to him he mixed them all as for the lighter elements in the feastthe almonds and raisins the preserved ginger and the crystallized fruits he ate them as accompaniments to everything a dish of olives especially won his favor he plunged both hands into it and deposited his fistsfull of olives in the pockets of his trousers in this ways he explained i shall trouble nobody to pass the dishi shall have by me continually all the olives that i want when he could eat and drink no more he rolled up his napkin into a ball and became devoutly thankful how goot of gott he remarked when he invented the worlds to invent eatings and drinkings too ah sighed herr grosse gently laying his outspread fingers on the pit of his stomach what immense happiness there is in this  mr sebright looked at his watch  if there is anything more to be said on the question of the operation he announced it must be said at once we have barely five minutes more to spare you have heard my opinion i hold to it  herr grosse took a pinch of snuff i also he said hold to mine  lucilla turned towards the place from which mr sebright had spoken  i am obliged to you sir for your opinion she said very quietly and firmly i am determined to try the operation if it does fail it will only leave me what i am now if it succeeds it gives me a new life i will bear anything and risk anything on the chance that i may see  so she announced her decision in those memorable words she cleared the way for the coming event in her life and in our lives which it is the purpose of these pages to record  mr sebright answered her in mr sebrights discreet way  i cannot affect to be surprised at your decision he said however sincerely i may regret it i admit that it is the natural decision in your case  lucilla addressed herself next to herr grosse  choose your own day she said the sooner the better tomorrow if you can  answer me one little thing miss rejoined the german with a sudden gravity of tone and manner which was quite new in our experience of him do you mean what you say  she answered him gravely on her side i mean what i say  goot there is times my lofe to be funny there is also times to be grave it is gravetimes now i have my last word to say to you before i go  with his wild black eyes staring through his owlish spectacles at lucillas face speaking earnestly in his strange broken english he now impressed on his patient the necessity of gravely considering and preparing for the operation which he had undertaken to perform  i was greatly relieved by the tone he took with her he spoke with authority she would be obliged to listen to him  in the first place he warned lucilla if the operation failed that there would be no possibility of returning to it and trying it again once done be the results what they might it was done for good  in the second place before he would consent to operate he must insist on certain conditions essential to success being rigidly complied with on the part of the patient and her friends mr sebright had by no means exaggerated the length of the time of trial which would follow the operation in the darkened room under no circumstances could she hope to have her eyes uncovered even for a few moments to the light after a shorter interval than six weeks during the whole of that time and probably during another six weeks to follow it was absolutely necessary that she should be kept in such a state of health as would assist her constitutionally in her gradual progress towards complete restoration of sight if body and mind both were not preserved in their best and steadiest condition all that his skill could do might be done in vain nothing to excite or to agitate her must be allowed to find its way into the quiet daily routine of her life until her medical attendant was satisfied that her sight was safe the success of herr grosses professional career had been due in no small degree to his rigid enforcement of these rules founded on his own experience of the influence which a patients general health moral as well as physical exercised on that patients chance of profiting under an operationmore especially under an operation on an organ so delicate as the organ of sight  having spoken to this effect he appealed to lucillas own good sense to recognize the necessity of taking time to consider her decision and to consult on it with relatives and friends in plain words for at least three months the family arrangements must be so shaped as to enable the surgeon in attendance on her to hold the absolute power of regulating her life and of deciding on any changes introduced into it when she and the members of her family circle were sure of being able to comply with these conditions lucilla had only to write to him at his hotel in london on the next day he would undertake to be at dimchurch and then and there if he was satisfied with the state of her health at the time he would perform the operation  after pledging himself in those terms herr grosse puffed out his remaining breath in one deep guttural hahand got briskly on his short legs at the same moment zillah knocked at the door and announced that the chaise was waiting for the two gentlemen at the rectorygate  mr sebright rosein some doubt apparently whether his colleague had done talking dont let me hurry you he said i have business in london and i must positively catch the next train  soh i have my business in london too answered his brotheroculistthe business of pleasure mr sebright looked scandalized at the frankness of this confession coming from a professional man i am so passionfond of musics herr grosse went oni want to be in goot times for the opera ach gott musics is expensive in england i climb to the gallery and pay my five silver shillingses even there for five copper pences in my own country i can get the same thingonly better done from the deep bottoms of my heart proceeded this curious man taking a cordial leave of me i thank you dear madam for the mayonnaise when i come again i pray you more of that lofely dish he turned to lucilla and popped his thumb on her eyelids for the last time at parting my sweetfeench remember what your surgeonoptic has said to you i shall let the light in herebut in my own way at my own time pretty lofe ah how infinitely much prettier she will be when she can see he took lucillas hand and put it sentimentally inside the collar of his waistcoat over the region of the heart laying his other hand upon it as if he was keeping it warm in this tender attitude he blew a prodigious sigh recovered himself with a shake of his shockhead winked at me through his spectacles and waddled out after mr sebright who was already at the bottom of the stairs who would have guessed that this man held the key which was to open for my blind lucilla the gates of a new life    chapter the thirtysecond  alas for the marriage  we were left together nugent having accompanied the two oculists to the gardengate  now that we were alone oscars absence could hardly fail to attract lucillas attention just as she was referring to him in terms which made it no easy task for me to quiet her successfully we were interrupted by the screams of the baby ascending from the garden below i ran to the window and looked out  mrs finch had actually effected her desperate purpose of waylaying the two surgeons in the interests of babys eyes there she was in a skirt and a shawlwith her novel dropped in one part of the lawn and her handkerchief in the otherpursuing the oculists on their way to the chaise reckless of appearances herr grosse had taken to his heels he was retreating from the screeching infant with his fingers stuffed into his ears as fast as his short legs would let him nugent was ahead of him hurrying on to open the gardengate respectable mr sebright professionally incapable of running brought up the rear at short intervals mrs finch close on his heels held up the baby for inspection at short intervals mr sebright held up his hands in polite protest nugent roaring with laughter threw open the gardengate herr grosse rushed through the opening and disappeared mr sebright followed herr grosse and mrs finch attempted to follow mr sebrightwhen a new personage appeared on the scene startled in the sanctuary of his study by the noise the rector himself strutted into the garden and brought his wife to a sudden standstill by inquiring in his deepest base notes what does this unseemly disturbance mean  the chaise drove off and nugent closed the gardengate  some words inaudible to my ears passed between nugent and the rectorreferring as i could only suppose to the visit of the two departing surgeons after awhile mr finch turned away to all appearance offended by something which had been said to him and addressed himself to oscar who now reappeared on the lawn having evidently only waited to show himself until the chaise drove away the rector paternally took his arm and beckoning to his wife with the other hand took mrs finchs arm next majestically marching back to the house between the two reverend finch asserted himself and his authority alternately now to oscar and now to his wife his big booming voice reached my ears distinctly accompanied in sharp discord by the last wailings of the exhausted child  in these terrible words the pope of dimchurch beganoscar you are to understand distinctly if you please that i maintain my protest against this impious attempt to meddle with my afflicted daughters sightmrs finch you are to understand that i excuse your unseemly pursuit of two strange surgeons in consideration of the state that i find you in at this moment after your last confinement but eight you became i remember hysterically irresponsible hold your tongue you are hysterically irresponsible nowoscar i decline in justice to myself to be present at any discussion which may follow the visit of those two professional persons but i am not averse to advising you for your own good my foot is down put your foot down toomrs finch how long is it since you ate last two hours are you sure it is two hours very good you require a sedative application i order you medically to get into a warm bath and stay there till i come to youoscar you are deficient my good fellow in moral weight endeavor to oppose yourself resolutely to any scheme on the part of my unhappy daughter or of those who advise her which involves more expenditure of money in fees and new appearances of professional personsmrs finch the temperature is to be ninetyeight and the position partially recumbentoscar i authorize you if you cant stop it in any other way to throw my moral weight into the scale you are free to say i oppose this with mr finchs approval i am so to speak backed by mr finchmrs finch i wish you to understand the object of the bath hold your tongue the object is to produce a gentle action on your skin one of the women is to keep her eye on your forehead the instant she perceives an appearance of moisture she is to run for meoscar you will let me know at what decision they arrive upstairs in my daughters room not after they have merely heard what you have to say but after my moral weight has been thrown into the scalemrs finch on leaving the bath i shall have you only lightly clothed i forbid with a view to your head all compression whether of stays or strings round the waist i forbid garterswith the same object you will abstain from tea and talking you will lie loose on your back you will  what else this unhappy woman was to do i failed to hear mr finch disappeared with her round the corner of the house oscar waited at the door of our side of the rectory until nugent joined him on their way back to the sittingroom in which we were expecting their return    after an interval of a few minutes the brothers appeared  throughout the whole of the time during which the surgeons had been in the house i had noticed that nugent persisted in keeping himself scrupulously in the background having assumed the responsibility of putting the serious question of lucillas sight scientifically to the test he appeared to be resolved to pause there and to interfere no further in the affair after it had passed its first stage and now again when we were met in our little committee to discuss and possibly to combat lucillas resolution to proceed to extremities he once more refrained from interfering actively with the matter in hand  i have brought oscar back with me he said to lucilla and i have told him how widely the two oculists differ in opinion on your case he knows also that you have decided on being guided by the more favorable view taken by herr grosseand he knows no more  there he stopped abruptly and seated himself apart from us at the lower end of the room  lucilla instantly appealed to oscar to explain his conduct  why have you kept out of the way she asked why have you not been with me at the most important moment of my life  because i felt your anxious position too keenly oscar answered dont think me inconsiderate towards you lucilla if i had not kept away i might not have been able to control myself  i thought that reply far too dexterous to have come from oscar on the spur of the moment besides he looked at his brother when he said the last words it seemed more than likelyshort as the interval had been before they appeared in the sittingroomthat nugent had been advising oscar and had been telling him what to say  lucilla received his excuses with the readiest grace and kindness  mr sebright tells me oscar that my sight is hopelessly gone she said herr grosse answers for it that an operation will make me see need i tell you which of the two i believe in if i could have had my own way herr grosse should have operated on my eyes before he went back to london  did he refuse  yes  why  lucilla told him of the reasons which the german oculist had stated as unanswerable reasons for delay oscar listened attentively and looked at his brother again before he replied  as i understand it he said if you decide on risking the operation at once you decide on undergoing six weeks imprisonment in a darkened room and on placing yourself entirely at the surgeons disposal for six weeks more after that have you considered lucilla that this means putting off our marriage again for at least three months  if you were in my place oscar you would let nothing not even your marriage stand in the way of your restoration to sight dont ask me to consider love i can consider nothing but the prospect of seeing you  that fearlessly frank confession silenced him he happened to be sitting opposite to the glass so that he could see his face the poor wretch abruptly moved his chair so as to turn his back on it  i looked at nugent and surprised him trying to catch his brothers eye prompted by him as i could now no longer doubt oscar had laid his finger on a certain domestic difficulty which i had had in my mind from the moment when the question of the operation had been first agitated among us  the marriage of oscar and lucillait is here necessary to explainhad encountered another obstacle and undergone a new delay in consequence of the dangerous illness of lucillas aunt miss batchford formally invited to the ceremony as a matter of course had most considerately sent a message begging that the marriage might not be deferred on her account lucilla however had refused to allow her wedding to be celebrated while the woman who had been a second mother to her lay at the point of death the rector having an eye to rich miss batchfords moneynot for himself miss b detested him but for lucillahad supported his daughters decision and oscar had been compelled to submit these domestic events had taken place about three weeks since and we were now in receipt of news which not only assured us of the old ladys recovery but informed us also that she would be well enough to make one of the wedding party in a fortnights time the brides dress was in the house the brides father was ready to officiateand here like a fatality was the question of the operation unexpectedly starting up and threatening another delay yet for a period which could not possibly be shorter than a period of three months add to this if you please a new element of embarrassment as follows supposing lucilla to persist in her resolution and oscar to persist in concealing from her the personal change in him produced by the medical treatment of the fits what would happen nothing less than this lucilla if the operation succeeded would find out for herselfbefore instead of after her marriagethe deception that had been practiced on her and how she might resent that deception thus discovered the cleverest person among us could not pretend to foresee there was our situation as we sat in domestic parliament assembled when the surgeons had left us  finding it impossible to attract his brothers attention nugent had no alternative but to interfere actively for the first time  let me suggest lucilla he said that it is your duty to look at the other side of the question before you make up your mind in the first place it is surely hard on oscar to postpone the weddingday again in the second place clever as he is herr grosse is not infallible it is just possible that the operation may fail and that you may find you have put off your marriage for three months to no purpose do think of it if you defer the operation on your eyes till after your marriage you conciliate all interests and you only delay by a month or so the time when you may see  lucilla impatiently shook her head  if you were blind she answered you would not willingly delay by a single hour the time when you might see you ask me to think of it i ask you to think of the years i have lost i ask you to think of the exquisite happiness i shall feel when oscar and i are standing at the altar if i can see the husband to whom i am giving myself for life put it off for a month you might as well ask me to die for a month it is like death to be sitting here blind and to know that a man is within a few hours reach of me who can give me my sight i tell you all plainly if you go on opposing me in this i dont answer for myself if herr grosse is not recalled to dimchurch before the end of the weeki am my own mistress i will go to him in london  both the brothers looked at me  have you nothing to say madame pratolungo asked nugent  oscar was too painfully agitated to speak he softly crossed to my chair and kneeling by me put my hand entreatingly to his lips  you may consider me a heartless woman if you will i remained entirely unmoved even by this lucillas interests and my interests you will observe were now one i had resolved from the first that she should not be married in ignorance of which was the man who was disfigured by the blue face if she took the course which would enable her to make that discovery for herself at the right time she would spare me the performance of a very painful and ungracious dutyand she would marry as i was determined she should marry with a full knowledge of the truth in this position of affairs it was no business of mine to join the twinbrothers in trying to make her alter her resolution on the contrary it was my business to confirm her in it  i cant see that i have any right to interfere i said in lucillas placeafter one and twenty years of blindnessi too should sacrifice every other consideration to the consideration of recovering my sight  oscar instantly rose offended with me and walked away to the window lucillas face brightened gratefully ah she said you understand me nugent in his turn left his chair he had confidently calculated in his brothers interests on lucillas marriage preceding the recovery of lucillas sight that calculation was completely baffled the marriage would now depend on the state of lucillas feelings after she had penetrated the truth for herself i saw nugents face darken as he walked to the door  madame pratolungo he said you may one day regret the course that you have just taken do as you please lucillai have no more to say  he left the room with a quiet submission to circumstances which became him admirably now as always it was impossible not to compare him advantageously with his vacillating brother oscar turned round at the window apparently with the idea of following nugent out at the first step he checked himself there was a last effort still left to make reverend finchs moral weight had not been thrown into the scale yet  there is one thing more lucilla he said which you ought to know before you decide i have seen your father he desires me to tell you that he is strongly opposed to the experiment which you are determined to try  lucilla sighed wearily it is not the first time that i find my father failing to sympathize with me she said i am distressedbut not surprised it is you who surprise me she added suddenly raising her voice you who love me are not one with me when i am standing on the brink of a new life good heavens are my interests not your interests in this is it not worth your while to wait till i can look at you when i vow before god to love honor and obey you do you understand him she asked appealing abruptly to me why does he try to start difficulties why is he not as eager about it as i am  i turned to oscar now was the time for him to fall at her feet and own it here was the golden opportunity that might never come again i signed to him impatiently to take it he tried to take itlet me do him the justice now which i failed to do him at the timehe tried to take it he advanced towards her he struggled with himself he said there is a motive for my conduct lucilla and stopped his breath failed him he struggled again he forced out a word or two more a motive he went on which i have been afraid to confess he paused again with the perspiration pouring over his livid face  lucillas patience failed her what is your motive she asked sharply  the tone in which she spoke broke down his last reserves of resolution he turned his head suddenly so as not to see her at the final momentmiserable miserable manat the final moment he took refuge in an excuse  i dont believe in herr grosse he said faintly as you believe in him  lucilla rose bitterly disappointed and opened the door that led into her own room  if it had been you who were blind she answered your belief would have been my belief and your hope my hope it seems i have expected too much from you live and learn live and learn  she went into her room and closed the door on us i could bear it no longer i got up with the firm resolution in me to follow her and say the words which he had failed to say for himself my hand was on the door when i was suddenly pulled back from it by oscar i turned and faced him in silence  no he said with his eyes fixed on mine and his hand still on my arm if i dont tell her nobody shall tell her for me  she shall be deceived no longershe must and shall hear it i answered let me go  you have given me your promise to wait for my leave before you open your lips i forbid you to open your lips  i snapped the fingers of my hand that was free in his face that for my promise i said your contemptible weakness is putting her happiness in peril as well as yours i turned my head towards the door and called to her lucilla  his hand closed fast on my arm some lurking devil in him that i had never seen yet leapt up and looked at me out of his eyes  tell her he whispered savagely between his teeth and i will contradict you to your face if you are desperate i am desperate too i dont care what meanness i am guilty of i will deny it on my honor i will deny it on my oath you heard what she said about you at browndown she will believe me before you  lucilla opened her door and stood waiting on the threshold  what is it she asked quietly  a moments glance at oscar warned me that he would do what he had threatened if i persisted in my resolution the desperation of a weak man is of all desperations the most unscrupulous and the most unmanageablewhen it is once roused angry as i was i shrank from degrading him as i must now have degraded him if i matched my obstinacy against his in mercy to both of them i gave way  i may be going out my dear before it gets dark i said to lucilla can i do anything for you in the village  yes she said if you will wait a little you can take a letter for me to the post  she went back into her room and closed the door  i neither looked at oscar nor spoke to him when we were alone again he was the first who broke the silence  you have remembered your promise to me he said you have done well  i have nothing more to say to you i answered i shall go to my own room  his eyes followed me uneasily as i walked to the door  i shall speak to her he muttered doggedly at my own time  a wise woman would not have allowed him to irritate her into saying another word alas i am not a wise womanthat is to say not always  your own time i repeated with the whole force of my contempt if you dont own the truth to her before the german surgeon comes back your time will have gone by for ever he has told us in the plainest termswhen once the operation is performed nothing must be said to agitate or distress her for months afterwards the preservation of her tranquillity is the condition of the recovery of her sight you will soon have an excuse for your silence mr oscar dubourg  the tone in which i said those last words stung him to some purpose  spare your sneers you heartless frenchwoman he broke out angrily i dont care how i stand in your estimation lucilla loves me nugent feels for me  my vile temper instantly hit on the most merciless answer that i could make to him in return  ah poor lucilla i said what a much happier prospect hers might have been what a thousand pities it is that she is not going to marry your brother instead of marrying you  he winced under that reply as if i had cut him with a knife his head dropped on his breast he started back from me like a beaten dogand suddenly and silently left the room  i had not been a minute by myself before my anger cooled i tried to keep it hot i tried to remember that he had aspersed my nation in calling me a heartless frenchwoman no it was not to be done in spite of myself i repented what i had said to him  in a moment more i was out on the stairs to try if i could overtake him  i was too late i heard the gardengate bang before i was out of the house twice i approached the gate to follow him and twice i drew back in the fear of making bad worse it ended in my returning to the sittingroom very seriously dissatisfied with myself  the first welcome interruption to my solitude camenot from lucillabut from the old nurse zillah appeared with a letter for me left that moment at the rectory by the servant from browndown the direction was in oscars handwriting i opened the envelope and read these words  madame pratolungoyou have distressed and pained me more than i can say there are faults and serious ones on my side i know i heartily beg your pardon for anything that i may have said or done to offend you i cannot submit to your hard verdict on me if you knew how i adore lucilla you would make allowances for meyou would understand me better than you do i cannot get your last cruel words out of my ears i cannot meet you again without some explanation of them you stabbed me to the heart when you said to me this evening that it would be a happier prospect for lucilla if she had been going to marry my brother instead of marrying me i hope you did not really mean that will you please write and tell me whether you did or not  oscar  write and tell him it was absurd enoughwhen we were within a few minutes walk of each otherthat oscar should prefer the cold formality of a letter to the friendly ease of a personal interview why could he not have called and spoken to me we should have made it up together far more comfortably in that wayand in half the time at any rate i determined to go to browndown and be good friends again viv√¢voce with this poor weak wellmeaning illjudging boy was it not monstrous to have attached serious meaning to what oscar had said when he was in a panic of nervous terror his tone of writing so keenly distressed me that i resented his letter on that very account it was one of the chilly evenings of an english june a small fire was burning in the grate i crumpled up the letter and threw it as i supposed into the fire afterevents showed that i only threw it into a corner of the fender instead then i put on my hat without stopping to think of lucilla or of what she was writing for the post and ran off to browndown  where do you think i found him locked up in his own room his insane shynessit was really nothing lessmade him shrink from that very personal explanation which with such a temperament as mine was the only possible explanation under the circumstances i had to threaten him with forcing his door before i could get him to show himself and take my hand  once face to face with him i soon set things right i really believe he had been half mad with his own selfimposed troubles when he had declared he would give me the lie at the door of lucillas room  it is needless to dwell on what took place between us i shall only say here that i had serious reason at a later timeas you will soon seeto regret not having humoured oscars request that i should reconcile myself to him by writing instead of by word of mouth if i had only placed on record in pen and ink what i actually said in the way of making atonement to him i might have spared some suffering to myself and to others as it was the only proof that i had absolved myself in his estimation consisted in his cordially shaking hands with me at the door when i left him  did you meet nugent he asked as he walked with me across the enclosure in front of the house  i had gone to browndown by a short cut at the back of the garden instead of going through the village having mentioned this i asked if nugent had returned to the rectory  he went back to see you said oscar  why  only his usual kindness he takes your views of things he laughed when he heard i had sent a letter to you and he ran off dear fellow to see you on my behalf you must have met him if you had come here by the village  on getting back to the rectory i questioned zillah nugent in my absence had run up into the sittingroom had waited there a few minutes alone on the chance of my return had got tired of waiting and had gone away again i inquired about lucilla next a few minutes after nugent had gone she had left her room and she too had asked for me hearing that i was not to be found in the house she had given zillah a letter to postand had then returned to her bedchamber  i happened to be standing by the hearth looking into the dying fire while the nurse was speaking not a vestige of oscars letter to me as i now well remember was to be seen in my position the plain conclusion was that i had really done what i supposed myself to have donethat is to say thrown the letter into the flames  entering lucillas room soon afterwards to make my apologies for having forgotten to wait and take her letter to the post i found her weary enough after the events of the day getting ready for bed  i dont wonder at your being tired of waiting for me she said writing is long long work for me but this was a letter which i felt bound to write myself if i could can you guess who i am corresponding with it is done my dear i have written to herr grosse  already  what is there to wait for what is there left to determine on i have told herr grosse that our family consultation is over and that i am entirely at his disposal for any length of time he may think right and i warn him if he attempts to put it off that he will be only forcing on me the inconvenience of going to him in london i have expressed that part of my letter stronglyi can tell you he will get it tomorrow by the afternoon post and the next dayif he is a man of his wordhe will be here  oh lucilla not to operate on your eyes  yesto operate on my eyes    chapter the thirtythird  the day between  the intervalday before the second appearance of herr grosse and the experiment on lucillas sight that was to follow it was marked by two incidents which ought to be noticed in this place  the first incident was the arrival early in the morning of another letter addressed to me privately by oscar dubourg like many other shy people he had a perfect mania where any embarrassing circumstances were concerned for explaining himself with difficulty by means of his pen in preference to explaining himself with ease by means of his tongue  oscars present communication informed me that he had left us for london by the first morning train and that his object in taking this sudden journey wasto state his present position towards lucilla to a gentleman especially conversant with the peculiarities of blind people in plain words he had resolved on applying to mr sebright for advice  i like mr sebright oscar wrote as cordially as i detest herr grosse the short conversation i had with him has left me with the pleasantest impression of his delicacy and his kindness if i freely reveal to this skillful surgeon the sad situation in which i am placed i believe his experience will throw an entirely new light on the present state of lucillas mind and on the changes which we may expect to see produced in her if she really does recover her sight the result may be of incalculable benefit in teaching me how i may own the truth most harmlessly to her as well as to myself pray dont suppose i undervalue your advice i only want to be doubly fortified before i risk my confession by the advice of a scientific man  all this i took to mean in plain english that vacillating oscar wanted to quiet his conscience by gaining time and that his absurd idea of consulting mr sebright was nothing less than a new and plausible excuse for putting off the evil day his letter ended by pledging me to secrecy and by entreating me so to manage matters as to grant him a private interview on his return to dimchurch by the evening train  i confess i felt some curiosity as to what would come of the proposed consultation between unready oscar and precise mr sebrightand i accordingly arranged to take my walk alone towards eight oclock that evening on the road that led to the distant railway station    the second incident of the day may be described as a confidential conversation between lucilla and myself on the subject which now equally absorbed us boththe momentous subject of her restoration to the blessing of sight  she joined me at the breakfasttable with her ready distrust newly excited poor thing by oscar he had accounted to her for his journey to london by putting forward the commonplace excuse of business she instantly suspected knowing how he felt about it that he was secretly bent on interfering with the performance of the operation by herr grosse i contrived to compose the anxiety thus aroused in her mind by informing her on oscars own authority that he personally disliked and distrusted the german oculist make your mind easy i said i answer for his not venturing near herr grosse  a long silence between us followed those words when lucilla next referred to oscar in connection with the coming operation the depressed state of her spirits seemed to have quite altered her view of her own prospects she of all the people in the world now spoke in disparagement of the blessing conferred on the blind by the recovery of their sight  do you know one thing she said if i had not been going to be married to oscar i doubt if i should have cared to put any oculist native or foreign to the trouble of coming to dimchurch  i dont think i understand you i answered you cannot surely mean to say that you would not have been glad under any circumstances to recover your sight  that is just what i do mean to say  what you who have written to grosse to hurry the operation dont care to see  i only care to see oscar and what is more i only care to see him because i am in love with him but for that i really dont feel as if it would give me any particular pleasure to use my eyes i have been blind so long i have learnt to do without them  and yet you looked perfectly entranced when nugent first set you doubting whether you were blind for life  nugent took me by surprise she answered nugent startled me out of my senses i have had time to think since i am not carried away by the enthusiasm of the moment now you people who can see attach such an absurd importance to your eyes i set my touch my dear against your eyes as much the most trustworthy and much the most intelligent sense of the two if oscar was not as i have said the uppermost feeling with me shall i tell you what i should have infinitely preferred to recovering my sightsupposing it could have been done she shook her head with a comic resignation to circumstances unfortunately it cant be done  what cant be done  she suddenly held out both her arms over the breakfasttable  the stretching out of these to an enormous and unheardof length that is what i should have liked she answered i could find out better what was going on at a distance with my hands than you could with your eyes and your telescopes what doubts i might set at rest for instance about the planetary system among the people who can see if i could only stretch out far enough to touch the stars  this is talking sheer nonsense lucilla  is it just tell me which knows best in the darkmy touch or your eyes who has got a sense that she can always trust to serve her equally well through the whole fourandtwenty hours you or me but for oscarto speak in sober earnest this timei tell you i would much rather perfect the sense in me that i have already got than have a sense given to me that i have not got until i knew oscar i dont think i ever honestly envied any of you the use of your eyes  you astonish me lucilla  she rattled her teaspoon impatiently in her empty cup  can you always trust your eyes even in broad daylight she burst out how often do they deceive you in the simplest things what did i hear you all disputing about the other day in the garden you were looking at some view  yesat the view down the alley of trees at the other end of the churchyard wall  some object in the alley had attracted general noticehad it not  yesan object at the further end of it  i heard you up here you all differed in opinion in spite of your wonderful eyes my father said it moved you said it stood still oscar said it was a man mrs finch said it was a calf nugent ran off and examined this amazing object at close quarters and what did it turn out to be a stump of an old tree blown across the road in the night why am i to envy people the possession of a sense which plays them such tricks as that no no herr grosse is going to cut into my cataracts as he calls itbecause i am going to be married to a man i love and i fancy like a fool i may love him better still if i can see him i may be quite wrong she added archly it may end in my not loving him half as well as i do now  i thought of oscars face and felt a sickening fear that she might be speaking far more seriously than she suspected i tried to change the subject no her imaginative nature had found its way into a new region of speculation before i could open my lips  i associate light she said thoughtfully with all that is beautiful and heavenlyand dark with all that is vile and horrible and devilish i wonder how light and dark will look to me when i see  i believe they will astonish you i answered by being entirely unlike what you fancy them to be now  she started i had alarmed her without intending it  will oscars face be utterly unlike what i fancy it to be now she asked in suddenly altered tones do you mean to say that i have not had the right image of him in my mind all this time  i tried again to draw her off to another topic what more could i dowith my tongue tied by the germans warning to us not to agitate her in the face of the operation to be performed on the next day  it was quite useless she went on as before without heeding me  have i no means of judging rightly what oscar is like she said i touch my own face i know how long it is and how broad it is i know how big the different features are and where they are and then i touch oscar and compare his face with my knowledge of my own face not a single detail escapes me i see him in my mind as plainly as you see me across this table do you mean to say when i see him with my eyes that i shall discover something perfectly new to me i dont believe it she started up impatiently and took a turn in the room oh she exclaimed with a stamp of her foot why cant i take laudanum enough or chloroform enough to kill me for the next six weeksand then come to life again when the german takes the bandage off my eyes she sat down once more and drifted all on a sudden into a question of pure morality tell me this she said is the greatest virtue the virtue which it is most difficult to practice  i suppose so i answered  she drummed with both hands on the table petulantly viciously as hard as she could  then madame pratolungo she said the greatest of all the virtues ispatience oh my friend how i hate the greatest of all the virtues at this moment  that ended itthere the conversation found its way into other topics at last  thinking afterwards of the new side of her mind which lucilla had shown to me i derived one consolation from what had passed at the breakfasttable if mr sebright proved to be right and if the operation failed after all i had lucillas word for it that blindness of itself is not the terrible affliction to the blind which the rest of us fancy it to bebecause we can see  towards halfpast seven in the evening i went out alone as i had planned to meet oscar on his return from london  at a long straight stretch of the road i saw him advancing towards me he was walking more rapidly than usual and singing as he walked even through its livid discoloration the poor fellows face looked radiant with happiness as he came nearer he waved his walkingstick exultingly in the air good news he called out at the top of his voice mr sebright has made me a happy man again i had never before seen him so like nugent in manner as i now saw him when we met and he shook hands with me  tell me all about it i said  he gave me his arm and talking all the way we walked back slowly to dimchurch  in the first place he began mr sebright holds to his own opinion more firmly than ever he feels absolutely certain that the operation will fail  is that your good news i asked reproachfully  no he said though mind i own to my shame there was a time when i almost hoped it would fail mr sebright has put me in a better frame of mind i have little or nothing to dread from the success of the operationif by any extraordinary chance it should succeed i remind you of mr sebrights opinion merely to give you a right idea of the tone which he took with me at starting he only consented under protest to contemplate the event which lucilla and herr grosse consider to be a certainty if the statement of your position requires it he said i will admit that it is barely possible she may be able to see you two months hence now begin i began by informing him of my marriage engagement  shall i tell you how mr sebright received the information i said he held his tongue and made you a bow  oscar laughed  quite true he answered i told him next of lucillas extraordinary antipathy to dark people and dark shades of color of all kinds can you guess what he said to me when i had done  i owned that my observation of mr sebrights character did not extend to guessing that  he said it was a common antipathy in his experience of the blind it was one among the many strange influences exercised by blindness on the mind the physical affliction has its mysterious moral influence he said we can observe it but we cant explain it the special antipathy which you mention is an incurable antipathy except on one conditionthe recovery of the sight there he stopped i entreated him to go on no he declined to go on until i had finished what i had to say to him first i had my confession still to make to himand i made it  you concealed nothing  nothing i laid my weakness bare before him i told him that lucilla was still firmly convinced that nugents was the discolored face instead of mine and then i put the questionwhat am i to do  and how did he reply  in these wordsif you ask me what you are to do in the event of her remaining blind which i tell you again will be the event i decline to advise you your own conscience and your own sense of honor must decide the question on the other hand if you ask me what you are to do in the event of her recovering her sight i can answer you unreservedly in the plainest terms leave things as they are and wait till she sees those were his own words oh the load that they took off my mind i made him repeat themi declare i was almost afraid to trust the evidence of my own ears  i understood the motive of oscars good spirits better than i understood the motive of mr sebrights advice did he give his reasons i asked  you shall hear his reasons directly he insisted on first satisfying himself that i thoroughly understood my position at that moment the prime condition of success as herr grosse has told you he said is the perfect tranquillity of the patient if you make your confession to the young lady when you get back tonight to dimchurch you throw her into a state of excitement which will render it impossible for my german colleague to operate on her tomorrow if you defer your confession the medical necessities of the case force you to be silent until the professional attendance of the oculist has ceased there is your position my advice to you is to adopt the last alternative wait and make the other persons in the secret wait until the result of the operation has declared itself there i stopped him do you mean that i am to be present on the first occasion when she is able to use her eyes i asked am i to let her see me without a word beforehand to prepare her for the color of my face  we were now getting to the interesting part of it you english people when you are out walking and are carrying on a conversation with a friend never come to a standstill at the points of interest we foreigners on the other hand invariably stop i surprised oscar by suddenly pulling him up in the middle of the road  what is the matter he asked  go on i said impatiently  i cant go on he rejoined youre holding me  i held him tighter than ever and ordered him more resolutely than ever to go on oscar resigned himself to a halt foreign fashion on the high road  mr sebright met my question by putting a question on his side he resumed he asked me how i proposed to prepare her for the color of my face  and what did you tell him  i said i had planned to make an excuse for leaving dimchurchand once away to prepare her by writing for what she might expect to see when i returned  what did he say to that  he wouldnt hear of it he said i strongly recommend you to be present on the first occasion when she is capable if she ever is capable of using her sight i attach the greatest importance to her being able to correct the hideous and absurd image now in her mind of a face like yours by seeing you as you really are at the earliest available opportunity  we were just walking on again when certain words in that last sentence startled me i stopped short once more  hideous and absurd image i repeated thinking instantly of my conversation of that morning with lucilla what did mr sebright mean by using such language as that  just what i asked him his reply will interest you it led him into that explanation of his motives which you inquired for just now shall we walk on  my petrified foreign feet recovered their activity we went on again  when i had spoken to mr sebright of lucillas inveterate prejudice oscar continued he had surprised me by saying that it was common in his experience and was only curable by her restoration to sight in support of those assertions he now told me of two interesting cases which had occurred in his professional practice the first was the case of the little daughter of an indian officerblind from infancy like lucilla after operating successfully the time came when he could permit his patient to try her sightthat is to say to try if she could see sufficiently well at first to distinguish dark objects from light among the members of the household assembled to witness the removal of the bandage was an indian nurse who had accompanied the family to england the first person the child saw was her mothera fair woman she clasped her little hands in astonishment and that was all at the next turn of her head she saw the dark indian nurse and instantly screamed with terror mr sebright owned to me that he could not explain it the child could have no possible association with colors yet there nevertheless was the most violent hatred and horror of a dark object the hatred and horror peculiar to the blind expressing itself unmistakably in a child of ten years old my first thought while he was telling me this was of myself and of my chance with lucilla my first question was did the child get used to the nurse i can give you his answer in his own words in a weeks time i found the child sitting in the nurses lap as composedly as i am sitting in this chairthat is encouragingisnt it  most encouragingnobody can deny it  the second instance was more curious still this time the case was the case of a grown manand the object was to show me what strange fantastic images utterly unlike the reality the blind form of the people about them the patient was married and was to see his wife as lucilla is one day to see me for the first time he had been told before he married her that she was personally disfigured by the scar of a wound on one of her cheeks the poor womanah how well i can understand hertrembled for the consequences the man who had loved her dearly while he was blind might hate her when he saw her scarred face her husband had been the first to console her when the operation was determined on he declared that his sense of touch and the descriptions given to him by others had enabled him to form in his own mind the most complete and faithful image of his wifes face nothing that mr sebright could say would induce him to believe that it was physically impossible for him to form a really correct idea of any object animate or inanimate which he had never seen he wouldnt hear of it he was so certain of the result that he held his wifes hand in his to encourage her when the bandage was removed from him at his first look at her he uttered a cry of horror and fell back in his chair in a swoon his wife poor thing was distracted mr sebright did his best to compose her and waited till her husband was able to answer the questions put to him it then appeared that his blind idea of his wife and of her disfigurement had been something so grotesquely and horribly unlike the reality that it was hard to know whether to laugh or to tremble at it she was as beautiful as an angel by comparison with her husbands favorite idea of herand yet because it was his idea he was absolutely disgusted and terrified at the first sight of her in a few weeks he was able to compare his wife with other women to look at pictures to understand what beauty was and what ugliness wasand from that time they have lived together as happy a married couple as any in the kingdom  i was not quite sure which way this last example pointed it alarmed me when i thought of lucilla i came to a standstill again  how did mr sebright apply this second case to lucilla and to you i asked  you shall hear said oscar he first appealed to the case as supporting his assertion that lucillas idea of me must be utterly unlike what i am myself he asked if i was now satisfied that she could have no correct conception of what faces and colors were really like and if i agreed with him in believing that the image in her mind of the man with the blue face was in all probability something fantastically and hideously unlike the reality after what i had heard i agreed with him as a matter of course very well says mr sebright now let its remember that there is one important difference between the case of miss finch and the case that i have just mentioned the husbands blind idea of his wife was the husbands favorite idea the shock of the first sight of her was plainly a shock to him on that account now miss finchs blind idea of the blue face is on the contrary a hateful idea to herthe image is an image that she loathes is it not fair to conclude from this that the first sight of you as you really are is likely to be in her case a relief to her instead of a shock reasoning from my experience i reach that conclusion and i advise you in your own interests to be present when the bandage is taken off even if i prove to be mistakeneven if she is not immediately reconciled to the sight of youthere is the other example of the child and the indian nurse to satisfy you that it is only a question of time sooner or later she will take the discovery as any other young lady would take it at first she will be indignant with you for deceiving her and then if you are sure of your place in her affections she will end in forgiving youthere is my view of your position and there are the grounds on which i form it in the meantime my own opinion remains unshaken i firmly believe that you will never have occasion to act on the advice that i have given to you when the bandage is taken off the chances are five hundred to one that she is no nearer to seeing you then than she is now these were his last wordsand on that we parted  oscar and i walked on again for a little way in silence  i had nothing to say against mr sebrights reasons it was impossible to question the professional experience from which they were drawn as to blind people in general i felt no doubt that his advice was good and that his conclusions were arrived at correctly but lucillas was no ordinary character my experience of her was better experience than mr sebrightsand the more i thought of the future the less inclined i felt to share oscars hopeful view she was just the person to say something or do something at the critical moment of the experiment which would take the wisest previous calculation by surprise oscars prospects never had looked darker to me than they looked at that moment  it would have been useless and cruel to have said to him what i have just said here i put as bright a face on it as i could and asked if he proposed to follow mr sebrights advice  yes he said with a certain reservation of my own which occurred to me after i had left his house  may i ask what it is  certainly i mean to beg nugent to leave dimchurch before lucilla tries her sight for the first time he will do that i know to please me  and when he has done it what then  then i mean to be presentas mr sebright suggestedwhen the bandage is taken off  previously telling lucilla i interposed that it is you who are in the room  no there i take the precaution that i alluded to just now i propose to leave lucilla under the impression that it is i who have left dimchurch and that nugents face is the face she sees if mr sebright proves to be right and if her first sensation is a sensation of relief i will own the truth to her the same day if not i will wait to make my confession until she has become reconciled to the sight of me that plan meets every possible emergency it is one of the few good ideas that my stupid head has hit on since i have been at dimchurch  he said those last words with such an innocent air of triumph that i really could not find it in my heart to damp his ardor by telling him what i thought of his idea all i said was dont forget oscar that the cleverest plans are at the mercy of circumstances at the last moment an accident may happen which will force you to speak out  we came in sight of the rectory as i gave him that final warning nugent was strolling up and down the road on the lookout for us i left oscar to tell his story over again to his brother and went into the house  lucilla was at her piano when i entered the sittingroom she was not only playingbut a rare thing with her singing too the song was poetry and music both of her own composing i shall see him i shall see him in those four words the composition began and ended she adapted them to all the happy melodies in her memory she accompanied them with hands that seemed to be mad for joyhands that threatened every moment to snap the chords of the instrument never since my first day at the rectory had i heard such a noise in our quiet sittingroom as i heard now she was in a fever of exhilaration which in my foreboding frame of mind at that moment it pained and shocked me to see i lifted her off the musicstool and shut up the piano by main force  compose yourself for heavens sake i said do you want to be completely exhausted when the german comes tomorrow  that consideration instantly checked her she suddenly became quiet with the abrupt facility of a child  i forgot that she said sitting down in a corner with a face of dismay he might refuse to perform the operation oh my dear quiet me down somehow get a book and read to me  i got the book ah the poor author neither she nor i paid the slightest attention to him worse still we abused him for not interesting usand then shut him up with a bang and pushed him rudely into his place on the bookshelf and left him upside down and went to bed  she was standing at her window when i went in to wish her good night the mellow moonlight fell tenderly on her lovely face  moon that i have never seen she murmured softly i feel you looking at me is the time coming when i shall look at you she turned from the window and eagerly put my fingers on her pulse am i quite composed again she asked will he find me well tomorrow feel it feel it is it quiet now  i felt itthrobbing faster and faster  sleep will quiet it i saidand kissed her and left her    she slept well as for me i passed such a wretched night and got up so completely worn out that i had to go back to my room after breakfast and lie down again lucilla persuaded me to do it herr grosse wont be here till the afternoon she said rest till he comes  we had reckoned without allowing for the eccentric character of our german surgeon excepting the business of his profession herr grosse did everything by impulse and nothing by rule i had not long fallen into a broken unrefreshing sleep when i felt zillahs hand on my shoulder and heard zillahs voice in my ear  please to get up maam hes herehe has come from london by the morning train  i hurried into the sittingroom  there at the table sat herr grosse with an open instrumentcase before him his wild black eyes gloating over a hideous array of scissors probes and knives and his shabby hat hard by with lint and bandages huddled together anyhow inside it and there stood lucilla by his side stooping over himwith one hand laid familiarly on his shoulder and with the other deftly fingering one of his horrid instruments to find out what it was like   the end of the first part     part the second    chapter the thirtyfourth  nugent shows his hand  i closed the first part of my narrative on the day of the operation the twentyfifth of june  i open the second part between six and seven weeks later on the ninth of august  how did the time pass at dimchurch in that interval  searching backwards in my memory i call to life again the domestic history of the six weeks it looks on retrospection miserably dull and empty of incident i wonder when i contemplate it now how we got through that weary intervalhow we bore that forced inaction that unrelieved oppression of suspense    changing from bedroom to sittingroom from sittingroom back to bedroom with the daylight always shut out with the bandages always on except when the surgeon looked at her eyes lucilla bore the imprisonmentand worse than the imprisonment the uncertaintyof her period of probation with the courage that can endure anything the courage sustained by hope with books with music with talkabove all with love to help hershe counted her way calmly through the dull succession of hours and days till the time came which was to decide the question in dispute between the oculiststhe terrible question of which of the two mr sebright or herr grosse was right  i was not present at the examination which finally decided all doubt i joined oscar in the gardenquite as incapable as he was of exerting the slightest selfcontrol we paced silently backwards and forwards on the lawn like two animals in a cage zillah was the only witness present when the german examined our poor darlings eyes nugent engaging to wait in the next room and announce the result from the window as the event turned out herr grosse was beforehand with him once more we heard his broken english shouting hihihoi hoihi hoihi once more we beheld his huge silk handkerchief waving at the window i turned sick and faint under the excitement of the momentunder the rapture it was nothing less of hearing those three electrifying words she will see mercy how we did abuse mr sebright when we were all reunited again in lucillas room  the first excitement over we had our difficulties to contend with next  from the moment when she was positively informed that the operation had succeeded our oncepatient lucilla developed into a new being she now rose in perpetual revolt against the caution which still deferred the day on which she was to be allowed to make the first trial of her sight it required all my influence backed by oscars entreaties and strengthened by the furious foreign english of our excellent german surgeon herr grosse had a temper of his own i can tell you to prevent her from breaking through the medical discipline which held her in its grasp when she became quite unmanageable and vehemently abused him to his face our good grosse used to swear at her in a compound bad language of his own with a tremendous aspiration at the beginning of it which always set matters right by making her laugh i see him again as i write leaving the room on these occasions with his eyes blazing through his spectacles and his shabby hat cocked sideways on his head soh you littlespitfirefeench if you touch that bandages when i have put him onhodamndamn i say no more goodbye  from lucilla i turn to the twinbrothers next  tranquilized as to the future after his interview with mr sebright oscar presented himself at his best during the time of which i am now writing lucillas main reliance in her days in the darkened room was on what her lover could do to relieve and to encourage her he never once failed her his patience was perfect his devotion was inexhaustible it is sad to say so in view of what happened afterwards but i only tell a necessary truth when i declare that he immensely strengthened his hold on her affections in those last days of her blindness when his society was most precious to her ah how fervently she used to talk of him when she and i were left together at night forgive me if i leave this part of the history of the courtship untold i dont like to write of iti dont like to think of it let us get on to something else  nugent comes next i would give a great deal poor as i am to be able to leave him out it is not to be done i must write about that lost wretch and you must read about him whether we like it or not  the days of lucillas imprisonment were also the days when my favorite disappointed me for the first time he and his brother seemed to change places it was nugent now who appeared to disadvantage by comparison with oscar he surprised and grieved his brother by leaving browndown all i can do for you i have done he said i can be of no further use for the present to anybody let me go i am stagnating in this miserable placei must and will have change oscars entreaties in nugents present frame of mind failed to move him away he went one morning without bidding anybody goodbye he had talked of being absent for a weekhe remained away for a month we heard of him leading a wild life among a vicious set of men it was reported that a frantic restlessness possessed him which nobody could understand he came back as suddenly as he had left us his variable nature had swung round in the interval to the opposite extreme he was full of repentance for his reckless conduct he was in a state of depression which defied rousing he despaired of himself and his future sometimes he talked of going back to america and sometimes he threatened to close his career by enlisting as a private soldier would any other person in my place have seen which way these signs pointed i doubt it if that persons mind had been absorbed as mine was in watching lucilla day by day even if i had been a suspicious woman by naturewhich thank god i am notmy distrust must have lain dormant in the allsubduing atmosphere of suspense hanging heavily on me morning noon and night in the darkened room  so much briefly for the sayings and doings of the persons principally concerned in this narrative during the six weeks which separate part the first from part the second  i begin again on the ninth of august  this was the memorable day chosen by herr grosse for risking the experiment of removing the bandage and permitting lucilla to try her sight for the first time conceive for yourselves dont ask me to describe the excitement that raged in our obscure little circle now that we were standing face to face with that grand event in our lives which i promised to relate in the opening sentence of these pages  i was the earliest riser at the rectory that morning my excitable french blood was in a fever i was irresistibly reminded of myself at a time long pastthe time when my glorious pratolungo and i succumbing to fate and tyrants fled to england for safety martyrs to that ungrateful republic long live the republic for which i laid down my money and my husband his life  i opened my window and hailed the good omen of sunrise in a clear sky just as i was turning away again from the view i saw a figure steal out from the shrubbery and appear on the lawn the figure came nearer i recognized oscar  what in the world are you doing there at this time in the morning i called out  he lifted his finger to his lips and came close under my window before he answered  hush he said dont let lucilla hear you come down to me as soon as you can i am waiting to speak to you  when i joined him in the garden i saw directly that something had gone wrong  bad news from browndown i asked  nugent has disappointed me he answered do you remember the evening when you met me after my consultation with mr sebright  perfectly  i told you that i meant to ask nugent to leave dimchurch on the day when lucilla tried her sight for the first time  well  wellhe refuses to leave dimchurch  have you explained your motives to him  carefullybefore i asked him to go i told him how impossible it was to say what might happen i reminded him that it might be of the utmost importance to me to preserve the impression now in lucillas mindfor a certain time onlyafter lucilla could see i promised the moment she became reconciled to the sight of me to recall him and in his presence to tell her the truth all that i said to himand how do you think he answered me  did he positively refuse  no he walked away from me to the window and considered a little then he turned round suddenly and said what did you tell me was mr sebrights opinion mr sebright thought she would be relieved instead of being terrified in that case what need is there for me to go away you can acknowledge at once that she has seen your face and not mine he put his hands in his pockets when he had said that you know nugents downright wayand turned back to the window as if he had settled everything  what did you say on your side  i said suppose mr sebright is wrong he only answered suppose mr sebright is right i followed him to the windowi never heard him speak so sourly to me as he spoke at that moment what is your objection to going away for a day or two i asked my objection is soon stated he answered i am sick of these everlasting complications it is useless and cruel to carry on the deception any longer mr sebrights advice is the wise advice and the right advice let her see you as you are with that answer he walked out of the room something has upset himi cant imagine what it is do pray see what you can make of him my only hope is in you  i own i felt reluctant to interfere suddenly and strangely as nugent had altered his point of view it seemed to me undeniable that nugent was right at the same time oscar looked so disappointed and distressed that it was really impossible on that day above all others to pain him additionally by roundly saying no i undertook to do what i couldand i inwardly hoped that circumstances would absolve me from the necessity of doing anything at all  circumstances failed to justify my selfish confidence in them  i was out in the village after breakfast on a domestic errand connected with the necessary culinary preparations for the reception of herr grossewhen i heard my name pronounced behind me and turning round found myself face to face with nugent  has my brother been bothering you this morning he asked before i was up  i instantly noticed a return in him as he said that to the same dogged ungracious manner which had perplexed and displeased me at my last confidential interview with him in the rectory garden  oscar has been speaking to me this morning i replied  about me  about you you have distressed and disappointed him  i know i know oscar is worse than a child i am beginning to lose all patience with him  i am sorry to hear you say that nugent you have borne with him so kindly thus farsurely you can make allowances for him today his whole future may depend on what happens in lucillas sittingroom a few hours hence  he is making a mountain out of a molehilland so are you  those words were spoken bitterlyalmost rudely i answered sharply on my side  you are the last person living who has any right to say that oscar is in a false position towards lucilla with your knowledge and consent in your brothers interests you agreed to the fraud that has been practiced on her in your brothers interests again you are asked to leave dimchurch why do you refuse  i refuse because i have come round to your way of thinking what did you say of oscar and of me in the summerhouse you said we were taking a cruel advantage of lucillas blindness you were right it was cruel not to have told her the truth i wont be a party to concealing the truth from her any longer i refuse to persist in deceiving herin meanly deceiving heron the day when she recovers her sight  it is entirely beyond my power to describe the tone in which he made that reply i can only declare that it struck me dumb for the moment i drew a step nearer to him with vague misgivings in me i looked him searchingly in the face he looked back at me without shrinking  well he askedwith a hard smile which defied me to put him in the wrong  i could discover nothing in his facei could only follow my instincts as a woman those instincts warned me to accept his explanation  i am to understand then that you have decided on staying here i said  certainly  what do you propose to do when herr grosse arrives and we assemble in lucillas room  i propose to be present among the rest of you at the most interesting moment of lucillas life  no you dont propose that  i do  you have forgotten something mr nugent dubourg  what is it madame pratolungo  you have forgotten that lucilla believes the brother with the discolored face to be you and the brother with the fair complexion to be oscar you have forgotten that the surgeon has expressly forbidden us to agitate her by entering into any explanations before he allows her to use her eyes you have forgotten that the very deception which you have just positively refused to go on with will be nevertheless a deception continued if you are present when lucilla sees your own resolution pledges you not to enter the rectory doors until lucilla has discovered the truth in those words i closed the vice on him i had got mr nugent dubourg  he turned deadly pale his eyes dropped before mine for the first time  thank you for reminding me he said i had forgotten  he pronounced those submissive words in a suddenlylowered voice something in his tone or something in the dropping of his eyes set my heart beating quickly with a certain vague expectation which i was unable to realize to myself  you agree with me i said that you cannot be one amongst us at the rectory what will you do  i will remain at browndown he answered  i felt he was lying dont ask for my reasons i have no reasons to give when he said i will remain at browndown i felt he was lying  why not do what oscar asks of you i went on if you are absent you may as well be in one place as in another there is plenty of time still to leave dimchurch  he looked up as suddenly as he had looked down  do you and oscar think me a stock or a stone he burst out angrily  what do you mean  who are you indebted to for what is going to happen today he went on more and more passionately you are indebted to me who among you all stood alone in refusing to believe that she was blind for life i did who brought the man here who has given her back her sight i brought the man and i am the one person who is to be left in ignorance of how it ends the others are to be present i am to be sent away the others are to see it i am to hear by post if any of you think of writing to me what she does what she says how she looks at the first heavenly moment when she opens her eyes on the world he flung up his hand in the air and burst out savagely with a bitter laugh i astonish you dont i i am claiming a position which i have no right to occupy what interest can i feel in it oh god what do i care about the woman to whom i have given a new life his voice broke into a sob at those last wild words he tore at the breast of his coat as if he was suffocatingand turned and left me  i stood rooted to the spot in one breathless instant the truth broke on me like a revelation at last i had penetrated the terrible secret nugent loved her  my first impulse when i recovered myself hurried me at the top of my speed back to the rectory for a moment or two i think i must really have lost my senses i felt a frantic suspicion that he had gone into the house and that he was making his way to lucilla at that moment when i found that all was quietwhen zillah had satisfied me that no visitor had come near our side of the rectoryi calmed down a little and went back to the garden to compose myself before i ventured into lucillas presence  after awhile i got over the first horror of it and saw my own position plainly there was not a living soul at dimchurch in whom i could confide come what might of it in this dreadful emergency i must trust in myself alone  i had just arrived at that startling conclusion i had shed some bitter tears when i remembered how hardly i had judged poor oscar on more than one occasion i had decided that my favorite nugent was the most hateful villain living and that i would leave nothing undone that the craft of a woman could compass to drive him out of the placewhen i was forced back to present necessities by the sound of zillahs voice calling to me from the house i went to her directly the nurse had a message for me from her young mistress my poor lucilla was lonely and anxious she was surprised at my leaving her she insisted on seeing me immediately  i took my first precaution against a surprise from nugent as i crossed the threshold of the door  our dear child must not be disturbed by visitors today i said to zillah if mr nugent dubourg comes here and asks for herdont tell lucilla tell me  this said i went upstairs and joined my darling in the darkened room    chapter the thirtyfifth  lucilla tries her sight  she was sitting alone in the dim light with the bandage over her eyes with her pretty hands crossed patiently on her lap my heart swelled in me as i looked at her and felt the horrid discovery that i had made still present in my mind forgive me for leaving you i said in as steady a voice as i could command at the momentand kissed her  she instantly discovered my agitation carefully as i thought i had concealed it  you are frightened too she exclaimed taking my hands in hers  frightened my love i repeated i was perfectly stupefied i really did not know what to say  yes now the time is so near i feel my courage failing me i forbode all sorts of horrible things oh when will it be over what will oscar look like when i see him  i answered the first question who could answer the second  herr grosse comes to us by the morning train i said it will soon be over  where is oscar  on his way here i have no doubt  describe him to me once more she said eagerly for the last time before i see his eyes his hair his complexioneverything  how i should have got through the painful task which she had innocently imposed on me if i had attempted to perform it i hardly like to think to my infinite relief i was interrupted at my first word by the opening of the door and the sudden appearance of a family deputation in the room  first strutting with slow and solemn steps with one hand laid pathetically on the breast of his clerical waistcoat appeared reverend finch after him came his wife shorn of all her proper accompanimentsexcept the baby without her novel without her jacket petticoat or shawl without even the handkerchief which she was always losingclothed for the first time in my experience in a complete gownthe metamorphosis of damp mrs finch was complete but for the baby i believe i should have taken her in the dim light for a stranger she stood apparently doubtful of her reception hesitating in the doorway and so hiding a third member of the deputationwho appealed piteously to the general notice in a small voice which i knew well and in a form of address familiar to me from past experience  jicks wants to come in  the rector took his hand from his waistcoat and held it up in faint protest against the intrusion of the third member mrs finch moved mechanically into the room jicks appeared hugging her disreputable doll and showing signs of recent wandering in the white dust which dropped on the carpet from her frock and her shoes as she advanced towards the place in which i was sitting arrived in front of me she peered quaintly up at my face through the obscurity of the room lifted her doll by the legs hit me a smart rap with the head of it on my knee and said  jicks will sit here  i rubbed my knee and enthroned jicks as ordered at the same time mr finch solemnly stalked up to his daughter laid his hands on her head raised his eyes to the ceiling and said in bass notes that rumbled with paternal emotion bless you my child  at the sound of her husbands magnificent voice mrs finch became herself again she said meekly how dye do lucillaand sat down in a corner and suckled the baby  mr finch set in for one of his harangues  my advice has been neglected lucilla my paternal influence has been repudiated my moral weight has been so to speak set aside i dont complain understand mei simply state sad facts here he became aware of my existence good morning madame pratolungo i hope i see you wellthere has been variance between us lucilla i come my child with healing on my wings healing being understood for present purposes as reconciliationi come and bring mrs finch with medont speak mrs finchto offer my heartfelt wishes my fervent prayers on this the most eventful day in my daughters life no vulgar curiosity has turned my steps this way no hint shall escape my lips touching any misgivings which i may still feel as to this purely worldly interference with the ways of an inscrutable providence i am here as parent and peacemaker my wife accompanies medont speak mrs finchas stepparent and steppeacemaker you understand the distinction madame pratolungo thank you good creature shall i preach forgiveness of injuries from the pulpit and not practice that forgiveness at home can i remain on this momentous occasion at variance with my child lucilla i forgive you with full heart and tearful eyes i forgive you you have never had any children i believe madame pratolungo ah you cannot possibly understand this not your fault good creature not your fault the kiss of peace my child the kiss of peace he solemnly bent his bristly head and deposited the kiss of peace on lucillas forehead he sighed superbly and in a burst of magnanimity held out his hand next to me my hand madame pratolungo compose yourself dont cry god bless you mrs finch deeply affected by her husbands noble conduct began to sob hysterically the baby disarranged in his proceedings by the emotions of his mama set up a sympathetic scream mr finch crossed the room to them with domestic healing on his wings this does you credit mrs finch but under the circumstances it must not be continued control yourself in consideration of the infant mysterious mechanism of nature cried the rector raising his prodigious voice over the louder and louder screeching of the baby marvelous and beautiful sympathy which makes the maternal sustenance the conducting medium as it were of disturbance between the mother and child what problems confront us what forces environ us even in this mortal life nature maternity inscrutable providence  inscrutable providence was the rectors fatal phraseit always brought with it an interruption and it brought one now before mr finch brimful of pathetic apostrophes could burst into more exclamations the door opened and oscar walked into the room  lucilla instantly recognized his footstep  any signs oscar of herr grosse she asked  yes his chaise has been seen on the road he will be here directly  giving that answer and passing by my chair to place himself on the other side of lucilla oscar cast at me one imploring looka look which said plainly dont desert me when the time comes i nodded my head to show that i understood him and felt for him he sat down in the vacant chair by lucilla and took her hand in silence it was hard to say which of the two felt the position at that trying moment most painfully i dont think i ever saw any sight so simply and irresistibly touching as the sight of those two poor young creatures sitting hand in hand waiting the event which was to make the happiness or the misery of their future lives  have you seen anything of your brother i asked putting the question in as careless a tone as my devouring anxiety would allow me to assume  nugent has gone to meet herr grosse  oscars eyes once more encountered mine as he replied in those terms i saw again the imploring look more marked in them than ever it was plain to him as it was plain to me that nugent had gone to meet the german with the purpose of making herr grosse the innocent means of bringing him into the house  before i could speak again mr finch recovering himself after the interruption which had silenced him saw his opportunity of setting in for another harangue mrs finch had left off sobbing the baby had left off screaming the rest of us were silent and nervous in a word mr finchs domestic congregation was entirely at mr finchs mercy he strutted up to oscars chair was he going to propose to read hamlet no he was going to invoke a blessing on oscars head  on this interesting occasion began the rector in his pulpit tones now that we are all united in the same room all animated by the same hopei could wish as pastor and parent god bless you oscar i look on you as a son mrs finch follow my example look on him as a soni could wish as pastor and parent to say a few pious and consoling words  the doorthe friendly admirable judicious doorstopped the coming sermon in the nick of time by opening again herr grosses squat figure and owlish spectacles appeared on the threshold and behind him exactly as i had anticipated stood nugent dubourg  lucilla turned deadly pale she had heard the door open she knew by instinct that the surgeon had come oscar got up stole behind my chair and whispered to me for gods sake get nugent out of the room i gave him a reassuring squeeze of the hand and putting jicks down on the floor rose to welcome our good grosse  the child as it happened was beforehand with me she and the illustrious oculist had met in the garden at one of the germans professional visits to lucilla and had taken an amazing fancy to each other herr grosse never afterwards appeared at the rectory without some unwholesome eatable thing in his pocket for jicks who gave him in return as many kisses as he might ask for and further distinguished him as the only living creature whom she permitted to nurse the disreputable doll grasping this same doll now with both hands and using it headforemost as a kind of batteringram jicks plunged in front of me and butted with all her might at the surgeons bandy legs insisting on a monopoly of his attention before he presumed to speak to any other person in the room while he was lifting her to a level with his face and talking to her in his wonderful broken englishwhile the rector and mrs finch were making the necessary apologies for the childs conductnugent came round from behind herr grosse and drew me mysteriously into a corner of the room as i followed him i saw the silent torture of anxiety expressed in oscars face as he stood by lucillas chair it did me good it strung up my resolution to the right pitch it made me feel myself a match and more than a match for nugent dubourg  i am afraid i behaved in a very odd manner when we met in the village he said the fact is i am not at all well i have been in a strange feverish state lately i dont think the air of this place suits me there he stopped keeping his eyes steadily fixed on mine trying to read my mind in my face  i am not surprised to hear you say that i answered i have noticed that you have not been looking well lately  my tone and manner otherwise perfectly composed expressed polite sympathyand nothing more i saw i puzzled him he tried again  i hope i didnt say or do anything rude he went on  oh no  i was excitedpainfully excited you are too kind to admit it i am sure i owe you my apologies  no indeed you were certainly excited as you say but we are all in the same state today the occasion mr nugent is your sufficient apology  not the slightest sign in my face of any sort of suspicion of him rewarded the close and continued scrutiny with which he regarded me i saw in his perplexed expression the certain assurance that i was beating him at his own weapons he made a last effort to entrap me into revealing that i suspected his secrethe attempted by irritating my quick temper to take me by surprise  you are no doubt astonished at seeing me here he resumed i have not forgotten that i promised to remain at browndown instead of coming to the rectory dont be angry with me i am under medical orders which forbid me to keep my promise  i dont understand you i said just as coolly as ever  i will explain myself he rejoined you remember that we long since took grosse into our confidence on the subject of oscars position towards lucilla  i am not likely to have forgotten it i answered considering that it was i who first warned your brother that herr grosse might do terrible mischief by innocently letting out the truth  do you recollect how grosse took the warning when we gave it to him  perfectly he promised to be careful but at the same time he gruffly forbade us to involve him in any more of our family troubles he said he was determined to preserve his professional freedom of action without being hampered by domestic difficulties which might concern us but which did not concern him is my memory accurate enough to satisfy you  your memory is wonderful you will now understand me when i tell you that grosse asserts his professional freedom of action on this occasion i had it from his own lips on our way here he considers it very important that lucilla should not be frightened at the moment when she tries her sight oscars face is sure to startle her if it is the first face she sees grosse has accordingly requested me to be present as the only other young man in the room and to place myself so that i shall be the first person who attracts her notice ask him yourself madame pratolungo if you dont believe me  of course i believe you i answered it is useless to dispute the surgeons orders at such a time as this  with that i left him showing just as much annoyance as an unsuspecting woman in my position might have naturally betrayedand no more knowing as i did what was going on under the surface i understood only too plainly what had happened nugent had caught at the opportunity which the surgeon had innocently offered to him as a means of misleading lucilla at the moment and possibly of taking some base advantage of her afterwards i trembled inwardly with rage and fear as i turned my back on him our one chance was to make sure of his absence at the critical momentand cudgel my brains as i might how to reach that end successfully was more than i could see  when i returned to the other persons in the room oscar and lucilla were still occupying the same positions mr finch had presented himself at full length to herr grosse and jicks was established on a stool in a corner devouring a rampant horse carved in biliousyellow german gingerbread with a voracious relish wonderful and terrible to see  ah my goot madame pratolungo said herr grosse stopping on his way to lucilla to shake hands with me have you made anodder lofely mayonnaise i have come on purpose with an emptystomachs and a wolfsappetite in fine order look at that little imps he went on pointing to jicks ach gott i believe i am in lofe with her i have sent all the ways to germany for gingerbreads for jick aha you jick does it stick in your tooths is it niceclammysweet he glared benevolently at the child through his spectacles and tucked my hand sentimentally into the breast of his waistcoat promise me a child like adorable jick he said solemnly i will marry the first wife you bring menice womans nasty womans i dont care which soh there is my domestic sentiments laid bare before you enough of that now for my prettyfeench comebeginbegin  he crossed the room to lucilla and called to nugent to follow him  open the shutters he said lightlightlight and plenty of him for my lofely feench  nugent opened the shutters beginning with the lower window and ending with the window at which lucilla was sitting acting on this plan he had only to wait where he was to place himself close by herto be the first object she saw he did it the villain did it i stepped forward determined to interfereand stopped not knowing what to say or do i could have beaten my own stupid brains out against the wall there stood nugent right before her as the surgeon turned his patient towards the window and not the ghost of an idea came to me  the german stretched out his hairy hands and took hold of the knot of the bandage to undo it  lucilla trembled from head to foot  herr grosse hesitatedlooked at herlet go of the bandageand lifting one of her hands laid his fingers on her pulse  in the moment of silence that followed i had one of my inspirations the missing idea turned up in my brains at last  soh cried grosse dropping her hand with a sudden outbreak of annoyance and surprise who has been frightening my pretty feench why these cold trembles these sinking pulses some of you tell mewhat does it mean  here was my opportunity i tried my idea on the spot  it means i said that there are too many people in this room we confuse her and frighten her take her into her bedroom herr grosse and only let the rest of us in when you think rightone at a time  our excellent surgeon instantly seized on my idea and made it his own  you are a phenix among womens he said paternally patting me on the shoulder which is most perfectest your advice or your mayonnaise i am at a loss to know he turned to lucilla and raised her gently from her chair come into your own rooms with me my poor little feench i shall see if i dare take off your bandages today  lucilla clasped her hands entreatingly  you promised she said oh herr grosse you promised to let me use my eyes today  answer me this retorted the german did i know when i promised that i should find you all shakypale as white as my shirts when he comes back from the wash  i am quite myself again she pleaded faintly i am quite fit to have the bandage taken off  what you know better than i do which of us is surgeonopticyou or me no more of this come under my arms come into the odder rooms  he put her arm in his and walked with her to the door there her variable humour suddenly changed she rallied on the instant her face flushed her courage came back to my horror she snatched her arm away from the surgeon and refused to leave the room  no she said i am quite composed again i claim your promise examine me here i must and will have my first look at oscar in this room  i was afraidliterally afraidto turn my eyes oscars way i glanced at nugent instead there was a devilish smile on his face that it nearly drove me mad to see  you must and weel repeated grosse now mind he took out his watch i give you one little minutes to think in if you dont come with me in that time you shall find it is i who must and weel now  why do you object to go into your room i asked  because i want everybody to see me she answered how many of you are there here  there are five of us mr and mrs finch mr nugent dubourg oscar and myself  i wish there were five hundred of you instead of five she burst out  why  because you would see me pick out oscar from all the rest the instant the bandage was off my eyes  still holding to her own fatal conviction that the image in her mind of oscar was the right one for the second time though i felt the longing in me to look at him i shrank from doing it  herr grosse put his watch back in his pocket  the minutes is passed he said will you come into the odder rooms will you understand that i cannot properly examine you before all these peoples say my lofely feenchyes or no  no she cried obstinately with a childish stamp of her foot i insist on showing everybody that i can pick out oscar the moment i open my eyes  herr grosse buttoned his coat settled his owlish spectacles firmly on his nose and took up his hat goot morning he said i have nothing more to do with you or your eyes cure yourself you littlespitfirefeench i am going back to london  he opened the door even lucilla was obliged to yield when the surgeon in attendance on her threatened to throw up the case  you brute she said indignantlyand took his arm again  grosse indulged himself in his diabolical grin wait till you are able to use your eyes my lofe then you will see what a brutes i am with those words he took her out  we were left in the sittingroom to wait until the surgeon had decided whether he would or would not let lucilla try her sight on that day  while the others were in their various ways all suffering the same uneasy sense of expectation i was as quiet in my mind as the baby now sleeping in his mothers arms thanks to grosses resolution to act on the hint that i had given to him i had now made it impossibleeven if the bandage was removed on that dayfor nugent to catch lucillas first look when she opened her eyes her betrothed husband might certainly on such a special occasion as this be admitted into her bedchamber in company with her father or with me but the commonest sense of propriety would dictate the closing of the door on nugent in the sittingroom he must wait if he still persisted in remaining at the rectory until she was allowed to join him there i privately resolved having the control of the matter in my own hands that this should not happen until lucilla knew which of the twins was nugent and which was oscar a delicious inward glow of triumph diffused itself all through me i resisted the strong temptation that i felt to discover how nugent bore his defeat if i had yielded to it he would have seen in my face that i gloried in having outwitted him i sat down the picture of innocence in the nearest chair and crossed my hands on my lap a composed and ladylike person edifying to see  the slow minutes followed each otherand still we waited the event in silence even mr finchs tongue was on this solitary occasion a tongue incapable of pronouncing a single word he sat by his wife at one end of the room oscar and i were at the other nugent stood by himself at one of the windows deep in his own thoughts plotting how he could pay me out  oscar was the first of the party who broke the silence after looking all round the room he suddenly addressed himself to me  madame pratolungo he exclaimed what has become of jicks  i had completely forgotten the child i too looked round the room and satisfied myself that she had really disappeared mrs finch observing our astonishment timidly enlightened us the maternal eye had seen jicks slip out cunningly at herr grosses heels the childs object was plain enough while there was any probability of the presence of more gingerbread in the surgeons pocket the wandering arab of the family as stealthy and as quick as a cat was certain to keep within reach of her friend nobody who knew her could doubt that she had stolen into lucillas bedchamber under cover of herr grosses ample coattails  we had just accounted in this way for the mysterious absence of jicks when we heard the bedchamber door opened and the surgeons voice calling for zillah in a minute more the nurse appeared the bearer of a message from the next room  we all surrounded her with one and the same question to ask what had herr grosse decided to do the answer informed us that he had decided on forbidding lucilla to try her eyes that day  is she very much disappointed oscar inquired anxiously  i can hardly say sir she isnt like herself i never knew miss lucilla so quiet when she was crossed in her wishes before when the doctor called me into the room she said go in zillah and tell them those words sir and no more  did she express no wish to see me i inquired  no maam i took the liberty of asking her if she wished to see you miss lucilla shook her head and sat herself down on the sofa and made the doctor sit by her leave us by ourselves those were the last words she said to me before i came in here  reverend finch put the next question the pope of dimchurch was himself again the man of many words saw his chance of speaking once more  good woman said the rector with ponderous politeness step this way i wish to address an inquiry to you did miss finch make any remark in your hearing indicating a desire to be comforted by my ministrationsas one bearing the double relation towards her of pastor and parent  i didnt hear miss lucilla say anything to that effect sir  mr finch waved his hand with a look of disgust intimating that zillahs audience was over nugent upon that came forward and stopped her as she was leaving the room  have you nothing more to tell us he asked  no sir  why dont they come back here what are they doing in the other room  they were doing what i mentioned just now sirthey were sitting side by side on the sofa miss lucilla was talking and the doctor was listening to her and jicks added zillah addressing herself confidentially to me was behind them picking the doctors pocket  oscar put in a word thereby no means in his most gracious manner  what was miss lucilla saying to the doctor  i dont know sir  you dont know  i couldnt hear sir miss lucilla was speaking to him in a whisper  after that there was no more to be said zillahdisturbed over her domestic occupations and eager to get back to her kitchenseized the first chance of leaving the room going out in such a hurry that she forgot to close the door after her we all looked at each other to what conclusion did the nurses strange answers point it was plainly impossible for oscar no matter how quick his temper might be to feel jealous of a man of grosses age and personal appearance still the prolonged interview between patient and surgeonafter the decision had been pronounced and the trial of the eyes definitely deferred to a future dayhad a strange appearance to say the least of it  nugent returned to his place at the windowpuzzled suspicious deep in his own thoughts reverend finch swelling with unspoken words rose portentously from his chair by his wifes side had he discovered another chance of inflicting his eloquence on us it was only too evident that he had he looked at us with his ominous smile he addressed us in his biggest voice  my christian friends  nugent unassailable by eloquence persisted in looking out of the window oscar insensible to every earthly consideration except the one consideration of lucilla drew me aside unceremoniously out of the rectors hearing mr finch resumed  my christian friends i could wish to say a few appropriate words  go to lucilla whispered oscar taking me entreatingly by both hands you neednt stand on ceremony with her do do see what is going on in the next room  mr finch resumed  the occasion seems to call upon one in my position for a little sustaining advice on christian dutyi would say the duty of being cheerful under disappointment  oscar persisted  do me the greatest of all favors pray find out what is keeping lucilla with that man  mr finch cleared his throat and lifted his right hand persuasively by way of introduction to his next sentence  i answered oscar in a whisper  i dont like intruding on them lucilla told the nurse they were to be left by themselves  just as i said the words i became aware of a sudden bump against me from behind i turned and discovered jicks with the batteringramdoll preparing for a second plunge at me she stopped when she found that she had attracted my attention and taking hold of my dress tried to pull me out of the room  remove that child cried the rector exasperated by this new interruption  the child pulled harder and harder at my dress something had apparently happened outside the sittingroom which had produced a strong impression on her her little round face was flushed her bright blue eyes were wide open and staring jicks wants to speak to you she saidand pulled at me impatiently harder than ever  i stooped down with the double purpose of obeying mr finchs commands and of humouring the childs whim by carrying jicks out of the room when i was startled by a sound from the bedchamberthe sound loud and peremptory of lucillas voice  let go of me she cried i am a womani wont be treated like a child  there was a moment of silencefollowed by the rustling sound of her dress approaching us along the corridor  grosses voiceunmistakably angry and excitedbecame audible at the same time no come back come back  the rustling sound of the dress came nearer  nugent and mr finch moved together closer to the door oscar caught me by the arm he and i were on the lefthand side of the door nugent and the rector were on the righthand side it all happened with the suddenness of a flash of lightning my heart stood still i couldnt speak i couldnt move  the halfclosed door of the sittingroom was burst wide openroughly violently as if a man not a woman had been on the other side the rector drew back nugent remained where he was wildly groping her way with outstretched arms as i had never seen her grope it in the time of her blindness lucilla staggered into the room merciful god the bandage was off the life the new life of sight was in her eyes it transfigured her face it irradiated her beauty with an awful and unearthly light she saw she saw  for an instant she stopped at the door swaying to and fro giddy under the broad stare of daylight  she looked at the rectorthen at mrs finch who had followed her husband she paused bewildered and put her hands over her eyes she slightly changed her position turned her head as if to look at me turned it back sharply towards the righthand side of the door again and threw up her arms in the air with a burst of hysterical laughter the laughter ended in a scream of triumph which rang through the house she rushed at nugent dubourg so blindly incapable of measuring her distance that she struck against him violently and nearly threw him down i know him i know him she criedand flung her arms round his neck oh oscar oscar she clasped him to her with all her strength as the name passed her lips and dropped her head on his bosom in an ecstasy of joy  it was done before any of us had recovered the use of our senses the whole horrible scene must have begun and ended in less than half a minute of time the surgeon who had run into the room after her emptyhanded turned suddenly and left it again coming back with the bandage left forgotten in the bedroom grosse was the first among us to recover his presence of mind he approached her in silence  she heard him before he could take her by surprise and slip the bandage over her eyes the moment when i turned horrorstruck to look at oscar was also the moment when she lifted her head from nugents bosom to look for the surgeon her eyes followed the direction taken by mine they encountered oscars face she saw the blueblack hue of it in full light  a cry of terror escaped her she started back shuddering and caught hold of nugents arm grosse motioned sternly to him to turn her face from the window and lifted the bandage she clutched at it with feverish eagerness as he held it up put it on again she said holding by nugent with one hand and lifting the other to point towards oscar with a gesture of disgust put it on again i have seen too much already  grosse fastened the bandage over her eyes and waited a little she still held nugents arm the sting of my indignation as i saw it roused me into doing something i stepped forward to part them grosse stopped me no he said dont make bad worse i looked at oscar for the second time there he stood as he had stood from the first moment when she appeared at the doorhis eyes staring wildly straight before him his limbs set and fixed i went to him and touched him he seemed not to feel it i spoke to him i might as well have spoken to a man of stone  grosses voice drew my attention for a moment the other way  come he said trying to take lucilla back into her own room  she shook her head and tightened her hold on nugents arm  you take me she whispered as far as the door  i again attempted to stop it and again the german put me back  not today he said sternly with that he made a sign to nugent and placed himself on lucillas other side in silence the two men led her out of the room the door closed on them it was over    chapter the thirtysixth  the brothers meet  a faint sound of crying found its way to my ears from the lower end of the room and reminded me that the rector and his wife had been present among us feeble mrs finch was lying back in her chair weeping and wailing over what had happened her husband with the baby in his arms was trying to compose her i ought perhaps to have offered my helpbut i own poor mrs finchs distress produced only a passing impression on me my whole heart was with another person i forgot the rector and his wife and went back to oscar  this time he movedhe lifted his head when he saw me shall i ever forget the silent misery in that face the dull dreadful stare in those tearless eyes  i took his handi felt for the poor disfigured rejected man as his mother might have felt for himi gave him a mothers kiss be comforted oscar i said trust me to set this right  he drew a long trembling breath and pressed my hand gratefully i attempted to speak to him againhe stopped me by looking suddenly towards the door  is nugent outside he asked in a whisper  i went into the corridor it was empty i looked into lucillas room she and grosse and the nurse were the only persons in it i beckoned to zillah to come out and speak to me i asked for nugent he had left lucilla abruptly at the bedroom doorhe was out of the house i inquired if it was known in what direction he had gone zillah had seen him in the field at the end of the garden walking away rapidly with his back to the village and his face to the hills  nugent has gone i said returning to oscar  add to your kindness to me he answered let me go too  a quick fear crossed my mind that he might be bent on following his brother  wait a little i said and rest here  he shook his head  i must be by myself he said after considering a little he added a question has nugent gone to browndown  no nugent has been seen walking towards the hills  he took my hand again be merciful to me he said let me go  home to browndown  yes  let me go with you  he shook his head forgive me you shall hear from me later in the day  no tears no flamingup of the quick temper that i knew so well nothing in his face nothing in his voice nothing in his manner but a composure miserable to seethe composure of despair  at least let me accompany you to the gate i said  god bless and reward you he answered let me go  with a gentle handand yet with a firmness which took me completely by surprisehe separated himself from me and went out  i could stand no longeri dropped trembling into a chair the conviction forced itself on me that there were worse complications direr misfortunes still to come i was almost beside myselfi broke out vehemently with wild words spoken in my own language mrs finch recalled me to my senses i saw her as in a dream drying her tears and looking at me in alarm the rector approached with profuse expressions of sympathy and offers of assistance i wanted no comforting i had served a hard apprenticeship to life i had been well seasoned to trouble thank you sir i said look to mrs finch there was more air in the corridor i went out again to walk about and get the better of it there  a small object attracted my attention crouched up on one of the window seats the small object wasjicks  i suppose the childs instinct must have told her that something had gone wrong she looked furtively sideways at me round her doll she had grave doubts of my intentions towards her are you going to whack jicks asked the curious little creature shrinking into her corner i sat down by her and soon recovered my place in her confidence she began to chatter again as fast as usual i listened to her as i could have listened to no grownup person at that moment in some mysterious way that i cannot explain the child comforted me little by little i learnt what she had wanted with me when she had attempted to drag me out of the room she had seen all that had passed in the bedchamber and she had run out to take me back with her and show me the wonderful sight of lucilla with the bandage off her eyes if i had been wise enough to listen to jicks i might have prevented the catastrophe that had happened i might have met lucilla in the corridor and have forced her back into her own room and turned the key on her  it was too late now to regret what had happened jicks has been good i said patting my little friend on the head with a heavy heart the child listenedconsidered with herself gravelygot off the windowseatand claimed her reward for being good with that excellent brevity of speech which so eminently distinguished her  jicks will go out  with those words she shouldered her doll and walked off the last i saw of her she was descending the stairs as a workman descends a ladder on her way to the gardenand from the garden the first time the gate was opened to the hills if i could have gone out with her light heart i would have joined jicks  i had hardly lost sight of the child before the door of lucillas room opened and herr grosse appeared in the corridor  soh he muttered with a gesture of relief the very womans i was looking for a nice messfix we are in now i must stop with feench i shall end in hating feench can you put me into a beds for the night  i assured him that he could easily sleep at the rectory in answer to my inquiries after his patient he gravely acknowledged that he was anxious about lucilla the varying and violent emotions which had shaken her acting through her nervous system might produce results which would imperil the recovery of her sight absolute repose was not simply necessaryit was now the only chance for her for the next fourandtwenty hours he must keep watch over her eyes at the end of that timeno earlierhe might be able to say whether the mischief done would be fatal to her sight or not i asked how she had contrived to get her bandage off and to make her fatal entrance into the sittingroom  he shrugged his shoulders there are times he said cynically when every womans is a hussy and every mans is a fool this was one of the times  it appeared on further explanation that my poor lucilla had pleaded so earnestly after the nurse had left the room to be allowed to try her eyes and had shown such ungovernable disappointment when he persisted in saying no that he had yieldednot so much to her entreaties as to his own conviction that it would be less dangerous to humour her than to thwart her with such a sensitive and irritable temperament as hers he had first bargained however on his side that she should remain in the bedchamber and be content for that time with using her sight on the objects round her in the room she had promised all that he askedand he had been foolish enough to trust to her promise the bandage once off she had instantly set every consideration at defiancehad torn herself out of his hands like a mad creatureand had rushed into the sittingroom before he could stop her the rest had followed as a matter of course feeble as it was at the first trial of it her sense of sight was sufficiently restored to enable her to distinguish objects dimly of the three persons who had offered themselves to view on the righthand side of the door one mrs finch was a woman another mr finch was a short greyheaded elderly man the third nugent in his heightwhich she could seeand in the color of his hairwhich she could seewas the only one of the three who could possibly represent oscar the catastrophe that followed was as things were inevitable now that the harm was done the one alternative left was to check the mischief at the point which it had already reached not the slightest hint at the terrible mistake that she had made must be suffered to reach her ears if we any of us said one word about it before he authorized us to do so he would refuse to answer for the consequences and would then and there throw up the case  so in his broken english herr grosse explained what had happened and issued his directions for our future conduct  no person is to go into her he said in conclusion but you and goot mrs zillahs you two watch her turnaboutturnabout in a whiles she will sleep for me i go to smoke my tobaccos in the garden hear this madame pratolungo when gott made the womens he was sorry afterwards for the poor mensand he made tobaccos to comfort them  favoring me with this peculiar view of the scheme of creation herr grosse shook his shock head and waddled away to the garden  i softly opened the bedroom door and looked indisappearing just in time to escape the rector and mrs finch returning to their own side of the house  lucilla was lying on the sofa she asked who it was in a drowsy voiceshe was happily just sinking into slumber zillah occupied a chair near her i was not wanted for the momentand i was glad for the first time in my experience at dimchurch to get out of the room again by some contradiction in my character which i am not able to explain there was a certain hostile influence in the sympathy that i felt for oscar which estranged me for the moment from lucilla it was not her faultand yet i am ashamed to own it i almost felt angry with her for reposing so comfortably when i thought of the poor fellow without a creature to say a kind word to him alone at browndown  out again in the corridor the question faced mewhat was i to do next  the loneliness of the house was insupportable my anxiety about oscar grew more than i could endure i put on my hat and went out  having no desire to interfere with herr grosses enjoyment of his pipe i made my way through the garden as quickly as possible and found myself in the village again my uneasiness on the subject of oscar was matched by my angry desire to know what nugent would do now that he had worked the very mischief which his brother had foreseen to be possiblethe very mischief which it had been oscars one object to prevent in asking him to leave dimchurchwould he take his departure would he rid us at once and for ever of the sight of him the bare idea of the other alternativei mean of his remaining in the placeshook me with such an unutterable dread of what might happen next that my feet refused to support me i was obliged just beyond the village to sit down by the roadside and wait till my giddy head steadied itself before i attempted to move again  after a minute or two i heard footsteps coming along the road my heart gave one great leap in me i thought it was nugent  a moment more brought the person in view it was only mr gootheridge of the village inn on his way home he stopped and took off his hat  tired maam he said  the uppermost idea in my mind found its way somehow ill as i was to expression on my lipsin the form of a question addressed to the landlord  do you happen to have seen anything of mr nugent dubourg i asked  i saw him not five minutes since maam  where  going into browndown  i started up as if i had been struck or shot worthy mr gootheridge stared i wished him goodday and went on as fast as my feet would take me straight to browndown had the brothers met in the house i turned cold at the bare thought of itbut i still kept on there was an obstinate resolution in me to part them which served me in place of courage account for it as you may i was bold and frightened both at the same time at one moment i was fool enough to say to myself they will kill me at another just as foolishly i found comfort in the opposite view bah they are gentlemen they cant hurt a woman  the servant was standing idling at the front door when i arrived in sight of the house this in itself was unusual he was a hardworking welltrained man on other occasions nobody had ever seen him out of his proper place he advanced a few steps to meet me i looked at him carefully not the slightest appearance of disturbance was visible in his face  is mr oscar at home i asked  i beg your pardon maam mr oscar is at homebut you cant see him he and mr nugent are together  i rested my hand on the low wall in front of the house and made a desperate effort to put a calm face on it  surely mr oscar will see me i said  i have mr oscars orders maam to wait at the door and tell everybody who comes to the house without exception that he is engaged  the housedoor was half open i listened intently while the man was speaking if they had been at high words together i must have heard them in the silence of the lonely hills all round us i heard nothing  it was strange it was inconceivable at the same time it relieved me there they were together and no harm had come of it so far  i left my cardand walked on a little past the corner of the house wall as soon as i was out of the servants sight i turned back to the side of the building and ventured as near as i durst to the window of the sittingroom their voices reached me but not their words on both sides the tones were low and confidential not a note of anger in either voicelisten for it as i might i left the house again breathless with amazement and so rapidly does a woman shift from one emotion to another burning with curiosity  after half an hour of aimless wandering in the valley i returned to the rectory  lucilla was still sleeping i took zillahs place and sent her into the kitchen the landlady of the inn was there to help us with the dinner but she was hardly equal singlehanded to the superintendence of such dishes as we had to set before herr grosse it was high time i relieved zillah if we were to pass successfully through the ordeal of the great surgeons criticism as reviewer of all the sauces  an hour more passed before lucilla woke i sent a messenger to grosse who appeared enveloped in a halo of tobacco examined the patients eyes felt her pulse ordered her wine and jelly filled his monstrous pipe and gruffly returned to his promenade in the garden  the day wore on mr finch came to make inquiries and then went back to his wifewhom he described as hysterically irresponsible and in imminent need of another warm bath he declined in his most pathetic manner to meet the german at dinner after what i have suffered after what i have seen these banquetingsi would say these ticklings of the palateare not to my taste you mean well madame pratolungo good creature but i am not in heart for feasting simple fare by my wifes couch a few consoling words in the character of pastor and husband when the infant is quiet so my day is laid out i wish you well i dont object to your little dinner good day good day  a second examination of lucillas eyes brought us to the dinnerhour  at the sight of the tablecloth herr grosses good humour returned we two dined together alonethe german sending in selections of his own making from the dishes to lucillas room so far he said she had escaped any serious injury but he still insisted on keeping his patient perfectly quiet and he refused to answer for anything until the night had passed as for me oscars continued silence weighed more and more heavily on my spirits my past suspense in the darkened room with lucilla seemed to be a mere trifle by comparison with the keener anxieties which i suffered now i saw grosses eyes glaring discontentedly at me through his spectacles he had good reason to look at me as he didi had never before been so stupid and so disagreeable in all my life  towards the end of the dinner there came news from browndown at last the servant sent in a message by zillah begging me to see him for a moment outside the sittingroom door  i made my excuses to my guest and hurried out  the instant i saw the servants face my heart sank oscars kindness had attached the man devotedly to his master i saw his lips tremble and his color come and go when i looked at him  i have brought you a letter maam  he handed me a letter addressed to me in oscars handwriting  how is your master i asked  not very well when i saw him last  when you saw him last  i bring sad news maam theres a breakup at browndown  what do you mean where is mr oscar  mr oscar has left dimchurch    chapter the thirtyseventh  the brothers change places  i vainly believed i had prepared myself for any misfortune that could fall on us the mans last words dispelled my delusion my gloomiest forebodings had never contemplated such a disaster as had now happened i stood petrified thinking of lucilla and looking helplessly at the servant try as i might i was perfectly incapable of speaking to him  he felt no such difficulty on his side one of the strangest peculiarities in the humbler ranks of the english people is the sort of solemn relish which they have for talking of their own misfortunes to be the objects of a calamity of any kind seems to raise them in their own estimations with a dreary enjoyment of his miserable theme the servant expatiated on his position as a man deprived of the best of masters turned adrift again in the world to seek another service hopeless of ever again finding himself in such a situation as he had lost he roused me at last into speaking to him by sheer dint of irritating my nerves until i could endure him no longer  has mr oscar gone away alone i asked  yes maam quite alone  what had become of nugent i was too much interested in oscar to be able to put the question at that moment  when did your master go i went on  better than two hours since  why didnt i hear of it before  i had mr oscars orders not to tell you maam till this time in the evening  wretched as i was already my spirits sank lower still when i heard that the order given to the servant looked like a premeditated design not only to leave dimchurch but also to keep us in ignorance of his whereabouts afterwards  has mr oscar gone to london i inquired  he hired gootheridges chaise maam to take him to brighton and he told me with his own lips that he had left browndown never to come back i know no more of it than that  he had left browndown never to come back for lucillas sake i declined to believe that the servant was exaggerating or the servant had misunderstood what had been said to him the letter in my hand reminded me that i had perhaps needlessly questioned him on matters which his master had confided to my own knowledge only before i dismissed him for the night i made my deferred inquiry on the hateful subject of the other brother  where is mr nugent  at browndown  do you mean to say that he is going to stay at browndown  i dont know maam for certain i see no signs of his meaning to leave and he has said nothing to that effect  i had the greatest difficulty to keep myself from breaking out before the servant my indignation almost choked me the best way was to wish him good night i took the best wayonly calling him back as a measure of caution to say one last word  have you told anybody at the rectory of mr oscars departure i asked  no maam  say nothing about it then as you go out thank you for bringing me the letter good night  having thus provided against any whisper of what had happened reaching lucillas ears that evening i returned to herr grosse to make my excuses and to tell him as i honestly could that i was in sore need of being permitted to retire privately to my own room i found my illustrious guest putting a plate over the final dish of the dinner full of the tenderest anxiety to keep it warm on my account  here is a lofely cheeseomelets said grosse twothirds of him i have eaten my own self the odder third i sweat with anxiety to keep warm for you sit down sit down every moment he is getting cold  i am much obliged to you herr grosse i have just heard some miserable news  ach gott dont tell it to me the wretch burst out with a look of consternation no miserable news i pray you after such a dinner as i have eaten let me do my digestions my gootdearcreature if you lofe me let me do my digestions  will you excuse me if i leave you to your digestion and retire to my own room  he rose in a violent hurry and opened the door for me  yes yes from the deep bottoms of my heart i excuse you goot madame pratolungo retire retire  i had barely passed the threshold before the door was closed behind me i heard the selfish old brute rub his hands and chuckle over his success in shutting me and my sorrow both out of the room together  just as my hand was on my own door it occurred to me that i should do well to make sure of not being surprised by lucilla over the reading of oscars letter the truth is that i shrank from reading it in spite of my resolution to disbelieve the servant the dread was now growing on me that the letter would confirm his statement and would force it on me as the truth that oscar had left us never to return i retraced my steps and entered lucillas room  i could just see her by the dim nightlight burning in a cornet to enable the surgeon or the nurse to find their way to her she was alone in her favorite little wickerwork chair with the doleful white bandage over her eyesto all appearance quite content busily knitting  dont you feel lonely lucilla  she turned her head towards me and answered in her gayest tones  not in the least i am quite happy as i am  why is zillah not with you  i sent her away  you sent her away  yes i couldnt enjoy myself thoroughly tonight unless i felt that i was quite alone i have seen him my deari have seen him how could you possibly think i felt lonely i am so inordinately happy that i am obliged to knit to keep myself quiet if you say much more i shall get up and dancei know i shall where is oscar that odious grosseno it is too bad to talk of the dear old man in that way after he has given me back my sight still it is cruel of him to say that i am overexcited and to forbid oscar to come and see me tonight is oscar with you in the next room is he very much disappointed at being parted from me in this way say i am thinking of himsince i have seen himwith such new thoughts  oscar is not here tonight my dear  no then he is at browndown of course with that poor wretched disfigured brother of his i have got over my terror of nugents hideous face i am even beginning though i never liked him as you know to pity him with such a dreadful complexion as that dont let us talk about it dont let us talk at all i want to go on thinking of oscar  she resumed her knitting and shut herself up luxuriously in her own happy thoughts knowing what i knew it was nothing less than heartbreaking to see her and hear her afraid to trust myself to say another word i softly closed the door and charged zillah when her mistress rang her bell to say for me that i was weary after the events of the day and had gone to rest in my bedroom  at last i was alone at last i was at the end of my maneuvers to spare myself the miserable necessity of opening oscars letter after first locking my door i broke the seal and read the lines which follow    kind and dear friendforgive me i am going to surprise and distress you my letter thanks you gratefully and bids you a last farewell  summon all your indulgence for me read these lines to the end they will tell you what happened after i left the rectory  nothing had been seen of nugent when i reached this house it was not till a quarter of an hour later that i heard his voice at the door calling to me and asking if i had come back i answered and he joined me in the sittingroom nugents first words to me were these oscar i have come to ask your pardon and to bid you goodbye  i can give you no idea of the tone in which he spoke to me it would have gone straight to your heart as it went straight to mine for the moment i was not able to answer him i could only offer him my hand he sighed bitterly and refused to take it  i have something still to tell you he said wait till you have heard it and give me your hand afterwardsif you can  he even refused to take the chair to which i pointed he distressed me by standing in my presence as if he was my inferior the next words that he said to me  no i have need of all my calmness and all my courage it shakes both to recall what he said to me i sat down to write this intending to repeat to you everything that passed between us another of my weaknesses another of my failures the tears come into my eyes again when my mind attempts to dwell on the details i can only tell you the result my brothers confession may be summed up in three words prepare yourself to be startled prepare yourself to be grieved  nugent loves her  think of this discovery falling on me after i had seen my innocent lucillas arms round his neckafter my own eyes had shown me how she rejoiced over her first sight of him how she shuddered at her first sight of me need i tell you what i suffered no  nugent held out his hand when he had doneas i had held out mine before he began  the one atonement i can make to you and to her he said is never to let either of you set eyes on me again shake hands oscar and let me go  if i had willed it soso it might have ended i willed it differently it has ended differently can you guess how    i laid down the letter for a moment it cut me with such keen regret it fired me with such hot ragethat i was within a hairsbreadth of tearing the rest of it up unread and trampling it under my feet i took a turn in the room i dipped my handkerchief in water and bound it round my head in a minute or two i was myself againi could force my mind away from my poor lucilla and return to the letter it proceeded thus  i can write calmly of what i have next to tell you you shall hear what i have decided and what i have done  i told nugent to wait in the room while i went away and thought over what he had said to me by myself he attempted to resist this i insisted on his yielding for the first time in our lives we changed places it was i who took the lead and he who followed i left him and went out into the valley alone  the heavenly tranquillity the comforting solitude helped me i saw my position and his in their true light before i got back i had decided cost me what it might on myself making the sacrifice to which my brother had offered to submit for lucillas sake and for nugents sake i felt the certain assurance in my own mind that it was my duty and not his to go  dont blame me dont grieve for me read the rest i want you to think of this with my thoughtsto feel about it as i feel at this moment  bearing in mind what nugent has confessed and what i have myself seen have i any right to hold lucilla to her engagement i am firmly persuaded that i have no right after inspiring her with terror and disgust at the moment when her eyes first looked at me after seeing her innocently happy in nugents armshow in gods name can i claim her as mine our marriage has become an impossibility for her own sake i cannot i dare not appeal to our engagement the wreck of my happiness is nothing the wreck of her happiness would be a crime i absolve her from her engagement she is free  there is my duty towards lucillaas i see it  as to nugent next i owe it entirely to my brother at the time of the trial that the honor of our family has been saved and that i have escaped a shameful death on the scaffold is there any limit to the obligation that he has laid on me after doing me such a service as this there is no limit the man who loves lucilla and the brother who has saved my life are one i am bound to leave him freei do leave him freeto win lucilla by open and loyal means if he can as soon as herr grosse considers that she is fit to bear the disclosure let her be told of the error into which she has fallen through my faultlet her read these lines purposely written to meet her eye as well as yoursand let my brother tell her afterwards what has passed tonight in this house between himself and me she loves him now believing him to be oscar will she love him still after she has learnt to know him under his own name the answer to that question rests with time if it is an answer in nugents favor i have already arranged to set aside from my income a sufficient yearly sum to place my brother in a position to begin his married life i wish to leave his genius free to assert itself untrammeled by pecuniary cares possessing as i do far more than enough for my own simple wants i can dedicate my spare money to no better and nobler use than this  there is my duty towards nugentas i see it  what i have decided on you now know what i have done can be told in two words i have left browndown for ever i have gone to live or die as god pleases under the blow that has fallen on me far away from you all  perhaps when years have passed and when their children are growing up round them i may see lucilla again and may take as the hand of my sister the hand of the beloved woman who might once have been my wife this may happen if i live if i die you will none of you know it my death shall not cast its shadow of sadness on their lives forgive me and forget me and keep as i keep that first and noblest of all mortal hopesthe hope of the life to come  i enclose when there is need for you to write to me the address of my bankers in london they will have their instructions if you love me if you pity me abstain from attempting to shake my resolution you may distress mebut you will never change me wait to write until nugent has had the opportunity of pleading his own cause and lucilla has decided on her future life  once more i thank you for the kindness which has borne with my weaknesses and my follies god bless youand goodbye  oscar    of the effect which the first reading of this letter produced on me i shall say nothing even at this distance of time i shrink from reviving the memory of what i suffered alone in my room on that miserable night let it be enough if i tell you briefly at what decision i arrived  i determined on doing two things first on going to london by the earliest train the next morning and finding my way to oscar by means of his bankers secondly on preventing the villain who had accepted the sacrifice of his brothers happiness from entering the rectory in my absence  the one comfort i had that night was in feeling that on these two points my mind was made up there was a stimulant in my sense of my own resolution which strengthened me to make my excuses to lucilla without betraying the grief that tortured me when i found myself in her presence again before i went to my bed i had left her quiet and happy i had arranged with herr grosse that he was still to keep his excitable patient secluded from visitors all through the next day and i had secured as an ally to help me in preventing nugent from entering the house no less a person than reverend finch himself i saw him in his study overnight and told him all that had happened keeping one circumstance only concealednamely oscars insane determination to share his fortune with his infamous brother i purposely led the rector to suppose that oscar had left lucilla free to receive the addresses of a man who had dissipated his fortune to the last farthing mr finchs harangue when this prospect was brought within his range of contemplation was something to be remembered but not on this occasion to be reportedin mercy to the church  by the train of the next morning i left for london  by the train of the same evening i returned alone to dimchurch having completely failed to achieve the purpose which taken me to the metropolis  oscar had appeared at the bank as soon as the doors were opened in the morning had drawn out some hundreds of pounds in circular notes had told the bankers that they should be furnished with an address at which they could write to him in due course of time and had departed for the continent without leaving a trace behind him  i spent the day in making what arrangements i could for discovering him by the usual methods of inquiry pursued in such cases and took the return train to the country with my mind alternating between despair when i thought of lucilla and anger when i thought of the twinbrothers in the first bitterness of my disappointment i was quite as indignant with oscar as with nugent with all my heart i cursed the day which had brought the one and the other to dimchurch  as we lengthened our distance from london flying smoothly the tranquil woods and fields my mind with time to help it began to recover its balance little by little the unexpected revelation of firmness and decision in oscars conductheartily as i still deplored and blamed that conductbegan to have a new effect on my mind i now looked back in amazement and selfreproach at my own superficial estimate of the characters of the twinbrothers  thinking it over uninterruptedly with no one in the carriage but myself i arrived at a conclusion which strongly influenced my conduct in guiding lucilla through the troubles and perils that were still to come  our physical constitutions have as i take it more to do with the actions which determine other peoples opinions of us as well as with the course of our own lives than we generally suppose a man with delicatelystrung nerves says and does things which often lead us to think more meanly of him than he deserves it is his great misfortune constantly to present himself at his worst on the other hand a man provided with nerves vigorously constituted is provided also with a constitutional health and hardihood which express themselves brightly in his manners and which lead to a mistaken impression that his nature is what it appears to be on the surface having good health he has good spirits having good spirits he wins as an agreeable companion on the persons with whom he comes in contactalthough he may be hiding all the while under an outer covering which is physically wholesome an inner nature which is morally diseased in the last of these typical men i saw reflectednugent in the firstoscar all that was feeblest and poorest in oscars nature had shown itself on the surface in past times to the concealment of its stronger and its nobler side there had been something hidden in this supersensitive man who had shrunk under all the small trials of his life in our village which had proved firm enough when the greatness of the need called on it to sustain the terrible disaster that had fallen on him the nearer i got to the end of my journey the more certain i felt that i was only now learning bitterly as he had disappointed me to estimate oscars character at its true value inspired by this conviction i began already to face our hopeless prospects boldly as long as i had life and strength to help her i determined that lucilla should not lose the man whose best qualities i had failed to discover until he had made up his mind to turn his back on her for ever  when i reached the rectory i was informed that mr finch wished to speak to me my anxiety about lucilla made me unwilling to submit to any delay in seeing her i sent a message informing the rector that i would be with him in a few minutesand ran upstairs into lucillas room  has it been a very long day my dear i asked when our first greetings were over  it has been a delightful day she answered joyously grosse took me out for a walk before he went back to london can you guess where our walk led us  a chilly sense of misgiving seized me i drew back from her i looked at her lovely face without the slightest admiration of itworse still with downright distrust of it  where did you go i asked  to browndown of course  an exclamation escaped meinfamous grosse spit out between my teeth in my own language i could not help it i should have died if i had repressed iti was in such a rage  lucilla laughed there there it was my fault i insisted on speaking to oscar as soon as i had my own way i behaved perfectly i never asked to have the bandage taken off i was satisfied with only speaking to him dear old grossehe isnt half as hard on me as you and my fatherwas with us all the time it has done me so much good dont be sulky about it you darling pratolungo my surgeon optic sanctions my imprudence i wont ask you to go with me to browndown tomorrow oscar is coming to return my visit  those last words decided me i had had a weary time of it since the morning but for me the day was not at an end yet i said to myself i will have it out with mr nugent dubourg before i go to my bed tonight  can you spare me for a little while i asked i must go to the other side of the house your father wishes to speak to me  lucilla started about what she inquired eagerly  about business in london i answeredand left her before her curiosity could madden me in the state i was in at that moment with more questions  i found the rector prepared to favor me with his usual flow of language fifty mr finches could not have possessed themselves of my attention in the humour i was in at that moment to the reverend gentlemans amazement it was i who beganand not he  i have just left lucilla mr finch i know what has happened  wait a minute madame pratolungo one thing is of the utmost importance to begin with do you thoroughly understand that i am in no sense of the word to blame  thoroughly i interposed of course they would not have gone to browndown if you had consented to let nugent dubourg into the house  stop said mr finch elevating his right hand my good creature you are in a state of hysterical precipitation i will be heard i did more than refuse my consent when the man grossei insist on your composing yourselfwhen the man grosse came and spoke to me about it i did more i say infinitely more than refuse my consent you know my force of languagedont be alarmed i said sir as pastor and parent my foot is down  i understand mr finch whatever you said to herr grosse was quite useless he entirely ignored your personal point of view  madame pratolungo  he found lucilla dangerously agitated by her separation from oscar he asserted what he calls his professional freedom of action  madame pratolungo  you persisted in closing your doors to nugent dubourg he persisted on his sideand took lucilla to browndown  mr finch got on his feet and asserted himself at the full pitch of his tremendous voice  silence he shouted with a smack of his open hand on the table at his side  i didnt care i shouted i came down with a smack of my hand on the opposite side of the table  one question sir before i leave you i said since your daughter went to browndown you have had many hours at your disposal have you seen mr nugent dubourg  the pope of dimchurch suddenly collapsed in full fulmination of his domestic bulls  pardon me he replied adopting his most elaborately polite manner this requires considerable explanation  i declined to wait for considerable explanation you have not seen him i said  i have not seen him echoed mr finch my position towards nugent dubourg is very remarkable madame pratolungo in my parental character i should like to wring his neck in my clerical character i feel it incumbent on me to pauseand write to him you feel the responsibility you understand the distinction  i understood that he was afraid answering him by an inclination of the head i hate a coward i walked silently to the door  mr finch returned my bow with a look of helpless perplexity are you going to leave me he inquired blandly  i am going to browndown  if i had said that i was going to a place which the rector had frequent occasion to mention in the stronger passages of his sermons mr finchs face could hardly have shown more astonishment and alarm than it exhibited when i replied to him in those terms he lifted his persuasive right hand he opened his eloquent lips before the coming overflow of language could reach me i was out of the room on my way to browndown    chapter the thirtyeighth  is there no excuse for him  oscars dismissed servant left during the usual month of warning to take care of the house opened the door to me when i knocked although the hour was already a late one in primitive dimchurch the man showed no signs of surprise at seeing me  is mr nugent dubourg at home  yes maam he lowered his voice and added i think mr nugent expected to see you tonight  whether he intended it or not the servant had done me a good turnhe had put me on my guard nugent dubourg understood my character better than i had understood his he had foreseen what would happen when i heard of lucillas visit on my return to the rectoryand he had no doubt prepared himself accordingly i was conscious of a certain nervous trembling i own as i followed the servant to the sittingroom at the moment however when he opened the door this ignoble sensation left me as suddenly as it had come i felt myself pratolungos widow again when i entered the room  a readinglamp with its shade down was the only light on the table nugent dubourg comfortably reposing in an easychair sat by the lamp with a cigar in his mouth and a book in his hand he put down the book on the table as he rose to receive me knowing by this time what sort of man i had to deal with i was determined not to let even the merest trifles escape me it might have its use in helping me to understand him if i knew how he had been occupying his mind while he was expecting me to arrive i looked at the book it was rousseaus confessions  he advanced with his pleasant smile and offered his hand as if nothing had happened to disturb our ordinary relations towards each other i drew back a step and looked at him  wont you shake hands with me he asked  i will answer that directly i said where is your brother  i dont know  when you do know mr nugent dubourg and when you have brought your brother back to this house i will take your handnot before  he bowed resignedly with a little satirical shrug of the shoulders and asked if he might offer me a chair  i took a chair for myself and placed it so that i might be opposite to him when he resumed his seat he checked himself in the act of sitting down and looked towards the open window  shall i throw away my cigar he said  not on my account i have no objection to smoking  thank you he took his chairkeeping his face in the partial obscurity cast by the shade of the lamp after smoking for a moment he spoke again without turning to look at me may i ask what your object is in honoring me with this visit  i have two objects the first is to see that you leave dimchurch tomorrow morning the second is to make you restore your brother to his promised wife  he looked round at me quickly his experience of my irritable temper had not prepared him for the perfect composure of voice and manner with which i answered his question he looked back again from me to his cigar and knocked off the ash at the tip of it considering with himself before he addressed his next words to me  we will come to the question of my leaving dimchurch presently he said have you received a letter from oscar  yes  have you read it  i have read it  then you know that we understand each other  i know that your brother has sacrificed himselfand that you have taken a base advantage of the sacrifice  he started and looked round at me once more i saw that something in my language or in my tone of speaking had stung him  you have your privilege as a lady he said dont push it too far what oscar has done he has done of his own free will  what oscar has done i rejoined is lamentably foolish cruelly wrong still perverted as it is there is something generous something noble in the motive which has led him as for your conduct in this matter i see nothing but what is mean nothing but what is cowardly in the motive which has led you  he started to his feet and flung his cigar into the empty fireplace  madame pratolungo he said i have not the honor of knowing anything of your family i cant call a woman to account for insulting me do you happen to have any man related to you in or out of england  i happen to have what will do equally well on this occasion i replied i have a hearty contempt for threats of all sorts and a steady resolution in me to say what i think  he walked to the door and opened it  i decline to give you the opportunity of saying anything more he rejoined i beg to leave you in possession of the room and to wish you good evening  he opened the door i had entered the house armed in my own mind with a last desperate resolve only to be communicated to him or to anybody in the final emergency and at the eleventh hour the time had come for saying what i had hoped with my whole heart to have left unsaid  i rose on my side and stopped him as he was leaving the room  return to your chair and your book i said our interview is at an end in leaving the house i have one last word to say you are wasting your time in remaining at dimchurch  i am the best judge of that he answered making way for me to go out  pardon me you are not in a position to judge at all you dont know what i mean to do as soon as i get back to the rectory  he instantly changed his position placing himself in the doorway so as to prevent me from leaving the room  what do you mean to do he asked keeping his eyes attentively fixed on mine  i mean to force you to leave dimchurch  he laughed insolently i went on as quietly as before you have personated your brother to lucilla this morning i said you have done that mr nugent dubourg for the last time  have i who will prevent me from doing it again  i will  this time he took it seriously  you he said how are you to control me if you please  i can control you through lucilla when i get back to the rectory i can and will tell lucilla the truth  he startedand instantly recovered himself  you forget something madame pratolungo you forget what the surgeon in attendance on her has told us  i remember it perfectly if we say or do anything to agitate his patient in her present state the surgeon refuses to answer for the consequences  well  wellbetween the alternative of leaving you free to break both their hearts and the alternative of setting the surgeons warning at defiancedreadful as the choice is my choice is made i tell you to your face i would rather see lucilla blind again than see her your wife  his estimate of the strength of the position on his side had been necessarily based on one convictionthe conviction that grosses professional authority would tie my tongue i had scattered his calculations to the winds he turned so deadly pale that dim as the light was i could see the change in his face  i dont believe you he said  present yourself at the rectory tomorrow i answeredand you will see i have no more to say to you let me by  you may suppose i was only trying to frighten him i was doing nothing of the sort blame me or approve of me as you please i was expressing the resolution which i had in my mind when i spoke whether my courage would have held out through the walk from browndown to the rectorywhether i should have shrunk from it when i actually found myself in lucillas presenceis more than i can venture to decide all i say is that i did in my desperation positively mean doing it at the moment when i threatened to do itand that nugent dubourg heard something in my voice which told him i was in earnest  you fiend he burst out stepping close up to me with a look of fury  the whole passionate fervour of the love that the miserable wretch felt for her shook him from head to foot as his horror of me found its way to expression in those two words  spare me your opinion of my character i said i dont expect you to understand the motives of an honest woman for the last time let me by  instead of letting me by he locked the door and put the key in his pocket that done he pointed to the chair that i had left  sit down he said with a sudden sinking in his voice which implied a sudden change in his temper let me have a minute to myself  i returned to my place he took his own chair on the other side of the table and covered his face with his hands we waited awhile in silence i looked at him once or twice as the minutes followed each other the shaded lamplight glistened dimly on something between his fingers i rose softly and stretched across the table to look closer tears on my word of honor tears forcing their way through his fingers as he held them over his face i had been on the point of speaking i sat down again in silence  say what you want of me tell me what you wish me to do those were his first words he spoke them without moving his hands so quietly so sadly with such hopeless sorrow such uncomplaining resignation in his voice that i who had entered that room hating him rose again and went round to his chair iwho a minute ago if i had had the strength would have struck him down on the floor at my feetlaid my hand on his shoulder pitying him from the bottom of my heart that is what women are there is a specimen of their sense firmness and selfcontrol  be just nugent i said be honorable be all that i once thought you i want no more  he dropped his arms on the table his head fell on them and he burst into a fit of crying it was so like his brother that i could almost have fancied i too had mistaken one of them for the other oscar over again i thought to myself on the first day when i spoke to him in this very room  come i said when he was quieter we shall end in understanding each other and respecting each other after all  he irritably shook my hand off his shoulder and turned his face away from the light  dont talk of understanding me he said your sympathy is for oscar he is the victim he is the martyr he has all your consideration and all your pity i am a coward i am a villain i have no honor and no heart tread me under foot like a reptile my misery is only what i deserve compassion is thrown awayisnt iton such a scoundrel as i am  i was sorely puzzled how to answer him all that he had said against himself i had thought of him in my own mind and why not he had behaved infamouslyhe was a fit object for righteous indignation and yetand yetit is sometimes so very hard however badly a man may have behaved for women to hold out against forgiving him when they know that a woman is at the bottom of it  whatever i may have thought of you i said it is still in your power nugent to win back my old regard for you  is it he answered scornfully i know better than that you are not talking to oscar nowyou are talking to a man who has had some experience of women i know how you all hold to your opinions because they are your opinionswithout asking yourselves whether they are right or wrong there are men who could understand me and pity me no woman can do it the best and cleverest among you dont know what love isas a man feels it it isnt the frenzy with you that it is with us it acknowledges restraints in a womanit bursts through everything in a man it robs him of his intelligence his honor his selfrespectit levels him with the brutesit debases him into idiocyit lashes him into madness i tell you i am not accountable for my own actions the kindest thing you could do for me would be to shut me up in a madhouse the best thing i could do for myself would be to cut my throatoh yes this is a shocking way of talking isnt it i ought to struggle against itas you say i ought to summon my selfcontrol ha ha ha here is a clever womanhere is an experienced woman and yetthough she has seen me in lucillas company hundreds of timesshe has never once discovered the signs of a struggle in me from the moment when i first saw that heavenly creature it has been one long fight against myself one infernal torment of shame and remorse and this clever friend of mine has observed so little and knows so little that she can only view my conduct in one lightit is the conduct of a coward and a villain  he got up and took a turn in the room i wasnaturally i thinka little irritated by his way of putting it a man assuming to know more about love than a woman was there ever such a monstrous perversion of the truth as that i appeal to the women  you ought to be the last person to blame me i said i had too high an opinion of you to suspect what was going on i will never make the same mistake againi promise you that  he came back and stood still in front of me looking me hard in the face  do you really mean to say you saw nothing to set you thinking on the day when i first met her he asked you were there in the roomdidnt you see that she struck me dumb did you notice nothing suspicious at a later time when i was suffering martyrdom if i only looked at herwas there nothing to be seen in me which told its own tale  i noticed that you were never at your ease with her i replied but i liked you and trusted youand i failed to understand it thats all  did you fail to understand everything that followed didnt i speak to her father didnt i try to hasten oscars marriage  it was true he had tried  when we first talked of his telling lucilla of the discoloration of his face did i not agree with you that he ought to put himself right with her in his own interests  true again impossible to deny that he had sided with my view  when she all but found it out for herself whose influence was used to make him own it mine what did i do when he tried to confess it and failed to make her understand him what did i do when she first committed the mistake of believing me to be the disfigured man  the audacity of that last question fairly took away my breath you cruelly helped to deceive her i answered indignantly you basely encouraged your brother in his fatal policy of silence  he looked at me with an angry amazement on his side which more than equaled the angry amazement on mine  so much for the delicate perception of a woman he exclaimed so much for the wonderful tact which is the peculiar gift of the sex you can see no motive but a bad motive in my sacrificing myself for oscars sake  i began to discern faintly that there might have been another than a bad motive for his conduct butwell i dare say i was wrong i resented the tone he was taking with me i would have owned i had made a mistake to anybody else in the world i wouldnt own it to him there  look back for one moment he resumed in quieter and gentler tones see how hardly you have judged me i seized the opportunityi swear to you this is truei seized the opportunity of making myself an object of horror to her the moment i heard of the mistake that she had made i felt in myself that i was growing less and less capable of avoiding her and i caught at the chance of making her avoid me i did thatand i did more i entreated oscar to let me leave dimchurch he appealed to me in the name of our love for each other to remain i couldnt resist him where do you see signs of the conduct of a scoundrel in all this would a scoundrel have betrayed himself to you a dozen times overas i did in that talk of ours in the summerhouse i remember saying in so many words i wished i had never come to dimchurch what reason but one could there be for my saying that how is it that you never even asked me what i meant  you forget i interposed that i had no opportunity of asking you lucilla interrupted us and diverted my attention to other things what do you mean by putting me on my defence in this way i went on more and more irritated by the tone he was taking with me what right have you to judge my conduct  he looked at me with a kind of vacant surprise  have i been judging your conduct he asked  yes  perhaps i was thinking if you had seen my infatuation in time you might have checked it in time no he exclaimed before i could answer him nothing could have checked itnothing will cure it but my death let us try to agree i beg your pardon if i have offended you i am willing to take a just view of your conduct will you take a just view of mine  i tried hard to take a just view though i resented his manner of speaking to me i nevertheless secretly felt for him as i have confessed still i could not forget that he had attempted to attract to himself lucillas first look on the day when she tried her sightthat he had personated his brother to lucilla that very morningthat he had suffered his brother to go away heartbroken a voluntary exile from all that he held dear no i could feel for him but i could not take a just view of him i sat down and said nothing  he returned to the question between us treating me with the needful politeness when he spoke next for all that he alarmed me by what he now said as he had not alarmed me yet  i repeat what i have already told you he proceeded i am no longer accountable for what i do if i know anything of myself i believe it will be useless to trust me in the future while i am capable of speaking the truth let me tell it whatever happens at a later timeremember this i have honestly made a clean breast of it tonight  stop i cried i dont understand your reckless way of talking every man is accountable for what he does  he checked me there by an impatient wave of his hand  keep your opinion i dont dispute it you will see you will seemadame pratolungo the day when we had that private talk of ours in the rectory summerhouse marks a memorable date in my calendar my last honest struggle to be true to my poor oscar ended with that day the efforts i have made since then have been little better than mere outbreaks of despair they have done nothing to help me against the passion that has become the one feeling and the one misery of my life dont talk of resistance all resistance stops at a certain point since the time i have told you of my resistance has reached its limits you have heard how i struggled against temptation as long as i could resist it i have only to tell you how i have yielded to it now  the reckless shameless composure with which he said that began to set me against him once more the perpetual shifts and contradictions in him bewildered and irritated me quicksilver itself seemed to be less slippery to lay hold of than this man  do you remember the day he asked when lucilla lost her temper and received you so rudely at your visit to browndown  i made a sign in the affirmative  you spoke a little while since of my personating oscar to her i personated him on the occasion i have just mentioned for the first time you were present and heard me did you care to speculate on the motives which made me impose myself on her as my brother  as well as i can remember i answered i made the first guess that occurred to me i thought you were indulging in a moments mischievous amusement at lucillas expense  i was indulging the passion that consumed me i longed to feel the luxury of her touching me and being familiar with me under the impression that i was oscar worse even than that i wanted to try how completely i could impose on herhow easily i might marry her if i could only deceive you all and take her away somewhere by herself the devil was in possession of me i dont know how it might have ended if oscar had not come in and if lucilla had not burst out as she did she distressed meshe frightened meshe gave me back again to my better self i rushed without stopping to prepare her into the question of her restoration to sightas the only way of diverting her mind from the vile advantage that i had taken of her blindness that night madame pratolungo i suffered pangs of selfreproach and remorse which would even have satisfied you at the very next opportunity that offered i made my atonement to oscar i supported his interests i even put the words he was to say to lucilla into his lips  when i broke in where how  when the two surgeons had left us in lucillas sittingroom in the heat of the discussion whether she should submit to the operation at onceor whether she should marry oscar first and let grosse try his experiment on her eyes at a later time if you recall our conversation you will remember that i did all i could to persuade lucilla to marry my brother before grosse tried his experiment on her sight quite useless you threw all the weight of your influence into the opposite side of the scale i failed it made no difference i had done what i had done in sheer despair mere impulseit didnt last when the next temptation tried me i behaved like a scoundrelas you say  i have said nothing i answered shortly  very wellas you think then did you suspect me at lastwhen we met in the village yesterday surely even your eyes must have seen through me on that occasion  i answered silently by an inclination of my head i had no wish to drift into another quarrel sorely as he was presuming on my endurance i tried in lucillas interests to keep on friendly terms with him  you concealed it wonderfully well he went on when i tried to find out whether you had or had not discovered me you virtuous people are not bad hands at deception when it suits your interests to deceive i neednt tell you what my temptation was yesterday the first look of her eyes when they opened on the world the first light of love and joy breaking on her heavenly facewhat madness to expect me to let that look fall on another man that light show itself to other eyes no living being adoring her as i adored her would have acted otherwise than i did i could have fallen down on my knees and worshipped grosse when he innocently proposed to me to take the very place in the room which i was determined to occupy you saw what i had in my mind you did your bestand did it admirablyto defeat me oh you pattern peopleyou can be as shifty with your resources when a cunning trick is to be played as the worst of us you saw how it ended fortune stood my friend at the eleventh hour fortune can shine like the sun on the just and the unjust i had the first look of her eyes i felt the first light of love and joy in her face falling on me i have had her arms round me and her bosom on mine  i could endure it no longer  open the door i said i am ashamed to be in the same room with you  i dont wonder at it he answered you may well be ashamed of me i am ashamed of myself  there was nothing cynical in his tone nothing insolent in his manner the same man who had just gloried in that abominable way in his victory over innocence and misfortune now spoke and looked like a man who was honestly ashamed of himself if i could only have felt convinced that he was mocking me or playing the hypocrite with me i should have known what to do but i say againimpossible as it seemshe was beyond all doubt genuinely penitent for what he had said the instant after he had said it with all my experience of humanity and all my practice in dealing with strange characters i stopped midway between nugent and the locked door thoroughly puzzled  do you believe me he asked  i dont understand you i answered  he took the key of the door out of his pocket and put it on the tableclose to the chair from which i had just risen  i lose my head when i talk of her or think of her he went on i would give everything i possess not to have said what i said just now no language you can use is too strong to condemn it the words burst out of me if lucilla herself had been present i couldnt have controlled them go if you like i have no right to keep you here after behaving as i have done there is the key at your service only think first before you leave me you had something to propose when you came in you might influence meyou might shame me into behaving like an honorable man do as you please it rests with you  which was i a good christian or a contemptible fool i went back once more to my chair and determined to give him a last chance  thats kind he said you encourage me you show me that i am worth trying again i had a generous impulse in this room yesterday it might have been something better than an impulseif i had not had another temptation set straight in my way  what temptation i asked  oscars letter has told you oscar himself put the temptation in my way you must have seen it  i saw nothing of the sort  doesnt he tell you that i offered to leave dimchurch for ever i meant it i saw the misery in the poor fellows face when grosse and i were leading lucilla out of the room with my whole heart i meant it if he had taken my hand and had said goodbye i should have gone he wouldnt take my hand he insisted on thinking it over by himself he came back resolved to make the sacrifice on his side  why did you accept the sacrifice  because he tempted me  tempted you  yes what else can you call itwhen he offered to leave me free to plead my own cause with lucilla what else can you call itwhen he showed me a future life which was a life with lucilla poor dear generous fellow he tempted me to stay when he ought to have encouraged me to go how could i resist him blame the passion that has got me body and soul dont blame me  i looked at the book on the tablethe book that he had been reading when i entered the room these sophistical confidences of his were nothing but rousseau at second hand good if he talked false rousseau nothing was left for me but to talk genuine pratolungo i let myself goi was just in the humour for it  how can a clever man like you impose on yourself in that way i said your future with lucilla you have no future with lucilla which is not shocking to think of supposeyou shall never do it as long as i livesuppose you married her good heavens what a miserable life it would be for both of you you love your brother do you think you could ever really know a moments peace with one reflection perpetually forcing itself on your mind i have cheated oscar out of the woman whom he loved i have wasted his life i have broken his heart you couldnt look at her you couldnt speak to her you couldnt touch her without feeling it all embittered by that horrible reproach and she what sort of wife would she make you when she knew how you had got her i dont know which of the two she would hate mostyou or herself not a man would pass her in the street who would not rouse the thought in heri wonder whether he has ever done anything as base as what my husband has done not a married woman of her acquaintance but would make her sick at heart with envy and regret whatever faults he may have your husband hasnt won you as my husband won me you happy your married life endurable come i have saved a few pounds since i have been with lucilla i will lay you every farthing i possess you two would be separated by mutual consent before you had been six months man and wife now which will you do will you start for the continent or stay here will you bring oscar back like an honorable man or let him go and disgrace yourself for ever  his eyes sparkled his color rose he sprang to his feet and unlocked the door what was he going to do to start for the continent or to turn me out of the house  he called to the servant  james  yes sir  make the house fast when madame pratolungo and i have left it i am not coming back again  sir  pack my portmanteau and send it after me tomorrow to nagles hotel london  he closed the door again and came back to me  you refused to take my hand when you came in he said will you take it now i leave browndown when you leave it and i wont come back again till i bring oscar with me  both hands i exclaimedand took him by both hands i could say nothing more i could only wonder whether i was waking or sleeping fit to be put into an asylum or fit to go at large  come he said i will see you as far as the rectory gate  you cant go tonight i answered the last train has left hours since  i can i can walk to brighton and get a bed there and leave for london tomorrow morning nothing will induce me to pass another night at browndown stop one question before i put the lamp out  what is it  did you do anything towards tracing oscar when you were in london today  i went to a lawyer and made what arrangements with him i could  here is my pocketbook write me down his name and address  i wrote them he extinguished the lamp and led me into the passage the servant was standing there bewildered good night james i am going to bring your master back to browndown with that explanation he took up his hat and stick and gave me his arm the moment after we were out in the dark valley on our way to the village  on the walk back to the rectory he talked with a feverish volubility and excitement avoiding the slightest reference to the subject discussed at our strange and stormy interview he returned with tenfold confidence in himself to his old boastful assertion of the great things he was going to do as a painter the mission which called him to reconcile humanity with nature the superb scale on which he proposed to interpret sympathetic scenery for the benefit of suffering mankind the prime necessity of understanding him not as a mere painter but as grand consoler in arti had it all over again by way of satisfying my mind as to his prospects and occupations in his future life it was only when we stopped at the rectorygate that he referred to what had passed between usand even then he only touched on the subject in the briefest possible way  well he said have i won back your old regard for me do you believe there is a fine side to be found in the nature of nugent dubourg man is a compound animal you are a woman in ten thousand give me a kiss  he kissed me foreign fashion on both cheeks  now for oscar he shouted cheerfully he waved his hat and disappeared in the darkness i stood at the gate till the last rapid pitpat of his feet died away in the silence of the night  an indescribable depression seized on my spirits i began to doubt him again the instant i was alone  is there a time coming i asked myself when all that i have done tonight must be done over again  i opened the rectorygate mr finch intercepted me before i could get round to our side of the house he held up before me in solemn triumph a manuscript of many pages  my letter he said a letter of christian remonstrance to nugent dubourg  nugent dubourg has left dimchurch  with that reply i told the rector in as few words as possible how my visit to browndown had ended  mr finch looked at his letter all those pages of eloquence written for nothing no in the nature of things that could not possibly be you have done very well madame pratolungo he remarked in his most patronizing manner very well indeed all things considered but i dont think i shall act wisely if i destroy this he carefully locked up his manuscript and turned to me again with a mysterious smile i venture to think said mr finch with mock humility my letter will be wanted dont let me discourage you about nugent dubourg only let me sayis he to be trusted  it was said by a fool it would never have been said at all if he had not written his wonderful letter still it echoed with a painful fidelity the misgiving secretly present at that moment in my own mindand more yet it echoed the misgiving in nugents mind the doubt of himself which his own lips had confessed to me in so many words i wished the rector good night and went upstairs  lucilla was in bed and asleep when i softly opened her door  after looking for awhile at her lovely peaceful face i was obliged to turn away it was time i left the bedside when the sight of her only made my spirits sink lower and lower as i cast my last look at her before i closed the door mr finchs ominous question forced itself on me again in spite of myself i said to myself  is he to be trusted    chapter the thirtyninth  she learns to see  with the new morning certain reflections found their way into my mind which were not of the most welcome sort there was one serious element of embarrassment in my position towards lucilla which had not discovered itself to me when nugent and i parted at the rectory gate  browndown was now empty in the absence of both the brothers what was i to say to lucilla when the false oscar failed to pay her his promised visit that day  in what a labyrinth of lies had the first fatal suppression of the truth involved us all one deception after another had been forced on us one disaster after another had followed retributively as the resultand now that i was left to deal singlehanded with the hard necessities of our position no choice seemed left to me but to go on deceiving lucilla still i was weary of it and ashamed of it at breakfasttime i evaded all further discussion of the subject after i had first ascertained that lucilla did not expect her visitor before the afternoon for some time after breakfast i kept her at the piano when she wearied of music and began to talk of oscar once more i put on my hat and set forth on a domestic errand of the kind usually entrusted to zillah solely for the purpose of keeping out of the way and putting off to the last moment the hateful necessity of telling more lies the weather stood my friend it threatened to rain and lucilla on that account refrained from proposing to accompany me  my errand took me to a farmhouse on the road which led to brighton after settling my business i prolonged my walk though the rain was already beginning to fall i had nothing on me that would spoil and in my present frame of mind a wet gown was a preferable alternative to returning to the rectory  after i had walked about a mile further on the solitude of the road was enlivened by the appearance of an open carriage approaching me from the direction of brighton the hood was up to protect the person inside from the rain the person looked out as i passed and stopped the carriage in a voice which i instantly recognized as the voice of grosse our gallant oculist insisted in the state of the weather on my instantly taking shelter by his side and returning with him to the house  this is an unexpected pleasure i said i thought you had arranged not to see lucilla again till the end of the week  grosses eyes glared at me through his spectacles with a dignity and gravity worthy of mr finch himself  shall i tell you something he said you see sitting at your side a lost surgeonoptic i shall die soon put on my tombs if you please the malady which killed this german mans waslofely feench when i am away from hergif me your sympathies i so much want iti sweat with anxiousness for young miss your damnmessfix about those two brodders is a sort of perpetual blisters on my mind instead of snoring peaceably all night in my nice big english beds i roll wide awake on my pillows fidgeting for feench i am here today before my time for what for to try her eyesyou think goot madam you think wrong it is not her eyes which troubles me her eyes will do it is youand the odders at your rectoryplace you make me nervousanxious about my patients i am afraid some of you will let the messfix of those broddertwins find its way to her pretty ears and turn her poor little mind topsyturvies when i am not near to see to it in time will you let her be comfortableeasy for two months more ach gott if i could only be certainsure of that i might leave those weak new eyes of hers to cure themselves and go my ways back to london again  i had intended to remonstrate with him pretty sharply for taking lucilla to browndown after what he had now said it was useless to attempt anything of that sortand doubly useless to hope that he would let me extricate myself from my difficulties by letting me tell her the truth  of course you are the best judge i said but you little know what these precautions of yours cost the unfortunate people who are left to carry them out  he took me up sharply at those words  you shall judge for yourself he said if it is not worth the cost if her eyes satisfy mefeench shall learn to see today you shall stand by you obstinate womans and judge if it is goot to add shock and agitation to the exhaustions and irritabilities and bedevilments of all sorts which our poor miss must suffer in learning to see after being blind for all her life no more of it now till we get to the rectoryplace by way of changing the subject for the present he put a question to me which i felt it necessary to answer with some caution how is my nice boysmy brightclever nugent he asked  very well  there i stopped not feeling at all sure of the ground i was treading on  mind this grosse went on my brightboynugent keeps her comfortableeasy my brightboynugent is worth all the rest of you togedder i insist on his making his visits to young miss at the rectoryplace in spite of that windytalkypuffbagfeenchfather of hers i say positivelynugent shall come into the house  there was no help for it now i was obliged to tell him that nugent had left browndown and that i was the person who had sent him away  for a moment i was really in doubt whether the skilled hand of the great surgeon would not be ignobly employed in boxing my ears no perversion of spelling can possibly report the complicated germanenglish jargon in which his fury poured itself out on my devoted head let it be enough to say that he declared nugents abominable personation of his brother to be vitally importantso long as oscar was absentto his successful treatment of the sensitive and excitable patient whom we had placed under his care i vainly assured him that nugents object in leaving dimchurch was to set matters right again by bringing his brother back grosse flatly declined to allow himself to be influenced by any speculative consideration of that sort he said and swore that my meddling had raised a serious obstacle in his way and that nothing but his own tender regard for lucilla prevented him from turning the coachmans back and leaving us henceforth to shift for ourselves  when we reached the rectory gate he had cooled a little as we crossed the garden he reminded me that i stood pledged to be present when the bandage was taken off  now mind he said you are going to see if it is goot or bad to tell her that she has had those nice white arms of hers round the wrong brodder you are going to tell me afterwards if you dare say to her in plain english words blueface is the man  we found lucilla in the sittingroom grosse briefly informed her that he had nothing particular to occupy him in london and that he had advanced the date of his visit on that account you want something to do my lofe on this soakyrainy day show papagrosse what you can do with your eyes now you have got them back again with those words he unfastened the bandage and taking her by the chin examined her eyesfirst without his magnifying glass then with it  am i going on well she asked anxiously  famouswell you go on as my goot friends say in america firstclass now use your eyes for yourself gif one lofing look to grosse first thensee see see  there was no mistaking the tone in which he spoke to her  he was not only satisfied about her eyeshe was triumphant soh he grunted turning to me why is mr sebrights not here to look at this  i eagerly approached lucilla there was still a little dimness left in her eyes i noticed also that they moved to and fro restlessly and at times wildly but oh the bright change in her the new life of beauty which the new sense had bestowed on her already her smile always charming now caught light from her lips and spread its gentle fascination over all her face it was impossible not to long to kiss her i advanced to congratulate to embrace her grosse stepped forward and checked me  no he said walk your ways to the odder end of the roomsand let us see if she can go to you  like all other people knowing no more of the subject than i knew i had no idea of the pitiably helpless manner in which the restored sense of sight struggles to assert itself in persons who have been blind for life in such cases the effort of the eyes that are first learning to see is like the effort of the limbs when a child is first learning to walk but for grosses odd way of taking it the scene which i was now to witness would have been painful in the last degree my poor lucillainstead of filling me with joy as i had anticipatedwould i really believe have wrung my heart and have made me burst out crying  now said grosse laying one hand on lucillas arm while he pointed to me with the other there she stands can you go to her  of course i can  i lay you a betwager you can not ten thausand pounds to six pennies donedone now try  she answered by a little gesture of defiance and took three hasty steps forward bewildered and frightened she stopped suddenly at the third stepbefore she had advanced half the way from her end of the room to mine  i saw her here she said pointing down to the spot on which she was standing and appealing piteously to grosse i see her nowand i dont know where she is she is so near i feel as if she touched my eyesand yet she advanced another step and clutched with her hands at the empty airand yet i cant get near enough to take hold of her oh what does it mean what does it mean  it meanspay me my six pennies said grosse the wagerbet is mine  she resented his laughing at her with an obstinate shake of her head and an angry knitting of her pretty eyebrows  wait a little she said you shant win quite so easily as that i will get to her yet  she came straight to me in a momentjust as easily as i could have gone to her myself if i had tried  another wagerbet cried grosse still standing behind her and calling to me twenty thousand pounds this time to a fourpenniesbit she has shut her eyes to get to you hey  it was trueshe had blindfolded herself with her eyes closed she could measure to a hairs breadth the distance which with her eyes opened she was perfectly incompetent to calculate detected by both of us she sat down poor dear with a sigh of despair was it worth while she said to me sadly to go through the operation for this  grosse joined us at our end of the room  all in goot time he said patienceand these helpless eyes of yours will learn soh i shall begin to teach them now you have got your own notionsheyabout this colors and that when you were blind did you think what would be your favorite colors if you could see you did which colors is it tell me come  white first she answered then scarlet  grosse paused and considered  white i understand he said white is the fancy of a young girls but why scarlets could you see scarlets when you were blind  almost she answered if it was bright enough i used to feel something pass before my eyes when scarlet was shown to me  in these cataractscases it is constantly scarlets that they almost see muttered grosse to himself there must be reason for thisand i must find him he went on with his questions to lucilla and the colors you hate mostwhich is he  black  grosse nodded his head approvingly i thought so he said it is always black that they hate for this also there must be reasonand i must find him  having expressed that resolution he approached the writingtable and took a sheet of paper out of the case and a circular penwiper of scarlet cloth out of the inkstand after that he looked about him waddled back to the other end of the room and fetched the black felt hat in which he had traveled from london he ranged the hat the paper and the penwiper in a row before he could put his next question to her she pointed to the hat with a gesture of disapproval  take it away she said i dont like that  grosse stopped me before i could speak  wait a little he whispered in my ear it is not quite so wonderful as you think these blind peoples when they first see have all alike the same hatred of anything what is dark he turned to lucilla say he asked is your favorite colors among these things here  she passed by the hat in contempt looked at the penwiper and put it down looked at the sheet of paper and put it down hesitatedand again shut her eyes  no cried grosse i wont have it how dare you blind yourself in the presence of me what i give you back your sights and you go shut your eyes open themor i will put you in the corner like a naughty girls your favorite colors now now now  she opened her eyes very unwillingly and looked once more at the penwiper and the paper  i see nothing as bright as my favorite colors here she said  grosse held up the sheet of paper and pressed the question without mercy  what is white whiter than this  fifty thousand times whiter than that  goot now mind this paper is white he snatched her handkerchief out of her apronpocket this handkerchief is white too whitest of white both of them first lesson my lofe here in my hands is your favorite colors in the time when you were blind  those she exclaimed pointing to the paper and the handkerchief with a look of blank disappointment as he dropped them on the table she turned over the penwiper and the hat and looked round at me grosse waiting to try another experiment left it to me to answer the result in both cases was the same as in the cases of the sheet of paper and the handkerchief scarlet was not half as redblack not onehundredth part as blackas her imagination had figured them to her in the days when she was blind still as to this last coloras to blackshe could feel some little encouragement it had affected her disagreeably just as poor oscars face had affected her though she had not actually known it for the color that she disliked she made an effort poor child to assert herself against her merciless surgeonteacher i didnt know it was black she said but i hated the sight of it for all that  she tried as she spoke to toss the hat on to a chair standing close by herand threw it instead high above the back of the chair against the wall at least six feet away from the object at which she had aimed i am a helpless fool she burst out her face flushing crimson with mortification dont let oscar see me i cant bear the thought of making myself ridiculous before him he is coming here she added turning to me entreatingly manage to make some excuse for his not seeing me till later in the day  i promised to find the excuseall the more readily that i now saw an unexpected chance of reconciling her in some degree so long as she was learning to see to the blank produced in her life by oscars absence  she addressed herself again to grosse  go on she said impatiently teach me to be something better than an idiotor put the bandage on and blind me again my eyes are of no use to me do you hear she cried furiously taking him by his broad shoulders and shaking him with all her mightmy eyes are of no use to me  now now now cried grosse if you dont keep your tempers you little spitfire i will teach you nothing he took up the sheet of paper and the penwiper and forcing her to sit down placed them together before her in her lap  do you know one thing he went on do you know what is meant by an objects which is square do you know what is meant by an objects which is round  instead of answering him she appealed indignantly to my opinion  is it not monstrous she asked to hear him put such a question to me as that do i know round from square oh how cruelly humiliating dont tell oscar dont tell oscar  if you know persisted grosse you can tell me look at those two things in your lap are they both round or both square or is one round and the odder square look now and tell me  she lookedand said nothing  well continued grosse  you put me out standing there staring at me through your horrid spectacles she said irritably dont look at me and i will tell you directly  grosse turned his head my way with his diabolical grin and signed to me to keep watch on her in his place  the instant his back was turned she shut her eyes and ran over the paper and the penwiper with the tips of her fingers  one is round and one is square she answered cunningly opening her eyes again just in time to bear critical inspection when grosse turned round towards her once more  he took the paper and the penwiper out of her hands and thoroughly understanding the trick she had played him changed them for a bronze saucer and a book which is round and which is square of these he asked holding them up before her  she looked first at one and then at the otherplainly incapable with only her eyes to help her of answering the question  i put you outdont i said grosse you cant shut your eyes my lofely feench while i am lookingcan you  she turned redthen pale again i began to be afraid she would burst out crying grosse managed her to perfection the tact of this rough ugly eccentric old man was the most perfect tact i have ever met with  shut your eyes he said soothingly it is the right ways to learn shut your eyes and take them in your hands and tell me which is round and which is square in that way first  she told him directly  goot now open your eyes and see for yourself it is the saucers you have got in your right hand and the books you have got in your left you see goot again put them back on the table now what shall we do next  may i try if i can write she asked eagerly i do so want to see if i can write with my eyes instead of my finger  no ten thausand times no i forbid reading i forbid writing yet come with me to the window how do these most troublesome eyes of yours do at a distance  while we had been trying our experiment with lucilla the weather had brightened again the clouds were parting the sun was coming out the bright gaps of blue in the sky were widening every moment the shadows were traveling grandly over the windy slopes of the hills lucilla lifted her hands in speechless admiration as the german threw open the window and placed her face to face with the view  oh she exclaimed dont speak to me dont touch melet me enjoy it there is no disappointment here i have never thought i have never dreamed of anything half so beautiful as this  grosse looked at me and silently pointed to her she had turned paleshe was trembling in every limb overwhelmed by her own ecstatic sense of the glory of the sky and the beauty of the earth as they now met her view for the first time i penetrated the surgeons object in directing my attention to her see he meant to say what a delicatelyorganized creature we have to deal with is it possible to be too careful in handling such a sensitive temperament as that understanding him only too well i also trembled when i thought of the future everything now depended on nugent and nugents own lips had told me that he could not depend on himself  it was a relief to me when grosse interrupted her  she pleaded hard to be allowed to stay at the window a little longer he refused to allow it upon that she flew instantly into the opposite extreme i am in my own room and i am my own mistress she said angrily i insist on having my own way grosse was ready with his answer  take your own ways fatigue those weak new eyes of yoursand tomorrow when you try to look out of window you will not be able to see at all this reply terrified her into instant submission she assisted in replacing the bandage with her own hands may i go away to my own room she asked with the simplicity of a child i have seen such beautiful sightsand i do so want to think of them by myself  the medical adviser instantly granted the patients request any proceeding which tended to compose her was a proceeding of which he highly approved  if oscar comes she whispered as she passed me on her way to the door mind i hear of it and mind you dont tell him of the mistakes i have made she paused for a moment thinking i dont understand myself she said i never was so happy in my life and yet i feel almost ready to cry she turned towards grosse come here papa you have been very good to me today i will give you a kiss she laid her hands lightly on his shoulders kissed his lined and wrinkled cheek gave me a little squeeze round the waistand left us grosse turned sharply to the window and used his huge silk handkerchief for a purpose to which i suspect it had not been put for many a long year past    chapter the fortieth  traces of nugent  madame pratolungo  herr grosse  he put his handkerchief back into his pocket and turned round to me from the window with his face composed again and his teacaddy snuffbox in his hand  now you have seen for your own self he said with an emphatic rap on the box do you dare tell that sweet girls which of them it is that has gone his ways and left her for ever  it is not easy to find a limit to the obstinacy of womenwhen men expect them to acknowledge themselves to have been wrong after what i had seen i no more dared tell her than he did i was only too obstinate to acknowledge it to himjust yet  mind this he went on whether you shake her with frights or whether you heat her with rages or whether you wound her with griefsit all goes straight the same to those weak new eyes of hers they are so weak and so new that i must ask once more for my beds here tonight for to see tomorrow if i have not already tried them too much now for the last time of asking have you got the abominable courage in you to tell her the truth  he had found my limit at last i was obliged to own heartily as i disliked doing it that there was for the present no choice left but mercifully to conceal the truth having gone this length i next attempted to consult him as to the safest manner in which i could account to lucilla for oscars absence he refused as a man to recognize the slightest necessity for giving me as a woman any advice on a question of evasions and excuses i have not lived all my years in the world without learning something he said when it comes to walking upon eggshells and telling fips the womens have nothing to learn from the menswill you take a little strollwalk with me in the garden i have one odder thing to say to you and i am hungry and thirsty both togedderfor this  he produced this in the form of his pipe we left the room at once for our stroll in the garden  having solaced himself with his first mouthful of tobaccosmoke he startled me by announcing that he meant to remove lucilla forthwith from dimchurch to the seaside in doing this he was actuated by two motivesfirst the medical motive of strengthening her constitution second the personal motive of preserving her from making painful discoveries by placing her out of reach of the gossip of the rectory and the village grosse had the lowest opinion of mr finch and his household his dislike and distrust of the rector in particular knew no bounds he characterized the pope of dimchurch as an ape with a long tongue and a manandmonkey capacity for doing mischief ramsgate was the wateringplace which he had fixed on it was at a safe distance from dimchurch and it was near enough to london to enable him to visit lucilla frequently the one thing needed was my cooperation in the new plan if i was at liberty to take charge of lucilla he would speak to the ape with the long tongue and we might start for ramsgate before the end of the week  was there anything to prevent me from carrying out the arrangement proposed  there was nothing to prevent me my one other anxiety apart from lucillaanxiety about good papahad now for some time been happily set at rest letter after letter from my sisters in france brought me always the same cheering news my evergreen parent had at last discovered that he was no longer in the first bloom of his youth he had resigned to his juniors with pathetic expressions of regret the making of love and the fighting of duels ravaged by past passions this dear innocent had now found a refuge from swords pistols and the sex in collecting butterflies and playing on the guitar i was free wholly to devote myself to lucilla and i honestly rejoiced in the prospect before me alone with her and away from the rectory where there was always danger off gossip reaching her ears i could rely on myself to protect her from harm in the present and to preserve her for oscar in the future with all my heart i agreed to the arrangements as grosse proposed them when we parted in the garden he went round to the rectors side of the house to announce in his medical capacity the decision at which he had arrivedwhile i on my side went back to lucilla to make the best excuses that i could invent for oscar and to prepare her for our speedy removal from dimchurch    gone without coming to say goodbye gone without even writing to me  there was the first impression i produced on her when i had done my best to account harmlessly for oscars absence i had as i thought taken the shortest and simplest way out of the difficulty by merely inverting the truth in other words by telling her that nugent had got into some serious embarrassment abroad and that oscar had been called away at a moments notice to follow him and help him it was in vain that i reminded her of oscars wellknown horror of leavetakings of all kinds in vain that i represented the urgency of the matter as leaving him no alternative but to confide his excuses and his farewells to me in vain that i promised for him that he would write to her at the first opportunity she listened without conviction the more perseveringly i tried to account for it the more perseveringly she dwelt on oscars unaccountable disregard of her claims on his consideration for her as for our journey to ramsgate it was impossible to interest her in the subject i gave it up in despair  surely oscar has left some address at which i can write to him she said  i could only answer that he was not sure enough of his movements to be able to do that before he went away  it is more provoking than you think she went on i believe oscar is afraid to bring his unfortunate brother into my presence the blue face startled me when i saw it i know but i have quite got over that i feel none of the absurd terror of the poor man which i felt when i was blind now that i have seen for myself what he is really like i can feel for him i wanted to tell oscar thisi wanted to say that he might bring his brother to live with us if he likedi wanted to prevent just what has happened his going away from me when he wishes to see his brother you are using me very hardly among you and i have some reason to complain of it  while she was talking in this mortifying manner i felt some consolation nevertheless oscars disfigured complexion would not be the terrible obstacle in the way of his restoration to lucilla that i had feared all the comfort which this reflection could give i wanted badly enough there was no open hostility towards me on lucillas partbut there was a coolness which i found more distressing to bear than hostility itself i breakfasted in bed the next morning and only rose towards noonjust in time to say goodbye to grosse before he returned to london  he was in high good spirits about his patient her eyes were the better instead of the worse for the exertion to which he had subjected them on the previous day the bracing air of ramsgate was all that was wanting to complete the success of the operation mr finch had started objections all turning on the question of expense but with a daughter who was her own mistress and who had her own fortune his objections mattered nothing by the next day or the day after at latest we were to start for ramsgate i promised to write to our good surgeon as soon as we were established and he engaged on his side to visit us immediately after let her use her eyes for two goot hours every day said grosse at parting she may do what she likes with themexcept that she must not peep into books or take up pens till i come to you at ramsgate it is most wonderfulbeautiful to see how those new eyes of hers do get along when i next meet goot mr sebrightshey how i shall cockcrow over that spickspan respectable man  i felt a little nervous as to how the day would passwhen the german left me alone with lucilla  to my amazement she not only met me with the needful excuses for her behavior on the previous day but showed herself to be perfectly resigned to the temporary loss of oscars society it was she not i who remarked that he could not have chosen a better time for being away from her than the humiliating time when she was learning to distinguish between round and square it was she not i who welcomed the little journey to ramsgate as a pleasant change in her dull life which would help to reconcile her to oscars absence in brief if she had actually received a letter from oscar relieving her of all anxiety about him her words and looks could hardly have offered a completer contrast than they now showed to her words and looks of the previous day   if i had noticed no other alteration in her than this welcome change for the better my record of the day would have ended here as the record of unmixed happiness  but i grieve to say i have something unpleasant to add while she was making her excuses to me and speaking in the sensible and satisfactory terms which i have just repeated i noticed a curious underlying embarrassment in her manner entirely unlike any previous embarrassment which had ever intruded itself between us and stranger still on the first occasion when zillah came into the room while i was in it i observed that lucillas embarrassment was reflected when the old woman spoke to me in the face and manner of lucillas nurse  but one conclusion could possibly follow from what i sawthey were both concealing something from me and they were both more or less ashamed of what they were doing  somewherenot very far back in these pagesi have said of myself that i am not by nature a woman who is easily ready to suspect others on this very account when i find suspicion absolutely forced on meas it was nowi am apt to fly into the opposite extreme in the present case i fixed on the person to suspectall the more readily from having been slow to suspect him in bygone days in some way or other i said to myself nugent dubourg is at the bottom of this  was he communicating with her privately in the name and in the character of oscar  the bare idea of it hurried me headlong into letting her know that i had noticed the change in her  lucilla i said has anything happened  what do you mean she asked coldly  i fancy i see some change i began  i dont understand you she answered walking away from me as she spoke  i said no more if our intimacy had been less close and less affectionate i might have openly avowed to her what was passing in my mind but how could i say to lucilla you are deceiving me it would have been the end of our sisterhoodthe end of our friendship when confidence is withdrawn between two people who love each othereverything is withdrawn they are on the footing of strangers from that moment and must stand on ceremony delicate minds will understand why i accepted the check she had administered to me and said no more  i went into the village alone managing matters so as to excite no surprise i contrived to have a little gossip about nugent with gootheridge at the inn and with the servant at browndown if nugent had returned secretly to dimchurch one of those two men in our little village must almost certainly have seen him neither of them had seen him  i inferred from this that he had not tried to communicate with her personally had he attempted it more cunningly and more safely by letter  i went back to the rectory it was close on the hour which i had appointed with lucillanow that the responsibility rested on my shouldersfor allowing her to use her eyes on taking off the bandage i noticed a circumstance which confirmed the conclusion at which i had already arrived her eyes deliberately avoided looking into mine suppressing as well as i could the pain which this new discovery caused me i repeated grosses words prohibiting her from attempting to look into a book or to use a pen until he had seen her again  there is no need for him to forbid me to do that she said  have you attempted it already i inquired  i looked into a little book of engravings she answered but i could distinguish nothing the lines all mingled together and swam before my eyes  have you tried to write i asked next i was ashamed of myself for laying that trap for heralthough the serious necessity of discovering whether she was privately in correspondence with nugent might surely have excused it  no she replied i have not tried to write  she changed color when she made that answer it is necessary to own that in putting my question i was too much excited to call to mind what i should have remembered in a calmer state there was no necessity for her trying to use her eyeseven if she was really carrying on a correspondence which she wished to keep secret from me zillah had been in the habit of reading her letters to her before i appeared at the rectory and she could write short notes as i have already mentioned by feeling her way on the paper with her finger besides having learnt to read by touch that is to say with raised characters just as she had learnt to writeeven if her eyes had been sufficiently recovered to enable her to distinguish small objects nothing but practice could have taught her to use them for purposes of correspondence  these considerations though they did not strike me at the time occurred to me later in the day and altered my opinion to a certain extent i now interpreted the change of color which i had noticed in her as the outward sign of suspicion on her sidesuspicion that i had a motive of my own in interrogating her for the rest my doubts of nugent remained unmoved try as i might i could not divest my mind of the idea that he was playing me false and that in one way or another he had contrived not only to communicate with lucilla but to persuade her to keep me in ignorance of what he had done  i deferred to the next day any attempt at making further discoveries  the last thing at night i had a momentary impulse to question zillah reflection soon checked it my experience of the nurses character told me that she would take refuge in flat denialand would then inform her mistress of what had happened i knew enough of lucilla to know after what had already passed between us that a quarrel with me would follow things were bad enough already without making them worse in that way when the morning came i resolved to keep a watchful eye on the village postoffice and on the movements of the nurse  when the morning came there was a letter for me from abroad  the address was in the handwriting of one of my sisters we usually wrote to each other at intervals of a fortnight or three weeks this letter had followed its predecessor after an interval of less than one week what did it mean good news or bad  i opened the letter  it enclosed a telegram announcing that my poor dear father was lying dangerously wounded at marseilles my sisters had already gone to him they implored me to follow them without one moment of needless delay is it necessary to tell the story of this horrible calamity of course it begins with a woman and an elopement of course it ends with a young man and a duel have i not told you alreadypapa was so susceptible papa was so brave oh dear dear the old story over again you have an english proverb what is bred in the bone etcetera etcetera let us drop the veil i mean let us end the chapter    chapter the fortyfirst  a hard time for madame pratolungo  ought i to have been prepared for the calamity which had now fallen on my sisters and myself if i had looked my own experience of my poor father fairly in the face would it not have been plain to me that the habits of a life were not likely to be altered at the end of a life surelyif i had exerted my intelligencei might have foreseen that the longer his reformation lasted the nearer he was to a relapse and the more obviously probable it became that he would fail to fulfill the hopeful expectations which i had cherished of his conduct in the future i grant it all but where are the pattern people who can exert their intelligencewhen their intelligence points to one conclusion and their interests to another ah my dear ladies and gentlemen there is such a fine strong foundation of stupidity at the bottom of our common humanityif we only knew it  i could feel no hesitationas soon as i had recovered myselfabout what it was my duty to do my duty was to leave dimchurch in time to catch the fast mailtrain from london to the continent at eight oclock that night  and leave lucilla  yes not even lucillas interestsdearly as i loved her alarmed as i felt about herwere as sacred as the interests which called me to my fathers bedside i had some hours to spare before it would be necessary for me to leave her all i could do was to employ those hours in taking the strictest precautions i could think of to protect her in my absence i could not be long parted from her one way or the other the miserable doubt whether my father would live or die would at his age soon be over  i sent for her to see me in my room and showed her my letter  she was honestly grieved when she read it for a momentwhen she spoke her few words of sympathythe painful constraint in her manner towards me passed away it returned again when i announced my intention of starting for france that day and expressed the regret i felt at being obliged to defer our visit to ramsgate for the present she not only answered restrainedly forming as i fancied some thought at the moment in her own mindshe left me with a commonplace excuse you must have much to think of in this sad affliction i wont intrude on you any longer if you want me you know where to find me with no more than those words she walked out of the room  i never remember at any other time such a sense of helplessness and confusion as came over me when she had closed the door i set to work to pack up the few things i wanted for the journey feeling instinctively that if i did not occupy myself in doing something i should break down altogether accustomed in all the other emergencies of my life to decide rapidly i was not even clear enough in my mind to see the facts as they were as to resolving on anything i was about as capable of doing that as the baby in mrs finchs arms  the effort of packing aided me to rally a littlebut did no more towards restoring me to my customary tone of mind  i sat down helplessly when i had done feeling the serious necessity of clearing matters up between lucilla and myself before i went away and still as ignorant as ever how to do it to my own indescribable disgust i actually felt tears beginning to find their way into my eyes i had just enough of pratolungos widow left in me to feel heartily ashamed of myself past vicissitudes and dangers in the days of my republican life with my husband had made me a sturdy walkerwith a gypsy relish like my little jicks for the open air i snatched up my hat and went out to see what exercise would do for me  i tried the garden no the garden was for some inscrutable reason not big enough i had still some hours to spare i tried the hills next  turning towards the left and passing the church i heard through the open windows the boomboom of reverend finchs voice catechizing the village children thank heaven he was out of my way at any rate i mounted the hills hurrying on as fast as i could the air and the movement cleared my mind after more than an hour of hard walking i returned to the rectory feeling like my old self again  perhaps there were some dregs of irresolution still left in me or perhaps there was some enervating influence in my affliction which made me feel more sensitively than ever the change in the relations between lucilla and myself having by this time resolved to come to a plain explanation before i left her unprotected at the rectory i shrank even yet from confronting a possible repulse by speaking to her personally taking a leaf out of poor oscars book i wrote what i wanted to say to her in a note  i rang the bellonce twice nobody answered it  i went to the kitchen zillah was not there i knocked at the door of her bedroom there was no answer the bedroom was empty when i looked in awkward as it would be i found myself obliged either to give my note to lucilla with my own hand or to decide on speaking to her after all  i could not prevail on myself to speak to her so i went to her room with my note and knocked at the door  here again there was no reply i knocked once morewith the same result i looked in there was no one in the room on the little table at the foot of the bed there lay a letter addressed to me the writing was in zillahs hand but lucilla had written her name in the corner in the usual way to show that she had dictated the letter to her nurse a load was lifted off my heart as i took it up the same idea i concluded had occurred to her which had occurred to me she too had shrunk from the embarrassment of a personal explanation she too had writtenand was keeping out of the way until her letter had spoken for her and had united us again as friends before i left the house  with these pleasant anticipations i opened the letter judge what i felt when i found what it really contained    dear madame pratolungoyou will agree with me that it is very important after what herr grosse has said about the recovery of my sight that my visit to ramsgate should not be delayed as you are unable through circumstances which i sincerely regret to accompany me to the seaside i have determined to go to london to my aunt miss batchford and to ask her to be my companion instead of you i have had experience enough of her sincere affection for me to be quite sure that she will gladly take the charge of me off your hands as no time is to be lost i start for london without waiting for your return from your walk to wish you goodbye you so thoroughly understand the necessity of dispensing with formal farewells in cases of emergency that i am sure you will not feel offended at my taking leave of you in this way with best wishes for your fathers recovery believe me  yours very truly  lucilla  p syou need be under no apprehension about me zillah goes with me as far as london and i shall communicate with herr grosse when i arrive at my aunts house    but for one sentence in it i should most assuredly have answered this cruel letter by instantly resigning my situation as lucillas companion  the sentence to which i refer contained the words which cast in my teeth the excuses that i had made for oscars absence the sarcastic reference to my recent connection with a case of emergency and to my experience of the necessity of dispensing with formal farewells removed my last lingering doubts of nugents treachery i now felt not suspicion only but positive conviction that he had communicated with her in his brothers name and that he had contrived by some means at which it was impossible for me to guess so to work on lucillas mindso to excite that indwelling distrust which her blindness had rooted in her characteras to destroy her confidence in me for the time being  arriving at this conclusion i could still feel compassionately and generously towards lucilla far from blaming my poor deluded sisterfriend for her cruel departure and her yet crueler letter i laid the whole fault on the shoulders of nugent full as my mind was of my own troubles i could still think of the danger that threatened lucilla and of the wrong that oscar had suffered i could still feel the old glow of my resolution to bring them together again and still remember and determine to pay the debt i owed to nugent dubourg  in the turn things had taken and with the short time still at my disposal what was i to do next assuming that miss batchford would accompany her niece to ramsgate how could i put the necessary obstacle in nugents way if he attempted to communicate with lucilla at the seaside in my absence  it was impossible for me to decide this unless i first knew whether miss batchford as a member of the family was to be confidentially informed of the sad position in which oscar and lucilla now stood towards each other  the person to consult in this difficulty was the rector as head of the household and in my absence the responsibility evidently rested with reverend finch  i went round at once to the other side of the house if mr finch had returned to the rectory after the catechizing was over well and good if not i should be obliged to inquire in the village and seek him at the cottages of his parishioners his magnificent voice relieved me from all anxiety on this head the boomboom which i had last heard in the church i now heard again in the study  when i entered the room mr finch was on his legs highly excited haranguing mrs finch and the baby ensconced as usual in a corner my appearance on the scene diverted his flow of language for the moment so that it all poured itself out on my unlucky self if you recollect that the rector and lucillas aunt had been from time immemorial on the worst of termsyou will be prepared for what is coming if you have forgotten this look back at my sixth chapter and refresh your memory  the very person i was going to send for said the pope of dimchurch dont excite mrs finch dont speak to mrs finch you shall hear why directly address yourself exclusively to me be calm madame pratolungo you dont know what has happened i am here to tell you  i ventured to stop him mentioning that lucillas letter had informed me of his daughters sudden departure for her aunts house mr finch waved away my answer with his hand as something too infinitely unimportant to be worthy of a moments notice  yes yes yes he said you have a superficial acquaintance with the facts but you are far from being aware of what my daughters sudden removal of herself from my roof really means now dont be frightened madame pratolungo and dont excite mrs finch how are you my dear how is the child both well thanks to an overruling providence both well now madame pratolungo attend to this my daughters flighti say flight advisedly it is nothing lessmy daughters flight from my house means i entreat you to be calmmeans another blow dealt at me by the family of my first wife dealt at me repeated mr finch heating himself with the recollection of his old feud with the batchfordsdealt at me by miss batchford by lucillas aunt madame pratolungo through my unoffending second wife and my innocent childare you sure you are well my dear are you sure the infant is well thank providenceconcentrate your attention madame pratolungo your attention is wandering prompted by miss batchford my daughter has left my roof ramsgate is a mere excuse and how has she left it not only without first seeing mei am nobody but without showing the slightest sympathy for mrs finchs maternal situation attired in her traveling costume my daughter precipitately entered or to use my wifes graphic expression bounced into the nursery while mrs finch was administering maternal sustenance to the infant under circumstances which might have touched the heart of a bandit or a savage my unnatural daughter remind me mrs finch we will have a little shakespeare tonight i will read king lear my unnatural daughter announced without one word of preparation that a domestic affliction would prevent you from accompanying her to ramsgategrieved dear madame pratolungo to hear of it cast your burden on providence bear up mrs finch bear uphaving startled my wife with this harrowing news my daughter next shocked her by declaring that she was going to leave her fathers roof without waiting to bid her father goodbye the catching of a train you will observe was no doubt at miss batchfords instigation of more importance than the parental embrace or the pastoral blessing leaving a message of apology for me my heartless child i use mrs finchs graphic language againyou have fair very fair powers of expression mrs finchmy heartless child bounced out of the nursery to catch her train having for all she knew or cared administered a shock to my wife which might have soured the fountain of maternal sustenance at its source there is where the blow falls madame pratolungo how do i know that acid disturbance is not being communicated at this moment instead of wholesome nourishment between mother and child i shall prepare you an alkaline draught mrs finch to be taken after meals dont speak dont move give me your pulse i hold miss batchford accountable madame pratolungo for whatever happensmy daughter is a mere instrument in the hands of my first wifes family give me your pulse mrs finch i dont like your pulse come upstairs directly a recumbent position and another warm bathunder providence madame pratolungomay parry the blow would you kindly open the door and pick up mrs finchs handkerchief never mind the novelthe handkerchief  i seized my first opportunity of speaking again while mr finch was conducting his wife with his arm round her waist to the doorputting the question which i had been waiting to ask in this cautious form  do you propose to communicate sir either with your daughter or with miss batchford while lucilla is away from the rectory my object in venturing to ask  before i could state my object mr finch turned round turning mrs finch with him and surveyed me from head to foot with a look of indignant astonishment  is it possible you can see this double wreck said mr finch indicating his wife and child and suppose that i would communicate or sanction communication of any sort with the persons who are responsible for itmy dear can you account for madame pratolungos extraordinary question am i to understand do you understand that madame pratolungo is insulting me  it was useless to try to explain myself it was useless for mrs finch who had made several abortive efforts to put in a word or two on her own part to attempt to pacify her husband all the poor damp lady could do was to beg me to write to her from foreign parts im sorry youre in trouble and i should really be glad to hear from you mrs finch had barely time to say those kind wordsbefore the rector in a voice of thunder desired me to look at that double wreck and respect it if i did not respect himand with that walked himself his wife and his baby out of the room  having gained the object which had brought me into the study i made no attempt to detain him the little sense the man possessed at the best of times was completely upset by the shock which lucillas abrupt departure had inflicted on his high opinion of his own importance that he would end in being reconciled to his daughterbefore her next subscription to the household expenses fell duewas a matter of downright certainty but until that time came i felt equally sure that he would vindicate his outraged dignity by declining to hold any communication in person or in writing with ramsgate during the short term of my absence from england miss batchford would be left as ignorant of her nieces perilous position between the twinbrothers as lucilla herself to know this was to have gained the information that i wanted nothing was left but to set my brains to work at once and act on it  how was i to act on it  on the spur of the moment i could see but one way if grosse pronounced lucillas recovery to be complete before i returned from abroad the best thing i could do would be to put miss batchford in a position to reveal the truth in my placewithout running any risk of a premature discovery in other words without letting the old lady into the secret before the time arrived at which it could be safely divulged  this apparently intricate difficulty was easily overcome by writing two letters before i went away instead of one  the first letter i addressed to lucilla without any reference to her behavior to me i stated in the fullest detail and with all needful delicacy her position between oscar and nugent and referred her for proof of the truth of my assertions to her relatives at the rectory i leave it entirely to your discretion i added to write me an answer or not put the warning which i now give you to the proof and if you wonder why it has been so long delayed apply to herr grosse on whom the whole responsibility rests there i ended being resolved after the wrong that lucilla had inflicted on me to leave my justification to facts i confess i was too deeply wounded by her conductthough i did lay all the blame of it on nugentto care to say a word in my own defence  this letter sealed i wrote next to lucillas aunt  it was not an easy matter to address miss batchford the contempt with which she regarded mr finchs opinions in politics and religion was more than matched by the strong aversion which she felt for my republican opinions i have already mentioned far back in these pages that a dispute on politics between the tory old lady and myself ended in a quarrel between us which closed the doors of her house on me from that time forth knowing this i ventured on writing to her nevertheless because i also knew miss batchford to be apart from her furious prejudices a gentlewoman in the best sense of the word devotedly attached to her niece and quite as capable when that devotion was appealed to of doing justice to me apart from my furious prejudices as i was of doing justice to her writing in a tone of unaffected respect and appealing to her forbearance to encourage mine i requested her to hand my letter to lucilla on the day when the surgeon reported that all further necessity for his attendance had ceased in the interval before this happened i entreated miss batchford in her nieces interests to consider my letter as a strictly private communication adding that my sufficient reason for venturing to make this condition would be found in my letter to lucillawhich i authorized her aunt to read as soon as the time had arrived for opening it  by this means i had as i firmly believed taken the only possible way of preventing nugent dubourg from doing any serious mischief in my absence  whatever his uncontrolled infatuation for lucilla might lead him to do next he could proceed to no serious extremities until grosse pronounced her recovery to be complete on the day when grosse did that she would receive my letter and would discover for herself the abominable deception which had been practiced on her as to attempting to find nugent no idea of doing this entered my mind wherever he might be at home or abroad it would be equally useless to appeal to his honor again it would be degrading myself to speak to him or to trust him to expose him to lucilla the moment it became possible was the one thing to be done i was ready with my letters one enclosed in the other when good mr gootheridge with whom i had arranged previously called to drive me to brighton in his light cart the chaise which he had for hire had been already used to make the same journey by lucilla and the nurse and had not yet been returned to the inn i reached my train before the hour of starting and arrived in london with a sufficient margin of time to spare  resolved to make sure that no possible mischance could occur i drove to miss batchfords house and saw the cabman give my letter into the servants hands  it was a bitter moment when i found myself pulling down my veil in the fear that lucilla might be at the window and see me nobody was visible but the man who answered the door if pen ink and paper had been within my reach at the moment i think i should have written to her on my own account after all as it was i could only forgive her the injury she had done me from the bottom of my heart i forgave her and longed for the blessed time which should unite us again in the meanwhile having done everything that i could to guard and help her i was now free to give to oscar all the thoughts that i could spare from my poor misguided father  being bound for the continent i determined though the chances were a hundred to one against me to do all that i could in my painful position to discover the place of oscars retreat the weary hours of suspense at my fathers bedside would be lightened to me if i could feel that the search for the lost man was being carried on at my instigation and that from day to day there was a bare possibility of my hearing of him if there was no more  the office of the lawyer whom i had consulted during my previous visit to london lay in my way to the terminus i drove there next and was fortunate enough to find him still at business  no tidings had yet been heard of oscar the lawyer however proved to be useful by giving me a letter of introduction to a person at marseilles accustomed to conduct difficult confidential inquiries and having agents whom he could employ in all the great cities of europe a man of oscars startling personal appearance would be surely more or less easy to trace if the right machinery to do it could only be set at work my savings would suffice for this purpose to a certain extentand to that extent i resolved that they should be used when i reached my journeys end  it was a troubled sea on the channel passage that night i remained on deck accepting any inconvenience rather than descend into the atmosphere of the cabin as i looked out to sea on one side and on the other the dark waste of tossing waters seemed to be the fit and dreary type of the dark prospect that was before me on the trackless path that we were ploughing a faint misty moonlight shed its doubtful ray like the doubtful light of hope faintly flickering on my mind when i thought of the coming time    chapter the fortysecond  the story of lucilla told by herself  in my description of what lucilla said and did on the occasion when the surgeon was teaching her to use her sight it will be remembered that she is represented as having been particularly anxious to be allowed to try how she could write  the motive at the bottom of this was the motive which is always at the bottom of a womans conduct when she loves her one ambition is to present herself to advantage even in the most trifling matters before the man on whom her heart is fixed lucillas one ambition with oscar was this and no more  conscious that her handwritingthus far painfully and incompletely guided by her sense of touchmust present itself in sadly unfavorable contrast to the handwriting of other women who could see she persisted in petitioning grosse to permit her to learn to write with her eyes instead of her finger until she fairly wearied out the worthy germans power of resistance the rapid improvement in her sight after her removal to the seaside justified him as i was afterwards informed in letting her have her way little by little using her eyes for a longer and longer time on each succeeding day she mastered the serious difficulty of teaching herself to write by sight instead of by touch beginning with lines in copybooks she got on to writing easy words to dictation from that again she advanced to writing notes and from writing notes to keeping a journalthis last at the suggestion of her aunt who had lived in the days before penny postage when people kept journals and wrote long lettersin short when people had time to think of themselves and more wonderful still to write about it too  lucillas journal at ramsgate lies before me as i trace these lines  i had planned at first to make use of it so as to continue the course of my narrative without a check still writing in my own personas i have written thus far and as i propose to write again at the time when i reappear on the scene  but on thinking over it once more and after reading the journal again it strikes me as the wiser proceeding to let lucilla tell the story of her life at ramsgate herself adding notes of my own occasionally where they appear to be required variety freshness and realityi believe i shall secure them all three by following this plan why is history in general i know there are brilliant exceptions to the rule such dull reading because it is the narrative of events written at second hand now i will be anything else you please except dull you may say i have been dull already as i am an honest woman i dont agree with you there are some people who bring dull minds to their readingand then blame the writer for it i say no more  consider it as arranged then during my absence on the continent lucilla shall tell the story of events at ramsgate and i will sprinkle a few notes over it here and there signed p                       lucillas journal  east cliff ramsgate august 28tha fortnight today since my aunt and i arrived at this place i sent zillah back to the rectory from london her rheumatic infirmities trouble her tenfold poor old soul in the moist air of the seaside  how has my writing got on for the last week i am becoming a little better satisfied with it i use my pen more easily my hand is less like the hand of a backward child than it was i shall be able to write as well as other ladies do when i am oscars wife  noteshe is easily satisfied poor dear her improved handwriting is sadly crooked some of the letters embrace each other at close quarters like dear friends and some start asunder like bitter enemies this is not to reflect on lucillabut to excuse myself if i make any mistakes in transcribing the journal now let her go onp  oscars wife when shall i be oscars wife i have not so much as seen him yet somethingi am afraid a difficulty with his brotherstill keeps him on the continent the tone in which he writes continues to have a certain reserve in it which disquiets and puzzles me am i quite as happy as i expected to be when i recovered my sight not yet  it is not oscars fault if i am out of spirits every now and then it is my own fault i have offended my father and i sometimes fear i have not acted justly towards madame pratolungo these things vex me  it seems to be my fate to be always misunderstood my sudden flight from the rectory meant no disrespect to my father i left as i did because i was quite incapable of facing the woman whom i had once dearly lovedthinking of her as i think now it is so unendurable to feel that your confidence is lost in a person whom you once trusted without limit and to go on meeting that person every hour in the day with a smooth face as if nothing had happened the impulse to escape more meetings when i discovered that she had left the house for a walk was irresistible i should do it again if i was in the same position again i have hinted at this in writing to my father telling him that something unpleasant had happened between madame pratolungo and me and that i went away so suddenly on that account alone no use he has not answered my letter i have written since to my stepmother mrs finchs reply has informed me of the unjust manner in which he speaks of my aunt without the slightest reason for it he is even more deeply offended with miss batchford than he is with me  sad as this estrangement is there is one consolationso far as i am concerned it will not last my father and i are sure sooner or later to come to an understanding together when i return to the rectory i shall make my peace with him and we shall get on again as smoothly as ever  but how will it end between madame pratolungo and me  she has not answered the letter i wrote to her i begin to wish i had never written it or at least some of itthe latter part i mean i have heard absolutely nothing of her since she has been abroad i dont know when she will returnor if she will ever return to live at dimchurch again oh what would i not give to have this dreadful mystery cleared up to know whether i ought to fall down on my knees before her and beg her pardon or whether i ought to count among the saddest days of my life the day which brought that woman to live with me as companion and friend  have i acted rashly or have i acted wisely  there is the question which always comes to me and torments me when i wake in the night let me look again for the fiftieth time at least at oscars letter  notei copy the letter other eyes than hers ought to see it in this place it is nugent of course who here writes in oscars character and in oscars name you will observe that his good resolutions when he left me held out as far as parisand then gave way as followsp  my own dearesti have reached paris and have found my first opportunity of writing to you since i left browndown madame pratolungo has no doubt told you that a sudden necessity has called me to my brother i have not yet reached the place at which i am to meet him before i meet him let me tell you what the necessity which has parted us really is madame pratolungo no longer possesses my confidence when you have read on a little farther she will no longer possess yours  alas my love i must amaze you shock you grieve youi who would lay down my life for your happiness let me write it in the fewest words i have made a terrible discovery lucilla you have trusted madame pratolungo as your friend trust her no longer she is your enemy and mine  i suspected her some time since my worst suspicions have been confirmed  long ere this i ought to have told you what i tell you now but i shrink from distressing you to see a sad look on your dear face breaks my heart it is only when i am away from youwhen i fear the consequences if you are not warned of your dangerthat i can summon the courage to tear off the mask from that womans false face and show her to you as she really is it is impossible for me to enter into details in the space of a letter i reserve all particulars until we meet again and until i can produce what you have a right to ask forproof that i am speaking the truth  in the meanwhile i beg you to look back into your own thoughts to recall your own words on the day when madame pratolungo offended you in the rectory garden on that occasion the truth escaped the frenchwomans lipsand she knew it  do you remember what you said after she had followed you to browndown i mean after she had declared that you would have fallen in love with my brother if you had met him firstand after nugent at her instigation no doubt had taken advantage of your blindness to make you believe that you were speaking to me when you were smarting under the insult and when you had found out the trick what did you say  you said theseor nearly thesewords  she hated you from the first oscarshe took up with your brother directly he came here dont marry me at dimchurch find out some place that they dont know of they are both in a conspiracy together against you and against me take care of them take care of them  lucilla i echo your own words to you i return the warningthe prophetic warningwhich you unconsciously gave me in that past time i am afraid my unhappy brother loves youand i know for certain that madame pratolungo feels the interest in him which she has never felt in me what you said i say they are in a conspiracy together against us take care of them take care of them  when we meet again i shall be prepared to defeat the conspiracy till that time comesas you value your happiness and mine dont let madame pratolungo suspect that you have discovered her it is she i firmly believe who is to blame i am going to my brotheras you will now understandwith an object far different to the object which i put forward as an excuse to your false friend fear no dispute between nugent and me i know him i firmly believe i shall find that he has been tempted and misled i answernow that no evil influences are at work on himfor his acting like an honorable man and deserving your pardon and mine the excuse i have made to madame pratolungo will prevent her from interfering between us that was my one object in making it  keep me correctly informed of your movements and of hers i enclose an address to which you can write with the certainty that your letters will be forwarded  on my side i promise to write constantly once more dont trust a living creature about you with the secret which this letter reveals expect me back at the earliest possible moment to free youwith a husbands authorityfrom the woman who has so cruelly deceived usyours with the truest affection the fondest love  oscar  noteit is quite needless for me to dwell here on the devilish cunningi can use no other phrasewhich inspired this abominable letter look back to the twentyseventh and twentyeighth chapters and you will see how skillfully what i said in a moment of foolish irritation and what lucilla said when she too had lost her temper is turned to account to poison her mind against me we are made innocently to supply our enemy with the foundation on which he builds his plot for the rest the letter explains itself nugent still persists in personating his brother he guesses easily at the excuse i should make to lucilla for his absence and he gets over the difficulty of appearing to have confided his errand to a woman whom he distrusts by declaring that he felt it necessary to deceive me as to what the nature of that errand really was as the journal proceeds you will see how dexterously he works the machinery which his letter has set in motion all i need add here in the way of explanation isthat the delay in his arrival at ramsgate of which lucilla complains was caused by nothing but his own hesitation his sense of honoras i knew from discoveries made at a later timewas not entirely lost yet the lower he sank the harder his better nature struggled to raise him nothing positively nothing but his own remorse need have kept him at paris it is needless to say that he never stirred farther and never discovered the place of his brothers retreat after lucilla had informed him by letter that i had gone abroad and that she was at ramsgate with her aunt i have done let lucilla go on againp  i have read oscars letter once more  he is the soul of honor he is incapable of deceiving me i remember saying what he tells me i said and thinking it toofor the moment onlywhen i was beside myself with rage stillmay it not be possible that appearances have misled oscar oh madame pratolungo i had such a high opinion of you i loved you so dearlycan you have been unworthy of the admiration and affection that you once inspired in me  i quite agree with oscar that his brother is not to blame it is sad and shocking that mr nugent dubourg should have allowed himself to fall in love with me but i cannot help pitying him poor disfigured man i hope he will get a good wife how he must have suffered  it is impossible to endure any longer my present state of suspense oscar must and shall satisfy me about madame pratolungowith his own lips i shall write to him by this post and insist on his coming to ramsgate  august 29thi wrote to him yesterday to the address in paris my letter will be delivered tomorrow where is he when will he get it  notethat innocent letter did its fatal mischief it ended the struggle against himself which had kept nugent dubourg in paris on the morning when he received it he started for england here is the entry in lucillas journalp  august 31sta telegram for me at breakfasttime i am too happy to keep my hand steadyi am writing horribly it doesnt matter nothing matters but my telegram oh what a noble creature the man was who invented telegrams oscar is on his way to ramsgate    chapter the fortythird  lucillas journal continued  september 1st  i am composed enough to return to my journal and to let my mind dwell a little on all that i have thought and felt since oscar has been here  now that i have lost madame pratolungo i have no friend with whom i can talk over my little secrets my aunt is all that is kind and good to me but with a person so much older than i amwho has lived in such a different world from my world and whose ideas seem to be so far away from minehow can i talk about my follies and extravagances and expect sympathy in return my one confidential friend is my journali can only talk about myself to myself in these pages my position feels sometimes like a very lonely one i saw two girls telling all their secrets to each other on the sands todayand i am afraid i envied them  well my dear journal how did i feelafter longing for oscarwhen oscar came to me it is dreadful to own it but my book locks up and my book can be trusted with the truth i felt ready to cryi was so unexpectedly so horribly disappointed  no disappointed is not the word i cant find the word there was a momenti hardly dare write it it seems so atrociously wickedthere was a moment when i actually wished myself blind again  he took me in his arms he held my hand in his in the time when i was blind how i should have felt it how the delicious tingle would have run through me when he touched me nothing of the kind happened now he might have been oscars brother for all the effect he produced on me i have myself taken his hand since and shut my eyes to try and renew my blindness and put myself back completely as i was in the old time the same result still nothing nothing nothing  is it that he is a little restrained with me on his side he certainly is i felt it the moment he came into the roomi have felt it ever since  no it is not that in the old time when we were only beginning to love each other he was restrained with me but it made no difference then i was not the insensible creature in those days that i have become since  i can only account for it in one way the restoration of my sight has made a new creature of me i have gained a sensei am no longer the same woman this great change must have had some influence over me that i never suspected until oscar came here can the loss of my sense of feeling be the price that i have paid for the recovery of my sense of sight  when grosse comes next i shall put that question to him  in the meanwhile i have had a second disappointment he is not nearly so beautiful as i thought he was when i was blind  on the day when my bandage was taken off for the first time i could only see indistinctly when i ran into the room at the rectory i guessed it was oscar rather than knew it was oscar my fathers grey head and mrs finchs womans dress would no doubt have helped anybody in my place to fix as i did on the right man but this is all different now i can see his features in detailand the result is though i wont own it to any of them that i find my idea of him in the days of my blindnessoh so unlike the reality the one thing that is not a disappointment to me is his voice when he cannot see me i close my eyes and let my ears feel the old charm againso far  and this is what i have gained by submitting to the operation and enduring my imprisonment in the darkened room  what am i writing i ought to be ashamed of myself is it nothing to have had all the beauty of land and sea all the glory of cloud and sunshine revealed to me is it nothing to be able to look at my fellowcreaturesto see the bright faces of children smile at me when i speak to them enough of myself i am unhappy and ungrateful when i think of myself  let me write about oscar  my aunt approves of him she thinks him handsome and says he has the manners of a gentleman this last is high praise from miss batchford she despises the present generation of young men in my time she said the other day i used to see young gentlemen i only see young animals now wellfed wellwashed welldressed riding animals rowing animals betting animalsnothing more  oscar on his side seems to like miss batchford on better acquaintance when i first presented him to her he rather surprised me by changing color and looking very uneasy he is almost distressingly nervous on certain occasions i suppose my aunts grand manner daunted him  notei really must break in here her aunts grand manner makes me sick it is nothing between ourselves but a hooknose and a stiff pair of stays what daunted nugent dubourg when he first found himself in the old ladys presence was the fear of discovery he would no doubt have learnt from his brother that oscar and miss batchford had never met you will see if you look back that it was in the nature of things impossible they should have met but is it equally clear that nugent could find out beforehand that miss batchford had been left in ignorance of what had happened at dimchurch he could do nothing of the sorthe could feel no assurance of his security from exposure until he had tried the ground in his own proper person first the risk here was certainly serious enough to make even nugent dubourg feel uneasy and lucilla talks of her aunts grand manner poor innocent i leave her to go onp  as soon as my aunt left us together the first words i said to oscar referred of course to his letter about madame pratolungo  he made a little sign of entreaty and looked distressed  why should we spoil the pleasure of our first meeting by talking of her he said it is so inexpressibly painful to you and to me let us return to it in a day or two not now lucillanot now  his brother was the next subject in my mind i was not at all sure how he would take my speaking about it i risked a question however for all that he made another sign of entreaty and looked distressed again  my brother and i understand each other lucilla he will remain abroad for the present shall we drop that subject too let me hear your own newsi want to know what is going on at the rectory i have heard nothing since you wrote me word that you were here with your aunt and that madame pratolungo had gone abroad to her father is mr finch well is he coming to ramsgate to see you  i was unwilling to tell him of the misunderstanding at home i have not heard from my father since i have been here i said now you have come back i can write and announce your return and get all the news from the rectory  he looked at me rather strangelyin a way which led me to fear that he saw some objection to my writing to my father  i suppose you would like mr finch to come here he saidand then stopped suddenly and looked at me again  there is very little chance of his coming here i answered  oscar seemed to be wonderfully interested about my father very little chance he repeated why  i was obliged to refer to the family quarrelstill however saying nothing of the unjust manner in which my father had spoken of my aunt  as long as i am with miss batchford i said it is useless to hope that my father will come here they are on bad terms and i am afraid there is no prospect at present of their being friends again do you object to my writing home to say you have come to ramsgate i asked  i he exclaimed looking the picture of astonishment what could possibly make you think that write by all meansand leave a little space for me i will add a few lines to your letter  it is impossible to say how his answer relieved me it was quite plain that i had stupidly misinterpreted him oh my new eyes my new eyes shall i ever be able to depend on you as i could once depend on my touch  notei must intrude myself again i shall burst with indignation while i am copying the journal if i dont relieve my mind at certain places in it remark before you go any farther how skillfully nugent contrives to ascertain his exact position at ramsgateand see with what a fatal unanimity all the chances of his personating oscar without discovery declare themselves in his favor miss batchford as you have seen is entirely at his mercy she not only knows nothing herself but she operates as a check on mr finchwho would otherwise have joined his daughter at ramsgate and have instantly exposed the conspiracy on every side of him nugent is to all appearance safe i am away in one direction oscar is away in another mrs finch is anchored immovably in her nursery zillah has been sent back from london to the rectory the dimchurch doctor who attended oscar and who might have proved an awkward witness is settled in indiaas you will see if you refer to the twentysecond chapter the london doctor with whom he consulted has long since ceased to have any relations with his former patient as for herr grosse if he appears on the scene he can be trusted to shut his eyes professionally to all that is going on and to let matters take their course in the only interest he recognizesthe interest of lucillas health there is literally no obstacle in nugents wayand no sort of protection for lucilla except in the faithful instinct which persists in warning her that this is the wrong manthough it speaks in an unknown tongue will she end in understanding the warning before it is too late my friend this note is intended to relieve my mindnot yours all you have to do is to read on here is the journal i wont stand another moment in your wayp  september 2nda rainy day very little said that is worth recording between oscar and me  my aunt whose spirits are always affected by bad weather kept me a long time in her sittingroom amusing herself by making me exercise my sight oscar was present by special invitation and assisted the old lady in setting this new seeingsense of mine all sorts of tasks he tried hard to prevail on me to let him see my writing i refused it is improving as fast as it can but it is not good enough yet  i notice here what a dreadfully difficult thing it is to get backin such a case as mineto the exercise of ones sight  we have a cat and a dog in the house would it be credited if i was telling it to the world instead of telling it to my journal that i actually mistook one for the other todayafter seeing so well too as i do now and being able to write with so few false strokes in making my letters it is nevertheless true that i did mistake the two animals having trusted to nothing but my memory to inform my eyes which was which instead of helping my memory by my touch i have now set this right i caught up puss and shut my eyes oh that habit when shall i get over it and felt her soft fur so different from a dogs hair and opened my eyes again and associated the feel of the fur for ever afterwards with the sight of a cat  todays experience has also informed me that i make slow progress in teaching myself to judge correctly of distances  in spite of this drawback however there is nothing i enjoy so much in using my sight as looking at a great wide prospect of any kindprovided i am not asked to judge how far or how near objects may be it seems like escaping out of prison to look after having been shut up in my blindness at the view over the town and the bold promontory of the pier and the grand sweep of the sea beyondall visible from our windows  the moment my aunt begins to question me about distances she makes a toil of my pleasure it is worse still when i am asked about the relative sizes of ships and boats when i see nothing but a boat i fancy it larger than it is when i see the boat in comparison with a ship and then look back at the boat i instantly go to the other extreme and fancy it smaller than it is the setting this right still vexes me almost as keenly as my stupidity vexed me some time since when i saw my first horse and cart from an upper window and took it for a dog drawing a wheelbarrow let me add in my own defence that both horse and cart were figured at least five times their proper size in my blind fancy which makes my mistake i think not so very stupid after all  well i amused my aunt and what effect did i produce on oscar  if i could trust my eyes i should say i produced exactly the contrary effect on himi made him melancholy but i dont trust my eyes they must be deceiving me when they tell me that he looked in my company a moping anxious miserable man  or is it that he sees and feels something changed in me i could scream with vexation and rage against myself here is my oscarand yet he is not the oscar i knew when i was blind contradictory as it seems i used to understand how he looked at me when i was unable to see it now that i can see it i ask myself is this really love that is looking at me in his eyes or is it something else how should i know i knew when i had only my own fancy to tell me but now try as i may i cannot make the old fancy and the new sight serve me in harmony both together i am afraid he sees that i dont understand him oh dear dear why did i not meet my good old grosse and become the new creature that he has made me before i met oscar i should have had no blind memories and prepossessions to get over then i shall become used to my new self i hope and believe with timeand that will accustom me to my new impressions of oscarand so it may all come right in the end it is all wrong enough now he put his arm round me and gave me a little tender squeeze while we were following miss batchford down to the diningroom this afternoon nothing in me answered to it i should have felt it all over me a few months since  here is a tear on the paper what a fool i am why cant i write about something else  i sent my second letter to my father today telling him of oscars return from abroad and taking no notice of his not having replied to my first letter the only way to manage my father is not to take notice and to let him come right by himself i showed oscar my letterwith a space left at the end for his postscript while he was writing it he asked me to get something which happened to be upstairs in my room when i came back he had sealed the envelopeforgetting to show me his postscript it was not worth while to open the letter again he told me what he had written and that did just as well  notei must trouble you with a copy of what nugent really did write it shows why he sent her out of the room and closed the envelope before she could come back the postscript is also worthy of notice in this respectthat it plays a part in a page of my narrative which is still to come  thus nugent writes in oscars name and character to the rector of dimchurch i have already mentioned as you will see in the twentysecond chapter that a close similarity of handwriting was one among the other striking points of resemblance between the twins  dear mr finch  lucillas letter will have told you that i have come to my senses and that i am again paying my addresses to her as her affianced husband my principal object in adding these lines is to propose that we should forget the past and go on again as if nothing had happened  nugent has behaved nobly he absolves me from the engagements towards him into which i so rashly entered at our last interview before i left browndown most generously and amply he has redeemed his pledge to madame pratolungo to discover the place of my retreat and to restore me to lucilla for the present he remains abroad  if you favor me with a reply to this i must warn you to be careful how you write for lucilla is sure to ask to see your letter remember that she only supposes me to have returned to her after a brief absence from england caused by a necessity for joining my brother on the continent it will be also desirable to say nothing on the subject of my unfortunate peculiarity of complexion i have made it all right with lucilla and she is getting accustomed to me still the subject is a sore one and the less it is referred to the better  truly yours  oscar   unless i add a word of explanation here you will hardly appreciate the extraordinary skillfulness with which the deception is continued by means of this postscript  written in oscars character and representing nugent as having done all that he had promised me to do it designedly omits the customary courtesy of oscars style the object of this is to offend mr finchwith what end in view you will presently see the rector was the last man in existence to dispense with the necessary apologies and expressions of regret from a man engaged to his daughter who had left her as oscar had left herno matter how the circumstances might appear to excuse him the curt offhand postscript signed oscar was the very thing to exasperate the wound already inflicted on mr finchs selfesteem and to render it at least probable that he would reconsider his intention of himself performing the marriage ceremony in the event of his refusal what would happen a stranger entirely ignorant of which was nugent and which was oscar would officiate in his place do you see it now  but even the cleverest people are not always capable of providing for every emergency the completest plot generally has its weak place  the postscript as you have seen was a little masterpiece but it nevertheless exposed the writer to a danger which as the journal will tell you he only appreciated at its true value when it was too late to alter his mind finding himself forced for the sake of appearances to permit lucilla to inform her father of his arrival at ramsgate he was now obliged to run the risk of having that important piece of domestic news communicatedeither by mr finch or by his wifeto no less a person than myself you will remember that worthy mrs finch when we parted at the rectory had asked me to write to her while i was abroadand you will see after the hint i have given you that clever mr nugent is beginning already to walk upon delicate ground i say no more lucillas turn nowp  september 3rdoscar has i suppose forgotten something which he ought to have included in his postscript to my letter  more than two hours after i had sent it to the post he asked if the letter had gone for the moment he looked annoyed when i said yes but he soon recovered himself it mattered nothing he said he could easily write again talking of letters he added do you expect madame pratolungo to write to you this time it was he who referred to her i told him that there was not much chance after what had passed on her side and on mine of her writing to meand then tried to put some of those questions about her which he had once already requested me not to press yet for the second time he entreated me to defer the discussion of that unpleasant subject for the presentand yet with a curious inconsistency he made another inquiry relating to the subject in the same breath  do you think she is likely to be in correspondence with your father or your stepmother while she is out of england he asked  i should doubt her writing to my father i said but she might correspond with mrs finch  he considered a littleand then turned the talk to the topic of our residence at ramsgate next  how long do you stay here he inquired  it depends on herr grosse i answered i will ask him when he comes next  he turned away to the windowsuddenly as if he was a little put out  are you tired of ramsgate already i asked  he came back to me and took my handmy cold insensible hand that wont feel his touch as it ought  let me be your husband lucilla he whispered and i will live at ramsgate if you likefor your sake  although there was everything to please me in those words there was something that startled mei cannot describe itin his look and manner when he said them i made no answer at the moment he went on  why should we not be married at once he asked we are both of age we have only ourselves to think of  notealter his words as follows why should we not be married before madame pratolungo can hear of my arrival at ramsgateand you will rightly interpret his motives the situation is now fast reaching its climax of peril nugents one chance is to persuade lucilla to marry him before any discoveries can reach my ears and before grosse considers her sufficiently recovered to leave ramsgatep  you forget i answered more surprised than ever we have my father to think of it was always arranged that he was to marry us at dimchurch  oscar smilednot at all the charming smile i used to imagine when i was blind  we shall wait a long time i am afraid he said if we wait until your father marries us  what do you mean i asked  when we enter on the painful subject of madame pratolungo he replied i will tell you in the meantime do you think mr finch will answer your letter  i hope so  do you think he will answer my postscript  i am sure he will  the same unpleasant smile showed itself again in his face he abruptly dropped the conversation and went to play piquet with my aunt  all this happened yesterday evening i went to bed sadly dissatisfied with somebody was it with oscar or with myself or with both i fancy with both  today we went out together for a walk on the cliffs what a delight it was to move through the fresh briny air and see the lovely sights on every side of me oscar enjoyed it too all through the first part of our walk he was charming and i was more in love with him than ever on our return a little incident occurred which altered him for the worse and which made my spirits sink again  it happened in this manner  i proposed returning by the sands ramsgate is still crowded with visitors and the animated scene on the beach in the later part of the day has attractions for me after my blind life which it does not i dare say possess for people who have always enjoyed the use of their eyes oscar who has a nervous horror of crowds and who shrinks from contact with people not so refined as himself was surprised at my wishing to mix with what he called the mob on the sands however he said he would go if i particularly wished it i did particularly wish it so we went  there were chairs on the beach we hired two and sat down to look about us  all sorts of diversions were going on monkeys organs girls on stilts a conjurer and a troop of negro minstrels were all at work to amuse the visitors i thought the varied color and bustling enjoyment of the crowd with the bright blue sea beyond and the glorious sunshine overhead quite delightfuli declare i felt as if two eyes were not half enough to see with a nice old lady sitting near entered into conversation with me hospitably offering me biscuits and sherry out of her own bag oscar to my disappointment looked quite disgusted with all of us he thought my nice old lady vulgar and he called the company on the beach a herd of snobs while he was still muttering under his breath about the mixture of low people he suddenly cast a sidelook at some person or thingi could not at the moment tell whichand rising placed himself so as to intercept my view of the promenade on the sands immediately before me i happened to have noticed at the same moment a lady approaching us in a dress of a peculiar color and i pulled oscar on one side to look at her as she passed in front of me why do you get in my way i asked before he could answer the question the lady passed with two lovely children and with a tall man at her side my eyes looking first at the lady and the children found their way next to the gentlemanand saw repeated in his face the same blackblue complexion which had startled me in the face of oscars brother when i first opened my eyes at the rectory for the moment i felt startled againmore as i believe by the unexpected repetition of the blue face in the face of a stranger than by the ugliness of the complexion itself at any rate i was composed enough to admire the ladys dress and the beauty of the children before they had passed beyond my range of view oscar spoke to me while i was looking at them in a tone of reproach for which as i thought there was no occasion and no excuse  i tried to spare you he said you have yourself to thank if that man has frightened you  he has not frightened me i answeredsharply enough  oscar looked at me very attentively and sat down again without saying a word more  the goodhumoured old woman on my other side who had seen and heard all that had passed began to talk of the gentleman with the discolored face and of the lady and the children who accompanied him he was a retired indian officer she said the lady was his wife and the two beautiful children were his own children it seems a pity that such a handsome man should be disfigured in that way my new acquaintance remarked but still it dont matter much after all there he is as you see with a fine woman for a wife and with two lovely children i know the landlady of the house where they lodgeand a happier family you couldnt lay your hand on in all england that is my friends account of them even a blue face dont seem such a dreadful misfortune when you look at it in that lightdoes it miss  i entirely agreed with the old lady our talk seemed for some incomprehensible reason to irritate oscar he got up again impatiently and looked at his watch  your aunt will be wondering what has become of us he said surely you have had enough of the mob on the sands by this time  i had not had enough of it and i should have been quite content to have made one of the mob for some time longer but i saw that oscar would be seriously vexed if i persisted in keeping my place so i took leave of my nice old lady and left the pleasant sandsnot very willingly  he said nothing more until we had threaded our way out of the crowd then he returned without any reason for it that i could discover to the subject of the indian officer and to the remembrance which the strangers complexion must have awakened in me of his brothers face  i dont understand your telling me you were not frightened when you saw that man he said you were terribly frightened by my brother when you saw him  i was terribly frightened by my own imagination before i saw him i answered after i saw him i soon got over it  so you say he rejoined  there is something excessively provokingat least to mein being told to my face that i have said something which is not worthy of belief it was not a very becoming act on my part after what he had told me in his letter about his brothers infatuation to mention his brother i ought not to have done it i did it for all that  i say what i mean i replied before i knew what you told me about your brother i was going to propose to you for your sake and for his that he should live with us after we were married  oscar suddenly stopped he had given me his arm to lead me through the crowdhe dropped it now  you say that because you are angry with me he said  i denied being angry with him i declared once more that i was only speaking the truth  you really mean he went on that you could have lived comfortably with my brothers blue face before you every hour of the day  quite comfortablyif he would have been my brother too oscar pointed to the house in which my aunt and i are livingwithin a few yards of the place on which we stood  you are close at home he said speaking in an odd muffled voice with his eyes on the ground i want a longer walk we shall meet at dinnertime  he left mewithout looking up and without saying a word more  jealous of his brother there is something unnatural something degrading in such jealousy as that i am ashamed of myself for thinking it of him and yet what else could his conduct mean  noteit is for me to answer that question give the miserable wretch his due his conduct meant in one plain wordremorse the only excuse left that he could make to his own conscience for the infamous part which he was playing was thisthat his brothers personal disfigurement presented a fatal obstacle in the way of his brothers marriage and now lucillas own words lucillas own actions had told him that oscars face was no obstacle to her seeing oscar perpetually in the familiar intercourse of domestic life the torture of selfreproach which this discovery inflicted on him drove him out of her presence his own lips would have betrayed him if he had spoken a word more to her at that moment this is no speculation of mine i know what i am now writing to be the truthp  it is night again i am in my bedroomtoo nervous and too anxious to go to rest yet let me employ myself in finishing this private record of the events of the day  oscar came a little before dinnertime haggard and pale and so absent in mind that he hardly seemed to know what he was talking about no explanations passed between us he asked my pardon for the hard things he had said and the illtemper he had shown earlier in the day i readily accepted his excusesand did my best to conceal the uneasiness which his vacant preoccupied manner caused me all the time he was speaking to me he was plainly thinking of something elsehe was more unlike the oscar of my blind remembrances than ever it was the old voice talking in a new way i can only describe it to myself in those terms  as for his manner i know it used to be always more or less quiet and retiring in the old days but was it ever so hopelessly subdued and depressed as i have seen it today useless to ask in the bygone time i was not able to see it my past judgment of him and my present judgment of him have been arrived at by such totally different means that it seems useless to compare them oh how i miss madame pratolungo what a relief what a consolation it would have been to have said all this to her and to have heard what she thought of it in return  there is however a chance of my finding my way out of some of my perplexities at any rateif i can only wait till tomorrow  oscar seems to have made up his mind at last to enter into the explanations which he has hitherto withheld from me he has asked me to give him a private interview in the morning the circumstances which led to his making this request have highly excited my curiosity something is evidently going on under the surface in which my interests are concernedand possibly oscars interests too  it all came about in this way  on returning to the house after oscar had left me i found that a letter from grosse had arrived by the afternoon post my dear old surgeon wrote to say that he was coming to see meand added in a postscript that he would arrive the next day at luncheontime past experience told me that this meant a demand on my aunts housekeeping for all the good things that it could produce ah dear i thought of madame pratolungo and the mayonnaise will those times never come again wellat dinner i announced grosses visit adding significantly at luncheontime  my aunt looked up from her plate with a little startnot interested as i was prepared to hear in the serious question of luncheon but in the opinion which my medical adviser was likely to give of the state of my health  i am anxious to hear what mr grosse says about you tomorrow the old lady began i shall insist on his giving me a far more complete report of you than he gave last time the recovery of your sight appears to me my dear to be quite complete  do you want me to be cured aunt because you want to get away i asked are you weary of ramsgate  miss batchfords quick temper flashed at me out of miss batchfords bright old eyes  i am weary of keeping a letter of yours she answered with a look of disgust  a letter of mine i exclaimed  yes a letter which is only to be given to you when mr grosse pronounces that you are quite yourself again  oscarwho had not taken the slightest interest in the conversation thus farsuddenly stopped with his fork half way to his mouth changed color and looked eagerly at my aunt  what letter i asked who gave it to you why am i not to see it until i am quite myself again  miss batchford obstinately shook her head three times in answer to those three questions  i hate secrets and mysteries she said impatiently this is a secret and a mysteryand i long to have done with it that is all i have said too much already i shall say no more  all my entreaties were of no avail my aunts quick temper had evidently led her into committing an imprudence of some sort having done that she was now provokingly determined not to make bad worse nothing that i could say would induce her to open her lips on the subject of the mysterious letter wait till mr grosse comes tomorrow that was the only reply i could get  as for oscar this little incident appeared to have an effect on him which added immensely to the curiosity that my aunt had roused in me  he listened with breathless attention while i was trying to induce miss batchford to answer my questions when i gave it up he pushed away his plate and ate no more on the other hand though generally the most temperate of men he drank a great deal of wine both at dinner and after in the evening he made so many mistakes in playing cards with my aunt that she dismissed him from the game in disgrace he sat in a corner for the rest of the time pretending to listen while i was playing the pianoreally lost to me and my music buried fathoms deep in some uneasy thoughts of his own  when he took his leave he whispered these words in my ear anxiously pressing my hand while he spoke  i must see you alone tomorrow before grosse comes can you manage it  yes  when  at the stairs on the cliff at eleven oclock  on that he left me but one question has pursued me ever since does oscar know the writer of the mysterious letter i firmly believe he does tomorrow will prove whether i am right or wrong how i long for tomorrow to come    chapter the fortyfourth  lucillas journal continued  september 4th  i mark this day as one of the saddest days of my life oscar has shown madame pratolungo to me in her true colors he has reasoned out this miserable matter with a plainness which it is impossible for me to resist i have thrown away my love and my confidence on a false woman there is no sense of honor no feeling of gratitude or of delicacy in her nature and i once thought herit sickens me to recall it i will see her no more  notedid it ever occur to you to be obliged to copy out with your own hand this sort of opinion of your own character i can recommend the sensation produced as something quite new and the temptation to add a line or two on your own account to be as nearly as possible beyond mortal resistancep  oscar and i met at the stairs at eleven oclock as we had arranged  he took me to the west pier at that hour of the morning excepting a few sailors who paid no heed to us the place was a solitude it was one of the loveliest days of the season when we were tired of pacing to and fro we could sit down under the mellow sunshine and enjoy the balmy sea air in that pure light with all those lovely colors about us there was something to my mind horribly and shamefully out of place in the talk that engrossed ustalk that still turned hour after hour on nothing but plots and lies cruelty ingratitude and deceit  i managed to ask my first question so as to make him enter on the subject at oncewithout wasting time in phrases to prepare me for what was to come  when my aunt mentioned that letter at dinner yesterday i said i fancied that you knew something about it was i right  very nearly right he answered i cant say i knew anything about it i only suspected that it was the production of an enemy of yours and mine  not madame pratolungo  yes madame pratolungo  i disagreed with him at the outset madame pratolungo and my aunt had quarreled about politics any correspondence between thema confidential correspondence especiallyseemed to be one of the most unlikely things that could take place i asked oscar if he could guess what the letter contained and why it was not to be given to me until grosse reported that i was quite cured  i cant guess at the contentsi can only guess at the object of the letter he said  what is it  the object which she has had in view from the firstto place every possible obstacle in the way of my marrying you  what interest can she have in doing that  my brothers interest  forgive me oscar i cannot believe it of her  we were walking while these words were passing between us when i said that he stopped and looked at me very earnestly  you believed it of her when you answered my letter he said  i admitted that  i believed your letter i replied and i shared your opinion of her as long as she was in the same house with me her presence fed my anger and my horror of her in some way that i cant account for now she has left menow i have had time to thinkthere is something in her absence that pleads for her and tortures me with doubts if i have done right i cant explain iti dont understand it i only know that so it is  he still looked at me more and more attentively your good opinion of her must have been very firmly rooted to assert itself in this obstinate manner he said what can she have done to deserve it  if i had looked back through all my old recollections of her and had recalled them one by one it would only have ended in making me cry and yet i felt that i ought to stand up for her as long as i could i managed to meet the difficulty in this way  i will tell you what she did i said after i received your letter fortunately for me she was not very well that morning and she breakfasted in bed i had plenty of time to compose myself and to caution zillah who read your letter to me before we met for the first time that day on the previous day i had felt hurt and offended with her for the manner in which she accounted for your absence from browndown i thought she was not treating me with the same confidence which i should have placed in her if our positions had been reversed when i next saw her having your warning in my mind i made my excuses and said what i thought she would expect me to say under the circumstances in my excitement and my wretchedness i daresay i overacted my part at any rate i roused the suspicion in her that something was wrong she not only asked me if anything had happened she went the length of saying in so many words that she thought she saw a change in me i stopped it there by declaring that i did not understand her she must have seen that i was not telling the truth she must have known as well as i knew that i was concealing something from her for all that not one word more escaped her lips a proud delicacyi saw it as plainly in her face as i now see youa proud delicacy silenced her she looked wounded and hurt i have been thinking of that look since i have been here i have asked myself what did not occur to me at the time if a false woman who knew herself to be guilty would have behaved in that way surely a false woman would have set her wits against mine and have tried to lead me into betraying to her what discoveries i had really made oscar that delicate silence that wounded look will plead for her when i think of her in her absence i can not feel as satisfied as i once did that she is the abominable creature you declare her to be i know you are incapable of deceiving mei know you believe what you say but is it not possible that appearances have misled you can you really be sure that you have not made some dreadful mistake  without answering me he suddenly stopped at a seat under the stone parapet of the pier and signed to me to sit down by him i obeyed instead of looking at me he kept his head turned away looking out over the sea i could not make him out he perplexedhe almost alarmed me  have i offended you i asked  he turned towards me again as abruptly as he had turned away his eyes wandered his face was pale  you are a good generous creature he said in a confused hasty way let us talk of something else  no i answered i am too deeply interested in knowing the truth to talk of anything else  his color changed again at that his face flushed he gave a heavy sigh as one does sometimes when one is making a great effort  you will have it he said  i will have it  he rose again the nearer he was to telling me all that he had kept concealed from me thus far the harder it seemed to be to him to say the first words  do you mind walking on again he asked  i silently rose on my side and put my arm in his we walked on slowly towards the end of the pier arrived there he stood still and spoke those hard first wordslooking out over the broad blue waters not looking at me  i wont ask you to take anything for granted on my assertion only he began the womans own words the womans own actions shall prove her guilty  i interrupted him by a question  tell me one thing i said what first made you suspect her  you first made me suspect her by what you said of her at browndown he answered now carry your memory back to the time i have already mentioned in my letterwhen she betrayed herself to you in the rectory garden is it true that she said you would have fallen in love with nugent if you had met him first instead of me  it is true that she said it i answered at a moment i added when her temper had got the better of herand when mine had got the better of me  advance the hour a little he went on to the time when she followed you to browndown was she still out of temper when she made her excuses to you  no  did she interfere when nugent took advantage of your blindness to make you believe you were talking to me  no  was she out of temper then  i still defended her she might well have been angry i said she had made her excuses to me in the kindest manner and i had received them with the most unpardonable rudeness  my defence produced no effect on him he summed it up coolly so far she compared me disadvantageously with nugent and she allowed nugent to personate me in speaking to you without interfering to stop it in both these cases her temper excuses and accounts for her conduct very good we may or may not differ so far before we go farther let usif we canagree on one unanswerable fact which of us two brothers was her favorite from the first  about that there could be no doubt i admitted at once that nugent was her favorite and more than this i remembered accusing her myself of never having done justice to oscar from the first  notesee the sixteenth chapter and madame pratolungos remark warning you that you would hear of this circumstance againp  oscar went on  bear that in mind he said and now let us get to the time when we were assembled in your sittingroom to discuss the subject of the operation on your eyes the question before us as i remember it was this were you to marry me before the operation or were you to keep me waiting until the operation had been performed and the cure was complete how did madame pratolungo decide on that occasion she decided against my interests she encouraged you to delay our marriage  i persisted in defending her she did that out of sympathy with me i said  he surprised me by again accepting my view of the matter without attempting to dispute it  we will say she did it out of sympathy with you he proceeded whatever her motives might be the result was the same my marriage to you was indefinitely put off and madame pratolungo voted for that delay  and your brother i added took the other side and tried to persuade me to marry you first how can you reconcile that with what you have told me  he interposed before i could say more dont bring my brother into the inquiry he said my brother at that time could still behave like an honorable man and sacrifice his own feelings to his duty to me let us strictly confine ourselves for the present to what madame pratolungo said and did and let us advance again to a few minutes later on the same day when our little domestic debate had ended my brother was the first to go then you retired and left madame pratolungo and me alone in the room do you remember  i remembered perfectly  you had bitterly disappointed me i said you had shown no sympathy with my eagerness to be restored to the blessing of sight you made objections and started difficulties i recollect speaking to you with some of the bitterness that i feltblaming you for not believing in my future as i believed in it and hoping as i hopedand then leaving you and locking myself up in my own room  in those terms i satisfied him that my memory of the events of that day was as clear as his own he listened without making any remark and went on when i had done  madame pratolungo shared your hard opinion of me on that occasion he proceeded and expressed it in infinitely stronger terms she betrayed herself to you in the rectory garden she betrayed herself to me after you had left us together in the sittingroom her hasty temper again beyond all doubt i quite agree with you what she said to me in your absence she would never have said if she had been mistress of herself  i began to feel a little startled how is it that you now tell me of this for the first time i said were you afraid of distressing me  i was afraid of losing you he answered  hitherto i had kept my arm in his i drew it out now if his reply meant anything it meant that he had once thought me capable of breaking faith with him he saw that i was hurt  remember he said that i had unhappily offended you that day and that you have not heard yet what madame pratolungo had the audacity to say to me under those circumstances  what did she say to you  thisit would have been a happier prospect for lucilla if she had been going to marry your brother instead of marrying you i repeat literally those were the words  i could no more believe it of her than i could have believed it of myself  are you really sure i asked him can she have said anything so cruel to you as that  instead of answering me he took his pocketbook from the breastpocket of his coatsearched in itand produced a morsel of folded and crumpled paper he opened the paper and showed me some writing inside  is that my writing he asked  it was his writing i had seen enough of his letters since the recovery of my sight to feel sure of that  read it he said and judge for yourself  noteyou have made your acquaintance with this letter already in my thirtysecond chapter i had said those foolish words to oscar as you will find in my record of the time under the influence of a natural indignation which any other woman with a spark of spirit in her would have felt in my place instead of personally remonstrating with me oscar had as usual gone home and written me a letter of expostulation having on my side had time to cooland feeling the absurdity of our exchanging letters when we were within a few minutes walk of each otheri had gone straight to browndown on receiving the letter first crumpling it up and as i supposed throwing it into the fire after personally setting myself right with oscar i had returned to the rectory and had there heard that nugent had been to see me in my absence had waited a little while alone in the sittingroom and had gone away again when i tell you that the letter which he was now showing to lucilla was that same letter of oscars which i had as i believed destroyed you will understand that i had thrown it into the fender instead of into the fire and that i failed to see it in the fender on my return simply because nugent had seen it first and had taken it away with him these particulars are described in greater detail in the chapter to which i have referred the letter itself being there inserted at full length however i will save you the trouble of looking backi know how you hate troubleby transcribing literally what i find before me in the journal the original letter is pasted on the page i will copy it from the page for the second time am i not good to you what author by profession would do as much for you as this i am afraid i am praising myself let lucilla proceedp  i took the letter from him and read it at my request he has permitted me to keep it the letter is my justification for thinking of madame pratolungo as i now think of her i place it here before i write another line in my journal    madame pratolungoyou have distressed and pained me more than i can say there are faults and serious ones on my side i know i heartily beg your pardon for anything that i may have said or done to offend you i cannot submit to your hard verdict on me if you knew how i adore lucilla you would make allowances for meyou would understand me better than you do i cannot get your last cruel words out of my ears i cannot meet you again without some explanation of them you stabbed me to the heart when you said this evening that it would be a happier prospect for lucilla if she had been going to marry my brother instead of marrying me i hope you did not really mean that will you please write and tell me whether you did or not  oscar  my first proceeding after reading those lines was of course to put my arm again in his and to draw him as close to me as close could be my second proceeding followed in due time i asked naturally for madame pratolungos answer to that most affectionate and most touching letter  i have no answer to show you he said  you have lost it i asked  i never had it  what do you mean  madame pratolungo never answered my letter  i made him repeat thatonce twice was it not incredible that such an appeal could be made to any woman not utterly depravedand be left unnoticed twice he reiterated the same answer twice he declared on his honor that not a line of reply had been returned to him she was then utterly depraved no there was a last excuse left that justice and friendship might still make for her i made it  there is but one explanation of her conduct i said she never received the letter where did you send it to  to the rectory  who took it  my own servant  he may have lost it on the way and have been afraid to tell you or the servant at the rectory may have forgotten to deliver it  oscar shook his head quite impossible i know madame pratolungo received the letter  how  i found it crumpled up in a corner inside the fender in your sittingroom at the rectory  had it been opened  it had been opened she had received it she had read it and she had not thrown quite far enough to throw it into the fire now lucilla is madame pratolungo an injured woman and am i a man who has slandered her  there was another public seat a few paces distant from us i could stand no longer i went away by myself and sat down a dull sensation possessed me i could neither speak nor cry there i sat in silence slowly wringing my hands in my lap and feeling the last ties that still bound me to the onceloved friend of former days falling away one after the other and leaving us parted for life  he followed me and stood over mehe summed her up in stern quiet tones which carried conviction into my mind and made me feel ashamed of myself for having ever regretted her  look back for the last time lucilla at what this woman has said and done you will find that the idea of your marrying nugent is under one form or another always present to her mind present alike when she forgets herself and speaks in a rageor when she reflects and speaks with a purpose at one time she tells you that you would have fallen in love with nugent if you had seen him first at another time she stands by while nugent is personating me to you and never interferes to stop it on a third occasion she sees that you are offended with me and triumphs so cruelly in seeing it that she tells me to my face your prospect would have been a much happier one if you had been engaged to marry my brother instead of me she is asked in writing civilly and kindly asked to explain what she means by those abominable words she has had time to reflect since she spoke them and what does she do does she answer me no she contemptuously tosses my letter into the fireplace add to these plain facts what you yourself have observed nugent has all her admiration nugent is her favorite from the first she has always disliked and wronged me add to this again that nugent as i know for certain privately confessed to her that he was himself in love with you look at all these circumstancesand what plain conclusion follows i ask you once moreis madame pratolungo a slandered woman or am i right in warning you as you once warned me to beware of her  what could i do but own that he was right it was due to him and due to me to close my heart to her from that moment oscar sat down by me and took my hand  after my experience of her in the past he went on softly can you wonder that i dread what she may do in the future has no such thing ever happened as the parting of true lovers by treachery which has secretly undermined their confidence in each other is madame pratolungo not clever enough and unscrupulous enough to undermine our confidence and to turn against us to the wickedest purpose the influence which she already possesses at the rectory how do we know that she is not in communication with nugent at this moment  i stopped him therei could not endure it you have seen your brother i said you have told me that you and he understand each other what have you to dread after that  i have to dread madame pratolungos influence and my brothers infatuation for you he answered the promises which he has honestly made to me are promises which i cannot depend on when my back is turned and when madame pratolungo may be with him in my absence something under the surface is going on already i dont like that mysterious letter which is only to be shown to you on certain conditions i dont like your fathers silence he has had time to answer your letter has he done it he has had time to answer my postscript has he done it  those were awkward questions he had certainly left both our letters unansweredthus far still the next post might bring his reply i persisted in taking this view and i said so to oscar he persisted just as obstinately on his side  suppose we go on to the end of the week he said and still no letter from your father comes for you or for me will you admit then that his silence is suspicious  i will admit that his silence shows a sad want of proper consideration for you i replied  and there you will stop you wont see what i see the influence of madame pratolungo making itself felt at the rectory and poisoning your fathers mind against our marriage  he was pressing me rather hardly i did my best however to tell him honestly what was passing in my mind  i can see i said that madame pratolungo has behaved most cruelly to you and i believe after what you have told me that she would rejoice if i broke my engagement and married your brother but i can not understand that she is mad enough to be actually plotting to make me do it nobody knows better than she does how faithfully i love you and how hopeless it would be to attempt to make me marry another man would the stupidest woman living who looked at you two brothers knowing what she knows be stupid enough to do what you suspect madame pratolungo of doing  i thought this unanswerable he had his reply to it ready for all that  if you had seen more of the world lucilla he said you would know that a true love like yours is a mystery to a woman like madame pratolungo she doesnt believe in itshe doesnt understand it she knows herself to be capable of breaking any engagement if the circumstances encouraged herand she estimates your fidelity by her knowledge of her own nature there is nothing in her experience of you or in her knowledge of my brothers disfigurement to discourage such a woman from scheming to part us she has seen for herselfwhat you have already told methat you have got over your first aversion to him she knows that women as charming as you are have over and over again married men far more personally repulsive than my brother lucilla something which is not to be outargued and not to be contradicted tells me that her return to england will be fatal to my hopes if that return finds you and me with no closer tie between us than the tie that binds us now are these fanciful apprehensions unworthy of a man my darling worthy or not worthy you ought to make allowances for them they are apprehensions inspired by my love for you  under those circumstances i could make every allowance for himand i said so he moved nearer to me and put his arm round me  are we not engaged to each other to be man and wife he whispered  yes  are we not both of age and both free to do as we like  yes  would you relieve me from the anxieties under which i am suffering if you could  you know i would  you can relieve me  how  by giving me a husbands claim to you lucillaby consenting to marry me in london in a fortnights time  i started back and looked at him in amazement for the moment i was incapable of answering in any other way than that  i ask you to do nothing unworthy of you he said i have spoken to a relative of mine living near londona married ladywhose house is open to you in the interval before our wedding day when your visit has been prolonged over a fortnight only we can be married write home by all means to prevent them from feeling anxious about you tell them that you are safe and happy and under responsible and respectable carebut say no more as long as it is possible for madame pratolungo to make mischief between us conceal the place in which you are living the instant we are married reveal everything let all your friendslet all the world know that we are man and wife  his arm trembled round me his face flushed deep his eyes devoured me some women in my place might have been offended others might have been flattered as for mei can trust the secret to these pagesi was frightened  is it an elopement that you are proposing to me i asked  an elopement he repeated between two engaged people who have only themselves to think of  i have my father to think of and my aunt to think of i said you are proposing to me to run away from them and to keep in hiding from them  i am asking you to pay a fortnights visit at the house of a married ladyand to keep the knowledge of that visit from the ears of the worst enemy you have until you have become my wife he answered is there anything so very terrible in my request that you should turn pale at it and look at me in that frightened way have i not courted you with your fathers consent am i not your promised husband are we not free to decide for ourselves there is literally no reasonif it could be donewhy we should not be married tomorrow and you still hesitate lucilla lucilla you force me to own the doubt that has made me miserable ever since i have been here are you indeed as changed towards me as you seem do you really no longer love me as you once loved me in the days that are gone  he rose and walked away a few paces leaning over the parapet with his face in his hands  i sat alone not knowing what to say or do the uneasy sense in me that he had reason to complain of my treating him coldly was not to be dismissed from my mind by any effort that i could make he had no right to expect me to take the step which he had proposedthere were objections to it which any woman would have felt in my place still though i was satisfied of this there was an obstinate something in me which would take his part it could not have been my conscience surely which said to methere was a time when his entreaties would have prevailed on you there was a time when you would not have hesitated as you are hesitating now  whatever the influence was it moved me to rise from my seat and to join him at the parapet  you cannot expect me to decide on such a serious matter as this at once i said will you give me a little time to think  you are your own mistress he rejoined bitterly why ask me to give you time you can take any time you pleaseyou can do as you like  give me till the end of the week i went on let me be sure that my father persists in not answering either your letter or mine though i am my own mistress nothing but his silence can justify me in going away secretly and being married to you by a stranger dont press me oscar it isnt very long to the end of the week  something seemed to startle himsomething in my voice perhaps which told him that i was really distressed he looked round at me quickly and caught me with the tears in my eyes  dont cry for gods sake he said it shall be as you wish take your time we will say no more about it till the end of the week  he kissed me in a hurried startled way and gave me his arm to walk back  grosse is coming today he continued he mustnt see you looking as you are looking now you must rest and compose yourself come home  i went back with him feelingoh so sad and sore at heart my last faint hope of a renewal of my oncepleasant intimacy with madame pratolungo was at an end she stood revealed to me now as a woman whom i ought never to have knowna woman with whom i could never again exchange a friendly word i had lost the companion with whom i had once been so happy and i had pained and disappointed oscar my life has never looked so wretched and so worthless to me as it looked today on the pier at ramsgate  he left me at the door with a gentle encouraging pressure of my hand  i will call again later he said and hear what grosses report of you is before he goes back to london rest lucillarest and compose yourself  a heavy footstep sounded suddenly behind us as he spoke we both turned round time had slipped by more rapidly than we had thought there stood herr grosse just arrived on foot from the railway station  his first look at me seemed to startle and disappoint him his eyes stared into mine through his spectacles with an expression of surprise and anxiety which i had never seen in them before then he turned his head and looked at oscar with a sudden changea change unpleasantly suggestive to my fancy of anger or distrust not a word fell from his lips oscar was left to break the awkward silence he spoke to grosse  i wont disturb you and your patient now he said i will come back in an hours time  no you will come in along with me if you please i have something my young gentlemans that i may want to say to you he spoke with a frown on his bushy eyebrows and pointed in a very peremptory manner to the housedoor  oscar rang the bell at the same moment my aunt hearing us outside appeared on the balcony above the door  good morning mr grosse she said i hope you find lucilla looking her best only yesterday i expressed my opinion that she was quite well again  grosse took off his hat sulkily to my aunt and looked back again at melooked so hard and so long that he began to confuse me  your aunts opinions is not my opinions he growled close at my ear i dont like the looks of you miss go in  the servant was waiting for us at the open door i went an without making any answer grosse waited to see oscar enter the house before him oscars face darkened as he joined me in the hall he looked half angry half confused grosse pushed himself roughly between us and gave me his arm i went upstairs with him wondering what it all meant    chapter the fortyfifth  lucillas journal concluded  september 4th continued  arrived in the drawingroom grosse placed me in a chair near the window he leaned forward and looked at me close he drew back and looked at me from a distance he took out his magnifying glass and had a long stare through it at my eyes he felt my pulse dropped my wrist as if it disgusted him and turning to the window looked out in grim silence without taking the slightest notice of any one in the room  my aunt was the first person who spoke under these discouraging circumstances  mr grosse she said sharply have you nothing to tell me about your patient today do you find lucilla  he turned suddenly round from the window and interrupted miss batchford without the slightest ceremony  i find her gone back back back he growled getting louder and louder at each repetition of the word when i sent her here i saidkeep her comfortableeasy you have not kept her comfortableeasy something has turned her poor little mind topsyturvies what is it who is it he looked fiercely backwards and forwards between oscar and my auntthen turned my way and putting his heavy hands on my shoulders looked down at me with an odd angry kind of pity in his face my childs is melancholick my childs is ill he went on where is our gootdear pratolungo what did you tell me about her my littlelofe when i last saw you you said she had gone aways to see her papa send a telegramsand say i want pratolungo here  at the repetition of madame pratolungos name miss batchford rose to her feet and stood apparently several inches higher than usual  am i to understand sir inquired the old lady that your extraordinary language is intended to cast a reproach on my conduct towards my niece  you are to understand this madam in the face of the goot seaairs miss your niece is fretting herself ill i sent her to this place for to get a rosy face for to put on a firm flesh how do i find her she has got nothing she has put on nothingshe is emphatically flabbypale in this fine airs she can be flabbypale but for one reason she is fretting herself about something or anodder is fretting herself goot for her eyes hodamndamn it is as bad for her eyes as bad can be if you can do no better than this take her aways back again you are wasting your moneys in this lodgment here  my aunt addressed herself to me in her grandest manner  you will understand lucilla that it is impossible for me to notice such language as this in any other way than by leaving the room if you can bring mr grosse to his senses inform him that i will receive his apologies and explanations in writing pronouncing these lofty words with her severest emphasis miss batchford rose another inch and sailed majestically out of the room  grosse took no notice of the offended lady he only put his hands in his pockets and looked out of window once more as the door closed oscar left the corner in which he had seated himself not overgraciously when we entered the room  am i wanted here he asked  grosse was on the point of answering the question even less amiably than it had been putwhen i stopped him by a look i want to speak to you i whispered in his ear he nodded and turning sharply to oscar put this question to him  are you living in the house  i am staying at the hotel at the corner  go to the hotel and wait there till i come to you  greatly to my surprise oscar submitted to be treated in this peremptory manner he took his leave of me silently and left the room grosse drew a chair close to mine and sat down by me in a comforting confidential fatherly way  now my gootgirls he said what have you been fretting yourself about since i was last in this house open it all if you please to papa grosse come beginbegin  i suppose he had exhausted his illtemper on my aunt and oscar he said those wordsmore than kindlyalmost tenderly his fierce eyes seemed to soften behind his spectacles he took my hand and patted it to encourage me  there are some things written in these pages of mine which it was of course impossible for me to confide to him with those necessary reservationsand without entering on the painful subject of my altered relations with madame pratolungoi owned quite frankly how sadly changed i felt myself to be towards oscar and how much less happy i was with him in consequence of the change i am not ill as you suppose i explained i am only disappointed in myself and a little downhearted when i think of the future having opened it to him in this way i thought it time to put the question which i had determined to ask when i next saw him  the restoration of my sight i said has made a new being of me in gaining the sense of seeing have i lost the sense of feeling which i had when i was blind i want to know if it will come back when i have got used to the novelty of my position i want to know if i shall ever enjoy oscars society again as i used to enjoy it in the old days before you cured methe happy days papagrosse when i was an object of pity and when all the people spoke of me as poor miss finch  i had more to saybut at this place grosse without meaning it i am sure suddenly stopped me to my amazement he let go of my hand and turned his face away sharply as if he resented my looking at him his big head sank on his breast he lifted his great hairy hands shook them mournfully and let them fall on his knees this strange behavior and the still stranger silence which accompanied it made me so uneasy that i insisted on his explaining himself what is the matter with you i said why dont you answer me  he roused himself with a start and put his arm round me with a wonderful gentleness for a man who was so rough at other times  it is nothing my pretty lofe he said i am out of sort as you call it your english climates sometimes gives your english blue devil to foreign mens like me i have got him nowan english blue devil in a german inside soh i shall go and walk him out and come back emptycheerful and see you again he rose after this curious explanation and attempted some sort of answera very odd oneto the question which i had asked of him as to that odder thing he went on yesindeedyes you have hit your nail on his head it is as you say your seeings which has got in the way of your feelings when your seeingsfeelings has got used to one anodder your seeings will stay where he is your feelings will come back to where they was one will balance the odder you will feel as you did you will see as you didnt all at the same times all jollynice again as before you have my opinions now let me walk out my blue devil i swear to come back again with a new inside bybyemyfeenchgoodbye  saying all this in a violent hurry as if he was eager to get away he gave me a kiss on the forehead snatched up his shabby hat and ran out of the room  what did it mean  does he persist in thinking me seriously ill i am too weary to puzzle my brains in the effort to understand my dear old surgeon it is one oclock in the morning and i have still to write the story of all that happened later in the day my eyes are beginning to ache and strange to say i have hardly been able to see the last two or three lines i have written they look as if the ink was fading from them if grosse knew what i am about at this moment his last words to me when he went back to his patients in london wereno more readings no more writings till i come again it is all very well to talk in that way i have got so used to my journal that i cant do without it nevertheless i must stop nowfor the best of reasons though i have got three lighted candles on my table i really cannot see to write any more  to bed to bed  notei have purposely abstained from interrupting lucillas journal until my extracts from it had reached this place here the writer pauses and gives me a chance and here there are matters that must be mentioned of which she had personally no knowledge at the time  you have seen how her faithful instinct still tries to reveal to my poor darling the cruel deception that is being practiced on herand still tries in vain in spite of herself she shrinks from the man who is tempting her to go away with himthough he pleads in the character of her betrothed husband in spite of herself she detects the weak places in the case which nugent has made out against methe absence of sufficient motive for the conduct of which he accuses me and the utter improbability of my plotting and intriguing without anything to gain by it to make her marry the man who was not the man of her choice she feels these hesitations and difficulties but what they really signify it is morally impossible for her to guess  thus far no doubt her strange and touching position has been plainly revealed to you but can i feel quite so sure that you understand how seriously she has been affected by the anxiety disappointment and suspense which have combined together to torture her at this critical interval in her life  i doubt it for the sufficient reason that you have only had her journal to enlighten you and that her journal shows she does not understand it herself as things are it seems to be time for me to step on the stage and to discover to you plainly what her surgeon really thought of her by telling you what passed between grosse and nugent when the german presented himself at the hotel  i am writing now as a matter of course from information given to me at an afterperiod by the persons themselves as to particulars the accounts vary as to results they both agree  the discovery that nugent was at ramsgate necessarily took grosse by surprise with his previous knowledge however of the situation of affairs at dimchurch he could be at no loss to understand in what character nugent had presented himself to lucilla and he could certainly not fail to understandafter what he had seen and what she had herself told himthat the deception was under present circumstances producing the worst possible effect on her mind arriving at this conclusion he was not a man to hesitate about the duty that lay before him when he entered the room at the hotel in which nugent was waiting he announced the object of his visit in these four plain words as follows  pack up and go  nugent coolly offered him a chair and asked what he meant  grosse refused the chairbut consented to explain himself in terms variously reported by the two parties combining the statements and translating grosse in this grave matter into plain english i find that the german must have expressed himself in these or nearly in these words  as a professional man mr nugent i invariably refuse to enter into domestic considerations connected with my patients with which i have nothing to do in the case of miss finch my business is not with your family complications my business is to secure the recovery of the young ladys sight if i find her health improving i dont inquire how or why no matter what private and personal frauds you may be practicing upon her i have nothing to say to themmore i am ready to take advantage of them myselfso long as their influence is directly beneficial in keeping her morally and physically in the condition in which i wish her to be but the instant i discover that this domestic conspiracy of yoursthis personation of your brother which once quieted and comforted heris unfavorably affecting her health of body and her peace of mind i interfere between you in the character of her medical attendant and stop it on medical grounds you are producing in my patient a conflict of feeling whichin a nervous temperament like herscannot go on without serious injury to her health and serious injury to her health means serious injury to her eyes i wont have thati tell you plainly to pack up and go i meddle with nothing else after what you have yourself seen i leave you to decide whether you will restore your brother to miss finch or not all i say is go make any excuse you like but go before you have done more mischief you shake your head is that a sign that you refuse take a day to think before you make up your mind i have patients in london to whom i am obliged to go back but the day after tomorrow i shall return to ramsgate if i find you still here i shall tell miss finch you are no more oscar dubourg than i am in her present state i see less danger in giving her even that serious shock than in leaving her to the slow torment of mind which you are inflicting by your continued presence in this place my last word is said i go back by the next train in an hours time good morning mr nugent if you are a wise man you will meet me at the station  after this the accounts vary nugents statement asserts that he accompanied grosse on his way back to miss batchfords lodging arguing the matter with him and only leaving him at the door of the house grosses statement on the other hand makes no allusion to this the disagreement between them is however of no consequence here it is admitted on either side that the result of the interview was the same when grosse took the train for london nugent dubourg was not at the station the next entry in the journal shows that he remained that day and night at least at ramsgate  you now know from the narrative of the surgeons own proceedings how seriously he thought of his patients case and how firmly he did his duty as a professional man having given you this necessary information i again retire and leave lucilla to take up the next link in the chain of eventsp  september 5th six oclock in the morninga few hours of restless broken sleepdisturbed by horrid dreams and waking over and over again with startings that seemed to shake me from head to foot i can bear it no longer the sun is rising i have got upand here i am at the writingtable trying to finish the long story of yesterday still uncompleted in my journal  i have just been looking at the view from my windowand i notice one thing which has struck me the mist this morning is the thickest mist i have yet seen here  the seaview is almost invisible it is so dim and dull even the objects about me in my room are nothing like so plain as usual the mist is stealing in no doubt through my open window it gets between me and my paper and obliges me to bend down close over the page to see what i am about when the sun is higher things will be clear again in the meantime i must do as well as i can  grosse came back after his walk as mysterious as ever  he was quite peremptory in ordering me not to overtask my eyesforbidding reading and writing as i have already mentioned but when i asked for his reasons he had for the first time in my experience of him no reasons to give i have the less scruple about disobeying him on that account still i am a little uneasy i confess when i think of his strange behavior yesterday he looked at me in the oddest wayas if he saw something in my face which he had never seen before twice he took his leave and twice he returned doubtful whether he would not remain at ramsgate and let his patients in london take care of themselves his extraordinary indecision was put an end to at last by the arrival of a telegram which had followed him from london an urgent message i suppose from one of the patients he went away in a bad temper and a violent hurry and told me at the door to expect him back on the sixth  when oscar came later there was another surprise for me  like grosse he was not himselfhe too behaved strangely first he was so cold and so silent that i thought he was offended then he went straight to the other extreme and became so loudly talkative so obstreperously cheerful that my aunt asked me privately whether i did not suspect as she did that he had been taking too much wine it ended in his trying to sing to my accompaniment on the piano and in his breaking down he walked away to the other end of the room without explanation or apology when i followed him there a little while after he had a look that indescribably distressed mea look as if he had been crying towards the end of the evening my aunt fell asleep over her book and gave us a chance of speaking to each other in a little second room which opens out of the drawingroom in this house it was i who took the chancenot he he was so incomprehensibly unwilling to go into the room and speak to me that i had to do a very unladylike thing i mean that i had to take his arm and lead him in myself and entreat him in a whisper to tell me what was the matter with him  only the old complaint he answered  i made him sit down by me on a little couch that just held two  what do you mean by the old complaint i asked  oh you know  i dont know  you would know if you really loved me  oscar it is a shame to say that it is a shame to doubt that i love you  is it ever since i have been here i have doubted that you love me it is getting to be an old complaint of mine now i still suffer a little sometimes dont notice it  he was so cruel and so unjust that i got up to leave him without saying a word more but oh he looked so forlorn and so submissivesitting with his head down and his hands crossed listlessly over his kneesthat i could not find it in my heart to treat him harshly was i wrong i dont know i have no idea how to manage menand no madame pratolungo now to teach me right or wrong it ended in my sitting down by him again in the place which i had just left  you ought to beg my pardon i said for thinking of me as you think and talking to me as you talk  i do beg your pardon he answered humbly i am sorry if i have offended you  how could i resist that i put my hand on his shoulder and tried to make him lift up his head and look at me  you will always believe in me in the future i went on promise me that  i can promise to try lucilla as things are now i can promise no more  as things are now you are speaking in riddles tonight explain yourself  i explained myself this morning on the pier  surely this was hard on meafter he had promised to give me till the end of the week to consider his proposal i took my hand off his shoulder hewho never used to displease or disappoint me when i was blindhad displeased and disappointed me for the second time in a few minutes  do you wish to force me i asked after telling me this morning that you would give me time to reflect  he rose on his sidelanguidly and mechanically like a man who neither knew nor cared what he was doing  force you he repeated did i say that i dont know what i am talking about i dont know what i am doing you are right and i am wrong i am a miserable wretch lucillai am utterly unworthy of you it would be better for you if you never saw me again he paused and taking me by both hands looked earnestly and sadly into my face good night my dear he saidand suddenly dropped my hands and turned away to go out  i stopped him going already i said it is not late yet  it is best for me to go  why  i am in wretched spirits it is better for me to be by myself  dont say that it sounds like a reproach to me  on the contrary it is all my fault good night  i refused to say good nighti refused to let him go his wanting to go was in itself a reproach to me he had never done it before i asked him to sit down again  he shook his head  for ten minutes  he shook his head again  for five minutes  instead of answering he gently lifted a long lock of my hair which hung at the side of my neck my head i should add had been dressed that evening on the oldfashioned plan by my aunts maidto please my aunt  if i stay for five minutes longer he said i shall ask for something  for what  you have beautiful hair lucilla  you cant want a lock of my hair surely  why not  i gave you a keepsake of that sortages ago have you forgotten it  notethe keepsake had of course been given to the true oscar and was then as it is now still in his possession notice when he recovers himself how quickly the false oscar infers this and how cleverly he founds his excuse upon itp  his face flushed deep his eyes dropped before mine i could see that he was ashamed of himselfi could only conclude that he had forgotten it a morsel of his hair was at that moment in a locket which i wore round my neck i had more i think to doubt him than he had to doubt me i was so mortified that i stepped aside and made way for him to go out  you wish to go away i said i wont keep you any longer  it was his turn now to plead with me  suppose i have been deprived of your keepsake he said suppose somebody whom i would rather not mention has taken it away from me  i instantly understood him his miserable brother had taken it my workbasket was close by i cut off a lock of my hair and tied it at each end with a morsel of my favorite lightblue ribbon  are we friends again oscar was all i said as i put it into his hand  he caught me in his arms in a kind of frenzyholding me to him so violently that he hurt me kissing me so fiercely that he frightened me before i had recovered breath enough to speak to him he had released me and had gone out in such headlong haste that he knocked down a little round table with books on it and woke my aunt  the old lady called for me in her most formidable voice and showed me the family temper in its sourest aspect grosse had gone back to london without making any apology to her and oscar had knocked down her books the indignation aroused by these two outrages called loudly for a victimand no one else being near at the moment selected me miss batchford discovered for the first time that she had undertaken too much in assuming the sole charge of her niece at ramsgate  i decline to accept the entire responsibility said my aunt at my age the entire responsibility is too much for me i shall write to your father lucilla i always did and always shall detest him as you know his views on politics and religion are in a clergyman simply detestable still he is your father and it is a duty on my part after what that rude foreigner has said about your health to offer to restore you to your fathers roofor at least to obtain your fathers sanction to your continuing to remain under my care this course in either case you will observe relieves me from the entire responsibility i am doing nothing to compromise my position my position is quite plain to me i should have formally accepted your fathers hospitality on the occasion of your weddingif i had been well enough and if the wedding had taken place it follows as a matter of course that i may formally report to your father what the medical opinion is of your health however brutally it may have been given it is a medical opinionand as such i am bound to communicate it  knowing but too well how bitterly my aunts aversion to him is reciprocated by my father i did my best to combat miss batchfords resolutionwithout making matters worse by telling her what my motives really were with some difficulty i prevailed on her to defer the proposed report of me for a day or twoand we parted for the night the old ladys fits of temper are soon over as good friends as usual  this little episode in my narrative of events diverted my mind for the time from oscars strange conduct yesterday evening but once up here by myself in my own room i have been thinking of it or dreaming of it such horrid dreamsi cannot write them down almost incessantly from that time to this when we meet again todayhow will he look what will he say  he was right yesterday i am cold to him there is some change in me towards him which i dont understand myself my conscience accuses me now i am aloneand yet god knows it is not my fault poor oscar poor me i have never longed to see himsince we met at this placeas i long now he sometimes comes to breakfast will he come to breakfast today oh how my eyes ache and how obstinately the mist stops in the room suppose i close the window and go back to bed again for a little while  nine oclockthe maid came in half an hour since and woke me she went to open the window as usual i stopped her  is the mist gone i asked  the girl stared what mist miss  havent you seen it  no miss  what time did you get up  at seven miss  at seven i was still writing in my journal and the mist was still over everything in the room persons in the lower ranks of life are curiously unobservant of the aspects of nature i never in the days of my blindness got any information from servants or laborers about the views round dimchurch they seemed to have no eyes for anything beyond the range of the kitchen or the ploughed field i got out of bed and took the maid myself to the window and opened it  there i said it is not quite so thick as it was some hours since but there is the mist as plain as can be  the girl looked backwards and forwards in a state of bewilderment between me and the view  mist she repeated begging your pardon miss its a beautiful clear morningas i see it  clear i repeated on my side  yes miss  do you mean to tell me its clear over the sea  the sea is a beautiful blue miss far and near you can see the ships  where are the ships  she pointed out of the window to a certain spot  there are two of them miss a big ship with three masts and a little ship just behind with one  i looked along her finger and strained my eyes to see all i could make out was a dim greyish mist with something like a little spot or blur on it at the place which the maids finger indicated as the position occupied by the two ships  the idea struck me for the first time that the dimness which i had attributed to the mist was in plain truth the dimness in my own eyes for the moment i was a little startled i left the window and made the best excuse that i could to the girl as soon as it was possible to dismiss her i sent her away and bathed my eyes with one of grosses lotions and then tried them again in writing this entry to my relief i can see to write better than i did earlier in the morning still i have had a warning to pay a little more attention to grosses directions than i have hitherto done is it possible that he saw something in the state of my eyes which he was afraid to tell me of nonsense grosse is not the sort of man who shrinks from speaking out i have fatigued my eyesthat is all let me shut up my book and go downstairs to breakfast  ten oclockfor a moment i open my journal again  something has happened which i must positively set down in the history of my life i am so vexed and so angry the maid wretched chattering fool has told my aunt what passed between us this morning at my window miss batchford has taken the alarm and has insisted on writing not only to grosse but to my father in the present embittered state of my fathers feelings against my aunt he will either leave her letter unanswered or he will offend her by an angry reply in either case i shall be the sufferer my aunts sense of injurywhich cannot address itself to my fatherwill find a convenient object to assail in me i shall never hear the last of it being already nervous and dispirited the prospect of finding myself involved in a new family quarrel quite daunts me i feel ungratefully inclined to run away from miss batchford when i think of it  no signs of oscar and no news of oscaryet  twelve oclockbut one trial more was wanted to make my life here quite unendurable the trial has come  a letter from oscar sent by a messenger from his hotel has just been placed in my hands it informs me that he has decided on leaving ramsgate by the next train the next train starts in forty minutes good god what am i to do  my eyes are burning i know it does them harm to cry how can i help crying it is all over between us if i let oscar go away alonehis letter as good as tells me so oh why have i behaved so coldly to him i ought to make any sacrifice of my own feelings to atone for it and yet there is an obstinate something in me that shrinkswhat am i to do what am i to do  i must drop the pen and try if i can think my eyes completely fail me i can write no more  notei copy the letter to which lucilla refers  nugents own assertion is that he wrote it in a moment of remorse to give her an opportunity of breaking the engagement by which she innocently supposed herself to be held to him he declares that he honestly believed the letter would offend her when he wrote it the other interpretation of the document is that finding himself obliged to leave ramsgateunder penalty if he remained of being exposed by grosse as an impostor when the surgeon visited his patient on the next daynugent seized the opportunity of making his absence the means of working on lucillas feelings so as to persuade her to accompany him to london dont ask me which of these two conclusions i favor for reasons which you will understand when you have come to the end of my narrative i would rather not express my opinion either one way or the other  read the letterand determine for yourselves  my darlingafter a sleepless night i have decided on leaving ramsgate by the next train that starts after you receive these lines last nights experience has satisfied me that my presence here after what i said to you on the pier only distresses you some influence that is too strong for you to resist has changed your heart towards me when the time comes for you to determine whether you will be my wife on the conditions that i have proposed i see but too plainly that you will say no let me make it less hard for you my love to do that by leaving you to write the wordinstead of saying it to me if you wish for your freedom cost me what it may i will absolve you from your engagement i love you too dearly to blame you my address in london is on the other leaf farewell  oscar  the address given on the blank leaf is at an hotel  a few lines more in the journal follow the lines last quoted in this place except a word or two here and there it is impossible any longer to decipher the writing the mischief done to her eyes by her reckless use of them by her fits of crying by her disturbed nights by the longcontinued strain on her of agitation and suspense has evidently justified the worst of those unacknowledged forebodings which grosse felt when he saw her the last lines of the journal are as writing actually inferior to her worst penmanship when she was blind  however the course which she ended in taking on receipt of the letter which you have just read is sufficiently indicated by a note of nugents writing left at miss batchfords residence at ramsgate by a porter from the railway afterevents make it necessary to preserve this note also it runs thus  madami write by lucillas wish to beg that you will not be anxious on discovering that your niece has left ramsgate she accompanies me at my express request to the house of a married lady who is a relative of mine and under whose care she will remain until the time arrives for our marriage the reasons which have led to her taking this step and which oblige her to keep her new place of residence concealed for the present will be frankly stated to you and to her father on the day when we are man and wife in the meantime lucilla begs that you will excuse her abrupt departure and that you will be so good as to send this letter on to her father both you and he will i hope remember that she is of an age to act for herself and that she is only hastening her marriage with a man to whom she has been long engaged with the sanction and approval of her familybelieve me madam your faithful servant  oscar dubourg  this letter was delivered at luncheontimealmost at the moment when the servant had announced to her mistress that miss finch was nowhere to be found and that her travelingbag had disappeared from her room the london train had then started miss batchford having no right to interfere decidedafter consultation with a friendon at once traveling to dimchurch and placing the matter in mr finchs handsp    chapter the fortysixth  the italian steamer  lucillas journal has told you all that lucilla can tell permit me to reappear in these pages shall i say with your favorite english clown reappearing every year in your barbarous english pantomime here i am again how do you do noi had better leave that out your clown is one of your national institutions with this mysterious source of british amusement let no foreign person presume to trifle  i arrived at marseilles as well as i can remember on the fifteenth of august  you cannot be expected to feel any interest in good papa i will pass over this venerable victim of the amiable delusions of the heart as rapidly as respect and affection will permit the duel i hope you remember the duel had been fought with pistols and the bullet had not been extracted when i joined my sisters at the sufferers bedside he was delirious and did not know me two days later the removal of the bullet was accomplished by the surgeon in attendance for a time he improved after this then there was a relapse it was only on the first of september that we were permitted to hope he might still be spared to us  on that date i was composed enough to think again of lucilla and to remember mrs finchs polite request to me that i would write to her from marseilles  i wrote briefly telling the damp lady of the rectory only at greater length what i have told here my main motive in doing this was i confess to obtain through mrs finch some news of lucilla after posting the letter i attended to another duty which i had neglected while my father was in danger of death i went to the person to whom my lawyer had recommended me to institute that search for oscar which i had determined to set on foot when i left london the person was connected with the police in the capacity as nearly as i can express it in english of a sort of private superintendentnot officially recognized but secretly trusted for all that  when he heard of the time that had elapsed without any discovery of the slightest trace of the fugitive he looked grave and declared honestly enough that he doubted if he could reward my confidence in him by proving himself to be of the slightest service to me seeing however that i was earnestly bent on making some sort of effort he put a last question to me in these termsyou have not described the gentleman yet is there by lucky chance anything remarkable in his personal appearance  there is something very remarkable sir i answered describe it exactly maam if you please  i described oscars complexion my excellent superintendent showed encouraging signs of interest as he listened he was a most elegantlydressed gentleman with the gracious manners of a prince it was quite a privilege to be allowed to talk to him  if the missing man has passed through france he said with such a remarkable face as that there is a fair chance of finding him i will set preliminary inquiries going at the railway station at the steampacket office and at the port you shall hear the result tomorrow  i went back to good papas bedsidesatisfied so far  the next day my superintendent honored me by a visit  any news sir i asked  news already maam the clerk at the steampacket office perfectly well remembers selling a ticket to a stranger with a terrible blue face unhappily his memory is not equally good as to other matters he cannot accurately call to mind either the name of the stranger or the place for which the stranger embarked we know that he must either have gone to some port in italy or to some port in the east and thus far we know no more  what are we to do next i inquired  i proposewith your permissionsending personal descriptions of the gentleman by telegraph to the different ports in italy first if nothing is heard of him in reply we will try the ports in the east next that is the course which i have the honor of submitting to your consideration do you approve of it  i cordially approved of it and waited for the results with all the patience that i could command  the next day passed and nothing happened my unhappy father got on very slowly the vile woman who had caused the disaster and who had run off with his antagonist was perpetually in his mind disturbing him and keeping him back why is a destroying wretch of this sort a pitiless treacherous devouring monster in female form allowed to be out of prison you shut up in a cage a poor tigress who only eats you when she is hungry and cant provide for her dear little children in any other wayand you let the other and far more dangerous beast of the two range at large under protection of the law ah it is easy to see that the men make the laws never mind the women are coming to the front wait a little the tigresses on two legs will have a bad time of it when we get into parliament  on the fourth of the month the superintendent wrote to me more news of the lost oscar already  the blue man had disembarked at genoa and had been traced to the station of the railway running to turin more inquiries had been thereupon sent by telegraph to turin in the meantime and in the possible event of the missing person returning to england by way of marseilles experienced men provided with a personal description of him would be posted at various public places to pass in review all travelers arriving either by land or seaand to report to me if the right traveler appeared once more my princely superintendent submitted this course to my considerationand waited for my approvaland got it with my admiration thrown in as part of the bargain  the days passedand good papa still vacillated between better and worse  my sisters broke down poor souls under their anxieties it all fell as usual on my shoulders day by day my prospect of returning to england seemed to grow more and more remote not a line of reply reached me from mrs finch this in itself fidgeted and disturbed me lucilla was now hardly ever out of my thoughts over and over again my anxiety urged me to run the risk and write to her but the same obstacle always raised itself in my way after what had happened between us it was impossible for me to write to her directly without first restoring myself to my former place in her estimation and i could only do this by entering into particulars which for all i knew to the contrary it might still be cruel and dangerous to reveal  as for writing to miss batchford i had already tried the old ladys patience in that way before leaving england if i tried it again with no better excuse for a second intrusion than my own anxieties might suggest the chances were that this uncompromising royalist would throw my letter in the fire and treat her republican correspondent with contemptuous silence grosse was the third and last person from whom i might hope to obtain information butshall i confess iti did not know what lucilla might have told him of the estrangement between us and my pride remember if you please that i am a povertystricken foreigner revolted at the idea of exposing myself to a possible repulse  however by the eleventh of the month i began to feel my suspense so keenly and to suffer under such painful doubts of what nugent might be doing in my absence that i resolved at all hazards on writing to grosse it was at least possible as i calculatedand the journal will show you i calculated rightthat lucilla had only told him of my melancholy errand at marseilles and had mentioned nothing more i had just opened my deskwhen our doctor in attendance entered the room and announced the joyful intelligence that he could answer at last for the recovery of good papa  can i go back to england i asked eagerly  not immediately you are his favorite nurseyou must gradually accustom him to the idea of your going away if you do anything sudden you may cause a relapse  i will do nothing sudden only tell me when it will be safeabsolutely safefor me to go  say in a week  on the eighteenth  on the eighteenth  i shut up my writingdesk within a few days i might now hope to be in england as soon as i could receive grosses answer at marseilles under these circumstances it would be better to wait until i could make my inquiries safely and independently in my own proper person comparison of dates will show that if i had written to the german oculist it would have been too late it was now the eleventh and lucilla had left ramsgate with nugent on the fifth  all this time but one small morsel of news rewarded our inquiries after oscarand even that small morsel seemed to me to be unworthy of belief  it was said that he had been seen at a military hospitalthe hospital of alessandria in piedmont i thinkacting under the surgeons as attendant on the badlywounded men who had survived the famous campaign of france and italy against austria bear in mind if you please that i am writing of the year eighteen hundred and fiftynine and that the peace of villafranca was only signed in the july of that year occupation as hospitalmannurse was to my mind occupation so utterly at variance with oscars temperament and character that i persisted in considering the intelligence thus received of him to be on the face of it false  on the seventeenth of the month i had got my passport regulated and had packed up the greater part of my baggage in anticipation of my journey back to england on the next day  carefully as i had tried to accustom his mind to the idea my poor father remained so immovably reluctant to let me leave him that i was obliged to consent to a sort of compromise i promised when the business which took me to england was settled to return again to marseilles and to travel back with him to his home in paris as soon as he was fit to be moved on this condition i gained permission to go poor as i was i infinitely preferred charging my slender purse with the expense of the double journey to remaining any longer in ignorance of what was going on at ramsgateor at dimchurch as the case might be now that my mind was free from anxiety about my father i dont know which tormented me mostmy eagerness to set myself right with my sisterfriend or my vague dread of the mischief which nugent might have done while my back was turned over and over again i asked myself whether miss batchford had or had not shown my letter to lucilla over and over again i wondered whether it had been my happy privilege to reveal nugent under his true aspect and to preserve lucilla for oscar after all  towards the afternoon on the seventeenth i went out alone to get a breath of fresh air and a look at the shopwindows i dont care who or what she may behigh or low handsome or ugly young or oldit always relieves a womans mind to look at the shopwindows  i had not been five minutes out before i met my princely superintendent  any news for me today i asked  not yet  not yet i repeated you expect news then  we expect an italian steamship to arrive in port before the evening said the superintendent who knows what may happen  he bowed and left me i felt no great elation on contemplating the barren prospect which his last words had placed before me so many steamers had arrived at marseilles without bringing any news of the missing man that i attached very little importance to the arrival of the italian ship however i had nothing to doi wanted a walkand i thought i might as well stroll down to the port and see the vessel come in  the vessel was just entering the harbor by the time i got to the landingstage  i found our man employed to investigate travelers arriving by sea punctually at his post his influence broke through the vexatious french rules and regulations which forbid all freedom of public movement within official limits and procured me a place in the room at the customhouse through which the passengers by the steamer would be obliged to pass i accepted his polite attention simply because i was glad to sit down and rest in a quiet place after my walknot even the shadow of an idea that anything would come of my visit to the harbor being in my mind at the time  after a long interval the passengers began to stream into the room looking languidly enough at the first halfdozen strangers who came in i felt myself touched on the shoulder from behind there was our man in a state of indescribable excitement entreating me to compose myself  being perfectly composed already i stared at him and asked why  he is here cried the man look  he pointed to the passengers still crowding into the room i looked and instantly losing my head started up with a cry that turned everybodys eyes on me yes there was the poor dear discolored facethere was oscar himself thunderstruck on his side at the sight of me  i snatched the key of his portmanteau out of his hand and gave it to our manwho undertook to submit it to the customhouse examination and to bring it to my lodging afterwards holding oscar fast by the arm i pushed my way through the crowd in the room got outside and hailed a cab at the dock gates the people about noticing my agitation said to each other compassionately its the blue mans mother idiots they might have seen i think that i was only old enough to be his elder sister  once sheltered in the vehicle i could draw my breath again and reward him for all the anxiety he had caused me by giving him a kiss i might have given him a thousand kisses amazement made him a perfectly passive creature in my hands he only repeated faintly over and over again what does it mean what does it mean  it means that you have friends you wretch who are fools enough to be too fond of you to give you up i said i am one of the fools you will come to england with me tomorrowand see for yourself if lucilla is not another  that reference to lucilla restored him to the possession of his senses he began to ask the questions that naturally occurred to him under the circumstances having plenty of questions in reserve on my side i told him briefly enough what had brought me to marseilles and what i had done during my residence in that city towards discovering the place of his retreat  when he asked me nextafter a momentary struggle with himselfwhat i could tell him of nugent and lucilla it is not to be denied that i hesitated before i answered him a moments consideration however was enough to decide me on speaking outfor this plain reason that a moments consideration reminded me of the troubles and annoyances which had already befallen us as the result of concealing the truth i told oscar honestly all that i have related herestarting from my night interview with nugent at browndown and ending with my precautionary measures for the protection of lucilla while she was living under the care of her aunt  i was greatly interested in watching the effect which these disclosures produced on oscar  my observation led me to form two conclusions first conclusion that time and absence had not produced the slightest change in the love which the poor fellow bore to lucilla second conclusion that nothing but absolute proof would induce him to agree in my unfavorable opinion of his brothers character it was in vain i declared that nugent had quitted england pledged to find him and had left it to me as the event now proved to make the discovery he owned readily that he had seen nothing and heard nothing of nugent nevertheless his confidence in his brother remained unshaken nugent is the soul of honor he repeated again and againwith a sidelook at me which suggested that my franklyavowed opinion of his brother had hurt and offended him  i had barely time to notice this before we reached my lodgings he appeared to be unwilling to follow me into the house  i suppose you have some proof to support what you have said of nugent he resumed stopping in the courtyard have you written to england since you have been here and have you had a reply  i have written to mrs finch i answered and i have not had a word in reply  have you written to no one else  i explained to him the position in which i stood towards miss batchford and the hesitation which i had felt about writing to grosse the smoldering resentment against me that had been in him ever since i had spoken of his brother and of lucilla flamed up at last  i entirely disagree with you he broke out angrily you are wronging lucilla and wronging nugent lucilla is incapable of saying anything against you to grosse and nugent is equally incapable of misleading her as you suppose what horrible ingratitude you attribute to one of themand what horrible baseness to the other i have listened to you as patiently as i can and i feel sincerely obliged by the interest which you have shown in mebut i cannot remain in your company any longer madame pratolungo your suspicions are inhuman you have not brought forward a shadow of proof in support of them i will send here for my luggage if you will allow meand i will start for england by the next train after what you have said i cant rest till i have found out the truth for myself  this was my reward for all the trouble that i had taken to discover oscar dubourg never mind the money i had spenti am not rich enough to care about moneyonly consider the trouble if i had been a man i do really think i should have knocked him down being only a woman i dropped him a low curtsey and stung him with my tongue  as you please sir i said i have done my best to serve youand you quarrel with me and leave me in return go you are not the first fool who has quarreled with his best friend  either the words or the curtseyor both togetherbrought him to his senses he made me an apologywhich i received and he looked excessively foolishwhich put me in an excellent humour again you stupid boy i said taking his arm and leading him to the stairs when we first met at dimchurch did you find me a suspicious woman or an inhuman woman answer me that  he answered frankly enough  i found you all that was kind and good still it is surely only natural to want some confirmation he checked himself there and reverted abruptly to my letter to mrs finch the silence of the rectors wife evidently alarmed him how long is it since you wrote he inquired  as long ago as the first of this month i replied  he fell into thought we ascended the next flight of stairs in silence at the landing he stopped me and spoke again my unanswered letter was still uppermost in his mind  mrs finch loses everything that can be lost he said is it not likelywith her habitsthat when she had written her answer and wanted your letter to look at to put the address on it your letter was like her handkerchief or her novel or anything elsenot to be found  so far no doubt this was quite in mrs finchs character i could see thatbut my mind was too much preoccupied to draw the inference that followed oscars next words enlightened me  have you tried the posterestante he asked  what could i possibly have been thinking of of course she had lost my letter of course the whole house would be upset in looking for it and the rector would silence the uproar by ordering his wife to try the posterestante how strangely we had changed places instead of my clear head thinking for oscar here was oscars clear head thinking for me is my stupidity quite incredible remember if you please what a weight of trouble and anxiety had lain on my mind while i was at marseilles can one think of everything while one is afflicted as i was not even such a clever person as you can do that if as the saying is homer sometimes nodswhy not madame pratolungo  i never thought of the posterestante i said to oscar if you dont mind going back a little way shall we inquire at once  he was perfectly willing we went downstairs again and out into the street on our way to the postoffice i seized my first opportunity of making oscar give me some account of himself  i have satisfied your curiosity to the best of my ability i said as we walked arminarm through the streets now suppose you satisfy mine a report of your having been seen in a military hospital in italy is the only report of you which has reached me here of course it is not true  it is perfectly true  you in a hospital nursing wounded soldiers  that is exactly what i have been doing  no words could express my astonishment i could only stop and look at him  was that the occupation which you had in view when you left england i asked  i had no object in leaving england he answered but the object which i avowed to you after what had happened i owed it to lucilla and i owed it to nugent to go i left england without caring where i went the train to lyons happened to be the first train that started on my arrival at paris i took the first train at lyons i saw by chance an account in a french newspaper of the sufferings of some of the badlywounded men left still uncured after the battle of solferino i felt an impulse in my own wretchedness to help these other sufferers in their misery on every other side of it my life was wasted the one worthy use to which i could put it was to employ myself in doing good and here was good to be done i managed to get the necessary letters of introduction at turin with the help of these i made myself of some use under the regular surgeons and dressers in nursing the poor mutilated crippled men and i have helped a little afterwards from my own resources in starting them comfortably in new ways of life  in those manly and simple words he told me his story  once more i felt what i had felt already that there were hidden reserves of strength in the character of this innocent young fellow which had utterly escaped my superficial observation of him in choosing his vocation he was no doubt only following the conventional modern course in such cases despair has its fashions as well as dress ancient despair especially of oscars sort used to turn soldier or go into a monastery modern despair turns nurse binds up wounds gives physic and gets cured or not in that useful but nasty way oscar had certainly struck out nothing new for himself he had only followed the fashion still it implied as i thought both courage and resolution to have conquered the obstacles which he must have overcome and to have held steadily on his course after he had once entered it having begun by quarreling with him i was in a fair way to end by respecting him surely this man was worth preserving for lucilla after all  may i ask where you were going when we met at the port i continued have you left italy because there were no more wounded soldiers to be cured  there was no more work for me at the hospital to which i was attached he said and there were certain obstacles in my way as a stranger and a protestant among the poor and afflicted population outside the hospital i might have overcome those obstacles with little trouble among a people so essentially goodtempered and courteous as the italians if i had tried but it occurred to me that my first duty was to my own countrymen the misery crying for relief in london is misery not paralleled in any city of italy when you met me i was on my way to london to place my services at the disposal of any clergyman in a poor neighborhood who would accept such help as i can offer him he paused a littlehesitatedand added in lower tonesthat was one of my objects in returning to england it is only honest to own to you that i had another motive besides  a motive connected with your brother and with lucilla i suggested  yes dont misinterpret me i am not returning to england to retract what i said to nugent i still leave him free to plead his own cause with lucilla in his own person i am still resolved not to distress myself and distress them by returning to dimchurch but i have a longing that nothing can subdue to know how it has ended between them dont ask me to say more than that in spite of the time that has passed it breaks my heart to talk of lucilla i had looked forward to a meeting with you in london and to hearing what i longed to hear from your lips judge for yourself what my hopes were when i first saw your face and forgive me if i felt my disappointment bitterly when i found that you had really no news to tell and when you spoke of nugent as you did he stopped and pressed my arm earnestly suppose i am right about miss finchs letter he added suppose it should really be waiting for you at the post  well  the letter may contain the news which i most want to hear  i checked him there i am not sure of that i answered i dont know what it is that you most want to hear  i said those words with a purpose what was the news he was longing for in spite of all that he had told me my instincts answered news that lucilla is still a single woman my object in speaking as i had just spoken was to tempt him into a reply which might confirm me in this opinion he evaded the reply was that confirmation in itself yesas i think  will you tell me what there is in the letter he askedpassing as you see entirely over what i had just said to him  yesif you wish it i answered not over well pleased with his want of confidence in me  no matter what the letter contains he went on evidently doubting me  i said yes againthat one word and no more  i suppose it would be asking too much he persisted to ask you to let me read the letter myself  my temper as you are well aware by this time is not the temper of a saint i drew my arm smartly out of his arm and i surveyed him with what poor pratolungo used to call my roman look  mr oscar dubourg say in plain words that you distrust me  he protested of course that he did nothing of the kindwithout producing the slightest effect on me just run over in your mind the insults worries and anxieties which had assailed me as the reward for my friendly interest in this mans welfare or if that is too great an effort be so good as to remember that lucillas farewell letter to me at dimchurch was now followed by the equally ungracious expression of oscars distrustand this at a time when i had had serious trials of my own to sustain at my fathers bedside i think you will admit that a sweeter temper than mine might have not unnaturally turned a little sour under present circumstances  i answered not a word to oscars protestationsi only searched vehemently in the pocket of my dress  here i said opening my cardcase is my address in this place and here i went on producing the document is my passport if they want it  i forced the card and the passport into his hands he took them in helpless astonishment  what am i to do with these he asked  take them to the posterestante if there is a letter for me with the dimchurch postmark i authorize you to open it read it before it comes into my handsand then perhaps you will be satisfied  he declared that he would do nothing of the sortand tried to force my documents back into my own possession  please yourself i said i have done with you and your affairs mrs finchs letter is of no earthly consequence to me if it is at the posterestante i shall not trouble myself to ask for it what concern have i with news about lucilla what does it matter to me whether she is married or not i am going back to my father and my sisters decide for yourself whether you want mrs finchs letter or not  that settled it he went his way with my documents to the postoffice and i went mine back to the lodging  arrived in my room i still held to the resolution which i had expressed to oscar in the street why should i leave my poor old father to go back to england and mix myself up in lucillas affairs after the manner in which she had taken her leave of me had i any reasonable prospect of being civilly received oscar was on his way to englandlet oscar manage his own affairs let them all three oscar nugent lucilla fight it out together among themselves what had i pratolungos widow to do with this trumpery family entanglement nothing it was a warm day for the time of yearpratolungos widow like a wise woman determined to make herself comfortable she unlocked her packed box she removed her traveling costume and put on her dressinggown she took a turn in the roomand if you had come across her at that moment i wouldnt have stood in your shoes for something i can tell you  what do you think of my consistency by this time how often have i changed my mind about lucilla and oscar reckon it up from the time when i left dimchurch what a picture of perpetual selfcontradiction i presentand how improbable it is that i should act in this illogical way you never alter your mind under the influence of your temper or your circumstances no you are what they call a consistent character and i oh i am only a human beingand i feel painfully conscious that i have no business to be in a book  in about half an hours time the servant appeared with a little paper parcel for me it had been left by a stranger with an english accent and a terrible face he had announced his intention of calling a little later the servant a bouncing fat wench trembled as she repeated the message and asked if there was anything amiss between me and the man with the terrible face  i opened the parcel it contained my passport and sure enough the letter from mrs finch had he opened it yes he had not been able to resist the temptation to read it and more he had written a line or two on it in pencil thusas soon as i am fit to see you i will implore your pardon i dare not trust myself in your presence yet read the letter and you will understand why  i opened the letter  it was dated the fifth of september i ran over the first few sentences carelessly enough thanks for my lettercongratulations on my fathers prospect of recoveryinformation about babys gums and the rectors last sermonmore information about somebody else which mrs finch felt quite sure would interest and delight me what mr oscar dubourg has come back and is now with lucilla at ramsgate  i crumpled the letter up in my hand nugent had justified my worst anticipations of what he would do in my absence what did the true mr oscar dubourg reading that sentence at marseilles think of his brother now we are all mortalwe are all wicked it is monstrous but it is true i had a moments triumph  the wicked moment gone i was good againthat is to say i was ashamed of myself  i smoothed out the letter and looked eagerly for news of lucillas health if the news was favorable my letter committed to miss batchfords care must have been shown to lucilla by this time must have exposed nugents abominable personation of his brother and must have thus preserved her for oscar in that case all would be well again and my darling herself would own itthanks to me  after telling me the news from ramsgate mrs finch began to drift into what you call twaddle she had just discovered exactly as oscar had supposed that she had lost my letter she would keep her own letter back until the next day on the chance of finding it if she failed she must try posterestante at the suggestion not of mr finchthere i was wrongat the suggestion of zillah who had relatives in foreign parts and had tried posterestante in her case too so mrs finch driveled mildly on in her large loose untidy handwriting to the bottom of the third page  i turned over the handwriting suddenly grew untidier than ever two great blots defaced the paper the style became feebly hysterical good heavens what did i read when i made it out at last see for yourselves here are the words some hours have passedit is just teatimeoh my dear friend i can hardly hold the pen i tremble sowould you believe it miss batchford has arrived at the rectoryshe brings the dreadful news that lucilla has eloped with oscarwe dont know whywe dont know where except that they have gone away together privatelya letter from oscar tells miss batchford as much as that and no moreoh pray come back as soon as you canmr finch washes his hands of itand miss batchford has left the house again in a fury with himi am in dreadful agitation and i have given it mr finch says to baby who is screaming black in the face yours affectionately  amelia finch    all the rages i had ever been in before in my life were as nothing compared with the rage that devoured me when i had read that fourth page of mrs finchs letter nugent had got the better of me and my precautions nugent had robbed his brother of lucilla in the vilest manner with perfect impunity i cast all feminine restraints to the winds i sat down with my legs anyhow like a man i rammed my hands into the pockets of my dressinggown did i cry a word in your earand let it go no farther i swore  how long the fit lasted i dont know i only remember that i was disturbed by a knock at my door  i flung open the door in a furyand confronted oscar on the threshold  there was a look in his face that instantly quieted me there was a tone in his voice that brought the tears suddenly into my eyes  i must leave for england in two hours he said will you forgive me madame pratolungo before i go  only those words and yetif you had seen him if you had heard him as he spoke themyou would have been ready as i wasnot only to forgive himbut to go to the ends of the earth with him and you would have told him so as i did  in two hours more we were in the train on our way to england    chapter the fortyseventh  on the way to the end first stage  you will perhaps expect me to give some account of how oscar bore the discovery of his brothers conduct  i find it by no means easy to do this oscar baffled me  the first words of any importance which he addressed to me were spoken on our way to the station rousing himself from his own thoughts he said very earnestly  i want to know what conclusion you have drawn from mrs finchs letter  naturally enough under the circumstances i tried to avoid answering him he was not to be put off in that way  you will do me a favor he went on if you will reply to my question the letter has bred in me such a vile suspicion of my dear good brother who never deceived me in his life that i would rather believe i am out of my mind than believe in my own interpretation of it do you infer from what mrs finch writes that nugent has presented himself to lucilla under my name do you believe that he has persuaded her to leave her friends under the impression that she has yielded to my entreaties and trusted herself to my care  i answered in the fewest and plainest words that is what your brother has done  a sudden change passed over him my reply seemed to have set his last doubts at rest in an instant  that is what my brother has done he repeated after all that i sacrificed to himafter all that i trusted to his honorwhen i left england he paused and considered a little what does such a man deserve he went on speaking to himself in a low threatening tone that startled me  he deserves i said what he will get when we reach england you have only to show yourself to make him repent his wickedness to the last day of his life are exposure and defeat not punishment enough for such a man as nugent i stopped and waited for his answer  he turned his face away from me and said no more until we arrived at the station there he drew me aside for a moment out of hearing of the strangers about us  why should i take you away from your father he asked abruptly i am behaving very selfishlyand i only see it now  make your mind easy i said if i had not met you today i should have gone to england tomorrow for lucillas sake  but now you have met me he persisted why shouldnt i spare you the journey i could write and tell you every thingwithout putting you to this fatigue and expense  if you say a word more i answered i shall think you have some reason of your own for wishing to go to england by yourself  he cast one quick suspicious look at meand led the way back to the bookingoffice without uttering another word i was not at all satisfied with him i thought his conduct very strange  in silence we took our tickets in silence we got into the railwaycarriage i attempted to say something encouraging when we started dont notice me was all he replied you will be doing me a kindness if you will let me bear it by myself in my former experience of him he had talked his way out of all his other troubleshe had clamorously demanded the expression of my sympathy with him in this greatest trouble he was like another being i hardly knew him again were the hidden reserves in his nature stirred up by another serious call on them showing themselves once more on the surface as they had shown themselves already on the fatal first day when lucilla tried her sight in that way i accounted for the mere superficial change in him at the time what was actually going on below the surface it defied my ingenuity even to guess perhaps i shall best describe the sort of vague apprehension which he aroused in meafter what had passed between us at the stationby saying that i would not for worlds have allowed him to go to england by himself  left as i now was to my own resources i occupied the first hours of the journey in considering what course it would be safest and best for us to take on reaching england  i decided in the first place that we ought to go straight to dimchurch if any tidings had been obtained of lucilla they would be sure to have received them at the rectory our route after reaching paris must be therefore by way of dieppe thence across the channel to newhaven near brightonand so to dimchurch  in the second placeassuming it to be always possible that we might see lucilla at the rectorythe risk of abruptly presenting oscar to her in his own proper person might for all i knew to the contrary be a very serious one it would relieve us as i thought of a grave responsibility if we warned grosse of our arrival and so enabled him to be present if he thought it necessary in the interests of lucillas health i put this view as also my plan for returning by way of dieppe to oscar he briefly consented to everythinghe ungraciously left it all to me  accordingly on our arrival at lyons having some time for refreshment at our disposal before we went on i telegraphed to mr finch at the rectory and to grosse in london informing them as well as i could calculate it that if we were lucky in catching trains and steamboats oscar and i might be in dimchurch in good time on the next nightthat is to say on the night of the eighteenth in any case they were to expect us at the earliest possible moment  these difficulties disposed of and a little store of refreshment for the night packed in my basket we reentered the train for our long journey to paris  among the new passengers who joined us at lyons was a gentleman whose face was english and whose dress was the dress of a clergyman for the first time in my life i hailed the appearance of a priest with a feeling of relief the reason was this from the moment when i had read mrs finchs letter until now a horrid doubt which a priest was just the man to solve had laid its leaden weight on my mindand i firmly believe on oscars mind as well had time enough passed since lucilla had left ramsgate to allow of nugents marrying her under his brothers name  as the train rolled out of the station i the enemy of priests began to make myself agreeable to this priest he was young and shybut i conquered him just as the other travelers were beginning with the exception of oscar to compose themselves to sleep i put my case to the clergyman a and b sir lady and gentleman both of age leave one place in england and go to live in another place on the fifth of this monthhow soon if you please can they be lawfully married after that  i presume you mean in church said the young clergyman  in church of course to that extent i believed i might answer for lucilla without any fear of making a mistake  they may be married by license said the clergymanprovided one of them continues to reside in that other place to which they traveled on the fifthon the twentyfirst or possibly even the twentieth of this month  not before  certainly not before  it was then the night of the seventeenth i gave my companions hand a little squeeze in the dark here was a glimpse of encouragement to cheer us on the journey before the marriage could take place we should be in england we have time before us i whispered to oscar we will save lucilla yet  shall we find lucilla was all he whispered back  i had forgotten that serious difficulty no answer to oscars question could possibly present itself until we reached the rectory between this and then there was nothing for it but to keep patience and to keep hope  i refrain from encumbering this part of my narrative with any detailed account of the little accidents lucky and unlucky which alternately hastened or retarded our journey home let me only say that before midnight on the eighteenth oscar and i drove up to the rectory gate  mr finch himself came out to receive us with a lamp in his hand he lifted his eyes and his lamp devotionally to the sky when he saw oscar the two first words he said were  inscrutable providence  have you found lucilla i asked  mr finchwith his whole attention fixed on oscarwrung my hand mechanically and said i was a good creature much as he might have patted and spoken to oscars companion if the companion had been a dog i almost wished myself that animal for the momenti should have had the privilege of biting mr finch oscar impatiently repeated my question the rector at the time officiously assisting him to descend from the carriage and leaving me to get out as i could  did you hear madame pratolungo oscar asked is lucilla found  dear oscar we hope to find her now you have come  that answer revealed to me the secret of mr finchs extraordinary politeness to his young friend the last chance as things were of preventing lucillas marriage to a man who had squandered away every farthing of his money was the chance of oscars arrival in england before the ceremony could take place the measure of oscars importance to mr finch was now more literally than ever the measure of oscars fortune  i asked for news of grosse as we went in the rector actually found some comparatively high notes in his prodigious voice to express his amazement at my audacity in speaking to him of anybody but oscar  oh dear dear me cried mr finch impatiently conceding to me one precious moment of his attention dont bother about grosse grosse is ill in london there is a note for you from grossetake care of the doorstep dear oscar he went on in his deepest and gravest bass notes mrs finch is so anxious to see you we have both looked forward to your arrival with such eager hopesuch impatient affection so to speak let me put down your hat ah how you must have suffered share my trust in an allwise providence and meet this trial with cheerful submission as i do all is not lost yet bear up bear up he threw open the parlor door mrs finch compose yourself our dear adopted son our afflicted oscar  is it necessary to say what mrs finch was about and how mrs finch looked  there were the three unchangeable institutionsthe novel the baby and the missing pockethandkerchief there was the gaudy jacket over the long trailing dressinggownand the damp lady inside them damp as ever receiving oscar with a mouth drawn down at the corners and a head that shook sadly in sympathy with him mrs finchs face underwent a most extraordinary transformation when she turned my way next to my astonishment her dim eyes actually sparkled a broad smile of irrepressible contentment showed itself cunningly to me in place of the dismal expression which had welcomed oscar holding up the baby in triumph the lady of the rectory whispered these words in my earwhat do you think he has done since you have been away  i really dont know i answered  he has cut two teeth put your finger in and feel  others might bewail the family misfortune the family triumph filled the secret mind of mrs finch to the exclusion of every other earthly consideration i put my finger in as instructed and got instantly bitten by the ferocious baby but for a new outburst of the rectors voice at the moment mrs finch if i am any judge of physiognomy must have certainly relieved herself by a scream of delight as it was she opened her mouth and having lost her handkerchief as already stated retired into a corner and gagged herself with the baby  in the meantime mr finch had produced from a cupboard near the fireplace two letters the first he threw down impatiently on the table oh dear dear what a nuisance other peoples letters are the second he handled with extraordinary care offering it to oscar with a heavy sigh and with eyes that turned up martyrlike to the ceiling rouse yourself and read it said mr finch in his most pathetic pulpit tones i would have spared you oscar if i could all our hopes depend dear boy on what you can say to guide us when you have read those lines  oscar took the enclosure out of the enveloperan over the first wordsglanced at the signatureand with a look of mingled rage and horror threw the letter on the floor  dont ask me to read it he cried in the first burst of passion which had escaped him yet if i read it i shall kill him when we meet he dropped into a chair and hid his face in his hands oh nugent nugent nugent he moaned to himself with a cry that was dreadful to hear  it was no time for standing on ceremony i picked up the letter and looked at it without asking leave it proved to be the letter from nugent already inserted at the close of lucillas journal informing miss batchford of her nieces flight from ramsgate and signed in oscars name the only words which it is necessary to repeat here are theseshe accompanies me at my express request to the house of a married lady who is a relative of mine and under whose care she will remain until the time arrives for our marriage  those lines instantly lightened my heart of the burden that had oppressed it on the journey nugents married relative was oscars married relative too oscar had only to tell us where the lady livedand lucilla would be found  i stopped mr finch in the act of maddening oscar by administering pastoral consolation to him  leave it to me i said showing him the letter i know what you want  the rector stared at me indignantly i turned to mrs finch  we have had a weary journey i went on oscar is not so well used to traveling as i am where is his room  mrs finch rose to show the way her husband opened his lips to interfere  leave it to me i repeated i understand him and you dont  for once in his life the pope of dimchurch was reduced to silence his amazement at my audacity defied even his powers of expression i took oscars arm and said you are worn out go to your room i will make you something warm and bring it up to you myself in a few minutes he neither looked at me nor answered mehe yielded silently and followed mrs finch i took from the sideboard on which supper was waiting the materials i wanted set the kettle boiling made my renovating mixture and advanced to the door with itfollowed from first to last move where i might by the staring and scandalized eyes of mr finch the moment in which i opened the door was also the moment in which the rector recovered himself permit me to inquire madame pratolungo he said with his loftiest emphasis in what capacity are you here  in the capacity of oscars friend i answered you will get rid of us both tomorrow i banged the door behind me and went upstairs if i had been mr finchs wife i believe i should have ended in making quite an agreeable man of him  mrs finch met me in the passage on the first floor and pointed out oscars room i found him walking backwards and forwards restlessly the first words he said alluded to his brothers letter i had arranged not to disturb him by any reference to that painful matter until the next morning and i tried to change the topic it was useless there was an anxiety in his mind which was not to be dismissed at will he insisted on my instantly setting that anxiety at rest  i dont want to see the letter he said i only want to know all that it says about lucilla  all that it says may be summed up in this lucilla is perfectly safe  he caught me by the arm and looked me searchingly in the face  where he asked with him  with a married lady who is a relative of his  he dropped my arm and considered for a moment  my cousin at sydenham he exclaimed  do you know the house  perfectly well  we will go there tomorrow let that content you for tonight get to rest  i gave him my hand he took it mechanicallyabsorbed in his own thoughts  didnt i say something foolish down stairs he asked putting the question suddenly with an odd suspicious look at me  you were quite worn out i said consolingly nobody noticed it  you are sure of that  quite sure good night  i left the room feeling much as i had felt at the station at marseilles i was not satisfied with him i thought his conduct very strange    on returning to the parlor i found nobody there but mrs finch the rectors offended dignity had left the rector no honorable alternative but to withdraw to his own room i ate my supper in peace and mrs finch rocking the cradle with her foot chattered away to her hearts content about all that had happened in my absence  i gathered here and there from what she said some particulars worth mentioning  the new disagreement between mr finch and miss batchford which had driven the old lady out of the rectory almost as soon as she set foot in it had originated in mr finchs exasperating composure when he heard of his daughters flight he supposed of course that lucilla had left ramsgate with oscarwhose signed settlements on his future wife were safe in mr finchs possession it was only when miss batchford had communicated with grosse and when the discovery followed which revealed the penniless nugent as the man who had eloped with lucilla that mr finchs parental anxiety seeing no money likely to come of it became roused to action he miss batchford and grosse had all in their various ways done their best to trace the fugitivesand had all alike been baffled by the impossibility of discovering the residence of the lady mentioned in nugents letter my telegram announcing my return to england with oscar had inspired them with their first hope of being able to interfere and stop the marriage before it was too late  the occurrence of grosses name in mrs finchs rambling narrative recalled to my memory what the rector had told me at the garden gate i had not yet received the letter which the german had sent to wait my arrival at dimchurch after a short search we found itwhere it had been contemptuously thrown by mr finchon the parlor table  a few lines comprised the whole letter grosse informed me that he had so fretted himself about lucilla that he had been attacked by a visitation of gouts it was impossible to move his foots without instantly plunging into the torture of the infernal regions if it is you my goot dear who are going to find her he concluded come to me first in london i have something most dismalserious to say to you about our poor little feenchs eyes  no words can tell how that last sentence startled and grieved me mrs finch increased my anxiety and alarm by repeating what she had heard miss batchford say during her brief visit to the rectory on the subject of lucillas sight grosse had been seriously dissatisfied with the state of his patients eyes when he had seen them as long ago as the fourth of the month and on the morning of the next day the servant had reported lucilla as being hardly able to distinguish objects in the view from the window of her room later on the same day she had secretly left ramsgate and grosses letter proved that she had not been near her surgical attendant since  weary as i was after the journey this miserable news kept me waking long after i had gone to my bed the next morning i was up with the servantsimpatient to start for london by the first train    chapter the fortyeighth  on the way to the end second stage  early riser as i was i found that oscar had risen earlier still he had left the rectory and had disturbed mr gootheridges morning slumbers by an application at the inn for the key of browndown  on his return to the rectory he merely said that he had been to see after various things belonging to him which were still left in the empty house his look and manner as he gave us this brief explanation were to my mind more unsatisfactory than ever i made no remark and observing that his loose traveling coat was buttoned awry over the breast i set it right for him my hand as i did this touched his breastpocket he started back directlyas if there was something in the pocket which he did not wish me to feel was it something he had brought from browndown  we got awayencumbered by mr finch who insisted on attaching himself to oscarby the first express train which took us straight to london comparison of timetables on reaching the terminus showed that i had leisure to spare for a brief visit to grosse before we again took the railway back to sydenham having decided not to mention the bad news about lucillas sight to oscar until i had seen the german first i made the best excuse that suggested itself and drove awayleaving the two gentlemen in the waitingroom at the station  i found grosse confined to his easychair with his gouty foot enveloped in cool cabbageleaves between pain and anxiety his eyes were wilder his broken english was more grotesque than ever when i appeared at the door of his room and said good morningin the frenzy of his impatience he shook his fist at me  good morning godamn he roared out where where where is feench  i told him where we believed lucilla to be grosse turned his head and shook his fist at a bottle on the chimneypiece next  get that bottles on the chimney he said and the eyebaths by the side of him dont stop with your talkytalkychatterations here go save her eyes look you do this you throw her head backsoh he illustrated the position so forcibly with his own head that he shook his gouty foot and screamed with the pain of it he went on nevertheless glaring frightfully through his spectacles gnashing his mustache fiercely between his teeth throw her head back fill the eyebaths turn him upsidesdown over her open eyes drown them turnturnabout in my mixtures drown them i say onedowntoddercomeon and if she screech never mind it then bring her to me for the lofe of gott bring her to me if you tie her hands and foots bring her to me what is the womans stopping for go go go  i want to ask you a question about oscar i said before i go  he seized the pillow which supported his headevidently intending to expedite my departure by throwing it at me i produced the railway timetable as the best defensive weapon at my command look at it for yourself i said and you will see that i must wait at the station if i dont wait here  with some difficulty i satisfied him that it was impossible to leave london for sydenham before a certain hour and that i had at least ten minutes to spare which might be just as well passed in consulting him he closed his glaring eyes and laid his head back on the chair thoroughly exhausted with his own outbreak of excitement no matter how things goes he said a womans must wag her tongue goot wag yours  i am placed in a very difficult position i began oscar is going with me to lucilla i shall of course take care in the first place that he and nugent do not meet unless i am present at the interview but i am not equally sure of what i ought to do in the case of lucilla must i keep them apart until i have first prepared her to see oscar  let her see the devil himself if you like growled grosse so long as you bring her here afterwardsdirectly to me you will do the bettermost thing if you prepare oscar she wants no preparations she is enough disappointed in him as it is  disappointed in him i repeated i dont understand you  he settled himself wearily in his chair and referred in a softened and saddened tone to that private conversation of his with lucilla at ramsgate which has already been reported in the journal i was now informed for the first time of those changes in her sensations and in her ways of thinking which had so keenly vexed and mortified her i heard of the ominous absence of the old thrill of pleasure when nugent took her hand on meeting her at the seasidei heard how bitterly his personal appearance had disappointed her when she had seen his features in detail by comparison with the charming ideal picture which she had formed of her lover in the days of her blindness those happier days as she had called them when she was poor miss finch  surely i said all the old feelings will come back to her when she sees oscar  they will never come back to herno not if she sees fifty oscars  he was beginning to frighten me or to irritate mei can hardly say which i only know that i persisted in disputing with him when she sees the true man i went on do you mean to say she will feel the same disappointment  i could get no farther than that he cut me short there without ceremony  you foolish womans he interposed she will feel more than the same i have told you already it was one enormous disappointments to her when she saw the handsome brodder with the fair complexions ask your own self what it will be when she sees the ugly brodder with the blue face i tell you thisshe will think your true man the worst impostor of the two  there i indignantly contradicted him  his face may be a disappointment to her i saidi own that but there it will end her hand will tell her when he takes it that there is no impostor deceiving her this time  her hand will tell her nothingno more than yours i had not so much hard hearts in me as to say that to her when she asked me i say it to you hold your tongue and listen all those thrilltingles that she once had when he touched her belong to anodder timethe time goneby when her sight was in her fingers and not in her eyes with those finesuperfinefeelings of the days when she was blind she pays now for her grand new privilege of opening her eyes on the world and worth the price too do you understand yet it is a sort of swopbargain between nature and this poor girls of ours i take away your eyesi give you your fine touch i give you your eyesi take away your fine touch soh that is plain you see now  i was too mortified and too miserable to answer him through all our later troubles i had looked forward so confidently to oscars reappearance as the one sufficient condition on which lucillas happiness would be certainly restored what had become of my anticipations now i sat silent staring in stupid depression at the pattern of the carpet grosse took out his watch  your tenminutestime has counted himself out he said  i neither moved nor heeded him his ferocious eyes began to flame again behind his monstrous spectacles  gobeoffwithyou he shouted at me as if i was deaf her eyes her eyes while you stop chatterboxing here her eyes are in danger what with her frettings and her cryings and her damnnonsenselofebusiness i swear you my solemn oath her sight was in danger when i saw her a whole fortnight goneby do you want my big pillow to fly bang at your head you dont want him beoffaway with you then or you will have him in onetwothree time beoffawayand bring her back to me before night  i returned to the railway of all the women whom i passed in the crowded streets i doubt if one had a heavier heart in her bosom that morning than mine  to make matters worse still my traveling companions one in the refreshmentroom and one pacing the platform received my account of my interview with grosse in a manner which seriously disappointed and discouraged me mr finchs inhuman conceit treated my melancholy news of his daughter as a species of complimentary tribute to his own foresight  you remember madame pratolungo i took high ground in this matter from the first i protested against the proceedings of the man grosse as involving a purely worldly interference with the ways of an inscrutable providence with what effect my paternal influence was repudiated my moral weight was so to speak set aside and now you see the result take it to heart dear friend may it be a warning to you he sighed with ponderous complacency and turned from me to the girl behind the counter i will take another cup of tea  oscars reception of me when i found him on the platform and told him next of lucillas critical state was more than discouraging it is no exaggeration to say that he alarmed me another item in the debt i owe to nugent he said not a word of sympathy not a word of sorrow that vindictive answer and nothing more  we started for sydenham  from time to time i looked at oscar sitting opposite to me to see if any change appeared in him as we drew nearer and nearer to the place in which lucilla was now living no still the same ominous silence the same unnatural selfrepression possessed him  except the momentary outbreak when mr finch had placed nugents letter in his hand on the previous evening not the faintest token of what was really going on in his mind had escaped him since we had left marseilles he who could weep over all his other griefs as easily and as spontaneously as a woman had not shed a tear since the fatal day when he had discovered that his brother had played him falsethat brother who had been the god of his idolatry the sacred object of his gratitude and his love when a man of oscars temperament becomes frozen up for days together in his own thoughtswhen he keeps his own counsel when he asks for no sympathy and utters no complaintthe sign is a serious one there are hidden forces gathering in him which will burst their way to the surfacefor good or for evilwith an irresistible result watching oscar attentively behind my veil i felt the certain assurance that the part he would take in the terrible conflict of interests now awaiting us would be a part which i should remember to the latest day of my life  we reached sydenham and went to the nearest hotel  on the railwaywith other travelers in the carriageit had been impossible to consult on the safest method of approaching lucilla in the first instance that serious question now pressed for instant decision we sat down to discuss it in the room which we had hired at the hotel    chapter the fortyninth  on the way to the end third stage  on former occasions of doubt or difficulty it had always been oscars habit to follow the opinions of others on this occasion he was the first to speak and to assert an opinion of his own  it seems needless to waste time in discussing our different views he said there is only one thing to be done i am the person principally concerned in this matter wait here while i go to the house  he spoke without any of his usual hesitation he took up his hat without looking either at mr finch or at me i felt more and more convinced that the influence which nugents vile breach of confidence had exerted over oscars mind was an influence which had made a dangerous man of him resolved to prevent him from leaving us i insisted on his returning to his chair and hearing what i had to say at the same moment mr finch rose and placed himself between oscar and the door seeing this i thought it might be wise if i kept my interference in reserve and allowed the rector to speak first  wait a moment oscar said mr finch gravely you are forgetting me  oscar waited doggedly hat in hand  mr finch paused evidently considering what words he should use before he spoke again his respect for oscars pecuniary position was great but his respect for himselfespecially at the present crisiswas if possible greater still in deference to the first sentiment he was as polite and in deference to the second he was as positive in phrasing his remonstrance as a man could be permit me to remind you dear oscar that my claim to interfere as lucillas father is at least equal to yours proceeded the rector in the hour of my daughters need it is my parental duty to be present if you go to your cousins house my position imperatively requires that i should go too oscars reception of this proposal confirmed the grave apprehensions with which he had inspired me he flatly refused to have mr finch for a companion  excuse me he answered shortly i wish to go to the house alone  permit me to ask your reason said the rector still preserving his conciliatory manner  i wish to see my brother in private oscar replied with his eyes on the ground  mr finch still restraining himself but still not moving from the door looked at me i hastened to interfere before there was any serious disagreement between them  i venture to think i said that you are both wrong whether one of you goes or both of you go the result will be the same the chances are a hundred to one against your being admitted into the house  they both turned on me together and asked what i meant  you cant force your way in i said you must do one of two things you must either give your names to the servant at the door or you must withhold your names if you give them you warn nugent of what is comingand he is not the man to let you into the house under those circumstances if you take the other way and keep your names concealed you present yourselves as strangers is nugent likely to be accessible to strangers would lucilla in her present position consent to receive two men who are unknown to her take my word for ityou will not only gain nothing if you go to the house you will actually make it more difficult to communicate with lucilla than it is already  there was a moments silence both the men felt that my objections were not easy to answer once more oscar took the lead  do you propose to go he asked  no i answered i propose to send a letter to lucilla a letter will find its way to her  this again was unanswerable oscar inquired next what the purport of the letter was to be i replied that i proposed to ask her to grant me a private interviewnothing more  suppose lucilla refuses said mr finch  she will not refuse i rejoined there was a little misunderstanding between usi admitat the time when i went abroad i mean to refer frankly to that misunderstanding as my reason for writing i shall put your daughter on her honor to give me an opportunity of setting things right between us if i summon lucilla to do an act of justice i believe she will not refuse me  this let me add in parenthesis was the plan of action which i had formed on the way to sydenham i had only waited to mention it until i heard what the two men proposed to do first  oscar standing hat in hand glanced at mr finch also hat in hand keeping obstinately near the door if he persisted in carrying out his purpose of going alone to his cousins house the rectors face and manner expressed with the politest plainness the intention of following him oscar was placed between a clergyman and a woman both equally determined to have their own way under those circumstances there was no alternativeunless he wished to produce a public scandalbut to yield or appear to yield to one or the other of us he selected me  if you succeed in seeing her he asked what do you mean to do  i mean either to bring her back with me here to her father and to you or to make an appointment with her to see you both where she is now living i replied  oscarafter another look at the immovable rectorrang the bell and ordered writing materials  one more question he said assuming that lucilla receives you at the house do you intend to see he stopped his eyes shrank from meeting mine do you intend to see anybody else he resumed still evading the plain utterance of his brothers name  i intend to see nobody but lucilla i answered it is no business of mine to interfere between you and your brother heaven forgive me for speaking in that way to him while i had the firm resolution to interfere between them in my mind all the time  write your letter he said on condition that i see the reply  it is needless i presume for me to make the same stipulation added the rector in my parental capacity  i recognized his parental capacity before he could say any more you shall both see the reply i saidand sat down to my letter writing merely what i had told them i should write dear lucilla i have just returned from the continent for the sake of justice and for the sake of old times let me see you immediatelywithout mentioning our appointment to anybody i pledge myself to satisfy you in five minutes that i have never been unworthy of your affection and your confidence the bearer waits for your reply  i handed those lines to the two gentlemen to read mr finch made no remarkhe was palpably dissatisfied at the secondary position which he occupied oscar said i see no objection to the letter i will do nothing until i have read the answer with those words he dictated to me his cousins address i gave the letter myself to one of the servants at the hotel  is it far from here i asked  barely ten minutes walk maam  you understand that you are to wait for an answer  yes maam  he went out as well as i can remember an interval of at least half an hour passed before his return you will form some idea of the terrible oppression of suspense that now laid its slowlytorturing weight on all three of us when i tell you that not one word was spoken in the room from the time when the servant went out to the time when the servant came in again  when the man returned he had a letter in his hand  my fingers shook so that i could hardly open it before i had read a word the sight of the writing struck a sudden chill through me the body of the note was written by the hand of a stranger and the signature at the end was traced in the large straggling childish characters which i remembered so well when lucilla had written her first letter to oscar in the days when she was blind  the note was expressed in these strange wordsi cannot receive you here but i can and will come to you at your hotel if you will wait for me i am not able to appoint a time i can only promise to watch for my first opportunity and to take advantage of it instantlyfor your sake and for mine  but one interpretation could be placed on such language as this lucilla was not a free agent both oscar and the rector were now obliged to acknowledge that my view of the case had been the correct one if it was impossible for me to be received into the house how doubly impossible would it be for the men to gain admission oscar after reading the note withdrew to the further end of the room keeping his thoughts to himself mr finch decided on stepping out of his secondary position by forthwith taking a course of his own  am i to infer he began that it is really useless for me to attempt to see my own child  her letter speaks for itself i replied if you attempt to see her you will probably be the means of preventing your daughter from coming here  in my parental capacity continued mr finch it is impossible for me to remain passive as a brotherclergyman i have i conceive a claim on the rector of the parish it is quite likely that notice may have been already given of this fraudulent marriage in that case it is not only my duty to myself and my childit is my duty to the church to confer with my reverend colleague i go to confer with him he strutted to the door and added if lucilla arrives in my absence i invest you with my authority madame pratolungo to detain her until my return with that parting charge to me he walked out  i looked at oscar he came slowly towards me from the other end of the room  you will wait here of course he said  of course and you  i shall go out for a little while  for any particular purpose  no to get through the time i am weary of waiting  i felt positively assured from the manner in which he answered me that he was goingnow he had got rid of mr finchstraight to his cousins house  you forget i said that lucilla may come here while you are out your presence in the room or in the room next to this may be of the greatest importance when i tell her what your brother has done suppose she refuses to believe me what am i to do if i have not got you to appeal to in your own interests as well as in lucillas i request you to remain here with me till she comes  putting it on that ground only i waited to see what he would do after a certain hesitation he answered with a sullen assumption of indifference just as you pleaseand walked away again towards the other end of the room as he turned his back on me i heard him say to himself its only waiting a little longer  waiting for what i asked  he looked round at me over his shoulder  patience for the present he answered you will hear soon enough for the moment i said no more to him the tone in which he had replied warned me that it would be useless  after an intervalhow long an interval i cannot well sayi heard the sound of womens dresses in the passage outside  the instant after there was a knock at the door  i signed to oscar to open a second door close by him at the lower end of the room and for the moment at least to keep out of sight then i answered the knock and said as steadily as i could come in  a woman unknown to me entered dressed like a respectable servant she came in leading lucilla by the hand my first look at my darling told me the horrible truth as i had seen her in the corridor at the rectory on the first day we met so i now saw her once more again the sightless eyes turned on me insensibly reflecting the light that fell on them blind oh god after a few brief weeks of sight blind again  in that miserable discovery i forgot everything else i flew to her and caught her in my arms i cast one look at her pale wasted faceand burst out crying on her bosom  she held my head gently with one hand and waited with the patience of an angel until that first outbreak of my grief had exhausted itself dont cry about my blindness said the soft sweet voice that i knew so well the days when i had my sight have been the unhappiest days of my life if i look as if i had been fretting dont think it is about my eyes she paused and sighed bitterly i may tell you she went on in a whisper its a relief its a consolation to tell you i am fretting about my marriage  those words roused me i lifted my head and kissed her i have come back to comfort you i said and i have behaved like a fool  she smiled faintly how like you she exclaimed to say that she tapped my cheek with her fingers in the old familiar way the repetition of that little trifling action almost broke my heart i nearly choked myself in forcing back the stupid cowardly useless tears that tried to burst from me again come she said no more crying let us sit down and talk as if we were at dimchurch  i took her to the sofa we sat side by side she put her arm round my waist and laid her head on my shoulder again the faint smile flickered like a dying light on her lovely face wan and wasted yet still beautifulstill the virgins face in raphaels picture we are a strange pair she said with a momentary flash of her old irresistible humour you are my bitterest enemy and you burst out crying over me the moment we meet i have been shockingly treated by youand i have got my arm round your waist and my head on your shoulder and i wouldnt let go of you for the world her face saddened again her voice suddenly altered its tone tell me she went on how is it that appearances were so terribly against you oscar satisfied me at ramsgate that i ought to give you up that i ought never to see you again i took his viewthere is no denying it my deari agreed with him in detesting you for a little while but when the blindness came back i could keep it up no longer little by little as the light died out my heart would turn to you again when i heard your letter read when i knew that you were near meit was just like the old times i was mad to see you and here i amsatisfied before you explain it to me that you have been the victim of some terrible mistake  i tried in grateful acknowledgment of those generous words to enter on my justification there and then it was impossible i could think of nothing i could speak of nothing but the dreadful discovery of her blindness  give me a few minutes i said and you shall hear it all i cant talk of myself yeti can only talk of you oh lucilla why did you keep away from grosse come with me to him today let him try what he can do at once my lovebefore it is too late  it is too late she said i have been to another oculista stranger he said what mr sebright said he doubted if there was ever any chance for me he thought the operation ought never to have been performed  why did you go to a stranger i asked why did you give up grosse  you must ask oscar she answered it was at his desire that i kept away from grosse  hearing this i penetrated for myself the motive which had actuated nugentas i afterwards found it indicated in the journal if he had let lucilla go to grosse our good german might have noticed that her position was preying on her mind and might have seen his reasons for exposing the deception that nugent was practicing on her for the rest i still persisted in entreating lucilla to go back with me to our old friend  remember our conversation on this very subject she rejoined shaking her head decisively i mean at the time when the operation was going to be performed i told you i was used to being blind i said i only wanted to recover my sight to see oscar and when i did see himwhat happened the disappointment was so dreadful i wished myself blind again dont start dont cry out as if you were shocked i mean what i say you people who can see attach such an absurd importance to your eyes dont you recollect my saying that when we last talked about it  i recollected perfectly she had said those words she had declared that she had never honestly envied any of us the use of our eyes she had even reviled our eyes comparing them contemptuously with her touch deriding them as deceivers who were constantly leading us wrong i acknowledged all thiswithout being in the least reconciled to the catastrophe that had happened if she would only have listened to me i should still have gone on obstinately pleading with her but she flatly refused to listen we have very little time to spare she said let us talk of something more interesting before i am obliged to leave you  obliged to leave me i repeated are you not your own mistress  her face clouded over her manner became embarrassed  i cannot honestly tell you that i am a prisoner she answered i can only say i am watched when oscar is away from me oscars cousina sly suspicious false womanalways contrives to put herself in his place i heard her say to her husband that she believed i should break my marriage engagement unless i was closely looked after i dont know what i should do but for one of the servants in the house who is an excellent creaturewho sympathizes with me and helps me she stopped and lifted her head inquiringly where is the servant she asked  i had forgotten the woman who had brought her into the room she must have delicately left us together after leading lucilla in when i looked up she was not to be seen  the servant is no doubt waiting downstairs i said go on  but for that good creature lucilla resumed i should never have got here she brought me your letter and read it to me and wrote my reply i arranged with her to slip out at the first opportunity one chance was in our favorwe had only the cousin to keep an eye on us oscar was not in the house  she suddenly checked herself at the last word a slight sound at the lower end of the room which had passed unnoticed by me had caught her delicate ear what is that noise she asked anybody in the room with us  i looked up once more while she was talking of the false oscar the true oscar was standing listening to her at the other end of the room  when he discovered that i was looking at him he entreated me by a gesture not to betray his presence he had evidently heard what we had been saying to each other before i detected himfor he touched his eyes and lifted his hands pityingly in allusion to lucillas blindness whatever his mood might be that melancholy discovery must surely have affected himlucillas influence over him now could only be an influence for good i signed to him to remainand told lucilla that there was nothing to be alarmed about she went on  oscar left us for london early this morning she said can you guess what he has gone for he has gone to get the marriage licensehe has given notice of the marriage at the church my last hope is in you in spite of everything that i can say to him he has fixed the day for the twentyfirstin two days more i have done all i could to put it off i have insisted on every possible delay oh if you knew her rising agitation stifled her utterance at the moment i mustnt waste the precious minutes i must get back before oscar returns she went on rallying again oh my old friend you are never at a loss you always know what to do find me some way of putting off my marriage suggest something which will take them by surprise and force them to give me time  i looked towards the lower end of the room listening in breathless interest oscar had noiselessly advanced halfway towards us at a sign from me he checked himself and came no farther  do you really mean lucilla that you no longer love him i said  i can tell you nothing about it she answeredexcept that some dreadful change has come over me while i had my sight i could partly account for iti believed that the new sense had made a new being of me but now i have lost my sight againnow i am once more what i have been all my lifestill the same horrible insensibility possesses me i have so little feeling for him that i sometimes find it hard to persuade myself that he really is oscar you know how i used to adore him you know how enchanted i should once have been to marry him think of what i must suffer feeling towards him as i feel now  i looked up again oscar had stolen nearer i could see his face plainly the good influence of lucilla was beginning to do its good work i saw the tears rising in his eyes i saw love and pity taking the place of hatred and revenge the oscar of my old recollections was standing before me once more  i dont want to go away lucilla went on i dont want to leave him all i ask for is a little more time time must help me to get back again to my old self my blind days have been the days of my whole life can a few weeks of sight have deprived me of the feelings which have been growing in me for years i wont believe it i can find my way about the house i can tell things by my touch i can do all that i did in my blindness just as well as ever now i am blind again the feeling for him will come back to me like the rest only give me time only give me time  at the last word she started to her feet in sudden alarm there is some one in the room she said some one who is crying who is it  oscar was close to us the tears were falling fast over his cheeksthe one faint sobbing breath which had escaped him had caught my ear as well as lucillas i took his hand in one of my hands and i took lucillas hand in the other for good or for evil the result rested with gods mercy the time had come  who is it lucilla repeated impatiently  try if you can tell my love without asking me  with those words i put her hand in oscars handand stood close watching her face  for one awful moment when she first felt the familiar touch the blood left her cheeks her blind eyes dilated fearfully she stood petrified then with a long low crya cry of breathless raptureshe flung her arms passionately round his neck the life flowed back into her face her lovely smile just trembled on her parted lips her breath came faint and quick and fluttering in soft tones of ecstasy with her lips on his cheek she murmured the delicious words  oh oscar i know you once more    chapter the fiftieth  the end of the journey  a little interval of time elapsed  her first exquisite sense of the recognition by touch had passed away her mind had recovered its balance she separated herself from oscar and turned to me with the one inevitable question which i knew must follow the joining of their hands  what does it mean  the exposure of nugents perfidy the revelation of the fatal secret of oscars face and last not least the defence of my own conduct towards her were all comprehended in the answer for which that question called as carefully as delicately as mercifully as i could i disclosed to her the whole truth how the shock affected her she did not tell me at the time and has never told me since with her hand in oscars hand with her face hidden on oscars breast she listened not once interrupting me from first to last by so much as a single word now and then i saw her tremble now and then i heard her sigh heavily that was all it was only when i had endedit was only after a long interval during which oscar and i watched her in speechless anxietythat she slowly lifted her head and broke the silence  thank god we heard her say to herself ferventlythank god i am blind  those were her first words they filled me with horror i cried out to her to recall them  she quietly laid her head back on oscars breast  why should i recall them she asked do you think i wish to see him disfigured as he is now no i wish to see himand i do see himas my fancy drew his picture in the first days of our love my blindness is my blessing it has given me back my old delightful sensation when i touch him it keeps my own beloved image of himthe one image i care forunchanged and unchangeable you will persist in thinking that my happiness depends on my sight i look back with horror at what i suffered when i had my sightmy one effort is to forget that miserable time oh how little you know of me oh what a shock it would be to me if i saw him as you see him try to understand me and you wont talk of my lossyou will talk of my gain  your gain i repeated what have you gained  happiness she answered my life lives in my love and my love lives in my blindness  there was the story of her whole existencetold in two words  if you had seen her radiant face as she raised it again in the excitement of speaking if you had remembered as i remembered what her surgeon had said of the penalty which she must inevitably pay for the recovery of her sighthow would you have answered her it is barely possible perhaps that you might have done what i did that is to say you might have modestly admitted that she knew what the conditions of her happiness were better than youand you might not have answered her at all  i left them to talk together and took a turn in the room considering with myself what we were to do next  it was not easy to say the barren information which i had received from my darling was all the information that i possessed nugent had unflinchingly carried his cruel deception to its end he had falsely given notice of his marriage at the church in his brothers name and he was now in london falsely obtaining his marriage license in his brothers name also so much i knew of his proceedingsand no more  while i was still pondering lucilla cut the gordian knot  why are we stopping here she asked let us goand never return to this hateful place again  as she rose to her feet we were startled by a soft knock at the door  i answered the knock the woman who had brought lucilla to the hotel appeared once more she seemed to be afraid to venture far from the door standing just inside the room she looked nervously at lucilla and said can i speak to you miss  you can say anything you like before this lady and gentleman lucilla answered what is it  im afraid we have been followed miss  followed by whom  by the ladys maid i saw her a little while since looking up at the hoteland then she went back in a hurry on the way to the houseand thats not the worse of it miss  what else has happened  we have made a mistake about the railway said the woman theres a train from london that we didnt notice in the timetable they tell me downstairs it came in more than a quarter of an hour ago please to come back missor i fear we shall be found out  you can go back at once jane said lucilla  by myself  yes thank you for bringing me herehere i remain  she had barely taken her seat again between oscar and me before the door was softly opened from the outside a long thin nervous hand stole in through the opening took the servant by the arm and drew her out into the passage in her place a man entered the room with his hat on the man was nugent dubourg  he stopped where the servant had stopped he looked at lucilla he looked at his brother he looked at me  not a word fell from him there he stood fronting the friend whom he had calumniated and the brother whom he had betrayed there he stoodwith his eyes fixed on lucilla sitting between usknowing that it was all over knowing that the woman for whom he had degraded himself was a woman parted from him for ever there he stood in the hell of his own makingand devoured his torture in silence  on his brothers appearance oscar had risen and had raised lucilla with him he now advanced a step towards nugent still holding to him his betrothed wife  i followed them eagerly watching his face there was no fear in me now of what he might do lucillas blessed influence had found and cast out the lurking demon that had been hidden in him with a mind attentive but not alarmed i waited to see how he would meet the emergency that confronted him  nugent he said very quietly  nugents head droopedhe made no answer  lucilla hearing oscar pronounce the name instantly understood what had happened she shuddered with horror oscar gently placed her in my arms and advanced again alone towards his brother his face expressed the struggle in him of some subtlymingling influences of love and anguish of sorrow and shame he recalled to me in the strangest manner my past experience of him when he had first trusted me with the story of the trial and when he had told me that nugent was the good angel of his life  he went up to the place at which his brother was standing in the simple boyish way so familiar to me in the bygone time he laid his hand on his brothers arm  nugent he said are you the same dear good brother who saved me from dying on the scaffold and who cheered my hard life afterwards are you the same bright clever noble fellow that i was always so fond of and so proud of  he paused and removed his brothers hat with careful caressing hand he parted his brothers ruffled hair over the forehead nugents head sank lower his face was distorted his hands were clenched in the dumb agony of remembrance which that tender voice and that kind hand had set loose in him oscar gave him time to recover himself oscar spoke next to me  you know nugent he said you remember when we first met my telling you that nugent was an angel you saw for yourself when he came to dimchurch how kindly he helped me how faithfully he kept my secrets what a true friend he was look at himand you will feel as i do that we have misunderstood and misinterpreted him in some monstrous way he turned again to nugent i darent tell you he went on what i have heard about you and what i have believed about you and what vile unbrotherly thoughts i have had of being revenged on you thank god they are gone my dear fellow i look back at themnow i see youas i might look back at a horrible dream how can i see you nugent and believe that you have been false to me you a villain who has tried to rob poor me of the only woman in the world who cares for me you so handsome and so popular who may marry any woman you like it cant be you have drifted innocently into some false position without knowing it defend yourself no let me defend you you shant humble yourself to anybody tell me how you have really acted towards lucilla and towards meand leave it to your brother to set you right with everybody come nugent lift up your headand tell me what i shall say  nugent lifted his head and looked at oscar  ghastly as his face was i saw something in his eyes when he first fixed them on his brother which again reminded me of past daysthe days when he had joined us at dimchurch and when he used to talk of poor oscar in the tender lighthearted way that first won me i thought once more of the memorable nightinterview between us at browndown when oscar had left england again i called to mind the signs which had told of the nobler nature of the man pleading with him again i remembered the remorse which had moved him to tearsthe effort he had made in my presence to atone for past misdoing and to struggle for the last time against the guilty passion that possessed him was the nature which could feel that remorse utterly depraved was the man who had made that effortthe last of many that had gone before itirredeemably bad  wait i whispered to lucilla trembling and weeping in my arms he will deserve our sympathy he will win our pardon and our pity yet  come oscar repeated tell me what i shall say  nugent drew from his pocket a sheet of paper with writing on it  say he answered that i gave notice of your marriage at the church hereand that i went to london and got you this  he handed the sheet of paper to his brother it was the marriage license taken out in his brothers name  be happy oscar he added you deserve it  he threw one arm in his old easy protecting way round his brother his hand as he did this touched the breastpocket of oscars coat before it was possible to stop him his dexterous fingers had opened the pocket and had taken from it a little toypistol with a chased silver handle of oscars own workmanship  was this for me he asked with a faint smile my poor boy you could never have done it could you he kissed oscars dark cheek and put the pistol into his own pocket the handle is your work he said i shall take it as your present to me return to browndown when you are married i am going to travel again you shall hear from me before i leave england god bless you oscar goodbye  he put his brother back from him with a firm and gentle hand i attempted to advance with lucilla and speak to him something in his facelooking at me out of his mournful eyes calm stern and superhuman like a look of doomwarned me back from him and filled me with the foreboding that i should see him no more he walked to the door and opened itturnedand fixing his farewell look on lucilla saluted us silently with a bend of his head the door closed on him softly in a few minutes only from the time when he had entered the room he had left us againand left us for ever  we waited spellboundwe could not speak the void that he left behind him was dreary and dreadful i was the first who moved in silence i led lucilla back to our seat on the sofa and beckoned to oscar to go to her in my place  this done i left themand went out to meet lucillas father on his return to the hotel i wished to prevent him from disturbing them after what had happened it was good for those two to be alone    epilogue  madame pratolungos last words  twelve years have passed since the events occurred which it has been the business of these pages to relate i am at my desk looking idly at all the leaves of writing which my pen has filled and asking myself if there is more yet to add before i have done  there is morenot much  oscar and lucilla claim me first two days after they were restored to each other at sydenham they were married at the church in that place it was a dull wedding nobody was in spirits but mr finch we parted in london the bride and bridegroom returned to browndown the rector remained in town for a day or two visiting some friends i went back to my father to accompany him as i had promised on his journey from marseilles to paris  as well as i remember i remained a fortnight abroad in the course of that time i received kind letters from browndown one of them announced that oscar had heard from his brother  nugents letter was not a long one it was dated at liverpool and it announced his embarkation for america in two hours time he had heard of a new expedition to the arctic regionsthen fitting out in the united stateswith the object of discovering the open polar sea supposed to be situated between spitzbergen and nova zembla it had instantly struck him that this expedition offered an entirely new field of study to a landscape painter in search of the sublimest aspects of nature he had decided on volunteering to join the arctic explorersand he had already raised the necessary money for his outfit by the sale of the only valuables he possessedhis jewelry and his books if he wanted more he engaged to apply to oscar in any case he promised to write again before the expedition sailed and so for the present only he would bid his brother and sister affectionately farewellwhen i afterwards looked at the letter myself i found nothing in it which referred in the slightest degree to the past or which hinted at the state of the writers own health and spirits  i returned to our remote southdown village and occupied the room which lucilla had herself prepared for me at browndown  i found the married pair as tranquil and as happy in their union as a man and woman could be the absent nugent dwelt a little sadly in their minds at times i suspect as well as in mine it was perhaps on this account that lucilla appeared to me to be quieter than she used to be in her maiden days however my presence did something towards restoring her to her old spiritsand grosses speedy arrival exerted its enlivening influence in support of mine  as soon as the gout would let him get on his feet he presented himself with his instruments at browndown eager for another experiment on lucillas eyes  if my operations had failed he said i should not have plagued you no more but my operations has not failed it is you who have failed to take care of your nice new eyes when i gave them to you  in those terms he endeavored to persuade her to let him attempt another operation she steadily refused to submit to itand the discussion that followed roused her famously  more than once afterwards grosse tried to make her change her mind he tried in vain the disputes between the two made the house ring again lucilla found all her old gaiety in refuting the grotesque arguments and persuasions of our worthy german to mewhen i once or twice attempted to shake her resolutionshe replied in another way merely repeating the words she had said to me at sydenham my life lives in my love and my love lives in my blindness it is only right to add that mr sebright and another competent authority consulted with him declared unhesitatingly that she was right under the circumstances mr sebright was of opinion that the success of grosses operation could never have been more than temporary his colleague after examining lucillas eyes at a later period entirely agreed with him which was in the rightthese two or grossewho can say as blind lucilla you first knew her as blind lucilla you see the last of her now if you feel inclined to regret this remember that the one thing essential was the thing she possessed her life was a happy one bear this in mindand dont forget that your conditions of happiness need not necessarily be her conditions also  in the time i am now writing of the second letter from nugent arrived it was written the evening before he sailed for the polar seas one line in it touched us deeply who knows whether i shall ever see england again if a boy is born to you oscar call him by my namefor my sake  enclosed in this letter was a private communication from nugent addressed to me it was the confession to which i have alluded in my notes attached to lucillas journal these words only were added at the end you now know everything forgive meif you can i have not escaped without suffering remember that after making use of the narrative as you already know i have burnt it all except those last lines  at distant intervals we heard twice of the exploring ship from whaling vessels then there was a long dreary interval without news of any sort then a dreadful report that the expedition was lost then the confirmation of the reporta lapse of a whole year and no tidings of the missing men  they were well provided with supplies of all kinds and there was a general hope that they might be holding out a new expedition was sentand sent vainlyin search of them overland rewards were offered to whaling vessels to find them and were never earned we wore mourning for nugent we were a melancholy household two more years passedbefore the fate of the expedition was discovered a ship in the whale trade driven out of her course fell in with a wrecked and dismantled vessel lost in the ice let the last sentences of the captains report tell the story  the wreck was drifting along a channel of open water when we first saw it before long it was brought up by an iceberg i got into my boat with some of my sailors and we rowed to the vessel  not a man was to be seen on the deck which was covered with snow we hailed and got no reply i looked in through one of the circular glazed portholes astern and saw dimly the figure of a man seated at a table i knocked on the thick glass but he never moved we got on deck and opened the cabin hatchway and went below the man i had seen was before us at the end of the cabin i led the way and spoke to him he made no answer i looked closer and touched one of his hands which lay on the table to my horror and astonishment he was a frozen corpse  on the table before him was the last entry in the ships log  seventeen days since we have been shut up in the ice our fire went out yesterday the captain tried to light it again and has failed the surgeon and two seamen died of cold this morning the rest of us must soon follow if we are ever discovered i beg the person who finds me to send this  there the hand that held the pen had dropped into the writers lap the left hand still lay on the table between the frozen fingers we found a long lock of a womans hair tied at each end with a blue ribbon the open eyes of the corpse were still fixed on the lock of hair  the name of this man was found in his pocketbook it was nugent dubourg i publish the name in my report in case it may meet the eyes of his friends  examination of the rest of the vessel and comparison of dates with the date of the logbook showed that the officers and crew had been dead for more than two years the positions in which we found the frozen men and the names where it was possible to discover them are here set forth as follows   that lock of a womans hair is now in lucillas possession it will be buried with her at her own request when she dies ah poor nugent are we not all sinners remember the best of him and forget the worst as i do  i still linger over my writingreluctant to leave it if the truth must be told but what more is there to say i hear oscar hammering away at his chasing and whistling blithely over his work in another room lucilla is teaching the piano to her little girl on my table is a letter from mrs finch dated from one of our distant coloniesover which mr finch who has risen gloriously in the world presides pastorally as bishop he harangues the natives to his hearts content and the wonderful natives like it jicks is in her element among the aboriginal members of her fathers congregation there are fears that the wandering arab of the finch family will end in marrying a chief mrs finchi dont expect you to believe thisis anticipating another confinement lucillas eldest boycalled nugenthas just come in and stands by my desk he lifts his bright blue eyes up to mine his round rosy face expresses strong disapproval of what i am doing aunty he says you have written enough come and play  the boy is right i must put away my manuscript and leave you my excellent spirits are a little dashed at parting i wonder whether you are sorry too i shall never know well i have many blessings to comfort me on closing my relations with you i have kind souls who love me andobserve thisi stand on my political principles as firmly as ever the world is getting converted to my way of thinking the pratolungo programme my friends is coming to the front with giant steps long live the republic farewell    the end
