79324451	sebastian melmoth  oscar wilde        london arthur l humphreys 1911    miscellaneous aphorisms followed by the soul of man    the mystery of love is greater than the mystery of death  women are made to be loved not to be understood  it is absurd to have a hard and fast rule about what one should read and what one shouldnt moren than half of modern culture depends on what one shouldnt read  women as someone says love with their ears just as men love with their eyes if they ever love at all  it is better to be beautiful than to be good but it is better to be good than to be ugly  nothing looks so like innocence as an indiscretion  misfortunes one can endure they come from outside they are accidents but to suffer for ones faultsah there is the sting of life  beauty is the only thing that time cannot harm philosophies fall away like sand creeds follow one another but what is beautiful is a joy for all seasons a possession for all eternity  questions are never indiscreet answers sometimes are  twenty years of romance make a woman look like a ruin but twenty years of marriage make her something like a public building  the only thing that one really knows about human nature is that it changes  anyone can sympathise with the sufferings of a friend but it requires a very fine nature to sympathise with a friends success  selfishness is not living as one wishes to live it is asking others to live as one wishes to live and unselfishness is letting other peoples lives alone not interfering with them  a man who does not think for himself does not think at all  nowadays people seem to look on life as a speculation it is not a speculation it is a sacrament its ideal is love its purification is sacrifice  in old days nobody pretended to be a bit better than his neighbour in fact to be a bit better than ones neighbour was considered excessively vulgar and middle class nowadays with our modern mania for morality everyone has to pose as a paragon of purity incorruptibility and all the other seven deadly virtues and what is the result you all go over like ninepinsone after the other  all sympathy is fine but sympathy with suffering is the least fine mode  if you pretend to be good the world takes you very seriously if you pretend to be bad it doesnt such is the astounding stupidity of optimism  it is most dangerous nowadays for a husband to pay any attention to his wife in public it always makes people think that he beats her when theyre alone the world has grown so suspicious of anything that looks like a happy married life  actors are so fortunate they can choose whether they will appear in tragedy or in comedy whether they will suffer or make merry laugh or shed tears but in real life it is different most men and women are forced to perform parts for which they have no qualifications the world is a stage but the play is badly cast  men know life too early women know life too latethat is the difference between men and women  he who stands most remote from his age is he who mirrors it best  there is only one thing in the world worse than being talked about and that is not being talked about  life is not governed by will or intention life is a question of nerves and fibres and slowly builtup cells in which thought hides itself and passion has its dreams  man is a being with myriad lives and myriad sensations a complex multiform creature that bears within itself strange legacies of thought and passion and whose very flesh is tainted with the monstrous maladies of the dead  as long as a woman can look ten years younger than her own daughter she is perfectly satisfied  there is always something infinitely mean about other peoples tragedies  public and private life are different things they have different laws and move on different lines  when one is placed in the position of guardian one has to adopt a very high moral tone on all subjects its ones duty to do so  i have always been of opinion that a man who desires to get married should know either everything or nothing  an engagement should come on a young girl as a surprise pleasant or unpleasant as the case may be it is hardly a matter that she could be allowed to arrange for herself  if the lower classes dont set us a good example what on earth is the use of them they seem as a class to have absolutely no sense of moral responsibility  if a woman cannot make her mistakes charming she is only a female  the world was made for men and not for women  it is always with the best intentions that the worst work is done  if you wish to understand others you must intensify your own individualism  why do you talk so trivially about life because i think that life is far too important a thing ever to talk seriously about it  what a pity that in life we only get our lessons when they are of no use to us  it is better to have a permanent income than to be fascinating  relations are simply a tedious pack of people who havent got the remotest knowledge of how to live nor the smallest instinct about when to die  charity creates a multitude of sins  my experience is that as soon as people are old enough to know better they dont know anything at all  truth is a very complex thing and politics is a very complex business there are wheels within wheels one may be under certain obligations to people that one must pay sooner or later in political life one has to compromise everyone does  men can love what is beneath themthings unworthy stained dishonoured we women worship when we love and when we lose our worship we lose everything  the proper basis for marriage is a mutual misunderstanding  the one advantage of playing with fire is that one never gets even singed it is the people who dont know how to play with it who get burned up  there are moments when one has to choose between living ones own life fully entirely completely or dragging out some false shallow degrading existence that the world in its hypocrisy demands  when one is in town one amuses oneself when one is in the country one amuses other people it is excessively boring  romance is the privilege of the rich not the profession of the unemployed the poor should be practical and prosaic  an acquaintance that begins with a compliment is sure to develop into a real friendship it starts in the right manner  the truths of metaphysics are the truths of masks  science can never grapple with the irrational that is why it has no future before it in this world  the happy people of the world have their value but only the negative value of foils they throw up and emphasise the beauty and the fascination of the unhappy  in this world there are only two tragedies one is not getting what one wants and the other is getting it the last is much the worstthe last is a real tragedy  disobedience in the eyes of anyone who has read history is mans original virtue it is through disobedience that progress has been madethrough disobedience and rebellion  it is not wise to find symbols in everything that one sees it makes life too full of terrors  comfort is the only thing our civilisation can give us  politics are my only pleasure you see nowadays it is not fashionable to flirt till one is forty or to be romantic till one is fortyfive so we poor women who are under thirty or say we are have nothing open to us but politics or philanthropy and philanthropy seems to me to have become simply the refuge of people who wish to annoy their fellowcreatures i prefer politics i think they are more  becoming  ones past is what one is it is the only way by which people should be judged  in a very ugly and sensible age the arts borrow not from life but from each other  it is always a silly thing to give advice but to give good advice is fatal  secrets from other peoples wives are a necessary luxury in modern life so at least i am told at the club by people who are bald enough to know better but no man should have a secret from his own wife she invariably finds it out women have a wonderful instinct about things they discover everything except the obvious  life holds the mirror up to art and either reproduces some strange type imagined by painter or sculptor or realises in fact what has been dreamed in fiction  i feel sure that if i lived in the country for six months i should become so unsophisticated that no one would take the slightest notice of me  to recommend thrift to the poor is both grotesque and insulting it is like advising a man who is starving to eat less  a thing is not necessarily true because a man dies for it  i am always saying what i shouldnt say in fact i usually say what i really thinka great mistake nowadays it makes one so liable to be misunderstood  experience is the name everyone gives to their mistakes  the true perfection of man lies not in what man has but in what man is  the basis of every scandal is an absolute immoral certainty  people talk so much about the beauty of confidence they seem to entirely ignore the much more subtle beauty of doubt to believe is very dull to doubt is intensely engrossing to be on the alert is to live to be lulled into security is to die  every effect that one produces gives one an enemy to be popular one must be a mediocrity  it is a sad truth but we have lost the faculty of giving lovely names to things names are everything i never quarrel with actions my one quarrel is with words that is the reason i hate vulgar realism in literature the man who could call a spade a spade should be compelled to use one it is the only thing he is fit for  a high moral tone can hardly be said to conduce very much to either ones health or ones happiness  there are terrible temptations that it requires strengthstrength and courageto yield to to stake all ones life on one throwwhether the stake be power or pleasure i care notthere is no weakness in that there is a horrible a terrible courage  nowadays it is only the unreadable that occurs  all charming people are spoiled it is the secret of their attraction  there is more to be said for stupidity than people imagine personally i have a great admiration for stupidity it is a sort of fellowfeeling i suppose  all men are monsters the only thing to do is to feed the wretches well a good cook does wonders  there is no such thing as an omen  destiny does not send us heralds she is too wise or too cruel for that  crying is the refuge of plain women but the ruin of pretty ones  love art for its own sake and then all things that you need will be added to you this devotion to beauty and to the creation of beautiful things is the test of all great civilisations it is what makes the life of each citizen a sacrament and not a speculation  it is always worth while asking a question though it is not always answering one  it takes a thoroughly good woman to do a thoroughly stupid thing  with a proper background women can do anything  chiromancy is a most dangerous science and one that ought not to be encouraged except in a têteàtête  one should never take sides in anything taking sides is the beginning of sincerity and earnestness follows shortly afterwards and the human being becomes a bore  the work of art is beautiful by being what art never has been and to measure it by the standard of the past is to measure it by a standard on the reflection of which its real perfection depends  there are three kinds of despots there is the despot who tyrannises over the body there is the despot who tyrannises over the soul there is the despot who tyrannises over soul and body alike the first is called the prince the second is called the pope the third is called the people  costume is a growth an evolution and a most important perhaps the most important sign of the manners customs and mode of life of each century  i really dont see anything romantic in proposing it is very romantic to be in love but there is nothing romantic about a definite proposal why one may be accepted one usually is i believe then the excitement is all over the very essence of romance is uncertainty  what consoles one nowadays is not repentance but pleasure repentance is quite out of date  ideals are dangerous things realities are better they wound but they are better  unless one is wealthy there is no use in being a charming fellow  shallow sorrows and shallow loves live on the loves and sorrows that are great are destroyed by their own plenitude  an eternal smile is much more wearisome than a perpetual frown the one sweeps away all possibilities the other suggests a thousand  to disagree with threefourths of england on all points is one of the first elements of vanity which is a deep source of consolation in all moments of spiritual doubt  women live by their emotions and for them they have no philosophy of life  as long as war is regarded as wicked it will always have a fascination when it is looked upon as vulgar it will cease to be popular  there is only one thing worse than injustice and that is justice without her sword in her hand when right is not might it is evil  we spend our days each one of us in looking for the secret of life well the secret of life is in art  the truth isnt quite the sort of thing that one tells to a nice sweet refined girl  if one plays good music people dont listen and if one plays bad music people dont talk  how fond women are of doing dangerous things it is one of the qualities in them that i admire most a woman will flirt with anybody in the world as long as other people are looking on  englishwomen conceal their feelings till after they are married they show them then  moderation is a fatal thing nothing succeeds like excess  actions are the first tragedy in life words are the second words are perhaps the worst words are merciless  life is terrible it rules us we do not rule it  in art there is no such thing as a universal truth a truth in art is that whose contradictory is also true  ones days are too brief to take the burden of anothers sorrows on ones shoulders each man lives his own life and pays his own price for living it the only pity is that one has to pay so often for a single fault one has to pay over and over again indeed in her dealings with man destiny never closes her accounts  pleasure is natures test her sign of approval when we are happy we are always good but when we are good we are not always happy  the people who love only once in their lives are really the shallow people what they call their loyalty and their fidelity i call either the lethargy of custom or their lack of imagination  better to take pleasure in a rose than to put its root under a microscope  of shakespeare it may be said that he was the first to see the dramatic value of doublets and that a climax may depend on a crinoline  plain women are always jealous of their husbands beautiful women never are they never have time they are always so occupied in being jealous of other peoples husbands  what between the duties expected of one during ones lifetime and the duties exacted from one after ones death land has ceased to be either a profit or a pleasure it gives one position and prevents one from keeping it up  a man who moralises is usually a hypocrite and a woman who moralises is invariably plain there is nothing in the whole world so unbecoming to a woman as a nonconformist conscience and most women know it i am glad to say  it was a fatal day when the public discovered that the pen is mightier than the pavingstone and can be made as offensive as a brickbat  a map of the world that does not include utopia is not worth even glancing at for it leaves out the one country at which humanity is always landing and when humanity lands there it looks out and seeing a better country sets sail progress is the realisation of utopias  what is the difference between scandal and gossip oh gossip is charming history is merely gossip but scandal is gossip made tedious by morality  all beautiful things belong to the same age  it is personalities not principles that move the age  modern pictures are no doubt delightful to look at at least some of them are but they are quite impossible to live with they are too clever too assertive too intellectual their meaning is too obvious and their method too clearly defined one exhausts what they have to say in a very short time and then they become as tedious as ones relations  to know nothing about our great men is one of the necessary elements of english education  the truth is rarely pure and never simple modern life would be very tedious if it were either and modern literature a complete impossibility  you may laugh but it is a great thing to come across a woman who thoroughly understands one  the majority of people spoil their lives by an unhealthy and exaggerated altruism  the number of women in london who flirt with their own husbands is perfectly scandalous it looks so bad it is simply washing ones clean linen in public  the chief thing that makes life a failure from the artistic point of view is the thing that lends to life its sordid securitythe fact that one can never repeat exactly the same emotion  we teach people how to remember we never teach them how to grow  vulgar habit that is people have nowadays of asking one after one has given them an idea whether one is serious or not nothing is serious except passion the intellect is not a serious thing and never has been it is an instrument on which one plays that is all the only serious form of intellect i know is the british intellect and on the british intellect the illiterate always plays the drum  it is absurd to divide people into good and bad people are either charming or tedious  it is only the modern that ever become oldfashioned  it is only the philistine who seeks to estimate a personality by the vulgar test of production  musical people are so absurdly unreasonable they always want one to be perfectly dumb at the very moment when one is longing to be absolutely deaf  nothing is so dangerous as being too modern one is apt to grow oldfashioned quite suddenly  the fact of a man being a poisoner is nothing against his prose the domestic virtues are not the true basis of art  to the philosopher women represent the triumph of matter over mind just as men represent the triumph of mind over morals  the only way a woman can ever reform a man is by boring him so completely that he loses all possible interest in life  the only horrible thing in the world is ennui that is the one sin for which there is no forgiveness  french songs i cannot possibly allow people always seem to think that they are improper and either look shocked which is vulgar or laugh which is worse  it has often been made a subject of reproach against artists and men of letters that they are lacking in wholeness and completeness of nature as a rule this must necessarily be so that very concentration of vision and inversity of purpose which is the characteristic of the artistic temperament is in itself a mode of limitation to those who are preoccupied with the beauty of form nothing else seems of so much importance  the work of art is to dominate the spectator the spectator is not to dominate the work of art  one should sympathise with the joy the beauty the colour of life the less said about lifes sores the better  you cant make people good by act of parliamentthat is something  art creates an incomparable and unique effect and having done so passes on to other things nature on the other hand forgetting that imitation can be made the sincerest form of insult keeps on repeating the effect until we all become absolutely wearied of it  it is perfectly monstrous the way people go about nowadays saying things against one behind ones back that are absolutely and entirely true  a true artist takes no notice whatever of the public the public are to him nonexistent  one should never trust a woman who tells one her real age a woman who would tell one that would tell one anything  nothing is so aggravating as calmness there is something positively brutal about the good temper of most modern men i wonder we women stand it as well as we do  the truth is a thing i get rid of as soon as possible bad habit by the way makes one very unpopular at the club  with the older members they call it being conceited perhaps it is  my own business always bores me to death i prefer other peoples  dont be led astray into the paths of virtuethat is the worst of women they always want one to be good and if we are good when they meet us they dont love us at all they like to find us quite irretrievably bad and to leave us quite unattractively good  men are such cowards they outrage every law in the world and are afraid of the worlds tongue  wicked women bother one good women bore one that is the only difference between them  to know the principles of the highest art is to know the principles of all the arts  i dont believe in the existence of puritan women i dont think there is a woman in the world who would not be a little flattered if one made love to her it is that which makes women so irresistibly adorable  when i am in trouble eating is the only thing that consoles me indeed when i am in really great trouble as anyone who knows me intimately will tell you i refuse everything except food and drink  when one is going to lead an entirely new life one requires regular and wholesome meals  the soul is born old but grows young that is the comedy of life the body is born young and grows old that is lifes tragedy  one can survive everything nowadays except death and live down anything except a good reputation  the past is of no importance the present is of no importance it is with the future that we have to deal for the past is what men should not have been the present is what men ought not to be the future is what artists are  men become old but they never become good  by persistently remaining single a man converts himself into a permanent public temptation men should be more careful this very celibacy leads weaker vessels astray  i think that in practical life there is something about success actual success that is a little unscrupulous something about ambition that is scrupulous always  every man of ambition has to fight his century with its own weapons what this century worships is wealth the god of this century is wealth to succeed one must have wealth at all costs one must have wealth  i love scandals about other people but scandals about myself dont interest me they have not got the charm of novelty  moderation is a fatal thing enough is as bad as a meal more than enough is as good as a feast  the english cant stand a man who is always saying he is in the right but they are very fond of a man who admits he has been in the wrong it is one of the best things in them  life is simply a mauvais quart dheure made up of exquisite moments  there is the same world for all of us and good and evil sin and innocence go through it hand in hand to shut ones eyes to half of life that one may live securely is as though one blinded oneself that one might walk with more safety in a land of pit and precipice  married men are horribly tedious when they are good husbands and abominably conceited when they are not  between men and women there is no friendship possible there is passion enmity worship love but no friendship  everybody is clever nowadays you cant go anywhere without meeting clever people this has become an absolute public nuisance  i dont think man has much capacity for development he has got as far as he can and that is not far is it  i am not quite sure that i quite know what pessimism really means all i do know is that life cannot be understood without much charity cannot be lived without much charity it is love and not german philosophy that is the explanation of this world whatever may be the explanation of the next  i do not approve of anything that that tampers with natural arrogance ignorance is like a delicate exotic fruit touch it and the blossom is gone  the whole theory of modern education is radically unsound fortunately in england at any rate education produces no effect whatsoever if it did it would prove a serious danger to the upper classes and probably lead to acts of violence in grosvenor square  no woman should ever be quite accurate about her age it looks so calculating  emotion for the sake of emotion is the aim of art and emotion for the sake of emotion is the aim of life and of that practical organisation of life that we call society  men of the noblest possible moral character are extremely susceptible to the influence of the physical charms of others modern no less than ancient history supplies us with many most painful examples of what i refer to if it were not so indeed history would be quite unreadable  i am not in favour of long engagements they give people the opportunity of finding out each others character before marriage which i think is never advisable  it is a terrible thing for a man to find out suddenly that all his life he has been speaking nothing but the truth  the two weak points in our age are its want of principle and its want of profile  thirtyfive is a very attractive age london society is full of women who have of their own free choice remained thirtyfive for years  never speak disrespectfully of society only people who cant get into it do that  it is always painful to part with people whom one has known for a very brief space of time the absence of old friends one can endure with equanimity but even a momentary separation from anyone to whom one has just been introduced is almost unbearable  to be natural is to be obvious and to be obvious is to be inartistic  one is tempted to define man as a rational animal who always loses his temper when he is called upon to act in accordance with the dictates of reason  the essence of thought as the essence of life is growth  what people call insincerity is simply a method by which we can multiply our personalities  in a temple everyone should be serious except the thing that is worshipped  we are never more true to ourselves than when we are inconsistent  there is always something ridiculous about the emotions of people whom one has ceased to love  intellectual generalities are always interesting but generalities in morals mean absolutely nothing  to be in society is merely a bore but to be out of it simply a tragedy  we live in an age when unnecessary things are our only necessities  one should never make ones début with a scandal one should reserve that to give an interest to ones old age  what man has sought for is indeed neither pain nor pleasure but simply life man has sought to live intensely fully perfectly when he can do so without exercising restraint on others or suffering it ever and his activities are all pleasurable to him he will be saner healthier more civilised more himself pleasure is natures test her sign of approval when man is happy he is in harmony with himself and his environment  society often forgives the criminal it never forgives the dreamer  it is so easy for people to have sympathy with suffering it is so difficult for them to have sympathy with thought  conversation should touch on everything but should concentrate itself on nothing  there is a luxury in selfreproach when we blame ourselves we feel that no one else has a right to blame us it is the confession not the priest that gives us absolution  there are only two kinds of people who are really fascinatingpeople who know absolutely everything and people who know absolutely nothing  the public is wonderfully tolerant it forgives everything except genius  life makes us pay too high a price for its wares and we purchase the meanest of its secrets at a cost that is monstrous and infinite  this horrid house of commons quite ruins our husbands for us i think the lower house by far the greatest blow to a happy married life that there has been since that terrible thing they called the higher education of women was invented  once a man begins to neglect his domestic duties he becomes painfully effeminate does he not and i dont like that it makes men so very attractive  experience is a question of instinct about life  what is true about art is true about life  one can always be kind to people about whom one cares nothing  i like men who have a future and women who have a past  women as some witty frenchman put it inspire us with the desire to do masterpieces and always prevent us from carrying them out  in matters of grave importance style not sincerity is the vital thing  the only way to behave to a woman is to make love to her if she is pretty and to someone else if she is plain  women give to men the very gold of their lives possibly but they invariably want it back in such very small change  define women as a sex sphinxes without secrets  what do you call a bad man the sort of man who admires innocence  what do you call a bad woman oh the sort of woman a man never gets tired of  one can resist everything except temptation  dont let us go to life for our fulfilment or our experience it is a thing narrowed by circumstances incoherent in its utterance and without that fine correspondence or form and spirit which is the only thing that can satisfy the artistic and critical temperament  it is a dangerous thing to reform anyone  one can always know at once whether a man has home claims upon his life or not i have noticed a very very sad expression in the eyes of so many married men  a mother who doesnt part with a daughter every season has no real affection  to be good is to be in harmony with oneself discord is to be forced to be in harmony with others  a really grand passion is comparatively rare nowadays it is the privilege of people who have nothing to do that is the one use of the idle classes in a country  there is no secret of life lifes aim if it has one is simply to be always looking for temptations there are not nearly enough of them i sometimes pass a whole day without coming across a single one it is quite dreadful it makes one so nervous about the future  all thought is immoral its very essence is destruction if you think of anything you kill it nothing survives being thought of  what is truth in matters of religion it is simply the opinion that has survived in matters of science it is the ultimate sensation in matters of art it is ones last mood  it is so easy to convert others it is so difficult to convert oneself  a little sincerity is a dangerous thing and a great deal of it is absolutely fatal  life cheats us with shadows like a puppetmaster we ask it for pleasure it gives it to us with bitterness and disappointment in its train we come across some noble grief that we think will lend the purple dignity of tragedy to our days but it passes away from us and things less noble take its place and on some grey windy dawn or odorous eve of silence and of silver we find ourselves looking with callous wonder or dull heart of stone at the tress of goldflecked hair that we had once so wildly worshipped and so madly kissed  there are two ways of disliking art one is to dislike it and the other to like it rationally  there is nothing sane about the worship of beauty it is too splendid to be sane those of whose lives it forms the dominant note will always seem to the world to be mere visionaries  i am afraid that good people do a great deal of harm in this world certainly the greatest harm they do is that they make badness of such extraordinary importance  a sentimentalist is a man who sees an absurd value in everything and doesnt know the marked price of any single thing  punctuality is the thief of time  selfculture is the true ideal for man  theres nothing in the world like the devotion of a married woman its a thing no married man knows anything about  no woman should have a memory memory in a woman is the beginning of dowdiness one can always tell from a womans bonnet whether she has got a memory or not  there are things that are right to say but that may be said at the wrong time and to the wrong people  the meaning of any beautiful created thing is at least as much in the soul of him who looks at it as it was in his soul who wrought it nay it is rather the beholder who lends to the beautiful thing its myriad meanings and makes it marvellous for us and sets it in some new relation to the age so that it becomes a vital portion of our lives and a symbol of what we pray for or perhaps of what having prayed for we fear that we may receive  the renaissance was great because it sought to solve no social problem and busied itself not about such things but suffered the individual to develop freely beautifully and naturally and so had great and individual artists and great and individual men  in england people actually try to be brilliant at breakfast that is so dreadful of them only dull people are brilliant at breakfast  when one is in love one begins by deceiving oneself and one ends by deceiving others that is what the world calls a romance  the secret of life is never to have an emotion that is unbecoming  no artist is ever morbid the artist can express everything  the development of the race depends on the development of the individual and where selfculture has ceased to be the ideal the intellectual standard is instantly lowered and often ultimately lost  an idea that is not dangerous is unworthy of being called an idea at all  to elope is cowardly it is running away from danger and danger has become so rare in modern life  when a man is old enough to do wrong he should be old enough to do right also  the book of life begins with a man and a woman in a garden it ends with revelations  in married life three is company and two is none  out of ourselves we can never pass nor can there be in creation what in the creator was not  dont tell me that you have exhausted life when a man says that one knows that life has exhausted him  when a woman marries again it is because she detested her first husband when a man marries again it is because he adored his first wife women try their luck men risk theirs  the highest criticism really is the record of ones own soul it is more fascinating than history as it is concerned simply with oneself it is more delightful than philosophy as its subject is concrete and not abstract real and not vague it is the only civilised form of autobiography as it deals not with the events but with the thoughts of ones life not with lifes physical accidents of deed or circumstance but with the spiritual moods and imaginative passions of the mind  to know anything about oneself one must know all about others  duty is what one expects from others it is not what one does oneself  after a good dinner one can forgive anybody even ones own relations  talk to every woman as if you loved her and to every man as if he bored you and at the end of your first season you will have the reputation of possessing the most perfect social tact  manpoor awkward reliable necessary manbelongs to a sex that has been rational for millions and millions of years he cant help himself it is in his race the history of women is very different they have always been picturesque protests against the mere existence of commonsense they saw its dangers from the first  more marriages are ruined nowadays by the commonsense of the husband than by anything else how can a woman be expected to be happy with a man who insists on treating her as if she were a perfectly rational being  it is very vulgar to talk about ones business only people like stockbrokers do that and then merely at dinnerparties  it is awfully hard work doing nothing however i dont mind hard work when there is no definite object of any kind  to do nothing at all is the most difficult thing in the world the most difficult and the most intellectual to plato with his passion for wisdom this was the noblest form of energy  to aristotle with his passion for knowledge this was the noblest form of energy also it was to this that the passion for holiness led the saint and the mystic of mediæval days  youth there is nothing like it it is absurd to talk of the ignorance of youth the only people to whose opinions i listen now with any respect are persons much younger than myself they seem in front of me life has revealed to them her latest wonder  romance lives by repetition and repetition converts an appetite into an art  i adore simple pleasures they are the last refuge of the complex  there is nothing like youth the middleaged are mortgaged to life the old are in lifes lumberroom but youth is the lord of life youth has a kingdom waiting for it everyone is born a king and most people die in exilelike most kings  all crime is vulgar just as all vulgarity is crime  society civilised society at least is never very ready to believe anything to the detriment of those who are both rich and fascinating it instinctively feels that manners are of more importance than morals and in its opinion the highest respectability is of much less value than the possession of a good chef and after all it is a very poor consolation to be told that the man who has given one a bad dinner or poor wine is irreproachable in his private life even the cardinal virtues cannot atone for halfcold entrees  while in the opinion of society contemplation is the gravest thing of which any citizen can be guilty in the opinion of the highest culture it is the proper occupation of man  life is terribly deficient in form its catastrophes happen in the wrong way and to the wrong people there is a grotesque horror about its comedies and its tragedies seem to culminate in farce one is always wounded when one approaches it things last either too long or not long enough  if a woman wants to hold a man she has merely to appeal to what is worst in him  we are all in the gutter but some of us are looking at the stars  beauty has as many meanings as man has moods it is the symbol of symbols it reveals everything because it expresses nothing when it shows us itself it shows us the whole fierycoloured world  men always want to be a womans first love that is their clumsy vanity women have a more subtle instinct about things what they like is to be a mans last romance  anything approaching to the free play of the mind is practically unknown amongst us people cry out against the sinner yet it is not the sinful but the stupid who are our shame there is no sin except stupidity  one regrets the loss even of ones worst habits perhaps one regrets them the most they are such an essential part of ones personality  it is through art and through art only that we can realise our perfection through art and through art only that we can shield ourselves from the sordid perils of actual existence  a man who can dominate a london dinnertable can dominate the world the future belongs to the dandy it is the exquisites who are going to rule  it often happens that the real tragedies of life occur in such an inartistic manner that they hurt us by their crude violence their absolute incoherence their absurd want of meaning their entire lack of style they affect us just as vulgarity affects us they give us an impression of sheer brute force and we revolt against that sometimes however a tragedy that possesses artistic elements of beauty crosses our lives if these elements of beauty are real the whole thing simply appeals to our sense of dramatic effect suddenly we find that we are no longer the actors but the spectators of the play or rather we are both we watch ourselves and the mere wonder of the spectacle enthrals us  when a woman finds out that her husband is absolutely indifferent to her she either becomes dreadfully dowdy or wears very smart bonnets that some other womans husband has to pay for  it is immoral to use private property in order to alleviate the horrible evils that result from the institution of private property  it is a mistake to think that the passion one feels in creation is ever really shown in the work one creates art is always more abstract than we fancy form and colour tell us of form and colourthat is all  it is sometimes said that the tragedy of an artists life is that he cannot realise his ideal but the true tragedy that dogs the steps of most artists is that they realise their ideal too absolutely for when the ideal is realised it is robbed of its wonder and its mystery and becomes simply a new startingpoint for an ideal that is other than itself  people who go in for being consistent have just as many moods as others have the only difference is that their moods are rather meaningless  it is only shallow people who require years to get rid of an emotion a man who is master of himself can end a sorrow as easily as he can invent a pleasure  good women have such a limited view of life their horizon is so small their interests so petty the fact is they are not modern and to be modern is the only thing worth being nowadays  discontent is the first step in the progress of a man or a nation  men marry because they are tired women because they are curious both are disappointed  all men are married womens property that is the only true definition of what married womens property really is  i am not in favour of this modern mania for turning bad people into good people at a moments notice as a man sows so let him reap  nothing refines but the intellect  it is very painful for me to be forced to speak the truth it is the first time in my life that i have ever been reduced to such a painful position and i am really quite inexperienced in doing anything of the kind  the man who regards his past is a man who deserves to have no future to look forward to  just as it is only by contact with the art of foreign nations that the art of a country gains that individual and separate life that we call nationality so by curious inversion it is only by intensifying his own personality that the critic can interpret the personality of others and the more strongly this personality enters into the interpretation the more real the interpretation becomes the more satisfying the more convincing and the more true  man is least himself when he talks in his own person give him a mask and he will tell you the truth  all women become like their mothers that is their tragedy no man does that is his  women are a fascinatingly wilful sex every woman is a rebel and usually in wild revolt against herself  one should always be in love that is the reason one should never marry  no man came across two ideal things few come across one  to become the spectator of ones own life is to escape the suffering of life  the state is to make what is useful the individual is to make what is beautiful  a community is infinitely more brutalised by the habitual employment of punishment than it is by the occasional occurrence of crime  the systems that fail are those that rely on the permanency of human nature and not on its growth and development  jealousy which is an extraordinary source of crime in modern life is an emotion closely bound up with our conceptions of property and under socialism and individualism will die out it is remarkable that in communistic tribes jealousy is entirely unknown  all art is immoral  he to whom the present is the only thing that is present knows nothing of the age in which he lives to realise the nineteenth century one must realise every century that has preceded it and that has contributed to its making  few parents nowadays pay any regard to what their children say to them the oldfashioned respect for the young is fast dying out  the history of woman is the history of the worst form of tyranny the world has ever known the tyranny of the weak over the strong it is the only tyranny that lasts  the happiness of a married man depends on the people he has not married  there is no one type for man there are as many perfections as there are imperfect men and while to the claims of charity a man may yield and yet be free to the claims of conformity no man may yield and remain free at all  a practical scheme is either a scheme that is already in existence or a scheme that could be carried out under existing conditions  all imitation in morals and in life is wrong  the world has been made by fools that wise men may live in it  women love us for our defects if we have enough of them they will forgive us everything even our gigantic intellects  society is a necessary thing no man has any real success in this world unless he has got women to back himand women rule society if you have not got women on your side you are quite over you might just as well be a barrister or a stockbroker or a journalist at once  the worship of the senses has often and with much justice been decried men feeling a natural instinct of terror about passions and sensations that seem stronger than themselves and that they are conscious of sharing with the less highly organised forms of existence but it is probable the true nature of the senses has never been understood and that they have remained savage and animal merely because the world has sought to starve them into submission or to kill them by pain instead of aiming at making them elements of a new spirituality of which a fine instinct for beauty will be the dominant characteristic  women appreciate cruelty more than anything else they have wonderfully primitive instincts we have emancipated them but they remain slaves looking for their master all the same they love being dominated  those who try to lead the people can only do so by following the mob it is through the voice of one crying in the wilderness that the way of the gods must be prepared  circumstances are the lashes laid on to us by life some of us have to receive them with bared ivory backs and others are permitted to keep on a coatthat is the only difference  criticism is itself an art it is no more to be judged by any low standard of imitation or resemblance than is the work of poet or sculptor the critic occupies the same relation to the work of art that he criticises as the artist does to the visible world of form and colour or the unseen world of passion and thought he does not even require for the perfection of his art the finest materials anything will serve his purpose  it is very much more difficult to talk about a thing than to do it in the sphere of actual life that is of course obvious anybody can make history only a great man can write it  if we lived long enough to see the results of our actions it may be that those who call themselves good would be filled with a wild remorse and those whom the world calls evil stirred with a noble joy each little thing that we do passes into the great machine of life which may grind our virtues to powder and make them worthless or transform our sins into elements of a new civilisation more marvellous and more splendid than any that has gone before  children begin by loving their parents as they grow older they judge them sometimes they forgive them  we live in an age that reads too much to be wise and that thinks too much to be beautiful  one should absorb the colour of life but one should never remember its details details are always vulgar  it will be a marvellous thingthe true personality of manwhen we see it it will grow naturally and simply flowerlike or as a tree grows it will not be at discord it will never argue or dispute it will not prove things it will know everything and yet it will not busy itself about knowledge it will have wisdom its value will not be measured by material things it will have nothing and yet it will have everything and whatever one takes from it it will still have so rich it will be it will not be always meddling with others or asking them to be like itself it will love them because they will be different and yet while it will not meddle with others it will help all as a beautiful thing helps us by being what it is the personality of man will be very wonderful it will be as wonderful as the personality of a child  cynicism is merely the art of seeing things as they are instead of as they ought to be  three addresses always inspire confidence even in tradesmen  if one doesnt talk about a thing it has never happened it is simply expression that gives reality to things  no man is able who is unable to get on just as no woman is clever who cant succeed in obtaining that worst and most necessary of evils a husband  the one charm of the past is that it is the past but women never know when the curtain has fallen they always want a sixth act and as soon as the interest of the play is entirely over they propose to continue it if they were allowed their way every comedy would have a tragic ending and every tragedy would culminate in a farce they are charmingly artificial but they have no sense of art  each time that one loves is the only time that one has ever loved difference of object does not alter singleness of passion it merely intensifies it  the real tragedy of the poor is that they can afford nothing but selfdenial beautiful sins like beautiful things are the privilege of the rich  human life is the one thing worth investigating compared to it there is nothing else of any value it is true that as one watches life in its curious crucible of pain and pleasure one cannot wear over ones face a mask of glass nor keep the sulphurous fumes from troubling the brain and making the imagination turbid with monstrous fancies and misshapen dreams there are poisons so subtle that to know their properties one has to sicken of them there are maladies so strange that one has to pass through them if one seeks to understand their nature and yet what a great reward one receives how wonderful the whole world becomes to one to note the curious hard logic of passion and the emotional coloured life of the intellectto observe where they meet and where they separate at what point they are in unison and at what point they are in discordthere is a delight in that what matter what the cost is one can never pay too high a price for any sensation  there is only one class in the community that thinks more about money than the rich and that is the poor the poor can think of nothing else that is the misery of being poor  to live is the rarest thing in the world most people existthat is all  personality is a very mysterious thing a man cannot always be estimated by what he does he may keep the law and yet be worthless he may break the law and yet be fine he may be bad without ever doing anything bad he may commit a sin against society and yet realise through that sin his true perfection  mediæval art is charming but mediæval emotions are out of date one can use them in fiction of course but then the only things that one can use in fiction are the only things that one has ceased to use in fact  man is complete in himself  what is a cynic a man who knows the price of everything and the value of nothing  its the old old story lovewell not at first sightbut love at the end of the season which is so much more satisfactory  no nice girl should ever waltz with such particularly younger sons it looks so fast  good resolutions are useless attempts to interfere with scientific laws their origin is pure vanity their result is absolutely nil they give us now and then some of those luxurious sterile emotions that have a certain charm for the weak that is all that can be said for them they are simply cheques that men draw on a bank where they have no account  what is the difference between literature and journalism journalism is unreadable and literature is unread  i hope you have not been leading a double life pretending to be wicked and being really good all the time that would be hypocrisy  my husband is a sort of promissory note i am tired of meeting him  conscience makes egotists of us all  never trust a woman who wears mauve whatever her age may be or a woman over thirtyfive who is fond of pink ribbons it always means that they have a history  there is a fatality about good resolutionsthey are always made too late  we can have in life but one great experience at best and the secret of life is to reproduce that experience as often as possible  anybody can be good in the country there are no temptations there that is the reason why people who live out of town are so absolutely uncivilised civilisation is not by any means an easy thing to attain to there are only two ways by which man can reach it one is by being cultured the other by being corrupt country people have no opportunity of being either so they stagnate  what nonsense people talk about happy marriages a man can be happy with any woman so long as he does not love her  the things one feels absolutely certain about are never true that is the fatality of faith and the lesson of romance  in the common world of fact the wicked are not punished nor the good rewarded success is given to the strong failure thrust upon the weak  nothing should be able to harm a man except himself nothing should be able to rob a man at all what a man really has is what is in him what is outside of him should be a matter of no importance  modern morality consists in accepting the standard of ones age i consider that for any man of culture to accept the standard of his age is a form of the grossest immorality  perplexity and mistrust fan affection into passion and so bring about those beautiful tragedies that alone make life worth living women once felt this while men did not and so women once ruled the world  sin is a thing that writes itself across a mans face it cannot be concealed people talk sometimes of secret vices there are no such things  if a wretched man has a vice it shows itself in the lines of his mouth the drop of his eyelids the moulding of his hands even  there are sins whose fascination is more in the memory than in the doing of them strange triumphs that gratify the pride more than the passions and give to the intellect a quickened sense of joy greater than they bring or can ever bring to the senses  no civilised man ever regrets a pleasure and no uncivilised man ever knows what a pleasure is  as for a spoiled life no life is spoiled but one whose growth is arrested if you want to mar a nature you have merely to reform it  socialism itself will be of value simply because it will lead to individualism  some years ago people went about the country saying that property has duties it is perfectly true property not merely has duties but has so many duties that its possession to any large extent is a bore if property had simply pleasures we could stand it but its duties make it unbearable  it is through joy that the individualism of the future will develop itself christ made no attempt to reconstruct society and consequently the individualism that he preached to man could be realised only through pain or in solitude  most people become bankrupt through having invested too heavily in the prose of life to have ruined oneself over poetry is an honour  the only artists i have ever known who are personally delightful are bad artists good artists exist simply on what they make and consequently are perfectly uninteresting in what they are  what are the virtues nature renan tells us cares little about chastity and it may be that it is to the shame of the magdalen and not to their own purity that the lucretias of modern life owe their freedom from stain charity as even those of whose religion it makes a formal part have been compelled to acknowledge creates a multitude of evils the mere existence of conscience that faculty of which people prate so much nowadays and are so ignorantly proud is a sign of our imperfect development it must be merged in instinct before we become fine selfdenial is simply a method by which man arrests his progress and selfsacrifice a survival of the mutilation of the savage part of that old worship of pain which is so terrible a factor in the history of the world and which even now makes its victims day by day and has its altars in the land virtues who knows what the virtues are not you not i not anyone it is well for our vanity that we slay the criminal for if we suffered him to live he might show us what we had gained by his crime it is well for his peace that the saint goes to his martyrdom he is spared the sight of the horror of his harvest  nowadays all the married men live like bachelors and all the bachelors like married men  the higher education of men is what i should like to see men need it so sadly  the world is perfectly packed with good women to know them is a middleclass education  hesitation of any kind is a sign of mental decay in the young of physical weakness in the old  our husbands never appreciate anything in us we have to go to others for that  most women in london nowadays seem to furnish their rooms with nothing but orchids foreigners and french novels  the canons of good society are or should be the same as the canons of art form is absolutely essential to it it should have the dignity of a ceremony as well as its unreality and should combine the insincere character of a romantic play with the wit and beauty that make such plays delightful to us is sincerity such a terrible thing i think not it is merely a method by which we can multiply our personalities  the tragedy of old age is not that one is old but that one is young  a great poet a really great poet is the most unpoetical of all creatures but inferior poets are absolutely fascinating the worse their rhymes are the more picturesque they look the mere fact of having published a book of secondrate sonnets makes a man quite irresistible he lives the poetry that he cannot write the others write the poetry that they dare not realise  being adored is a nuisance women treat us just as humanity treats its gods they worship us and are always bothering us to do something for them  if a man treats life artistically his brain is his heart  the peerage is the one book a young man about town should know thoroughly and it is the best thing in fiction the english have ever done  the world has always laughed at its own tragedies that being the only way in which it has been able to bear them consequently whatever the world has treated seriously belongs to the comedy side of things  the only difference between the saint and the sinner is that every saint has a past and every sinner has a future  what is termed sin is an essential element of progress without it the world would stagnate or grow old or becomes colourless by its curiosity it increases the experience of the race through its intensified assertion of individualism it saves us from the commonplace in its rejection of the current notions about morality it is one with the higher ethics  formerly we used to canonise our heroes the modern method is to vulgarise them cheap editions of great books may be delightful but cheap editions of great men are absolutely detestable  individualism does not come to man with any claims upon him at all it comes naturally and inevitably out of man it is the point to which all development tends it is the differentiation to which all organisms grow it is the perfection that is inherent in every mode of life and toward which every mode of life quickens individualism exercises no compulsion over man on the contrary it says to man that he should suffer no compulsion to be exercised over him it does not try to force people to be good it knows that people are good when they are let alone man will develop individualism out of himself man is now so developing individualism to ask whether individualism is practical is like asking whether evolution is practical evolution is the law of life and there is no evolution except towards individualism  the longer i live the more keenly i feel that whatever was good enough for our fathers is not good enough for us in art as in politics les grand pères ont toujours tort  no woman is a genius women are a decorative sex they never have anything to say but they say it charmingly  humanity takes itself too seriously it is the worlds original sin if the cave men had known how to laugh history would have been different  i wonder who it was defined man as a rational animal it was the most premature definition ever given man is many things but he is not rational  thought and language are to the artist instruments of an art  to get into the best society nowadays one has either to feed people amuse people or shock peoplethat is all  you should never try to understand women women are pictures men are problems if you want to know what a woman really meanswhich by the way is always a dangerous thing to dolook at her dont listen to her  ordinary women never appeal to ones imagination they are limited to their century no glamour ever transfigures them one knows their minds as easily as one knows their bonnets one can always find them there is no mystery in any of them they ride in the park in the morning and chatter at tea parties in the afternoon they have their stereotyped smile and their fashionable mauve  dont run down dyed hair and painted faces there is an extraordinary charm in themsometimes  to have been well brought up is a great drawback nowadays it shuts one out from so much  the people who have adored methere have not been very many but there have been somehave always insisted on living on long after i had ceased to care for them or they to care for me they have become stout and tedious and when i meet them they go in at once for reminiscences that awful memory of women what a fearful thing it is and what an utter intellectual stagnation it reveals  examinations are pure humbug from beginning to end if a man is a gentleman he knows quite enough and if he is not a gentleman whatever he knows is bad for him  credit is the capital of a younger son and he can live charmingly on it  the object of art is not simply truth but complex beauty art itself is really a form of exaggeration and selection which is the very spirit of art is nothing more than an intensified mode of overemphasis  the popular cry of our time is let us return to life and nature they will recreate art for us and send the red blood coursing through her veins they will shoe her feet with swiftness and make her hand strong but alas we are mistaken in our amiable and wellmeant efforts nature is always behind the age and as for life she is the solvent that breaks up art the enemy that lays waste her house  there are only two kinds of womenthe plain and the coloured the plain women are very useful if you want to gain a reputation for respectability you have merely to take them down to supper the other women are very charming they commit one mistake howeverthey paint in order to try and look young  the way of paradoxes is the way of truth to test reality we must see it on the tightrope when the verities become acrobats we can judge them  life imitates art far more than art imitates life the greeks with their quick artistic instinct understood this and set in the brides chamber the statue of hermes or of apollo that she might bear children as lovely as the works of art that she looked at in her rapture or her pain they knew that life gains from art not merely spirituality depth of thought and feeling soulturmoil or soulpeace but that she can form herself on the very lines and colours of art and can reproduce the dignity of pheidias as well as the grace of praxiteles hence came this objection to realism they disliked it on purely social grounds they felt that it inevitably makes people ugly and they were perfectly right  faithfulness is to the emotional life what consistency is to the life of the intellectsimply a confession of failure  there are many things that we would throw away if we were not afraid that others might pick them up  what a fuss people make about fidelity why even in love it is purely a question for physiology it has nothing to do with our own will young men want to be faithful and are not old men want to be faithless and cannotthat is all one can say  modernity of form and modernity of subjectmatter are entirely and absolutely wrong we have mistaken the common livery of the age for the vesture of the muses and spent our days in the sordid streets and hideous suburbs of our vile cities when we should be out on the hillside with apollo certainly we are a degraded race and have sold our birthright for a mess of facts  nothing can cure the soul but the senses just as nothing can cure the senses but the soul  i can stand brute force but brute reason is quite unbearable there is something unfair about its use it is hitting below the intellect  those who live in marble or on painted panel know of life but a single exquisite instant eternal indeed in its beauty but limited to one note of passion or one mood of calm those whom the poet makes live have their myriad emotions of joy and terror of courage and despair of pleasure and of suffering the seasons come and go in glad or saddening pageant and with winged or leaden feet the years pass by before them they have their youth and their manhood they are children and they grow old it is always dawn for st helena as veronese saw her at the window through the still morning air the angels bring her the symbol of gods pain the cool breezes of the morning lift the gilt threads from her brow on that little hill by the city of florence where the lovers of giorgione are lying it is always the solstice of noonof noon made so languorous by summer suns that hardly can the slim naked girl dip into the marble tank the round bubble of clear glass and the long fingers of the lute player rest idly upon the chords it is twilight always for the dancing nymphs whom corot set free among the silver poplars of france in eternal twilight they move those frail diaphanous figures whose tremulous white feet seem not to touch the dewdrenched grass they tread on but those who walk in epos drama or romance see through the labouring months the young moons wax and wane and watch the night from evening into morning star and from sunrise into sunsetting can note the shifting day with all its gold and shadow for them as for us the flowers bloom and wither and the earth that greentressed goddess as coleridge calls her alters her raiment for their pleasure the statue is concentrated to one moment of perfection the image stained upon the canvas possesses no spiritual element of growth or change if they know nothing of death it is because they know little of life for the secrets of life and death belong to those and to those only whom the sequence of time affects and who possess not merely the present but the future and can rise or fall from a past of glory or of shame movement that problem of the visible arts can be truly realised by literature alone it is literature that shows us the body in its swiftness and the soul in its unrest  behind every exquisite thing that exists there is something tragic worlds have to be in travail that the merest flower may blow  beauty is a form of geniusis higher indeed than genius as it needs no explanation it is one of the great facts of the world like sunlight or springtime or the reflection in dark water of that silver shell we call the moon it cannot be questioned it has its divine right of sovereignty  the only way to get rid of a temptation is to yield to it resist it and your soul grows sick with longing for the things it has forbidden to itself  women spoil every romance by trying to make it last for ever  hes sure to be a wonderful success he thinks like a tory and talks like a radical and thats so important nowadays  nowadays to be intelligible is to be found out  we make gods of men and they leave us others make brutes of them and they fawn and are faithful  the husbands of very beautiful women belong to the criminal classes  to me beauty is the wonder of wonders it is only shallow people who do not judge by appearances  the true mystery of the world is the visible not the invisible  the thoroughly wellinformed man is the modern ideal and the mind of the thoroughly wellinformed man is a dreadful thing it is like a bricabrac shop all monsters and dust with everything priced above its proper value  women have no appreciation of good looks in menat least good women have none  to influence a person is to give him ones own soul he does not think his natural thoughts or burn with his natural passions his virtues are not real to him his sins if there are such things as sins are borrowed he becomes an echo of someone elses music an actor of a part that has not been written for him  those who are faithful know only the trivial side of love it is the faithless who know loves tragedies  an artist should create beautiful things but should put nothing of his own life into them we live in an age when men treat art as if it were meant to be a form of autobiography we have lost the abstract sense of beauty  a man cannot be too careful in the choice of his enemies i have not got one who is a fool they are all men of some intellectual power and consequently they all appreciate me  the value of an idea has nothing whatever to do with the sincerity of the man who expresses it  i like persons better than principles and i like persons with no principles better than anything else in the world  he who would lead a christlike life is he who is perfectly and absolutely himself he may be a great poet or a great man of science or a young student at the university or one who watches sheep upon a moor or a maker of dramas like shakespeare or a thinker about god like spinoza or a child who plays in a garden or a fisherman who throws his nets into the sea it does not matter what he is as long as he realises the perfection of the soul that is within him  the aim of life is selfdevelopment to realise ones nature perfectlythat is what each of us is here for  there is no such thing as a good influence all influence is immoralimmoral from the scientific point of view  words have not merely music as sweet as that of viol and lute colour as rich and vivid as any that makes lovely for us the canvas of the venetian or the spaniard and plastic form no less sure and certain than that which reveals itself in marble or in bronze but thought and passion and spirituality are theirs alsoare theirs indeed alone  there is nothing so absolutely pathetic as a really fine paradox the pun is the clown among jokes the wellturned paradox is the polished comedian and the highest comedy verges upon tragedy just as the keenest edge of tragedy is often tempered by a subtle humour our minds are shot with moods as a fabric is shot with colours and our moods often seem inappropriate everything that is true is inappropriate  the longer one studies life and literature the more strongly one feels that behind everything that is wonderful stands the individual and that it is not the moment that makes the man but the man who creates the age  to know the vintage and quality of a wine one need not drink the whole cask  it is a sad thing to think of but there is no doubt that genius lasts longer than beauty that accounts for the fact that we all take such pains to overeducate ourselves  the ugly and the stupid have the best of it in this world they can sit at their ease and gape at the play if they know nothing of victory they are at least spared the knowledge of defeat  to have a capacity for a passion and not to realise it is to make oneself incomplete and limited  even in actual life egotism is not without its attractions when people talk to us about others they are usually dull when they talk to us about themselves they are nearly always interesting and if one could shut them up when they become wearisome as easily as one can shut up a book of which one has grown wearied they would be perfect absolutely  every great man nowadays has his disciples and it is invariably judas who writes the biography  art finds her own perfection within and not outside of herself she is not to be judged by any external standard of resemblance she is a veil rather than a mirror she has flowers that no forest knows of birds that no woodland possesses she makes and unmakes many worlds and can draw the moon from heaven with a scarlet thread hers are the forms more real than living man and hers the great archetypes of which things that have existence are but unfinished copies nature has in her eyes no laws no uniformity she can work miracles at her will and when she calls monsters from the deep they come she can bid the almondtree blossom in winter and send the snow upon the ripe cornfield at her word the frost lays its silver finger on the burning mouth of june and the winged lions creep out from the hollows of the lydian hills the dryads peer from the thicket as she passes by and the brown fauns smile strangely at her when she comes near them she has hawkfaced gods that worship her and the centaurs gallop at her side  in literature mere egotism is delightful  if we live for aims we blunt our emotions if we live for aims we live for one minute for one day for one year instead of for every minute every day every year the moods of ones life are lifes beauties to yield to all ones moods is to really live  many a young man starts in life with a natural gift for exaggeration which if nurtured in congenial and sympathetic surroundings or by the imitations of the best models might grow into something really great and wonderful but as a rule he comes to nothing he either falls into careless habits of accuracy or takes to frequenting the society of the aged and the wellinformed both things are equally fatal to his imagination  the spirit of an age may be best expressed in the abstract ideal arts for the spirit itself is abstract and ideal  as for believing things i can believe anything provided that it is quite incredible  know thyself was written over the portal of the antique world over the portal of the new world be thyself shall be written and the message of christ to man was simply be thyself that is the secret of christ  london is full of women who trust their husbands one can always recognise them they look so thoroughly unhappy  for those who are not artists and to whom there is no mode of life but the actual life of fact pain is the only door to perfection  the english public always feels perfectly at its ease when a mediocrity is talking to it  men always fall into the absurdity of endeavouring to develop the mind to push it violently forward in this direction or in that the mind should be receptive a harp waiting to catch the winds a pool ready to be ruffled not a bustling busybody for ever trotting about on the pavement looking for a new bun shop  there is nothing more beautiful than to forget except perhaps to be forgotten  all bad art comes from returning to life and nature and elevating them into ideals life and nature may sometimes be used as part of arts rough material but before they are of any real service to art they must be translated into artistic conventions the moment art surrenders its imaginative medium it surrenders everything as a method realism is a complete failure and the two things that every artist should avoid are modernity of form and modernity of subjectmatter  men may have womens minds just as women may have the minds of men  london is too full of fogs and serious people whether the fogs produce the serious people or whether the serious people produce the fogs i dont know  how marriage ruins a man its as demoralising as cigarettes and far more expensive  he must be quite respectable one has never heard his name before in the whole course of ones life which speaks volumes for a man nowadays  literature always anticipates life it does not copy it but moulds it to its purpose  as long as a thing is useful or necessary to us or affects us in any way either for pain or pleasure or appeals strongly to our sympathies or is a vital part of the environment in which we live it is outside the proper sphere of art  i couldnt have a scene in this bonnet it is far too fragile a harsh word would ruin it  music creates for one a past of which one has been ignorant and fills one with a sense of sorrows that have been hidden from ones tears  nothing is so fatal to personality as deliberation  i adore london dinner parties the clever people never listen and the stupid people never talk  learned conversation is either the affection of the ignorant or the profession of the mentally unemployed  the academy is too large and too vulgar whenever i have gone there there have been either so many people that i have not been able to see the pictureswhich was dreadful or so many pictures that i have not been able to see the peoplewhich was worse  all art is quite useless  beauty real beauty ends where an intellectual expression begins intellect is in itself a mode of exaggeration and destroys the harmony of any face the moment one sits down to think one becomes all nose or all forehead or something horrid  the one charm of marriage is that it makes a life of deception absolutely necessary for both parties  secrecy seems to be the one thing that can make modern life mysterious or marvellous to us the commonest thing is delightful if one only hides it  conceit is one of the greatest of the virtues yet how few people recognise it as a thing to aim at and to strive after in conceit many a man and woman has found salvation yet the average person goes on allfours grovelling after modesty  it is difficult not to be unjust to what one loves  humanity will always love rousseau for having confessed his sins not to a friend but to the world  just as those who do not love plato more than truth cannot pass beyond the threshold of the academe so those who do not love beauty more than truth never know the inmost shrine of art  there is a fatality about all physical and intellectual distinction the sort of fatality that seems to dog through history the faltering steps of kings it is better not to be different from ones fellows  to be born or at any rate bred in a handbag whether it had handles or not seems to me to display a contempt for the ordinary decencies of family life that reminds one of the worst excesses of the french revolution  vice and virtue are to the artist materials for an art  there must be a new hedonism that shall recreate life and save it from that harsh uncomely puritanism that is having in our own day its curious revival it must have its service of the intellect certainly yet it must never accept any theory or system that will involve the sacrifice of any mode of passionate experience its aim indeed is to be experience itself and not the fruits of experience bitter or sweet as they may be of the æstheticism that deadens the senses as of the vulgar profligacy that dulls them it is to know nothing but it is to teach man to concentrate himself upon the moments of a life that is itself but a moment  art never expresses anything but itself it has an independent life just as thought has and develops purely on its own lines it is not necessarily realistic in an age of realism nor spiritual in an age of faith so far from being the creation of its time it is usually in direct opposition to it and the only history that it preserves for us is the history of its own progress  people who mean well always do badly they are like the ladies who wear clothes that dont fit them in order to show their piety good intentions are invariably ungrammatical  man can believe the impossible but man can never believe the improbable  when art is more varied nature will no doubt be more varied also  if a man is sufficiently imaginative to produce evidence in support of a lie he might just as well speak the truth at once  the ancient historians gave us delightful fiction in the form of fact the modern novelist presents us with dull facts under the guise of fiction  nature is no great mother who has home us she is our own creation it is in our brain that she quickens to life things are because we see them and what we see and how we see it depends on the arts that have influenced us to look at a thing is very different from seeing a thing one does not see anything until one sees its beauty  the proper school to learn art in is not life but art  i wont tell you that the world matters nothing or the worlds voice or the voice of society they matter a good deal they matter far too much  i wouldnt marry a man with a future before him for anything under the sun  i am the only person in the world i should like to know thoroughly but i dont see any chance of it just at present  modern memoirs are generally written by people who have entirely lost their memories and have never done anything worth recording  education is an admirable thing but it is well to remember from time to time that nothing that is worth knowing can be taught  women are like minors they live upon their expectations  twisted minds are as natural to some people as twisted bodies  it is the very passions about whose origin we deceive ourselves that tyrannise most strongly over us our weakest motives are those of whose nature we are conscious it often happens that when we think we are experimenting on others we are really experimenting on ourselves  whenever a man does a thoroughly stupid thing it is always from the noblest motives  i thought i had no heart i find i have and a heart doesnt suit me somehow it doesnt go with modern dress it makes one look old and it spoils ones career at critical moments  i dont play accuratelyanyone can play accuratelybut i play with wonderful expression as far as the piano is concerned sentiment is my forte i keep science for life  i delight in men over seventy they always offer one the devotion of a lifetime  everybody who is incapable of learning has taken to teachingthat is really what our enthusiasm for education has come to  nature hates mind  from the point of view of form the type of all the arts is the art of the musician from the point of view of feeling the actors craft is the type  where we differ from each other is purely in accidentalsin dress manner tone of voice religious opinions personal appearance tricks of habit and the like  the more we study art the less we care for nature what art really reveals to us is natures lack of design her curious crudities her extraordinary monotony her absolutely unfinished condition it is fortunate for us however that nature is so imperfect as otherwise we should have had no art at all art is our spirited protest our gallant attempt to teach nature her proper place as for the infinite variety of nature that is a pure myth it is not to be found in nature herself it resides in the imagination or fancy or cultivated blindness of the man who looks at her  facts are not merely finding a footingplace in history but they are usurping the domain of fancy and have invaded the kingdom of romance their chilling touch is over everything they are vulgarising mankind  ordinary people wait till life discloses to them its secrets but to the few to the elect the mysteries of life are revealed before the veil is drawn away sometimes this is the effect of art and chiefly of the art of literature which deals immediately with the passions and the intellect but now and then a complex personality takes the place and assumes the office of art is indeed in its way a real work of art life having its elaborate masterpieces just as poetry has or sculpture or painting  thinking is the most unhealthy thing in the world and people die of it just as they die of any other disease  a cigarette is the perfect type of a perfect pleasure it is exquisite and it leaves one unsatisfied  the aim of the liar is simply to charm to delight to give pleasure he is the very basis of civilised society  it is quite a mistake to believe as many people do that the mind shows itself in the face vice may sometimes write itself in lines and changes of contour but that is all our faces are really masks given to us to conceal our minds with  what on earth should we men do going about with purity and innocence a carefully thoughtout buttonhole is much more effective  the only difference between a caprice and a lifelong passion is that the caprice lasts a little longer  people say sometimes that beauty is only superficial that may be so but at least it is not so superficial as thought is  it is the spectator and not life that art really mirrors  nowadays people know the price of everything and the value of nothing  conscience and cowardice are really the same things conscience is the trade name of the firmthat is all  in every sphere of life form is the beginning of things the rhythmic harmonious gestures of dancing convey plato tells us both rhythm and harmony into the mind forms are the food of faith cried newman in one of those great moments of sincerity that make us admire and know the man he was right though he may not have known how terribly right he was the creeds are believed not because they are rational but because they are repeated yes form is everything it is the secret of life find expression for a sorrow and it will become dear to you find expression for a joy and you intensify its ecstasy do you wish to love use loves litany and the words will create the yearning from which the world fancies that they spring have you a grief that corrodes your heart learn its utterance from prince hamlet and queen constance and you will find that mere expression is a mode of consolation and that form which is the birth of passion is also the death of pain and so to return to the sphere of art it is form that creates not merely the critical temperament but also the æsthetic instinct that reveals to one all things under the condition of beauty start with the worship of form and there is no secret in art that will not be revealed to you  it is only the intellectually lost who ever argue  nowadays most people die of a sort of creeping commonsense and discover when it is too late that the only things one never regrets are ones mistakes  lady henry wotton was a curious woman whose dresses always looked as if they had been designed in a rage and put on in a tempest she was usually in love with somebody and as her passion was never returned she had kept all her illusions she tried to look picturesque but only succeeded in being untidy  those who go beneath the surface do so at their peril  with an evening coat and a white tie anybody even a stockbroker can gain a reputation for being civilised  there is nothing so interesting as telling a good man or woman how bad one has been it is intellectually fascinating one of the greatest pleasures of having been wicked is that one has so much to say to the good  laws are made in order that people in authority may not remember them just as marriages are made in order that the divorce court may not play about idly  to get back ones youth one has merely to repeat ones follies  never marry a woman with strawcoloured hair they are so sentimental  the reason we all like to think so well of others is that we are all afraid for ourselves the basis of optimism is sheer terror we think that we are generous because we credit our neighbours with the possession of those virtues that are likely to be a benefit to us we praise the banker that we may overdraw our account and find good qualities in the highwayman in the hope that he may spare our pockets i have the greatest contempt for optimism  art begins with abstract decoration with purely imaginative and pleasureable work dealing with what is unreal and nonexistent this is the first stage then life becomes fascinated with this new wonder and asks to be admitted into the charmed circle art takes life as part of her rough material recreates it and refashions it in fresh form is absolutely indifferent to facts invents imagines dreams and keeps between herself and reality the impenetrable barrier of beautiful style of decorative or ideal treatment the third stage is when life gets the upper hand and drives art out into the wilderness this is the true decadence and it is from this that we are now suffering  good intentions have been the ruin of the world the only people who have achieved anything have been those who have had no intentions at all  i never take any notice of what common people say and i never interfere with what charming people do  you know i am not a champion of marriage the real drawback to marriage is that it makes one unselfish and unselfish people are colourlessthey lack individuality still there are certain temperaments that marriage makes more complex they retain their egotism and add to it many other egos they are forced to have more than one life they become more highly organised and to be highly organised is i should fancy the object of mans existence besides every experience is of value and whatever one may say against marriage it is certainly an experience  those who read the symbol do so at their peril  i never talk during musicat least not during good music if anyone hears bad music it is ones duty to drown it in conversation  when critics disagree the artist is in accord with himself  faith is the most plural thing i know we are all supposed to believe in the same thing in different ways it is like eating out of the same dish with different coloured spoons  experience is of no ethical value it is merely the name men give to their mistakes moralists have as a rule regarded it as a mode of warning have claimed for it a certain ethical efficacy in the formation of character have praised it as something that teaches us what to follow and shows us what to avoid but there is no motive power in experience it is as little of an active cause as conscience itself all that it really demonstrates is that our future will be the same as our past and that the sin we have done once and with loathing we shall do many times and with joy  sensations are the details that build up the stories of our lives  no artist has ethical sympathies an ethical sympathy in an artist is an unpardonable mannerism of style  she looks like an edition de luxe of a wicked french novel meant specially for the english market  i never knew what terror was before i know it now it is as if a hand of ice were laid upon ones heart it is as if ones heart were beating itself to death in some empty hollow  we can forgive a man for making a useful thing as long as he does not admire it the only excuse for making a useless thing is that one admires it intensely  no artist desires to prove anything even things that are true can be proved  one knows so well the popular idea of health the english country gentleman galloping along after a foxthe unspeakable in pursuit of the uneatable  people seldom tell the truths that are worth telling we ought to choose our truths as carefully as we choose our lies and to select our virtues with as much thought as we bestow upon the selection of our enemies  soul and body body and soulhow mysterious they are there is animalism in the soul and the body has its moments of spirituality the senses can refine and the intellect can degrade who can say where the fleshly impulse ceases or the psychical impulse begins how shallow are the arbitrary definitions of ordinary psychologists and yet how difficult to decide between the claims of the various schools is the soul a shadow seated in the house of sin or is the body really in the soul as giordano bruno thought the separation of spirit from matter is a mystery and the unison of spirit with matter is a mystery also  those who find beautiful meanings in beautiful things are the cultivated for these there is hope  there is no such thing as a moral or an immoral book books are well written or badly writtenthat is all  marriage is a sort of forcing house it brings strange sins to fruit and sometimes strange renunciations  the moral life of man forms part of the subjectmatter of the artist but the morality of art consists in the perfect use of an imperfect medium  a sense of duty is like some horrible disease it destroys the tissues of the mind as certain complaints destroy the tissues of the body the catechism has a great deal to answer for  they are the elect to whom beautiful things mean only beauty  those who find ugly meanings in beautiful things are corrupt without being charming this is a fault  few people have sufficient strength to resist the preposterous claims of orthodoxy  she wore far too much rouge last night and not quite enough clothes that is always a sign of despair in a woman  a virtue is like a city set upon a hillit cannot be hid we can conceal our vices if we care tofor a time at leastbut a virtue will out  cant make out how you stand london society the thing has gone to the dogs a lot of damned nobodies talking about nothing  you dont know what an existence they lead down there it is pure unadulterated country life they get up early because they have so much to do and go to bed early because they have so little to think about  nothing is so fatal to a personality as the keeping of promises unless it be telling the truth  who cares whether mr ruskins views on turner are sound or not what does it matter that mighty and majestic prose of his so fervid and so fiery coloured in its noble eloquence so rich in its elaborate symphonic music so sure and certain at its best in subtle choice of word and epithet is at least as great a work of art as any of those wonderful sunsets that bleach or rot on their corrupted canvases in englands gallerygreater indeed one is apt to think at times not merely because its equal beauty is more enduring but on account of the fuller variety of its appealsoul speaking to soul in those long cadenced lines not through form and colour alone though through these indeed completely and without loss but with intellectual and emotional utterance with lofty passion and with loftier thought with imaginative insight and with poetic aimgreater i always think even as literature is the greater art  laughter is not at all a bad beginning for a friendship and it is far the best ending for one  mrs cheveley is one of those very modern women of our time who find a new scandal as becoming as a new bonnet and air them both in the park every afternoon at 530 i am sure she adores scandals and that the sorrow of her life at present is that she cant manage to have enough of them  the world divides actions into three classes good actions bad actions that you may do and bad actions that you may not do if you stick to the good actions you are respected by the good if you stick to the bad actions that you may do you are respected by the bad but if you perform the bad actions that no one may do then the good and the bad set upon you and you are lost indeed  i choose my friends for their good looks my acquaintances for their good characters and my enemies for their good intellects  the artist is the creator of beautiful things  to me the word natural means all that is middle class all that is of the essence of jingoism all that is colourless and without form and void it might be a beautiful word but it is the most debased coin in the currency of language  i pity any woman who is married to a man called john she would probably never be allowed to know the entrancing pleasure of a single moments solitude  it is only when we have learned to love forgetfulness that we have learned the art of living  to reveal art and conceal the artist is arts aim  the world taken en masse is a monster crammed with prejudices packed with prepossessions cankered with what it calls virtues a puritan a prig and the art of life is the art of defiance to defythat is what we ought to live for instead of living as we do to acquiesce  some resemblance the creative work of the critic will have to the work that has stirred him to creation but it will be such resemblance as exists not between nature and the mirror that the painter of landscape or figure may be supposed to hold up to her but between nature and the work of the decorative artist just as on the flowerless carpets of persia tulip and rose blossom indeed and are lovely to look on though they are not reproduced in visible shape or line just as the pearl and purple of the sea shell is echoed in the church of st mark at venice just as the vaulted ceiling of the wondrous chapel at ravenna is made gorgeous by the gold and green and sapphire of the peacocks tail though the birds of juno fly not across it so the critic reproduces the work that he criticises in a mode that is never imitative and part of whose charm may really consist in the rejection of resemblance and shows us in this way not merely the meaning but also the mystery of beauty and by transforming each art into literature solves once for all the problem of arts unity  diversity of opinion about a work of art shows that the work is new complex and vital   nothing is more painful to me than to come across virtue in a person in whom i have never suspected its existence it is like finding a needle in a bundle of hay it pricks you if we have virtue we should warn people of it  the critic is he who can translate into another manner or a new material his impression of beautiful things  hopper is one of natures gentlementhe worst type of gentleman i know  if one intends to be good one must take it up as a profession it is quite the most engrossing one in the world  i like wagners music better than anybodys it is so loud that one can talk the whole time without other people hearing what one says  all art is at once surface and symbol  childhood is one long career of innocent eavesdropping of hearing what one ought not to hear  the highest as the lowest form of criticism is a mode of autobiography  the only things worth saying are those that we forget just as the only things worth doing are those that the world is surprised at  maturity is one long career of saying what one ought not to say that is the art of conversation  virtue is generally merely a form of deficiency just as vice is an assertion of intellect  people teach in order to conceal their ignorance as people smile in order to conceal their tears  to be unnatural is often to be great to be natural is generally to be stupid  to lie finely is an art to tell the truth is to act according to nature  people who talk sense are like people who break stones in the road they cover one with dust and splinters  jesus said to man you have a wonderful personality develop it be yourself dont imagine that your perfection lies in accumulating or possessing external things your perfection is inside of you if only you could realise that you would not want to be rich ordinary riches can be stolen from a man real riches cannot in the treasuryhouse of your soul there are infinitely precious things that may not be taken from you try to so shape your life that external things will not harm you and try also to get rid of personal property it involves sordid preoccupation endless industry continual wrong personal property hinders individualism at every step  when jesus talks about the poor he simply means personalities just as when he talks about the rich he simply means people who have not developed their personalities  an echo is often more beautiful than the voice it repeats                                         the soul of man   the chief advantage that would result from the establishment of socialism is undoubtedly the fact that socialism would relieve us from that sordid necessity of living for others which in the present condition of things presses so hardly upon almost everybody in fact scarcely anyone at all escapes  now and then in the course of the century a great man of science like darwin a great poet like keats a fine critical spirit like m renan a supreme artist like flaubert has been able to isolate himself to keep himself out of reach of the clamorous claims of others to stand under the shelter of the wall as plato puts it and so to realise the perfection of what was in him to his own incomparable gain and to the incomparable and lasting gain of the whole world these however are exceptions the majority of people spoil their lives by an unhealthy and exaggerated altruismare forced indeed so to spoil them they find themselves surrounded by hideous poverty by hideous ugliness by hideous starvation it is inevitable that they should be strongly moved by all this the emotions of man are stirred more quickly than mans intelligence and as i pointed out some time ago in an article on the function of criticism it is much more easy to have sympathy with suffering than it is to have sympathy with thought accordingly with admirable though misdirected intentions they very seriously and very sentimentally set themselves to the task of remedying the evils that they see but their remedies do not cure the disease they merely prolong it indeed their remedies are part of the disease  they try to solve the problem of poverty for instance by keeping the poor alive or in the case of a very advanced school by amusing the poor  but this is not a solution it is an aggravation of the difficulty the proper aim is to try and reconstruct society on such a basis that poverty will be impossible and the altruistic virtues have really prevented the carrying out of this aim just as the worst slaveowners were those who were kind to their slaves and so prevented the horror of the system being realised by those who suffered from it and understood by those who contemplated it so in the present state of things in england the people who do most harm are the people who try to do most good and at last we have had the spectacle of men who have really studied the problem and know the lifeeducated men who live in the east endcoming forward and imploring the community to restrain its altruistic impulses of charity benevolence and the like they do so on the ground that such charity degrades and demoralises they are perfectly right charity creates a multitude of sins  there is also this to be said it is immoral to use private property in order to alleviate the horrible evils that result from the institution of private property it is both immoral and unfair  under socialism all this will of course be altered there will be no people living in fetid dens and fetid rags and bringing up unhealthy hungerpinched children in the midst of impossible and absolutely repulsive surroundings the security of society will not depend as it does now on the state of the weather if a frost comes we shall not have a hundred thousand men out of work tramping about the streets in a state of disgusting misery or whining to their neighbours for alms or crowding round the doors of loathsome shelters to try and secure a hunch of bread and a nights unclean lodging each member of the society will share in the general prosperity and happiness of the society and if a frost comes no one will practically be anything the worse  upon the other hand socialism itself will be of value simply because it will lead to individualism  socialism communism or whatever one chooses to call it by converting private property into public wealth and substituting cooperation for competition will restore society to its proper condition of a thoroughly healthy organism and insure the material wellbeing of each member of the community it will in fact give life its proper basis and its proper environment but for the full development of life to its highest mode of perfection something more is needed what is needed is individualism if the socialism is authoritarian if there are governments armed with economic power as they are now with political power if in a word we are to have industrial tyrannies then the last state of man will be worse than the first at present in consequence of the existence of private property a great many people are enabled to develop a certain very limited amount of individualism they are either under no necessity to work for their living or are enabled to choose the sphere of activity that is really congenial to them and gives them pleasure these are the poets the philosophers the men of science the men of culturein a word the real men the men who have realised themselves and in whom all humanity gains a partial realisation upon the other hand there are a great many people who having no private property of their own and being always on the brink of sheer starvation are compelled to do the work of beasts of burden to do work that is quite uncongenial to them and to which they are forced by the peremptory unreasonable degrading tyranny of want these are the poor and amongst them there is no grace of manner or charm of speech or civilisation or culture or refinement in pleasures or joy of life from their collective force humanity gains much in material prosperity but it is only the material result that it gains and the man who is poor is in himself absolutely of no importance he is merely the infinitesimal atom of a force that so far from regarding him crushes him indeed prefers him crushed as in that case he is far more obedient  of course it might be said that the individualism generated under conditions of private property is not always or even as a rule of a fine or wonderful type and that the poor if they have not culture and charm have still many virtues both these statements would be quite true the possession of private property is very often extremely demoralising and that is of course one of the reasons why socialism wants to get rid of the institution in fact property is really a nuisance some years ago people went about the country saying that property has duties they said it so often and so tediously that at last the church has begun to say it one hears it now from every pulpit it is perfectly true property not merely has duties but has so many duties that its possession to any large extent is a bore it involves endless claims upon one endless attention to business endless bother if property had simply pleasures we could stand it but its duties make it unbearable in the interest of the rich we must get rid of it the virtues of the poor may be readily admitted and are much to be regretted we are often told that the poor are grateful for charity some of them are no doubt but the best amongst the poor are never grateful they are ungrateful discontented disobedient and rebellious they are quite right to be so charity they feel to be a ridiculously inadequate mode of partial restitution or a sentimental dole usually accompanied by some impertinent attempt on the part of the sentimentalist to tyrannise over their private lives why should they be grateful for the crumbs that fall from the rich mans table they should be seated at the board and are beginning to know it as for being discontented a man who would not be discontented with such surroundings and such a low mode of life would be a perfect brute disobedience in the eyes of anyone who has read history is mans original virtue it is through disobedience that progress has been made through disobedience and through rebellion sometimes the poor are praised for being thrifty but to recommend thrift to the poor is both grotesque and insulting it is like advising a man who is starving to eat less for a town or country labourer to practise thrift would be absolutely immoral man should not be ready to show that he can live like a badlyfed animal he should decline to live like that and should either steal or go on the rates which is considered by many to be a form of stealing as for begging it is safer to beg than to take but it is finer to take than to beg no a poor man who is ungrateful unthrifty discontented and rebellious is probably a real personality and has much in him he is at any rate a healthy protest as for the virtuous poor one can pity them of course but one cannot possibly admire them they have made private terms with the enemy and sold their birthright for very bad pottage they must also be extraordinarily stupid i can quite understand a man accepting laws that protect private property and admit of its accumulation as long as he himself is able under those conditions to realise some form of beautiful and intellectual life but it is almost incredible to me how a man whose life is marred and made hideous by such laws can possibly acquiesce in their continuance  however the explanation is not really difficult to find it is simply this misery and poverty are so absolutely degrading and exercise such a paralysing effect over the nature of men that no class is ever really conscious of its own suffering they have to be told of it by other people and they often entirely disbelieve them what is said by great employers of labour against agitators is unquestionably true agitators are a set of interfering meddling people who come down to some perfectly contented class of the community and sow the seeds of discontent amongst them that is the reason why agitators are so absolutely necessary without them in our incomplete state there would be no advance towards civilisation slavery was put down in america not in consequence of any action on the part of the slaves or even any express desire on their part that they should be free it was put down entirely through the grossly illegal conduct of certain agitators in boston and elsewhere who were not slaves themselves nor owners of slaves nor had anything to do with the question really it was undoubtedly the abolitionists who set the torch alight who began the whole thing and it is curious to note that from the slaves themselves they received not merely very little assistance but hardly any sympathy even and when at the close of the war the slaves found themselves free found themselves indeed so absolutely free that they were free to starve many of them bitterly regretted the new state of things to the thinker the most tragic fact in the whole of the french revolution is not that marie antoinette was killed for being a queen but that the starved peasant of the vendée voluntarily went out to die for the hideous cause of feudalism  it is clear then that no authoritarian socialism will do for while under the present system a very large number of people can lead lives of a certain amount of freedom and expression and happiness under an industrialbarrack system or a system of economic tyranny nobody would be able to have any such freedom at all it is to be regretted that a portion of our community should be practically in slavery but to propose to solve the problem by enslaving the entire community is childish every man must be left quite free to choose his own work no form of compulsion must be exercised over him if there is his work will not be good for him will riot be good in itself and will not be good for others and by work i simply mean activity of any kind  i hardly think that any socialist nowadays would seriously propose that an inspector should call every morning at each house to see that each citizen rose up and did manual labour for eight hours humanity has got beyond that stage and reserves such a form of life for the people whom in a very arbitrary manner it chooses to call criminals but i confess that many of the socialistic views that i have come across seem to me to be tainted with ideas of authority if not of actual compulsion of course authority and compulsion are out of the question all association must be quite voluntary it is only in voluntary associations that man is fine  but it may be asked how individualism which is now more or less dependent on the existence of private property for its development will benefit by the abolition of such private property the answer is very simple it is true that under existing conditions a few men who have had private means of their own such as byron shelley browning victor hugo baudelaire and others have been able to realise their personality more or less completely not one of these men ever did a single days work for hire they were relieved from poverty they had an immense advantage the question is whether it would be for the good of individualism that such an advantage should be taken away let us suppose that it is taken away what happens then to individualism how will it benefit  it will benefit in this way under the new conditions individualism will be far freer far finer and far more intensified than it is now i am not talking of the great imaginativelyrealised individualism of such poets as i have mentioned but of the great actual individualism latent and potential in mankind generally for the recognition of private property has really harmed individualism and obscured it by confusing a man with what he possesses it has led individualism entirely astray it has made gain not growth its aim so that man thought that the important thing was to have and did not know that the important thing is to be the true perfection of man lies not in what man has but in what man is private property has crushed true individualism and set up an individualism that is false it has debarred one part of the community from being individual by starving them it has debarred the other part of the community from being individual by putting them on the wrong road and encumbering them indeed so completely has mans personality been absorbed by his possessions that the english law has always treated offences against a mans property with far more severity than offences against his person and property is still the test of complete citizenship the industry necessary for the making of money is also very demoralising in a community like ours where property confers immense distinction social position honour respect titles and other pleasant things of the kind man being naturally ambitious makes it his aim to accumulate this property and goes on wearily and tediously accumulating it long after he has got far more than he wants or can use or enjoy or perhaps even know of man will kill himself by overwork in order to secure property and really considering the enormous advantages that property brings one is hardly surprised ones regret is that society should be constructed on such a basis that man has been forced into a groove in which he cannot freely develop what is wonderful and fascinating and delightful in himin which in fact he misses the true pleasure and joy of living he is also under existing conditions very insecure an enormously wealthy merchant may beoften isat every moment of his life at the mercy of things that are not under his control if the wind blows an extra point or so or the weather suddenly changes or some trivial thing happens his ship may go down his speculations may go wrong and he finds himself a poor man with his social position quite gone now nothing should be able to harm a man except himself nothing should be able to rob a man at all what a man really has is what is in him what is outside of him should be a matter of no importance  with the abolition of private property then we shall have true beautiful healthy individualism nobody will waste his life in accumulating things and the symbols for things one will live to live is the rarest thing in the world most people exist that is all  it is a question whether we have ever seen the full expression of a personality except on the imaginative plane of art in action we never have cæsar says mommsen was the complete and perfect man but how tragically insecure was cæsar wherever there is a man who exercises authority there is a man who resists authority cæsar was very perfect but his perfection travelled by too dangerous a road marcus aurelius was the perfect man says renan yes the great emperor was a perfect man but how intolerable were the endless claims upon him he staggered under the burden of the empire he was conscious how inadequate one man was to bear the weight of that titan and too vast orb what i mean by a perfect man is one who develops under perfect conditions one who is not wounded or worried or maimed or in danger most personalities have been obliged to be rebels half their strength has been wasted in friction byrons personality for instance was terribly wasted in its battle with the stupidity and hypocrisy and philistinism of the english such battles do not always intensify strength they often exaggerate weakness byron was never able to give us what he might have given us shelley escaped better like byron he got out of england as soon as possible but he was not so well known if the english had had any idea of what a great poet he really was they would have fallen on him with tooth and nail and made his life as unbearable to him as they possibly could but he was not a remarkable figure in society and consequently he escaped to a certain degree still even in shelley the note of rebellion is sometimes too strong the note of the perfect personality is not rebellion but peace  it will be a marvellous thingthe true personality of manwhen we see it it will grow naturally and simply flowerlike or as a tree grows it will not be at discord it will never argue or dispute it will not prove things it will know everything and yet it will not busy itself about knowledge it will have wisdom its value will not be measured by material things it will have nothing and yet it will have everything and whatever one takes from it it will still have so rich will it he it will not be always meddling with others or asking them to be like itself it will love them because they will be different and yet while it will not meddle with others it will help all as a beautiful thing helps us by being what it is the personality of man will be very wonderful it will be as wonderful as the personality of a child  in its development it will be assisted by christianity if men desire that but if men do not desire that it will develop none the less surely for it will not worry itself about the past nor care whether things happened or did not happen nor will it admit any laws but its own laws nor any authority but its own authority yet it will love those who sought to intensity it and speak often of them and of these christ was one  know thyself was written over the portal of the antique world over the portal of the new world be thyself shall be written and the message of christ to man was simply be thyself that is the secret of christ  when jesus talks about the poor he simply means personalities just as when he talks about the rich he simply means people who have not developed their personalities jesus moved in a community that allowed the accumulation of private property just as ours does and the gospel that he preached was not that in such a community it is an advantage for a man to live on scanty unwholesome food to wear ragged unwholesome clothes to sleep in horrid unwholesome dwellings and a disadvantage for a man to live under healthy pleasant and decent conditions such a view would have been wrong there and then and would of course be still more wrong now and in england for as man moves northward the material necessities of life become of more vital importance and our society is infinitely more complex and displays far greater extremes of luxury and pauperism than any society of the antique world what jesus meant was this he said to man you have a wonderful personality develop it be yourself dont imagine that your perfection lies in accumulating or possessing external things your perfection is inside of you if only you could realise that you would not want to be rich ordinary riches can be stolen from a man real riches cannot in the treasuryhouse of your soul there are infinitely precious things that may not be taken from you and so try to so shape your life that external things will not harm you and try also to get rid of personal property it involves sordid preoccupation endless industry continual wrong personal property hinders individualism at every step it is to be noted that jesus never says that impoverished people are necessarily good or wealthy people necessarily bad that would not have been true wealthy people are as a class better than impoverished people more moral more intellectual more wellbehaved there is only one class in the community that thinks more about money than the rich and that is the poor the poor can think of nothing else that is the misery of being poor what jesus does say is that man reaches his perfection not through what he has not even through what he does but entirely through what he is and so the wealthy young man who comes to jesus is represented as a thoroughly good citizen who has broken none of the laws of his state none of the commandments of his religion he is quite respectable in the ordinary sense of that extraordinary word jesus says to him you should give up private property it hinders you from realising your perfection it is a drag upon you it is a burden your personality does not need it it is within you and not outside of you that you will find what you really are and what you really want to his own friends he says the same thing he tells them to be themselves and not to be always worrying about other things what do other things matter man is complete in himself when they go into the world the world will disagree with them that is inevitable the world hates individualism but that is not to trouble them they are to be calm and selfcentred if a man takes their cloak they are to give him their coat just to show that material things are of no importance if people abuse them they are not to answer back what does it signify the things people say of a man do not alter a man he is what he is public opinion is of no value whatsoever even if people employ actual violence they are not to be violent in turn that would be to fall to the same low level after all even in prison a man can be quite free his soul can be free his personality can be untroubled he can be at peace and above all things they are not to interfere with other people or judge them in any way personality is a very mysterious thing a man cannot always be estimated by what he does he may keep the law and yet be worthless he may break the law and yet be fine he may be bad without ever doing anything bad he may commit a sin against society and yet realise through that sin his true perfection  there was a woman who was taken in adultery we are not told the history of her love but that love must have been very great for jesus said that her sins were forgiven her not because she repented but because her love was so intense and wonderful later on a short time before his death as he sat at a feast the woman came in and poured costly perfumes on his hair his friends tried to interfere with her and said that it was an extravagance and that the money that the perfume cost should have been expended on charitable relief of people in want or something of that kind jesus did not accept that view he pointed out that the material needs of man were great and very permanent but that the spiritual needs of man were greater still and that in one divine moment and by selecting its own mode of expression a personality might make itself perfect the world worships the woman even now as a saint  yes there are suggestive things in individualism socialism annihilates family life for instance with the abolition of private property marriage in its present form must disappear this is part of the programme individualism accepts this and makes it fine it converts the abolition of legal restraint into a form of freedom that will help the full development of personality and make the love of man and woman more wonderful more beautiful and more ennobling jesus knew this he rejected the claims of family life although they existed in his day and community in a very marked form who is my mother who are my brothers he said when he was told that they wished to speak to him when one of his followers asked leave to go and bury his father let the dead bury the dead was his terrible answer he would allow no claim whatsoever to be made on personality  and so he who would lead a christlike like life is he who is perfectly and absolutely himself he may be a great poet or a great man of science or a young student at a university or one who watches sheep upon a moor or a maker of dramas like shakespeare or a thinker about god like spinoza or a child who plays in a garden or a fisherman who throws his net into the sea it does not matter what he is as long as he realises the perfection of the soul that is within him all imitation in morals and in life is wrong through the streets of jerusalem at the present day crawls one who is mad and carries a wooden cross on his shoulders he is a symbol of the lives that are marred by imitation father damien was christlike when he went out to live with the lepers because in such service he realised fully what was best in him but he was not more christlike than wagner when he realised his soul in music or than shelley when he realised his soul in song there is no one type for man there are as many perfections as there are imperfect men and while to the claims of charity a man may yield and yet be free to the claims of conformity no man may yield and remain free at all  individualism then is what through socialism we are to attain to as a natural result the state must give up all idea of government it must give it up because as a wise man once said many centuries before christ there is such a thing as leaving mankind alone there is no such thing as governing mankind all modes of government are failures despotism is unjust to everybody including the despot who was probably made for better things oligarchies are unjust to the many and ochlocracies are unjust to the few high hopes were once formed of democracy but democracy means simply the bludgeoning of the people by the people for the people it has been found out i must say that it was high time for all authority is quite degrading it degrades those who exercise it and degrades those over whom it is exercised when it is violently grossly and cruelly used it produces a good effect by creating or at any rate bringing out the spirit of revolt and individualism that is to kill it when it is used with a certain amount of kindness and accompanied by prizes and rewards it is dreadfully demoralising people in that case are less conscious of the horrible pressure that is being put on them and so go through their lives in a sort of coarse comfort like petted animals without ever realising that they are probably thinking other peoples thoughts living by other peoples standards wearing practically what one may call other peoples secondhand clothes and never being themselves for a single moment he who would be free says a fine thinker must not conform and authority by bribing people to conform produces a very gross kind of overfed barbarism amongst us  with authority punishment will pass away this will be a great gaina gain in fact of incalculable value as one reads history not in the expurgated editions written for schoolboys and passmen but in the original authorities of each time one is absolutely sickened not by the crimes that the wicked have committed but by the punishments that the good have inflicted and a community is infinitely more brutalised by the habitual employment of punishment than it is by the occurrence of crime it obviously follows that the more punishment is inflicted the more crime is produced and most modern legislation has clearly recognised this and has made it its task to diminish punishment as far as it thinks it can wherever it has really diminished it the results have always been extremely good the less punishment the less crime when there is no punishment at all crime will either cease to exist or if it occurs will be treated by physicians as a very distressing form of dementia to be cured by care and kindness for what are called criminals nowadays are not criminals at all starvation and not sin is the parent of modern crime that indeed is the reason why our criminals are as a class so absolutely uninteresting from any psychological point of view they are not marvellous macbeths and terrible vautrins they are merely what ordinary respectable commonplace people would be if they had not got enough to eat when private property is abolished there will be no necessity for crime no demand for it it will cease to exist of course all crimes are not crimes against property though such are the crimes that the english law valuing what a man has more than what a man is punishes with the harshest and most horrible severity if we except the crime of murder and regard death as worse than penal servitude a point on which our criminals i believe disagree but though a crime may not be against property it may spring from the misery and rage and depression produced by our wrong system of propertyholding and so when that system is abolished will disappear when each member of the community has sufficient for his wants and is not interfered with by his neighbour it will not be an object of any interest to him to interfere with anyone else jealousy which is an extraordinary source of crime in modern life is an emotion closely bound up with our conceptions of property and under socialism and individualism will die out it is remarkable that in communistic tribes jealousy is entirely unknown  now as the state is not to govern it may be asked what the state is to do the state is to be a voluntary association that will organise labour and be the manufacturer and distributor of necessary commodities the state is to make what is useful the individual is to make what is beautiful and as i have mentioned the word labour i cannot help saying that a great deal of nonsense is being written and talked nowadays about the dignity of manual labour there is nothing necessarily dignified about manual labour at all and most of it is absolutely degrading it is mentally and morally injurious to man to do anything in which he does not find pleasure and many forms of labour are quite pleasureless activities and should be regarded as such to sweep a slushy crossing for eight hours on a day when the east wind is blowing is a disgusting occupation to sweep it with mental moral or physical dignity seems to me to be impossible to sweep it with joy would be appalling man is made for something better than disturbing dirt all work of that kind should be done by a machine  and i have no doubt that it will be so up to the present man has been to a certain extent the slave of machinery and there is something tragic in the fact that as soon as man had invented a machine to do his work he began to starve this however is of course the result of our property system and our system of competition one man owns a machine which does the work of five hundred men five hundred men are in consequence thrown out of employment and having no work to do become hungry and take to thieving the one man secures the produce of the machine and keeps it and has five hundred times as much as he should have and probably which is of much more importance a great deal more than he really wants were that machine the property of all everyone would benefit by it it would be an immense advantage to the community all unintellectual labour all monotonous dull labour all labour that deals with dreadful things and involves unpleasant conditions must be done by machinery machinery must work for us in coal mines and do all sanitary services and be the stoker of steamers and clean the streets and run messages on wet days and do anything that is tedious or distressing at present machinery competes against man under proper conditions machinery will serve man there is no doubt at all that this is the future of machinery and just as trees grow while the country gentleman is asleep so while humanity will be amusing itself or enjoying cultivated leisurewhich and not labour is the aim of manor making beautiful things or reading beautiful things or simply contemplating the world with admiration and delight machinery will he doing all the necessary and unpleasant work the fact is that civilisation requires slaves the greeks were quite right there unless there are slaves to do the ugly horrible uninteresting work culture and contemplation become almost impossible human slavery is wrong insecure and demoralising on mechanical slavery on the slavery of the machine the future of the world depends and when scientific men are no longer called upon to go down to a depressing east end and distribute bad cocoa and worse blankets to starving people they will have delightful leisure in which to devise wonderful and marvellous things for their own joy and the joy of everyone else there will be great storages of force for every city and for every house if required and this force man will convert into heat light or motion according to his needs is this utopian a map of the world that does not include utopia is not worth even glancing at for it leaves out the one country at which humanity is always landing and when humanity lands there it looks out and seeing a better country sets sail progress is the realisation of utopias  now i have said that the community by means of organisation of machinery will supply the useful things and that the beautiful things will be made by the individual this is not merely necessary but it is the only possible way by which we can get either the one or the other an individual who has to make things for the use of others and with reference to their wants and their wishes does not work with interest and consequently cannot put into his work what is best in him upon the other hand whenever a community or a powerful section of a community or a government of any kind attempts to dictate to the artist what he is to do art either entirely vanishes or becomes stereotyped or degenerates into a low and ignoble form of craft a work of art is the unique result of a unique temperament its beauty comes from the fact that the author is what he is it has nothing to do with the fact that other people want what they want indeed the moment that an artist takes notice of what other people want and tries to supply the demand he ceases to be an artist and becomes a dull or an amusing craftsman an honest or a dishonest tradesman he has no further claim to be considered as an artist art is the most intense mode of individualism that the world has known i am inclined to say that it is the only real mode of individualism that the world has known crime which under certain conditions may seem to have created individualism must take cognisance of other people and interfere with them it belongs to the sphere of action but alone without any reference to his neighbours without any interference the artist can fashion a beautiful thing and if he does not do it solely for his own pleasure he is not an artist at all  and it is to be noted that it is the fact that art is this intense form of individualism that makes the public try to exercise over it an authority that is as immoral as it is ridiculous and as corrupting as it is contemptible it is not quite their fault the public has always and in every age been badly brought up they are continually asking art to be popular to please their want of taste to flatter their absurd vanity to tell them what they have been told before to show them what they ought to be tired of seeing to amuse them when they feel heavy after eating too much and to distract their thoughts when they are wearied of their own stupidity now art should never try to be popular the public should try to make itself artistic there is a very wide difference if a man of science were told that the results of his experiments and the conclusions that he arrived at should be of such a character that they would not upset the received popular notions on the subject or disturb popular prejudice or hurt the sensibilities of people who knew nothing about science if a philosopher were told that he had a perfect right to speculate in the highest spheres of thought provided that he arrived at the same conclusions as were held by those who had never thought in any sphere at allwell nowadays the man of science and the philosopher would be considerably amused yet it is really a very few years since both philosophy and science were subjected to brutal popular control to authority in factthe authority of either the general ignorance of the community or the terror and greed for power of an ecclesiastical or governmental class of course we have to a very great extent got rid of any attempt on the part of the community or the church or the government to interfere with the individualism of speculative thought but the attempt to interfere with the individualism of imaginative art still lingers in fact it does more than linger it is aggressive offensive and brutalising  in england the arts that have escaped best are the arts in which the public take no interest poetry is an instance of what i mean we have been able to have fine poetry in england because the public do not read it and consequently do not influence it the public like to insult poets because they are individual but once they have insulted them they leave them alone in the case of the novel and the drama arts in which the public do take an interest the result of the exercise of popular authority has been absolutely ridiculous no country produces such badlywritten fiction such tedious common work in the novel form such silly vulgar plays as england it must necessarily be so the popular standard is of such a character that no artist can get to it it is at once too easy and too difficult to be a popular novelist it is too easy because the requirements of the public as far as plot style psychology treatment of life and treatment of literature are concerned are within the reach of the very meanest capacity and the most uncultivated mind it is too difficult because to meet such requirements the artist would have to do violence to his temperament would have to write not for the artistic joy of writing but for the amusement of halfeducated people and so would have to suppress his individualism forget his culture annihilate his style and surrender everything that is valuable in him in the case of the drama things are a little better the theatregoing public like the obvious it is true but they do not like the tedious and burlesque and farcical comedy the two most popular forms are distinct forms of art delightful work may be produced under burlesque and farcical conditions and in work of this kind the artist in england is allowed very great freedom it is when one comes to the higher forms of the drama that the result of popular control is seen the one thing that the public dislike is novelty any attempt to extend the subjectmatter of art is extremely distasteful to the public and yet the vitality and progress of art depend in a large measure on the continual extension of subjectmatter the public dislike novelty because they are afraid of it it represents to them a mode of individualism an assertion on the part of the artist that he selects his own subject and treats it as he chooses the public are quite right in their attitude art is individualism and individualism is a disturbing and disintegrating force therein lies its immense value for what it seeks to disturb is monotony of type slavery of custom tyranny of habit and the reduction of man to the level of a machine in art the public accept what has been because they cannot alter it not because they appreciate it they swallow their classics whole and never taste them they endure them as the inevitable and as they cannot mar them they mouth about them strangely enough or not strangely according to ones own views this acceptance of the classics does a great deal of harm the uncritical admiration of the bible and shakespeare in england is an instance of what i mean with regard to the bible considerations of ecclesiastical authority enter into the matter so that i need not dwell upon the point  but in the case of shakespeare it is quite obvious that the public really see neither the beauties nor the defects of his plays if they saw the beauties they would not object to the development of the drama and if they saw the defects they would not object to the development of the drama either the fact is the public make use of the classics of a country as a means of checking the progress of art they degrade the classics into authorities they use them as bludgeons for preventing the free expression of beauty in new forms they are always asking a writer why he does not write like somebody else or a painter why he does not paint like somebody else quite oblivious of the fact that if either of them did anything of the kind he would cease to be an artist a fresh mode of beauty is absolutely distasteful to them and whenever it appears they get so angry and bewildered that they always use two stupid expressionsone is that the work of art is grossly unintelligible the other that the work of art is grossly immoral what they mean by these words seems to me to be this when they say a work is grossly unintelligible they mean that the artist has said or made a beautiful thing that is new when they describe a work as grossly immoral they mean that the artist has said or made a beautiful thing that is true the former expression has reference to style the latter to subjectmatter but they probably use the words very vaguely as an ordinary mob will use readymade pavingstones there is not a single real poet or prosewriter of this century for instance on whom the british public have not solemnly conferred diplomas of immorality and these diplomas practically take the place with us of what in france is the formal recognition of an academy of letters and fortunately make the establishment of such an institution quite unnecessary in england of course the public are very reckless in their use of the word that they should have called wordsworth an immoral poet was only to be expected wordsworth was a poet but that they should have called charles kingsley an immoral novelist is extraordinary kingsleys prose was not of a very fine quality still there is the word and they use it as best they can an artist is of course not disturbed by it the true artist is a man who believes absolutely in himself because he is absolutely himself but i can fancy that if an artist produced a work of art in england that immediately on its appearance was recognised by the public through their medium which is the public press as a work that was quite intelligible and highly moral he would begin to seriously question whether in its creation he had really been himself at all and consequently whether the work was not quite unworthy of him and either of a thoroughly secondrate order or of no artistic value whatsoever  perhaps however i have wronged the public in limiting them to such words as immoral unintelligible exotic and unhealthy there is one other word that they use that word is morbid they do not use it often the meaning of the word is so simple that they are afraid of using it still they use it sometimes and now and then one comes across it in popular newspapers it is of course a ridiculous word to apply to a work of art for what is morbidity but a mood of emotion or a mode of thought that one cannot express the public are all morbid because the public can never find expression for anything the artist is never morbid he expresses everything he stands outside his subject and through its medium produces incomparable and artistic effects to call an artist morbid because he deals with morbidity as his subjectmatter is as silly as if one called shakespeare mad because he wrote king lear  on the whole an artist in england gains something by being attacked his individuality is intensified he becomes more completely himself of course the attacks are very gross very impertinent and very contemptible but then no artist expects grace from the vulgar mind or style from the suburban intellect vulgarity and stupidity are two very vivid facts in modern life one regrets them naturally but there they are they are subjects for study like everything else and it is only fair to state with regard to modern journalists that they always apologise to one in private for what they have written against one in public  within the last few years two other adjectives it may be mentioned have been added to the very limited vocabulary of artabuse that is at the disposal of the public one is the word unhealthy the other is the word exotic the latter merely expresses the rage of the momentary mushroom against the immortal entrancing and exquisitely lovely orchid it is a tribute but a tribute of no importance the word unhealthy however admits of analysis it is a rather interesting word in fact it is so interesting that the people who use it do not know what it means  what does it mean what is a healthy or an unhealthy work of art all terms that one applies to a work of art provided that one applies them rationally have reference to either its style or its subject or to both together from the point of view of style a healthy work of art is one whose style recognises the beauty of the material it employs be that material one of words or of bronze of colour or of ivory and uses that beauty as a factor in producing the æsthetic effect from the point of view of subject a healthy work of art is one the choice of whose subject is conditioned by the temperament of the artist and comes directly out of it in fine a healthy work of art is one that has both perfection and personality of course form and substance cannot be separated in a work of art they are always one but for purposes of analysis and setting the wholeness of æsthetic impression aside for a moment we can intellectually so separate them an unhealthy work of art on the other hand is a work whose style is obvious oldfashioned and common and whose subject is deliberately chosen not because the artist has any pleasure in it but because he thinks that the public will pay him for it in fact the popular novel that the public calls healthy is always a thoroughly unhealthy production and what the public call an unhealthy novel is always a beautiful and healthy work of art  i need hardly say that i am not for a single moment complaining that the public and the public press misuse these words i do not see how with their lack of comprehension of what art is they could possibly use them in the proper sense i am merely pointing out the misuse and as for the origin of the misuse and the meaning that lies behind it all the explanation is very simple it comes from the barbarous conception of authority it comes from the natural inability of a community corrupted by authority to understand or appreciate individualism in a word it comes from that monstrous and ignorant thing that is called public opinion which bad and wellmeaning as it is when it tries to control action is infamous and of evil meaning when it tries to control thought or art  indeed there is much more to be said in favour of the physical force of the public than there is in favour of the publics opinion the former may be fine the latter must be foolish it is often said that force is no argument that however entirely depends on what one wants to prove many of the most important problems of the last few centuries such as the continuance of personal government in england or of feudalism in france have been solved entirely by means of physical force the very violence of a revolution may make the public grand and splendid for a moment it was a fatal day when the public discovered that the pen is mightier than the pavingstone and can be made as offensive as the brickbat they at once sought for the journalist found him developed him and made him their industrious and wellpaid servant it is greatly to be regretted for both their sakes behind the barricade there may be much that is noble and heroic but what is there behind the leadingarticle but prejudice stupidity cant and twaddle and when these four are joined together they make a terrible force and constitute the new authority  in old days men had the rack now they have the press that is an improvement certainly but still it is very bad and wrong and demoralising somebodywas it burkecalled journalism the fourth estate that was true at the time no doubt but at the present moment it really is the only estate it has eaten up the other three the lords temporal say nothing the lords spiritual have nothing to say and the house of commons has nothing to say and says it we are dominated by journalism in america the president reigns for four years and journalism governs for ever and ever fortunately in america journalism has carried its authority to the grossest and most brutal extreme as a natural consequence it has begun to create a spirit of revolt people are amused by it or disgusted by it according to their temperaments but it is no longer the real force it was it is not seriously treated in england journalism not except in a few wellknown instances having been carried to such excesses of brutality is still a great factor a really remarkable power the tyranny that it proposes to exercise over peoples private lives seems to me to be quite extraordinary the fact is that the public have an insatiable curiosity to know everything except what is worth knowing journalism conscious of this and having tradesmanlike habits supplies their demands in centuries before ours the public nailed the ears of journalists to the pump that was quite hideous in this century journalists have nailed their own ears to the keyhole that is much worse and what aggravates the mischief is that the journalists who are most to blame are not the amusing journalists who write for what are called society papers the harm is done by the serious thoughtful earnest journalists who solemnly as they are doing at present will drag before the eyes of the public some incident in the private life of a great statesman of a man who is a leader of political thought as he is a creator of political force and invite the public to discuss the incident to exercise authority in the matter to give their views and not merely to give their views but to carry them into action to dictate to the man upon all other points to dictate to his party to dictate to his country in fact to make themselves ridiculous offensive and harmful the private lives of men and women should not be told to the public the public have nothing to do with them at all in prance they manage these things better there they do not allow the details of the trials that take place in the divorce courts to be published for the amusement or criticism of the public all that the public are allowed to know is that the divorce has taken place and was granted on petition of one or other or both of the married parties concerned in france in fact they limit the journalist and allow the artist almost perfect freedom here we allow absolute freedom to the journalist and entirely limit the artist english public opinion that is to say tries to constrain and impede and warp the man who makes things that are beautiful in effect and compels the journalist to retail things that are ugly or disgusting or revolting in fact so that we have the most serious journalists in the world and the most indecent newspapers it is no exaggeration to talk of compulsion there are possibly some journalists who take a real pleasure in publishing horrible things or who being poor look to scandals as forming a sort of permanent basis for an income but there are other journalists i feel certain men of education and cultivation who really dislike publishing these things who know that it is wrong to do so and only do it because the unhealthy conditions under which their occupation is carried on oblige them to supply the public with what the public wants and to compete with other journalists in making that supply as full and satisfying to the gross popular appetite as possible it is a very degrading position for any body of educated men to be placed in and i have no doubt that most of them feel it acutely  however let us leave what is really a very sordid side of the subject and return to the question of popular control in the matter of art by which i mean public opinion dictating to the artist the form which he is to use the mode in which he is to use it and the materials with which he is to work i have pointed out that the arts which have escaped best in england are the arts in which the public have not been interested they are however interested in the drama and as a certain advance has been made in the drama within the last ten or fifteen years it is important to point out that this advance is entirely due to a few individual artists refusing to accept the popular want of taste as their standard and refusing to regard art as a mere matter of demand and supply with his marvellous and vivid personality with a style that has really a true colourelement in it with his extraordinary power not over mere mimicry but over imaginative and intellectual creation mr irving had his sole object been to give the public what they wanted could have produced the commonest plays in the commonest manner and made as much success and money as a man could possibly desire but his object was not that his object was to realise his own perfection as an artist under certain conditions and in certain forms of art at first he appealed to the few now he has educated the many he has created in the public both taste and temperament the public appreciate his artistic success immensely i often wonder however whether the public understand that that success is entirely due to the fact that he did not accept their standard but realised his own with their standard the lyceum would have been a sort of secondrate booth as some of the popular theatres in london are at present whether they understand it or not the fact however remains that taste and temperament have to a certain extent been created in the public and that the public is capable of developing these qualities the problem then is why do not the public become more civilised they have the capacity what stops them  the thing that stops them it must be said again is their desire to exercise authority over the artist and over works of art to certain theatres such as the lyceum and the haymarket the public seem to come in a proper mood in both of these theatres there have been individual artists who have succeeded in creating in their audiencesand every theatre in london has its own audiencethe temperament to which art appeals and what is that temperament it is the temperament of receptivity that is all  if a man approaches a work of art with any desire to exercise authority over it and the artist he approaches it in such a spirit that he cannot receive any artistic impression from it at all the work of art is to dominate the spectator the spectator is not to dominate the work of art the spectator is to be receptive he is to be the violin on which the master is to play and the more completely he can suppress his own silly views his own foolish prejudices his own absurd ideas of what art should be or should not be the more likely he is to understand and appreciate the work of art in question this is of course quite obvious in the case of the vulgar theatregoing public of english men and women but it is equally true of what are called educated people for an educated persons ideas of art are drawn naturally from what art has been whereas the new work of art is beautiful by being what art has never been and to measure it by the standard of the past is to measure it by a standard on the rejection of which its real perfection depends a temperament capable of receiving through an imaginative medium and under imaginative conditions new and beautiful impressions is the only temperament that can appreciate a work of art and true as this is in the case of the appreciation of sculpture and painting it is still more true of the appreciation of such arts as the drama for a picture and a statue are not at war with time they take no count of its succession in one moment their unity may be apprehended in the case of literature it is different time must be traversed before the unity of effect is realised and so in the drama there may occur in the first act of the play something whose real artistic value may not be evident to the spectator till the third or fourth act is reached is the silly fellow to get angry and call out and disturb the play and annoy the artists no the honest man is to sit quietly and know the delightful emotions of wonder curiosity and suspense he is not to go to the play to lose a vulgar temper he is to go to the play to realise an artistic temperament he is to go to the play to gain an artistic temperament he is not the arbiter of the work of art he is one who is admitted to contemplate the work of art and if the work be fine to forget in its contemplation all the egotism that mars himthe egotism of his ignorance or the egotism of his information this point about the drama is hardly i think sufficiently recognised i can quite understand that were macbeth produced for the first time before a modern london audience many of the people present would strongly and vigorously object to the introduction of the witches in the first act with their grotesque phrases and their ridiculous words but when the play is over one realises that the laughter of the witches in macbeth is as terrible as the laughter of madness in lear more terrible than the daughter of iago in the tragedy of the moor no spectator of art needs a more perfect mood of receptivity than the spectator of a play the moment he seeks to exercise authority he becomes the avowed enemy of art and of himself art does not mind it is he who suffers  with the novel it is the same thing popular authority and the recognition of popular authority are fatal thackerays esmond is a beautiful work of art because he wrote it to please himself in his other novels in pendennis in philip in vanity fair even at times he is too conscious of the public and spoils his work by appealing directly to the sympathies of the public or by directly mocking at them a true artist takes no notice whatever of the public the public are to him nonexistent he has no poppied or honeyed cakes through which to give the monster sleep or sustenance he leaves that to the popular novelist one incomparable novelist we have now in england mr george meredith there are better artists in france but france has no one whose view of life is so large so varied so imaginatively true there are tellers of stories in russia who have a more vivid sense of what pain in fiction may be but to him belongs philosophy in fiction his people not merely live but they live in thought one can see them from myriad points of view they are suggestive there is soul in them and around them they are interpretative and symbolic and he who made them those wonderful quicklymoving figures made them for his own pleasure and has never asked the public what they wanted has never cared to know what they wanted has never allowed the public to dictate to him or influence him in any way but has gone on intensifying his own personality and producing his own individual work at first none came to him that did not matter then the few came to him that did not change him the many have come now he is still the same hes an incomparable novelist  with the decorative arts it is not different the public clung with really pathetic tenacity to what i believe were the direct traditions of the great exhibition of international vulgarity traditions that were so appalling that the houses in which people lived were only fit for blind people to live in beautiful things began to be made beautiful colours came from the dyers hand beautiful patterns from the artists brain and the use of beautiful things and their value and importance were set forth the public were really very indignant they lost their temper they said silly things no one minded no one was a whit the worse no one accepted the authority of public opinion and now it is almost impossible to enter any modern house without seeing some recognition of good taste some recognition of the value of lovely surroundings some sign of appreciation of beauty in fact peoples houses are as a rule quite charming nowadays people have been to a very great extent civilised it is only fair to state however that the extraordinary success of the revolution in housedecoration and furniture and the like has not really been due to the majority of the public developing a very fine taste in such matters it has been chiefly due to the fact that the craftsmen of things so appreciated the pleasure of making what was beautiful and woke to such a vivid consciousness of the hideousness and vulgarity of what the public had previously wanted that they simply starved the public out it would be quite impossible at the present moment to furnish a room as rooms were furnished a few years ago without going for everything to an auction of secondhand furniture from some thirdrate lodginghouse the things are no longer made however they may object to it people must nowadays have something charming in their surroundings fortunately for them their assumption of authority in these artmatters came to entire grief  it is evident then that all authority in such things is bad people sometimes inquire what form of government is most suitable for an artist to live under to this question there is only one answer the form of government that is most suitable to the artist is no government at all authority over him and his art is ridiculous it has been stated that under despotisms artists have produced lovely work this is not quite so artists have visited despots not as subjects to be tyrannised over but as wandering wondermakers as fascinating vagrant personalities to be entertained and charmed and suffered to be at peace and allowed to create there is this to be said in favour of the despot that he being an individual may have culture while the mob being a monster has none one who is an emperor and king may stoop down to pick up a brush for a painter but when the democracy stoops down it is merely to throw mud and yet the democracy have not so far to stoop as the emperor in fact when they want to throw mud they have not to stoop at all but there is no necessity to separate the monarch from the mob all authority is equally bad  there are three kinds of despots there is the despot who tyrannises over the body there is the despot who tyrannises over the soul there is the despot who tyrannises over the soul and body alike the first is called the prince the second is called the pope the third is called the people the prince may be cultivated many princes have been yet in the prince there is danger one thinks of dante at the bitter feast in verona of tasso in ferraras madmans cell it is better for the artist not to live with princes the pope may be cultivated many popes have been the bad popes have been the bad popes loved beauty almost as passionately nay with as much passion as the good popes hated thought to the wickedness of the papacy humanity owes much the goodness of the papacy owes a terrible debt to humanity yet though the vatican has kept the rhetoric of its thunders and lost the rod of its lightning it is better for the artist not to live with popes it was a pope who said of cellini to a conclave of cardinals that common laws and common authority were not made for men such as he but it was a pope who thrust cellini into prison and kept him there till he sickened with rage and created unreal visions for himself and saw the gilded sun enter his room and grew so enamoured of it that he sought to escape and crept out from tower to tower and falling through dizzy air at dawn maimed himself and was by a vinedresser covered with vine leaves and carried in a cart to one who loving beautiful things had care of him there is danger in popes and as for the people what of them and their authority perhaps of them and their authority one has spoken enough their authority is a thing blind deaf hideous grotesque tragic amusing serious and obscene it is impossible for the artist to live with the people all despots bribe the people bribe and brutalise who told them to exercise authority they were made to live to listen and to love someone has done them a great wrong they have marred themselves by imitation of their inferiors they have taken the sceptre of the prince how should they use it they have taken the triple tiara of the pope how should they carry its burden they are as a clown whose heart is broken they are as a priest whose soul is not yet born let all who love beauty pity them though they themselves love not beauty yet let them pity themselves who taught them the trick of tyranny  there are many other things that one might point out one might point out how the renaissance was great because it sought to solve no social problem and busied itself not about such things but suffered the individual to develop freely beautifully and naturally and so had great and individual artists and great and individual men one might point out how louis xiv by creating the modern state destroyed the individualism of the artist and made things monstrous in their monotony of repetition and contemptible in their conformity to rule and destroyed throughout all france all those fine freedoms of expression that had made tradition new in beauty and new modes one with antique form but the past is of no importance the present is of no importance it is with the future that we have to deal for the past is what man should not have been the present is what man ought not to be the future is what artists are  it will of course be said that such a scheme as is set forth here is quite unpractical and goes against human nature this is perfectly true it is unpractical and it goes against human nature this is why it is worth carrying out and that is why one proposes it for what is a practical scheme a practical scheme is either a scheme that is already in existence or a scheme that could be carried out under existing conditions but it is exactly the existing conditions that one objects to and any scheme that could accept these conditions is wrong and foolish the conditions will be done away with and human nature will change the only thing that one really knows about human nature is that it changes change is the one quality we can predicate of it the systems that fail are those that rely on the permanency of human nature and not on its growth and development the error of louis xiv was that he thought human nature would always be the same the result of his error was the french revolution it was an admirable result all the results of the mistakes of governments are quite admirable  it is to be noted also that individualism does not come to man with any sickly cant about duty which merely means doing what other people want because they want it or any hideous cant about selfsacrifice which is merely a survival of savage mutilation in fact it does not come to man with any claims upon him at all it comes naturally and inevitably out of man it is the point to which all development tends it is the differentiation to which all organisms grow it is the perfection that is inherent in every mode of life and towards which every mode of life quickens and so individualism exercises no compulsion over man on the contrary it says to man that he should suffer no compulsion to be exercised over him it does not try to force people to be good it knows that people are good when they are let alone man will develop individualism out of himself man is now so developing individualism to ask whether individualism is practical is like asking whether evolution is practical evolution is the law of life and there is no evolution except towards individualism where this tendency is not expressed it is a case of artificiallyarrested growth or of disease or of death  individualism will also be unselfish and unaffected it has been pointed out that one of the results of the extraordinary tyranny of authority is that words are absolutely distorted from their proper and simple meaning and are used to express the obverse of their right signification what is true about art is true about life a man is called affected nowadays if he dresses as he likes to dress but in doing that he is acting in a perfectly natural manner affectation in such matters consists in dressing according to the views of ones neighbour whose views as they are the views of the majority will probably be extremely stupid or a man is called selfish if he lives in the manner that seems to him most suitable for the full realisation of his own personality if in fact the primary aim of his life is selfdevelopment but this is the way in which everyone should live selfishness is not living as one wishes to live it is asking others to live as one wishes to live and unselfishness is letting other peoples lives alone not interfering with them selfishness always aims at creating around it an absolute uniformity of type unselfishness recognises infinite variety of type as a delightful thing accepts it acquiesces in it enjoys it it is not selfish to think for oneself a man who does not think for himself does not think at all it is grossly selfish to require of ones neighbour that he should think in the same way and hold the same opinions why should he if he can think he will probably think differently if he cannot think it is monstrous to require thought of any kind from him a red rose is not selfish because it wants to be a red rose it would be horribly selfish if it wanted all the other flowers in the garden to be both red and roses under individualism people will be quite natural and absolutely unselfish and will know the meanings of the words and realise them in their free beautiful lives nor will men be egotistic as they are now for the egotist is he who makes claims upon others and the individualist will not desire to do that it will not give him pleasure when man has realised individualism he will also realise sympathy and exercise it freely and spontaneously up to the present man has hardly cultivated sympathy at all he has merely sympathy with pain and sympathy with pain is not the highest form of sympathy all sympathy is fine but sympathy with suffering is the least fine mode it is tainted with egotism it is apt to become morbid there is in it a certain element of terror for our own safety we become afraid that we ourselves might be as the leper or as the blind and that no man would have care of us it is curiously limiting too one should sympathise with the entirety of life not with lifes sores and maladies merely but with lifes joy and beauty and energy and health and freedom the wider sympathy is of course the more difficult it requires more unselfishness anybody can sympathise with the sufferings of a friend but it requires a very fine natureit requires in fact the nature of a true individualistto sympathise with a friends success  in the modern stress of competition and struggle for place such sympathy is naturally rare and is also very much stifled by the immoral ideal of uniformity of type and conformity to rule which is so prevalent everywhere and is perhaps most obnoxious in england  sympathy with pain there will of course always be it is one of the first instincts of man the animals which are individual the higher animals that is to say share it with us but it must be remembered that while sympathy with joy intensifies the sum of joy in the world sympathy with pain does not really diminish the amount of pain it may make man better able to endure evil but the evil remains sympathy with consumption does not cure consumption that is what science does and when socialism has solved the problem of poverty and science solved the problem of disease the area of the sentimentalists will be lessened and the sympathy of man will be large healthy and spontaneous man will have joy in the contemplation of the joyous life of others  for it is through joy that the individualism of the future will develop itself christ made no attempt to reconstruct society and consequently the individualism that he preached to man could be realised only through pain or in solitude the ideals that we owe to christ are the ideals of the man who abandons society entirely or of the man who resists society absolutely but man is naturally social even the thebaid became peopled at last and though the cenobite realises his personality it is often an impoverished personality that he so realises upon the other hand the terrible truth that pain is a mode through which man may realise himself exercises a wonderful fascination over the world shallow speakers and shallow thinkers in pulpits and on platforms often talk about the worlds worship of pleasure and whine against it but it is rarely in the worlds history that its ideal has been one of joy and beauty the worship of pain has far more often dominated the world mediævalism with its saints and martyrs its love of selftorture its wild passion for wounding itself its gashing with knives and its whipping with rodsmediævalism is real christianity and the mediæval christ is the real christ when the renaissance dawned upon the world and brought with it the new ideals of the beauty of life and the joy of living men could not understand christ even art shows us that the painters of the renaissance drew christ as a little boy playing with another boy in a palace or a garden or lying back in his mothers arms smiling at her or at a flower or at a bright bird or as a noble stately figure moving nobly through the world or as a wonderful figure rising in a sort of ecstasy from death to life even when they drew him crucified they drew him as a beautiful god on whom evil men had inflicted suffering but he did not preoccupy them much what delighted them was to paint the men and women whom they admired and to show the loveliness of this lovely earth they painted many religious picturesin fact they painted far too many and the monotony of type and motive is wearisome and was bad for art it was the result of the authority of the public in artmatters and is to be deplored but their soul was not in the subject raphael was a great artist when he painted his portrait of the pope when he painted his madonnas and infant christs he is not a great artist at all christ had no message for the renaissance which was wonderful because it brought an ideal at variance with his and to find the presentation of the real christ we must go to mediæval art there he is one maimed and marred one who is not comely to look on because beauty is a joy one who is not in fair raiment because that may be a joy also he is a beggar who has a marvellous soul he is a leper whose soul is divine he needs neither property nor health he is a god realising his perfection through pain  the evolution of man is slow the injustice of men is great it was necessary that pain should be put forward as a mode of selfrealisation even now in some places in the world the message of christ is necessary no one who lived in modern russia could possibly realise his perfection except by pain a few russian artists have realised themselves in art in a fiction that is mediæval in character hecauae its dominant note is the realisation of men through suffering but for those who are not artists and to whom there is no mode of life but the actual life of fact pain is the only door to perfection a russian who lives happily under the present system of government in russia must either believe that man has no soul or that if he has it is not worth developing a nihilist who rejects all authority because he knows authority to be evil and welcomes all pain because through that he realises his personality is a real christian to him the christian ideal is a true thing  and yet christ did not revolt against authority he accepted the imperial authority of the roman empire and paid tribute he endured the ecclesiastical authority of the jewish church and would not repel its violence by any violence of his own he had as i said before no scheme for the reconstruction of society but the modern world has schemes it proposes to do away with poverty and the suffering that it entails it desires to get rid of pain and the suffering that pain entails it trusts to socialism and to science as its methods what it aims at is an individualism expressing itself through joy this individualism will be larger fuller lovelier than any individualism has ever been pain is not the ultimate mode of perfection it is merely provisional and a protest it has reference to wrong unhealthy unjust surroundings when the wrong and the disease and the injustice are removed it will have no further place it will have done its work it was a great work but it is almost over its sphere lessens every day  nor will man miss it for what man has sought for is indeed neither pain nor pleasure but simply life man has sought to live intensely fully perfectly when he can do so without exercising restraint on others or suffering it ever and his activities are all pleasurable to him he will be saner healthier more civilised more himself pleasure is natures test her sign of approval when man is happy he is in harmony with himself and his environment the new individualism for whose service socialism whether it wills it or not is working will be perfect harmony it will be what the greeks sought for but could not except in thought realise completely because they had slaves and fed them it will be what the renaissance sought for but could not realise completely except in art because they had slaves and starved them it will be complete and through it each man will attain to his perfection the new individualism is the new hellenism   reprinted from the fortnightly review by permission of messrs chapman  hall
