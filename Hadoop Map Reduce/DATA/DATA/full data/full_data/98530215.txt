98530215	dutch courage and other stories  by  jack london  new york  1924        illustration jack london sailor     preface   ive never written a line that id be ashamed for my young daughters to read and i never shall write such a line  thus jack london well along in his career and thus almost any collection of his adventure stories is acceptable to young readers as well as to their elders so in sorting over the few manuscripts still unpublished in book form while most of them were written primarily for boys and girls i do not hesitate to include as appropriate a tale such as whose business is to live  number two of the present group typhoon off the coast of japan is the first story ever written by jack london for publication at the age of seventeen he had returned from his deepwater voyage in the sealing schooner sophie sutherland and was working thirteen hours a day for forty dollars a month in an oakland california jute mill the san francisco call offered a prize of twentyfive dollars for the best written descriptive article jacks mother flora london remembering that i had excelled in his school compositions urged him to enter the contest by recalling some happening of his travels grammar school years earlier had been his sole disciplined education but his wide reading worldly experience and extraordinary powers of observation and correlation enabled him to command first prize it is notable that the second and third awards went to students at california and stanford universities  jack never took the trouble to hunt up that old san francisco call of november 12 1893 but when i came to write his biography the book of jack london i unearthed the issue and the tale appears intact in my english edition published in 1921 and now gathering material for what will be the final jack london collections i cannot but think that his first printed story will have unusual interest for his readers of all ages  the boy jacks unexpected success in that virgin venture naturally spurred him to further effort it was for one thing the pleasantest way he had ever earned so much money even if it lacked the element of physical prowess and danger that had marked those purple days with the oyster pirates and later equally exciting passages with the fish patrol he only waited to catch up on sleep lost while hammering out typhoon off the coast of japan before applying himself to new fiction that was what was the matter with it it was sheer fiction in place of the whitehot realism of the true story that had brought him distinction this second venture he afterward termed gush it was promptly rejected by the editor of the call lacking experience in such matters jack could not know why and it did not occur to him to submit his manuscript elsewhere his fire was dampened he gave over writing and continued with the jute mill and innocent social diversion in company with louis shattuck and his friends who had superseded jacks wilder comrades and hazards of bay and seafaring this period following the publication of typhoon off the coast of japan is touched upon in his book john barleycorn  the next that one hears of attempts at writing is when during his tramping episode he showed some stories to his aunt mrs everhard in st joseph michigan and in the ensuing months of that year 1894 she received other romances mailed at his stopping places along the eastward route alone or with kellys industrial army as yet it had not sunk into his consciousness that his unyouthful knowledge of life in the raw would be the means of success in literature therefore he discoursed of imaginary things and persons lords and ladies days of chivalry and what notanything but out of his priceless firsthand lore at the same time however he kept a small diary which in the days when he had found himself helped in visualizing his tramp life in the road  the only out and out juvenile in the jack london list prior to his death is the cruise of the dazzler published in 1902 at that it is a good and authentic maritime study of its kind and not lacking in honest thrills tales of the fish patrol comes next as a book for boys but the happenings told therein are perilous enough to interest many an older reader  i am often asked which of his books have made the strongest appeal to youth the impulse is to answer that it depends upon the particular type of youth as example there lies before me a letter from a friend ruth she is eleven has been reading every book of your husbands that she can get hold of she is crazy over the stories i have bought nearly all of them but cannot find the son of the wolf moon face and michael brother of jerry will you tell me where i can order these i have not yet learned ruths favorites but i smile to myself at thought of the rereading she may have to do when her mind has more fully developed  the youth of every country who read jack london naturally turn to his adventure storiesparticularly the call of the wild and its companion white fang the sea wolf the cruise of the snark and my own journal the log of the snark and our hawaii smoke bellew tales adventure the mutiny of the elsinore as well as before adam the game the abysmal brute the road jerry of the islands and its sequel michael brother of jerry and because of the last named the youth of many lands are enrolling in the famous jack london club this was inspired by dr francis h bowley president of the massachusetts spca the club expects no dues membership is automatic through the mere promise to leave any playhouse during an animal performance the protest thereby registered is bound in good time to do away with the abuses that attend animal training for show purposes michael brother of jerry was written out of jack londons heart of love and head of understanding of animals aided by a yearslong study of the conditions of which he treats incidentally this book contains one of the most charming bits of seafaring romance of the southern ocean that he ever wrote  during the great war the english speaking soldiers called freely for the foregoing novels dubbing them the jacklondons and there was also lively demand for burning daylight the scarlet plague the star rover the little lady of the big house the valley of the moon and because of its prophetic spirit the iron heel there was likewise a desire for the shortstory collections such as the god of his fathers children of the frost the faith of men love of life lost face when god laughs and later groups like south sea tales a son of the sun the night born and the house of pride and a long list beside  but for the serious minded youth of america great britain and all countries where jack londons work has been translatedyouth considering life with a purposemartin eden is the beacon passing years only augment the number of messages that find their way to me from near and far attesting the worth to thoughtful boys and girls young men and women of the authors own formative struggle in life and letters as partially outlined in martin eden  the present sheaf of young folks stories were written during the latter part of that battle for recognition and my gathering of them inside book covers is pursuant of his own intention at the time of his death on november 22 1916    charmian london    jack london ranch     glen ellen sonoma county california

adventure in the upper sea   baldface   in yeddo bay   whose business is to live     dutch courage   just our luck  gus lafee finished wiping his hands and sullenly threw the towel upon the rocks his attitude was one of deep dejection the light seemed gone out of the day and the glory from the golden sun even the keen mountain air was devoid of relish and the early morning no longer yielded its customary zest  just our luck gus repeated this time avowedly for the edification of another young fellow who was busily engaged in sousing his head in the water of the lake  what are you grumbling about anyway hazard van dorn lifted a soaprimmed face questioningly his eyes were shut whats our luck  look there gus threw a moody glance skyward some duffers got ahead of us weve been scooped thats all  hazard opened his eyes and caught a fleeting glimpse of a white flag waving arrogantly on the edge of a wall of rock nearly a mile above his head then his eyes closed with a snap and his face wrinkled spasmodically gus threw him the towel and uncommiseratingly watched him wipe out the offending soap he felt too blue himself to take stock in trivialities  hazard groaned  does it hurtmuch gus queried coldly without interest as if it were no more than his duty to ask after the welfare of his comrade  i guess it does responded the suffering one  soaps pretty strong ehnoticed it myself  tisnt the soap itsits that he opened his reddened eyes and pointed toward the innocent white little flag thats what hurts  gus lafee did not reply but turned away to start the fire and begin cooking breakfast his disappointment and grief were too deep for anything but silence and hazard who felt likewise never opened his mouth as he fed the horses nor once laid his head against their arching necks or passed caressing fingers through their manes the two boys were blind also to the manifold glories of mirror lake which reposed at their very feet nine times had they chosen to move along its margin the short distance of a hundred yards could they have seen the sunrise repeated nine times from behind as many successive peaks could they have seen the great orb rear his blazing rim and nine times had they but looked into the waters of the lake could they have seen the phenomena reflected faithfully and vividly but all the titanic grandeur of the scene was lost to them they had been robbed of the chief pleasure of their trip to yosemite valley they had been frustrated in their longcherished design upon half dome and hence were rendered disconsolate and blind to the beauties and the wonders of the place  half dome rears its icescarred head fully five thousand feet above the level floor of yosemite valley in the name itself of this great rock lies an accurate and complete description nothing more nor less is it than a cyclopean rounded dome split in half as cleanly as an apple that is divided by a knife it is perhaps quite needless to state that but onehalf remains hence its name the other half having been carried away by the great iceriver in the stormy time of the glacial period in that dim day one of those frigid rivers gouged a mighty channel from out the solid rock this channel today is yosemite valley but to return to the half dome on its northeastern side by circuitous trails and stiff climbing one may gain the saddle against the slope of the dome the saddle leans like a gigantic slab and from the top of this slab one thousand feet in length curves the great circle to the summit of the dome a few degrees too steep for unaided climbing these one thousand feet defied for years the adventurous spirits who fixed yearning eyes upon the crest above  one day a couple of clearheaded mountaineers had proceeded to insert iron eyebolts into holes which they drilled into the rock every few feet apart but when they found themselves three hundred feet above the saddle clinging like flies to the precarious wall with on either hand a yawning abyss their nerves failed them and they abandoned the enterprise so it remained for an indomitable scotchman one george anderson finally to achieve the feat beginning where they had left off drilling and climbing for a week he had at last set foot upon that awful summit and gazed down into the depths where mirror lake reposed nearly a mile beneath  in the years which followed many bold men took advantage of the huge rope ladder which he had put in place but one winter ladder cables and all were carried away by the snow and ice true most of the eyebolts twisted and bent remained but few men had since essayed the hazardous undertaking and of those few more than one gave up his life on the treacherous heights and not one succeeded  but gus lafee and hazard van dorn had left the smiling valleyland of california and journeyed into the high sierras intent on the great adventure and thus it was that their disappointment was deep and grievous when they awoke on this morning to receive the forestalling message of the little white flag  camped at the foot of the saddle last night and went up at the first peep of day hazard ventured long after the silent breakfast had been tucked away and the dishes washed  gus nodded it was not in the nature of things that a youths spirits should long remain at low ebb and his tongue was beginning to loosen  guess hes down by now lying in camp and feeling as big as alexander the other went on and i dont blame him either only i wish it were we  you can be sure hes down gus spoke up at last its mighty warm on that naked rock with the sun beating down on it at this time of year that was our plan you know to go up early and come down early and any man sensible enough to get to the top is bound to have sense enough to do it before the rock gets hot and his hands sweaty  and you can be sure he didnt take his shoes with him hazard rolled over on his back and lazily regarded the speck of flag fluttering briskly on the sheer edge of the precipice say he sat up with a start whats that  a metallic ray of light flashed out from the summit of half dome then a second and a third the heads of both boys were craned backward on the instant agog with excitement  what a duffer gus cried why didnt he come down when it was cool  hazard shook his head slowly as if the question were too deep for immediate answer and they had better defer judgment  the flashes continued and as the boys soon noted at irregular intervals of duration and disappearance now they were long now short and again they came and went with great rapidity or ceased altogether for several moments at a time  i have it hazards face lighted up with the coming of understanding i have it that fellow up there is trying to talk to us hes flashing the sunlight down to us on a pocketmirrordot dash dot dash dont you see  the light also began to break in guss face ah i know its what they do in wartimesignaling they call it heliographing dont they same thing as telegraphing only its done without wires and they use the same dots and dashes too  yes the morse alphabet wish i knew it  same here he surely must have something to say to us or he wouldnt be kicking up all that rumpus  still the flashes came and went persistently till gus exclaimed that chaps in trouble thats whats the matter with him most likely hes hurt himself or something or other  go on hazard scouted  gus got out the shotgun and fired both barrels three times in rapid succession a perfect flutter of flashes came back before the echoes had ceased their antics so unmistakable was the message that even doubting hazard was convinced that the man who had forestalled them stood in some grave danger  quick gus he cried and pack ill see to the horses our trip hasnt come to nothing after all weve got to go right up half dome and rescue him wheres the map how do we get to the saddle  taking the horsetrail below the vernal falls gus read from the guidebook one mile of brisk traveling brings the tourist to the worldfamed nevada fall close by rising up in all its pomp and glory the cap of liberty stands guard  skip all that hazard impatiently interrupted the trails what we want  oh here it is following the trail up the side of the fall will bring you to the forks the left one leads to little yosemite valley clouds rest and other points  hold on thatll do ive got it on the map now again interrupted hazard from the clouds rest trail a dotted line leads off to half dome that shows the trails abandoned well have to look sharp to find it its a days journey  and to think of all that traveling when right here were at the bottom of the dome gus complained staring up wistfully at the goal  thats because this is yosemite and all the more reason for us to hurry come on be lively now  well used as they were to trail life but few minutes sufficed to see the camp equipage on the backs of the packhorses and the boys in the saddle in the late twilight of that evening they hobbled their animals in a tiny mountain meadow and cooked coffee and bacon for themselves at the very base of the saddle here also before they turned into their blankets they found the camp of the unlucky stranger who was destined to spend the night on the naked roof of the dome  dawn was brightening into day when the panting lads threw themselves down at the summit of the saddle and began taking off their shoes looking down from the great height they seemed perched upon the ridgepole of the world and even the snowcrowned sierra peaks seemed beneath them directly below on the one hand lay little yosemite valley half a mile deep on the other hand big yosemite a mile already the suns rays were striking about the adventurers but the darkness of night still shrouded the two great gulfs into which they peered and above them bathed in the full day rose only the majestic curve of the dome  whats that for gus asked pointing to a leathershielded flask which hazard was securely fastening in his shirt pocket  dutch courage of course was the reply well need all our nerve in this undertaking and a little bit more and he tapped the flask significantly heres the little bit more  good idea gus commented  how they had ever come possessed of this erroneous idea it would be hard to discover but they were young yet and there remained for them many uncut pages of life believers also in the efficacy of whisky as a remedy for snakebite they had brought with them a fair supply of medicinechest liquor as yet they had not touched it  have some before we start hazard asked  gus looked into the gulf and shook his head better wait till we get up higher and the climbing is more ticklish  some seventy feet above them projected the first eyebolt the winter accumulations of ice had twisted and bent it down till it did not stand more than a bare inch and a half above the rocka most difficult object to lasso as such a distance time and again hazard coiled his lariat in true cowboy fashion and made the cast and time and again was he baffled by the elusive peg nor could gus do better taking advantage of inequalities in the surface they scrambled twenty feet up the dome and found they could rest in a shallow crevice the cleft side of the dome was so near that they could look over its edge from the crevice and gaze down the smooth vertical wall for nearly two thousand feet it was yet too dark down below for them to see farther  the peg was now fifty feet away but the path they must cover to get to it was quite smooth and ran at an inclination of nearly fifty degrees it seemed impossible in that intervening space to find a restingplace either the climber must keep going up or he must slide down he could not stop but just here rose the danger the dome was sphereshaped and if he should begin to slide his course would be not to the point from which he had started and where the saddle would catch him but off to the south toward little yosemite this meant a plunge of half a mile  ill try it gus said simply  they knotted the two lariats together so that they had over a hundred feet of rope between them and then each boy tied an end to his waist  if i slide gus cautioned come in on the slack and brace yourself if you dont youll follow me thats all  ay ay was the confident response better take a nip before you start  gus glanced at the proffered bottle he knew himself and of what he was capable wait till i make the peg and you join me all ready  ay  he struck out like a cat on all fours clawing energetically as he urged his upward progress his comrade paying out the rope carefully at first his speed was good but gradually it dwindled now he was fifteen feet from the peg now ten now eightbut going oh so slowly hazard looking up from his crevice felt a contempt for him and disappointment in him it did look easy now gus was five feet away and after a painful effort four feet but when only a yard intervened he came to a standstillnot exactly a standstill for like a squirrel in a wheel he maintained his position on the face of the dome by the most desperate clawing  he had failed that was evident the question now was how to save himself with a sudden catlike movement he whirled over on his back caught his heel in a tiny saucershaped depression and sat up then his courage failed him day had at last penetrated to the floor of the valley and he was appalled at the frightful distance  go ahead and make it hazard ordered but gus merely shook his head  then come down  again he shook his head this was his ordeal to sit nerveless and insecure on the brink of the precipice but hazard lying safely in his crevice now had to face his own ordeal but one of a different nature when gus began to slideas he soon mustwould he hazard be able to take in the slack and then meet the shock as the other tautened the rope and darted toward the plunge it seemed doubtful and there he lay apparently safe but in reality harnessed to death then rose the temptation why not cast off the rope about his waist he would be safe at all events it was a simple way out of the difficulty there was no need that two should perish but it was impossible for such temptation to overcome his pride of race and his own pride in himself and in his honor so the rope remained about him  come down he ordered but gus seemed to have become petrified  come down he threatened or ill drag you down he pulled on the rope to show he was in earnest  dont you dare gus articulated through his clenched teeth  sure i will if you dont come again he jerked the rope  with a despairing gurgle gus started doing his best to work sideways from the plunge hazard every sense on the alert almost exulting in his perfect coolness took in the slack with deft rapidity then as the rope began to tighten he braced himself the shock drew him half out of the crevice but he held firm and served as the center of the circle while gus with the rope as a radius described the circumference and ended up on the extreme southern edge of the saddle a few moments later hazard was offering him the flask  take some yourself gus said  no you i dont need it  and im past needing it evidently gus was dubious of the bottle and its contents  hazard put it away in his pocket are you game he asked or are you going to give it up  never gus protested i am game no lafee ever showed the white feather yet and if i did lose my grit up there it was only for the momentsort of like seasickness im all right now and im going to the top  good encouraged hazard you lie in the crevice this time and ill show you how easy it is  but gus refused he held that it was easier and safer for him to try again arguing that it was less difficult for his one hundred and sixteen pounds to cling to the smooth rock than for hazards one hundred and sixtyfive also that it was easier for one hundred and sixtyfive pounds to bring a sliding one hundred and sixteen to a stop than vice versa and further that he had the benefit of his previous experience hazard saw the justice of this although it was with great reluctance that he gave in  success vindicated guss contention the second time just as it seemed as if his slide would be repeated he made a last supreme effort and gripped the coveted peg by means of the rope hazard quickly joined him the next peg was nearly sixty feet away but for nearly half that distance the base of some glacier in the forgotten past had ground a shallow furrow taking advantage of this it was easy for gus to lasso the eyebolt and it seemed as was really the case that the hardest part of the task was over true the curve steepened to nearly sixty degrees above them but a comparatively unbroken line of eyebolts six feet apart awaited the lads they no longer had even to use the lasso standing on one peg it was childs play to throw the bight of the rope over the next and to draw themselves up to it  a bronzed and bearded man met them at the top and gripped their hands in hearty fellowship  talk about your mont blancs he exclaimed pausing in the midst of greeting them to survey the mighty panorama but theres nothing on all the earth nor over it nor under it to compare with this then he recollected himself and thanked them for coming to his aid no he was not hurt or injured in any way simply because of his own carelessness just as he had arrived at the top the previous day he had dropped his climbing rope of course it was impossible to descend without it did they understand heliographing no that was strange how did they  oh we knew something was the matter gus interrupted from the way you flashed when we fired off the shotgun  find it pretty cold last night without blankets hazard queried  i should say so ive hardly thawed out yet  have some of this hazard shoved the flask over to him  the stranger regarded him quite seriously for a moment then said my dear fellow do you see that row of pegs since it is my honest intention to climb down them very shortly i am forced to decline no i dont think ill have any though i thank you just the same  hazard glanced at gus and then put the flask back in his pocket but when they pulled the doubled rope through the last eyebolt and set foot on the saddle he again drew out the bottle  now that were down we dont need it he remarked pithily and ive about come to the conclusion that there isnt very much in dutch courage after all he gazed up the great curve of the dome look at what weve done without it  several seconds thereafter a party of tourists gathered at the margin of mirror lake were astounded at the unwonted phenomenon of a whisky flask descending upon them like a comet out of a clear sky and all the way back to the hotel they marveled greatly at the wonders of nature especially meteorites     typhoon off the coast of japan  jack londons first story published at the age of seventeen   it was four bells in the morning watch we had just finished breakfast when the order came forward for the watch on deck to stand by to heave her to and all hands stand by the boats  port hard a port cried our sailingmaster clew up the topsails let the flying jib run down back the jib over to windward and run down the foresail and so was our schooner sophie sutherland hove to off the japan coast near cape jerimo on april 10 1893  then came moments of bustle and confusion there were eighteen men to man the six boats some were hooking on the falls others casting off the lashings boatsteerers appeared with boatcompasses and waterbreakers and boatpullers with the lunch boxes hunters were staggering under two or three shotguns a rifle and heavy ammunition box all of which were soon stowed away with their oilskins and mittens in the boats  the sailingmaster gave his last orders and away we went pulling three pairs of oars to gain our positions we were in the weather boat and so had a longer pull than the others the first second and third lee boats soon had all sail set and were running off to the southward and westward with the wind beam while the schooner was running off to leeward of them so that in case of accident the boats would have fair wind home  it was a glorious morning but our boatsteerer shook his head ominously as he glanced at the rising sun and prophetically muttered red sun in the morning sailor take warning the sun had an angry look and a few light fleecy niggerheads in that quarter seemed abashed and frightened and soon disappeared  away off to the northward cape jerimo reared its black forbidding head like some huge monster rising from the deep the winters snow not yet entirely dissipated by the sun covered it in patches of glistening white over which the light wind swept on its way out to sea huge gulls rose slowly fluttering their wings in the light breeze and striking their webbed feet on the surface of the water for over half a mile before they could leave it hardly had the patter patter died away when a flock of sea quail rose and with whistling wings flew away to windward where members of a large band of whales were disporting themselves their blowings sounding like the exhaust of steam engines the harsh discordant cries of a seaparrot grated unpleasantly on the ear and set half a dozen alert in a small band of seals that were ahead of us away they went breaching and jumping entirely out of water a seagull with slow deliberate flight and long majestic curves circled round us and as a reminder of home a little english sparrow perched impudently on the focastle head and cocking his head on one side chirped merrily the boats were soon among the seals and the bang bang of the guns could be heard from down to leeward  the wind was slowly rising and by three oclock as with a dozen seals in our boat we were deliberating whether to go on or turn back the recall flag was run up at the schooners mizzena sure sign that with the rising wind the barometer was falling and that our sailingmaster was getting anxious for the welfare of the boats  away we went before the wind with a single reef in our sail with clenched teeth sat the boatsteerer grasping the steering oar firmly with both hands his restless eyes on the alerta glance at the schooner ahead as we rose on a sea another at the mainsheet and then one astern where the dark ripple of the wind on the water told him of a coming puff or a large whitecap that threatened to overwhelm us the waves were holding high carnival performing the strangest antics as with wild glee they danced along in fierce pursuitnow up now down here there and everywhere until some great sea of liquid green with its milkwhite crest of foam rose from the oceans throbbing bosom and drove the others from view but only for a moment for again under new forms they reappeared in the suns path they wandered where every ripple great or small every little spit or spray looked like molten silver where the water lost its dark green color and became a dazzling silvery flood only to vanish and become a wild waste of sullen turbulence each dark foreboding sea rising and breaking then rolling on again the dash the sparkle the silvery light soon vanished with the sun which became obscured by black clouds that were rolling swiftly in from the west northwest apt heralds of the coming storm  we soon reached the schooner and found ourselves the last aboard in a few minutes the seals were skinned boats and decks washed and we were down below by the roaring focastle fire with a wash change of clothes and a hot substantial supper before us sail had been put on the schooner as we had a run of seventyfive miles to make to the southward before morning so as to get in the midst of the seals out of which we had strayed during the last two days hunting  we had the first watch from eight to midnight the wind was soon blowing half a gale and our sailingmaster expected little sleep that night as he paced up and down the poop the topsails were soon clewed up and made fast then the flying jib run down and furled quite a sea was rolling by this time occasionally breaking over the decks flooding them and threatening to smash the boats at six bells we were ordered to turn them over and put on storm lashings this occupied us till eight bells when we were relieved by the midwatch i was the last to go below doing so just as the watch on deck was furling the spanker below all were asleep except our green hand the bricklayer who was dying of consumption the wildly dancing movements of the sea lamp cast a pale flickering light through the focastle and turned to golden honey the drops of water on the yellow oilskins in all the corners dark shadows seemed to come and go while up in the eyes of her beyond the pall bits descending from deck to deck where they seemed to lurk like some dragon at the caverns mouth it was dark as erebus now and again the light seemed to penetrate for a moment as the schooner rolled heavier than usual only to recede leaving it darker and blacker than before the roar of the wind through the rigging came to the ear muffled like the distant rumble of a train crossing a trestle or the surf on the beach while the loud crash of the seas on her weather bow seemed almost to rend the beams and planking asunder as it resounded through the focastle the creaking and groaning of the timbers stanchions and bulkheads as the strain the vessel was undergoing was felt served to drown the groans of the dying man as he tossed uneasily in his bunk the working of the foremast against the deck beams caused a shower of flaky powder to fall and sent another sound mingling with the tumultous storm small cascades of water streamed from the pall bits from the focastle head above and joining issue with the streams from the wet oilskins ran along the floor and disappeared aft into the main hold  at two bells in the middle watchthat is in land parlance one oclock in the morningthe order was roared out on the focastle all hands on deck and shorten sail  then the sleepy sailors tumbled out of their bunk and into their clothes oilskins and seaboots and up on deck tis when that order comes on cold blustering nights that jack grimly mutters who would not sell a farm and go to sea  it was on deck that the force of the wind could be fully appreciated especially after leaving the stifling focastle it seemed to stand up against you like a wall making it almost impossible to move on the heaving decks or to breathe as the fierce gusts came dashing by the schooner was hove to under jib foresail and mainsail we proceeded to lower the foresail and make it fast the night was dark greatly impeding our labor still though not a star or the moon could pierce the black masses of storm clouds that obscured the sky as they swept along before the gale nature aided us in a measure a soft light emanated from the movement of the ocean each mighty sea all phosphorescent and glowing with the tiny lights of myriads of animalculæ threatened to overwhelm us with a deluge of fire higher and higher thinner and thinner the crest grew as it began to curve and overtop preparatory to breaking until with a roar it fell over the bulwarks a mass of soft glowing light and tons of water which sent the sailors sprawling in all directions and left in each nook and cranny little specks of light that glowed and trembled till the next sea washed them away depositing new ones in their places sometimes several seas following each other with great rapidity and thundering down on our decks filled them full to the bulwarks but soon they were discharged through the lee scuppers  to reef the mainsail we were forced to run off before the gale under the single reefed jib by the time we had finished the wind had forced up such a tremendous sea that it was impossible to heave her to away we flew on the wings of the storm through the muck and flying spray a wind sheer to starboard then another to port as the enormous seas struck the schooner astern and nearly broached her to as day broke we took in the jib leaving not a sail unfurled since we had begun scudding she had ceased to take the seas over her bow but amidships they broke fast and furious it was a dry storm in the matter of rain but the force of the wind filled the air with fine spray which flew as high as the crosstrees and cut the face like a knife making it impossible to see over a hundred yards ahead the sea was a dark lead color as with long slow majestic roll it was heaped up by the wind into liquid mountains of foam the wild antics of the schooner were sickening as she forged along she would almost stop as though climbing a mountain then rapidly rolling to right and left as she gained the summit of a huge sea she steadied herself and paused for a moment as though affrighted at the yawning precipice before her like an avalanche she shot forward and down as the sea astern struck her with the force of a thousand battering rams burying her bow to the catheads in the milky foam at the bottom that came on deck in all directionsforward astern to right and left through the hawsepipes and over the rail  the wind began to drop and by ten oclock we were talking of heaving her to we passed a ship two schooners and a fourmasted barkentine under the smallest of canvas and at eleven oclock running up the spanker and jib we hove her to and in another hour we were beating back again against the aftersea under full sail to regain the sealing ground away to the westward  below a couple of men were sewing the bricklayers body in canvas preparatory to the sea burial and so with the storm passed away the bricklayers soul     the lost poacher   but they wont take excuses youre across the line and thats enough theyll take you in you go siberia and the saltmines and as for uncle sam why whats he to know about it never a word will get back to the states the mary thomas the papers will say the mary thomas lost with all hands probably in a typhoon in the japanese seas thats what the papers will say and people too in you go siberia and the saltmines dead to the world and kith and kin though you live fifty years  in such manner john lewis commonly known as the sealawyer settled the matter out of hand  it was a serious moment in the forecastle of the mary thomas no sooner had the watch below begun to talk the trouble over than the watch on deck came down and joined them as there was no wind every hand could be spared with the exception of the man at the wheel and he remained only for the sake of discipline even bub russell the cabinboy had crept forward to hear what was going on  however it was a serious moment as the grave faces of the sailors bore witness for the three preceding months the mary thomas sealing schooner had hunted the seal pack along the coast of japan and north to bering sea here on the asiatic side of the sea they were forced to give over the chase or rather to go no farther for beyond the russian cruisers patrolled forbidden ground where the seals might breed in peace  a week before she had fallen into a heavy fog accompanied by calm since then the fogbank had not lifted and the only wind had been light airs and catspaws this in itself was not so bad for the sealing schooners are never in a hurry so long as they are in the midst of the seals but the trouble lay in the fact that the current at this point bore heavily to the north thus the mary thomas had unwittingly drifted across the line and every hour she was penetrating unwillingly farther and farther into the dangerous waters where the russian bear kept guard  how far she had drifted no man knew the sun had not been visible for a week nor the stars and the captain had been unable to take observations in order to determine his position at any moment a cruiser might swoop down and hale the crew away to siberia the fate of other poaching sealhunters was too well known to the men of the mary thomas and there was cause for grave faces  mine friends spoke up a german boatsteerer it vas a pad piziness shust as ve make a big catch und all honest somedings go wrong und der russians nab us dake our skins and our schooner und send us mit der anarchists to siberia ach a pretty pad piziness  yes thats where it hurts the sea lawyer went on fifteen hundred skins in the salt piles and all honest a big payday coming to every man jack of us and then to be captured and lose it all itd be different if wed been poaching but its all honest work in open water  but if we havent done anything wrong they cant do anything to us can they bub queried  it strikes me as ow it aint the proper thing for a boy o your age shovin in when is elders is talkin protested an english sailor from over the edge of his bunk  oh thats all right jack answered the sealawyer hes a perfect right to aint he just as liable to lose his wages as the rest of us  wouldnt give thruppence for them jack sniffed back he had been planning to go home and see his family in chelsea when he was paid off and he was now feeling rather blue over the highly possible loss not only of his pay but of his liberty  how are they to know the sealawyer asked in answer to bubs previous question here we are in forbidden water how do they know but what we came here of our own accord here we are fifteen hundred skins in the hold how do they know whether we got them in open water or in the closed sea dont you see bub the evidence is all against us if you caught a man with his pockets full of apples like those which grow on your tree and if you caught him in your tree besides whatd you think if he told you he couldnt help it and had just been sort of blown there and that anyway those apples came from some other treewhatd you think eh  bub saw it clearly when put in that light and shook his head despondently  youd rather be dead than go to siberia one of the boatpullers said they put you into the saltmines and work you till you die never see daylight again why ive heard tell of one fellow that was chained to his mate and that mate died and they were both chained together and if they send you to the quicksilver mines you get salivated id rather be hung than salivated  wots salivated jack asked suddenly sitting up in his bunk at the hint of fresh misfortunes  why the quicksilver gets into your blood i think thats the way and your gums all swell like you had the scurvy only worse and your teeth get loose in your jaws and big ulcers form and then you die horrible the strongest man cant last long amining quicksilver  a pad piziness the boatsteerer reiterated dolorously in the silence which followed a pad piziness i vish i was in yokohama eh vot vas dot  the vessel had suddenly heeled over the decks were aslant a tin pannikin rolled down the inclined plane rattling and banging from above came the slapping of canvas and the quivering rattattat of the after leech of the loosely stretched foresail then the mates voice sang down the hatch all hands on deck and make sail  never had such summons been answered with more enthusiasm the calm had broken the wind had come which was to carry them south into safety with a wild cheer all sprang on deck working with mad haste they flung out topsails flying jibs and staysails as they worked the fogbank lifted and the black vault of heaven bespangled with the old familiar stars rushed into view when all was shipshape the mary thomas was lying gallantly over on her side to a beam wind and plunging ahead due south  steamers lights ahead on the port bow sir cried the lookout from his station on the forecastlehead there was excitement in the mans voice  the captain sent bub below for his nightglasses everybody crowded to the leerail to gaze at the suspicious stranger which already began to loom up vague and indistinct in those unfrequented waters the chance was one in a thousand that it could be anything else than a russian patrol the captain was still anxiously gazing through the glasses when a flash of flame left the strangers side followed by the loud report of a cannon the worst fears were confirmed it was a patrol evidently firing across the bows of the mary thomas in order to make her heave to  hard down with your helm the captain commanded the steersman all the life gone out of his voice then to the crew back over the jib and foresail run down the flying jib clew up the foretopsail and aft here and swing on to the mainsheet  the mary thomas ran into the eye of the wind lost headway and fell to courtesying gravely to the long seas rolling up from the west  the cruiser steamed a little nearer and lowered a boat the sealers watched in heartbroken silence they could see the white bulk of the boat as it was slacked away to the water and its crew sliding aboard they could hear the creaking of the davits and the commands of the officers then the boat sprang away under the impulse of the oars and came toward them the wind had been rising and already the sea was too rough to permit the frail craft to lie alongside the tossing schooner but watching their chance and taking advantage of the boarding ropes thrown to them an officer and a couple of men clambered aboard the boat then sheered off into safety and lay to its oars a young midshipman sitting in the stern and holding the yokelines in charge  the officer whose uniform disclosed his rank as that of second lieutenant in the russian navy went below with the captain of the mary thomas to look at the ships papers a few minutes later he emerged and upon his sailors removing the hatchcovers passed down into the hold with a lantern to inspect the salt piles it was a goodly heap which confronted himfifteen hundred fresh skins the seasons catch and under the circumstances he could have had but one conclusion  i am very sorry he said in broken english to the sealing captain when he again came on deck but it is my duty in the name of the tsar to seize your vessel as a poacher caught with fresh skins in the closed sea the penalty as you may know is confiscation and imprisonment  the captain of the mary thomas shrugged his shoulders in seeming indifference and turned away although they may restrain all outward show strong men under unmerited misfortune are sometimes very close to tears just then the vision of his little california home and of the wife and two yellowhaired boys was strong upon him and there was a strange choking sensation in his throat which made him afraid that if he attempted to speak he would sob instead  and also there was upon him the duty he owed his men no weakness before them for he must be a tower of strength to sustain them in misfortune he had already explained to the second lieutenant and knew the hopelessness of the situation as the sealawyer had said the evidence was all against him so he turned aft and fell to pacing up and down the poop of the vessel over which he was no longer commander  the russian officer now took temporary charge he ordered more of his men aboard and had all the canvas clewed up and furled snugly away while this was being done the boat plied back and forth between the two vessels passing a heavy hawser which was made fast to the great towingbitts on the schooners forecastlehead during all this work the sealers stood about in sullen groups it was madness to think of resisting with the guns of a manofwar not a biscuittoss away but they refused to lend a hand preferring instead to maintain a gloomy silence  having accomplished his task the lieutenant ordered all but four of his men back into the boat then the midshipman a lad of sixteen looking strangely mature and dignified in his uniform and sword came aboard to take command of the captured sealer just as the lieutenant prepared to depart his eyes chanced to alight upon bub without a word of warning he seized him by the arm and dropped him over the rail into the waiting boat and then with a parting wave of his hand he followed him  it was only natural that bub should be frightened at this unexpected happening all the terrible stories he had heard of the russians served to make him fear them and now returned to his mind with double force to be captured by them was bad enough but to be carried off by them away from his comrades was a fate of which he had not dreamed  be a good boy bub the captain called to him as the boat drew away from the mary thomass side and tell the truth  aye aye sir he answered bravely enough by all outward appearance he felt a certain pride of race and was ashamed to be a coward before these strange enemies these wild russian bears  und be politeful the german boatsteerer added his rough voice lifting across the water like a foghorn  bub waved his hand in farewell and his mates clustered along the rail as they answered with a cheering shout he found room in the sternsheets where he fell to regarding the lieutenant he didnt look so wild or bearish after allvery much like other men bub concluded and the sailors were much the same as all other manofwars men he had ever known nevertheless as his feet struck the steel deck of the cruiser he felt as if he had entered the portals of a prison  for a few minutes he was left unheeded the sailors hoisted the boat up and swung it in on the davits then great clouds of black smoke poured out of the funnels and they were under wayto siberia bub could not help but think he saw the mary thomas swing abruptly into line as she took the pressure from the hawser and her sidelights red and green rose and fell as she was towed through the sea  bubs eyes dimmed at the melancholy sight butbut just then the lieutenant came to take him down to the commander and he straightened up and set his lips firmly as if this were a very commonplace affair and he were used to being sent to siberia every day in the week the cabin in which the commander sat was like a palace compared to the humble fittings of the mary thomas and the commander himself in gold lace and dignity was a most august personage quite unlike the simple man who navigated his schooner on the trail of the seal pack  bub now quickly learned why he had been brought aboard and in the prolonged questioning which followed told nothing but the plain truth the truth was harmless only a lie could have injured his cause he did not know much except that they had been sealing far to the south in open water and that when the calm and fog came down upon them being close to the line they had drifted across again and again he insisted that they had not lowered a boat or shot a seal in the week they had been drifting about in the forbidden sea but the commander chose to consider all that he said to be a tissue of falsehoods and adopted a bullying tone in an effort to frighten the boy he threatened and cajoled by turns but failed in the slightest to shake bubs statements and at last ordered him out of his presence  by some oversight bub was not put in anybodys charge and wandered up on deck unobserved sometimes the sailors in passing bent curious glances upon him but otherwise he was left strictly alone nor could he have attracted much attention for he was small the night dark and the watch on deck intent on its own business stumbling over the strange decks he made his way aft where he could look upon the sidelights of the mary thomas following steadily in the rear  for a long while he watched and then lay down in the darkness close to where the hawser passed over the stern to the captured schooner once an officer came up and examined the straining rope to see if it were chafing but bub cowered away in the shadow undiscovered this however gave him an idea which concerned the lives and liberties of twentytwo men and which was to avert crushing sorrow from more than one happy home many thousand miles away  in the first place he reasoned the crew were all guiltless of any crime and yet were being carried relentlessly away to imprisonment in siberiaa living death he had heard and he believed it implicitly in the second place he was a prisoner hard and fast with no chance of escape in the third it was possible for the twentytwo men on the mary thomas to escape the only thing which bound them was a fourinch hawser they dared not cut it at their end for a watch was sure to be maintained upon it by their russian captors but at this end ah at his end  bub did not stop to reason further wriggling close to the hawser he opened his jackknife and went to work the blade was not very sharp and he sawed away ropeyarn by ropeyarn the awful picture of the solitary siberian exile he must endure growing clearer and more terrible at every stroke such a fate was bad enough to undergo with ones comrades but to face it alone seemed frightful and besides the very act he was performing was sure to bring greater punishment upon him  in the midst of such somber thoughts he heard footsteps approaching he wriggled away into the shadow an officer stopped where he had been working halfstooped to examine the hawser then changed his mind and straightened up for a few minutes he stood there gazing at the lights of the captured schooner and then went forward again  now was the time bub crept back and went on sawing now two parts were severed now three but one remained the tension upon this was so great that it readily yielded splash the freed end went overboard he lay quietly his heart in his mouth listening no one on the cruiser but himself had heard  he saw the red and green lights of the mary thomas grow dimmer and dimmer then a faint hallo came over the water from the russian prize crew still nobody heard the smoke continued to pour out of the cruisers funnels and her propellers throbbed as mightily as ever  what was happening on the mary thomas bub could only surmise but of one thing he was certain his comrades would assert themselves and overpower the four sailors and the midshipman a few minutes later he saw a small flash and straining his ears heard the very faint report of a pistol then oh joy both the red and green lights suddenly disappeared the mary thomas was retaken  just as an officer came aft bub crept forward and hid away in one of the boats not an instant too soon the alarm was given loud voices rose in command the cruiser altered her course an electric searchlight began to throw its white rays across the sea here there everywhere but in its flashing path no tossing schooner was revealed  bub went to sleep soon after that nor did he wake till the gray of dawn the engines were pulsing monotonously and the water splashing noisily told him the decks were being washed down one sweeping glance and he saw that they were alone on the expanse of ocean the mary thomas had escaped as he lifted his head a roar of laughter went up from the sailors even the officer who ordered him taken below and locked up could not quite conceal the laughter in his eyes bub thought often in the days of confinement which followed that they were not very angry with him for what he had done  he was not far from right there is a certain innate nobility deep down in the hearts of all men which forces them to admire a brave act even if it is performed by an enemy the russians were in nowise different from other men true a boy had outwitted them but they could not blame him and they were sore puzzled as to what to do with him it would never do to take a little mite like him in to represent all that remained of the lost poacher  so two weeks later a united states manofwar steaming out of the russian port of vladivostok was signaled by a russian cruiser a boat passed between the two ships and a small boy dropped over the rail upon the deck of the american vessel a week later he was put ashore at hakodate and after some telegraphing his fare was paid on the railroad to yokohama  from the depot he hurried through the quaint japanese streets to the harbor and hired a sampan boatman to put him aboard a certain vessel whose familiar rigging had quickly caught his eye her gaskets were off her sails unfurled she was just starting back to the united states as he came closer a crowd of sailors sprang upon the forecastle head and the windlassbars rose and fell as the anchor was torn from its muddy bottom  yankee ship come down the ribber the sealawyers voice rolled out as he led the anchor song  pull my bully boys pull roared back the old familiar chorus the mens bodies lifting and bending to the rhythm  bub russell paid the boatman and stepped on deck the anchor was forgotten a mighty cheer went up from the men and almost before he could catch his breath he was on the shoulders of the captain surrounded by his mates and endeavoring to answer twenty questions to the second  the next day a schooner hove to off a japanese fishing village sent ashore four sailors and a little midshipman and sailed away these men did not talk english but they had money and quickly made their way to yokohama from that day the japanese village folk never heard anything more about them and they are still a muchtalkedof mystery as the russian government never said anything about the incident the united states is still ignorant of the whereabouts of the lost poacher nor has she ever heard officially of the way in which some of her citizens shanghaied five subjects of the tsar even nations have secrets sometimes     the banks of the sacramento    and its blow ye winds heighho   for californio   for theres plenty of gold so ive been told   on the banks of the sacramento   it was only a little boy singing in a shrill treble the sea chantey which seamen sing the wide world over when they man the capstan bars and break the anchors out for frisco port it was only a little boy who had never seen the sea but two hundred feet beneath him rolled the sacramento young jerry he was called after old jerry his father from whom he had learned the song as well as received his shock of brightred hair his blue dancing eyes and his fair and inevitably freckled skin  for old jerry had been a sailor and had followed the sea till middle life haunted always by the words of the ringing chantey then one day he had sung the song in earnest in an asiatic port swinging and thrilling round the capstancircle with twenty others and at san francisco he turned his back upon his ship and upon the sea and went to behold with his own eyes the banks of the sacramento  he beheld the gold too for he found employment at the yellow dream mine and proved of utmost usefulness in rigging the great orecables across the river and two hundred feet above its surface  after that he took charge of the cables and kept them in repair and ran them and loved them and became himself an indispensable fixture of the yellow dream mine then he loved pretty margaret kelly but she had left him and young jerry the latter barely toddling to take up her last long sleep in the little graveyard among the great sober pines  old jerry never went back to the sea he remained by his cables and lavished upon them and young jerry all the love of his nature when evil days came to the yellowdream he still remained in the employ of the company as watchman over the all but abandoned property  but this morning he was not visible young jerry only was to be seen sitting on the cabin step and singing the ancient chantey he had cooked and eaten his breakfast all by himself and had just come out to take a look at the world twenty feet before him stood the steel drum round which the endless cable worked by the drum snug and fast was the orecar following with his eyes the dizzy flight of the cables to the farther bank he could see the other drum and the other car  the contrivance was worked by gravity the loaded car crossing the river by virtue of its own weight and at the same time dragging the empty car back the loaded car being emptied and the empty car being loaded with more ore the performance could be repeateda performance which had been repeated tens of thousands of times since the day old jerry became the keeper of the cables  young jerry broke off his song at the sound of approaching footsteps a tall blueshirted man a rifle across the hollow of his arm came out from the gloom of the pinetrees it was hall watchman of the yellow dragon mine the cables of which spanned the sacramento a mile farther up  hello younker was his greeting what you doin here by your lonesome  oh bachin jerry tried to answer unconcernedly as if it were a very ordinary sort of thing dads away you see  wheres he gone the man asked  san francisco went last night his brothers dead in the old country and hes gone down to see the lawyers wont be back till tomorrow night  so spoke jerry and with pride because of the responsibility which had fallen to him of keeping an eye on the property of the yellow dream and the glorious adventure of living alone on the cliff above the river and of cooking his own meals  well take care of yourself hall said and dont monkey with the cables im goin to see if i cant pick up a deer in the cripple cow cañon  its goin to rain i think jerry said with mature deliberation  and its little i mind a wettin hall laughed as he strode away among the trees  jerrys prediction concerning rain was more than fulfilled by ten oclock the pines were swaying and moaning the cabin windows rattling and the rain driving by in fierce squalls at half past eleven he kindled a fire and promptly at the stroke of twelve sat down to his dinner  no outofdoors for him that day he decided when he had washed the few dishes and put them neatly away and he wondered how wet hall was and whether he had succeeded in picking up a deer  at one oclock there came a knock at the door and when he opened it a man and a woman staggered in on the breast of a great gust of wind they were mr and mrs spillane ranchers who lived in a lonely valley a dozen miles back from the river  wheres hall was spillanes opening speech and he spoke sharply and quickly  jerry noted that he was nervous and abrupt in his movements and that mrs spillane seemed laboring under some strong anxiety she was a thin washedout workedout woman whose life of dreary and unending toil had stamped itself harshly upon her face it was the same life that had bowed her husbands shoulders and gnarled his hands and turned his hair to a dry and dusty gray  hes gone hunting up cripple cow jerry answered did you want to cross  the woman began to weep quietly while spillane dropped a troubled exclamation and strode to the window jerry joined him in gazing out to where the cables lost themselves in the thick downpour  it was the custom of the backwoods people in that section of country to cross the sacramento on the yellow dragon cable for this service a small toll was charged which tolls the yellow dragon company applied to the payment of halls wages  weve got to get across jerry spillane said at the same time jerking his thumb over his shoulder in the direction of his wife her fathers hurt at the clover leaf powder explosion not expected to live we just got word  jerry felt himself fluttering inwardly he knew that spillane wanted to cross on the yellow dream cable and in the absence of his father he felt that he dared not assume such a responsibility for the cable had never been used for passengers in fact had not been used at all for a long time  maybe hall will be back soon he said  spillane shook his head and demanded wheres your father  san francisco jerry answered briefly  spillane groaned and fiercely drove his clenched fist into the palm of the other hand his wife was crying more audibly and jerry could hear her murmuring and daddys dyin dyin  the tears welled up in his own eyes and he stood irresolute not knowing what he should do but the man decided for him  look here kid he said with determination the wife and me are goin over on this here cable of yours will you run it for us  jerry backed slightly away he did it unconsciously as if recoiling instinctively from something unwelcome  better see if halls back he suggested  and if he aint  again jerry hesitated  ill stand for the risk spillane added dont you see kid weve simply got to cross  jerry nodded his head reluctantly  and there aint no use waitin for hall spillane went on you know as well as me he aint back from cripple cow this time of day so come along and lets get started  no wonder that mrs spillane seemed terrified as they helped her into the orecarso jerry thought as he gazed into the apparently fathomless gulf beneath her for it was so filled with rain and cloud hurtling and curling in the fierce blast that the other shore seven hundred feet away was invisible while the cliff at their feet dropped sheer down and lost itself in the swirling vapor by all appearances it might be a mile to bottom instead of two hundred feet  all ready he asked  let her go spillane shouted to make himself heard above the roar of the wind  he had clambered in beside his wife and was holding one of her hands in his  jerry looked upon this with disapproval youll need all your hands for holdin on the way the winds yowlin  the man and the woman shifted their hands accordingly tightly gripping the sides of the car and jerry slowly and carefully released the brake the drum began to revolve as the endless cable passed round it and the car slid slowly out into the chasm its trolley wheels rolling on the stationary cable overhead to which it was suspended  it was not the first time jerry had worked the cable but it was the first time he had done so away from the supervising eye of his father by means of the brake he regulated the speed of the car it needed regulating for at times caught by the stronger gusts of wind it swayed violently back and forth and once just before it was swallowed up in a rain squall it seemed about to spill out its human contents  after that jerry had no way of knowing where the car was except by means of the cable this he watched keenly as it glided around the drum three hundred feet he breathed to himself as the cable markings went by three hundred and fifty four hundred four hundred and  the cable had stopped jerry threw off the brake but it did not move he caught the cable with his hands and tried to start it by tugging smartly something had gone wrong what he could not guess he could not see looking up he could vaguely make out the empty car which had been crossing from the opposite cliff at a speed equal to that of the loaded car it was about two hundred and fifty feet away that meant he knew that somewhere in the gray obscurity two hundred feet above the river and two hundred and fifty feet from the other bank spillane and his wife were suspended and stationary  three times jerry shouted with all the shrill force of his lungs but no answering cry came out of the storm it was impossible for him to hear them or to make himself heard as he stood for a moment thinking rapidly the flying clouds seemed to thin and lift he caught a brief glimpse of the swollen sacramento beneath and a briefer glimpse of the car and the man and woman then the clouds descended thicker than ever  the boy examined the drum closely and found nothing the matter with it evidently it was the drum on the other side that had gone wrong he was appalled at thought of the man and woman out there in the midst of the storm hanging over the abyss rocking back and forth in the frail car and ignorant of what was taking place on shore and he did not like to think of their hanging there while he went round by the yellow dragon cable to the other drum  but he remembered a block and tackle in the toolhouse and ran and brought it they were double blocks and he murmured aloud a purchase of four as he made the tackle fast to the endless cable then he heaved upon it heaved until it seemed that his arms were being drawn out from their sockets and that his shoulder muscles would be ripped asunder yet the cable did not budge nothing remained but to cross over to the other side  he was already soaking wet so he did not mind the rain as he ran over the trail to the yellow dragon the storm was with him and it was easy going although there was no hall at the other end of it to man the brake for him and regulate the speed of the car this he did for himself however by means of a stout rope which he passed with a turn round the stationary cable  as the full force of the wind struck him in midair swaying the cable and whistling and roaring past it and rocking and careening the car he appreciated more fully what must be the condition of mind of spillane and his wife and this appreciation gave strength to him as safely across he fought his way up the other bank in the teeth of the gale to the yellow dream cable  to his consternation he found the drum in thorough working order everything was running smoothly at both ends where was the hitch in the middle without a doubt  from this side the car containing spillane was only two hundred and fifty feet away he could make out the man and woman through the whirling vapor crouching in the bottom of the car and exposed to the pelting rain and the full fury of the wind in a lull between the squalls he shouted to spillane to examine the trolley of the car  spillane heard for he saw him rise up cautiously on his knees and with his hands go over both trolleywheels then he turned his face toward the bank  shes all right kid  jerry heard the words faint and far as from a remote distance then what was the matter nothing remained but the other and empty car which he could not see but which he knew to be there somewhere in that terrible gulf two hundred feet beyond spillanes car  his mind was made up on the instant he was only fourteen years old slightly and wirily built but his life had been lived among the mountains his father had taught him no small measure of sailoring and he was not particularly afraid of heights  in the toolbox by the drum he found an old monkeywrench and a short bar of iron also a coil of fairly new manila rope he looked in vain for a piece of board with which to rig a boatswains chair there was nothing at hand but large planks which he had no means of sawing so he was compelled to do without the more comfortable form of saddle  the saddle he rigged was very simple with the rope he made merely a large loop round the stationary cable to which hung the empty car when he sat in the loop his hands could just reach the cable conveniently and where the rope was likely to fray against the cable he lashed his coat in lieu of the old sack he would have used had he been able to find one  these preparations swiftly completed he swung out over the chasm sitting in the rope saddle and pulling himself along the cable by his hands with him he carried the monkeywrench and short iron bar and a few spare feet of rope it was a slightly uphill pull but this he did not mind so much as the wind when the furious gusts hurled him back and forth sometimes half twisting him about and he gazed down into the gray depths he was aware that he was afraid it was an old cable what if it should break under his weight and the pressure of the wind  it was fear he was experiencing honest fear and he knew that there was a gone feeling in the pit of his stomach and a trembling of the knees which he could not quell  but he held himself bravely to the task the cable was old and worn sharp pieces of wire projected from it and his hands were cut and bleeding by the time he took his first rest and held a shouted conversation with spillane the car was directly beneath him and only a few feet away so he was able to explain the condition of affairs and his errand  wish i could help you spillane shouted at him as he started on but the wifes gone all to pieces anyway kid take care of yourself i got myself in this fix but its up to you to get me out  oh ill do it jerry shouted back tell mrs spillane that shell be ashore now in a jiffy  in the midst of pelting rain which halfblinded him swinging from side to side like a rapid and erratic pendulum his torn hands paining him severely and his lungs panting from his exertions and panting from the very air which the wind sometimes blew into his mouth with strangling force he finally arrived at the empty car  a single glance showed him that he had not made the dangerous journey in vain the front trolleywheel loose from long wear had jumped the cable and the cable was now jammed tightly between the wheel and the sheaveblock  one thing was clearthe wheel must be removed from the block a second thing was equally clearwhile the wheel was being removed the car would have to be fastened to the cable by the rope he had brought  at the end of a quarter of an hour beyond making the car secure he had accomplished nothing the key which bound the wheel on its axle was rusted and jammed he hammered at it with one hand and held on the best he could with the other but the wind persisted in swinging and twisting his body and made his blows miss more often than not ninetenths of the strength he expended was in trying to hold himself steady for fear that he might drop the monkeywrench he made it fast to his wrist with his handkerchief  at the end of half an hour jerry had hammered the key clear but he could not draw it out a dozen times it seemed that he must give up in despair that all the danger and toil he had gone through were for nothing then an idea came to him and he went through his pockets with feverish haste and found what he soughta tenpenny nail  but for that nail put in his pocket he knew not when or why he would have had to make another trip over the cable and back thrusting the nail through the looped head of the key he at last had a grip and in no time the key was out  then came punching and prying with the iron bar to get the wheel itself free from where it was jammed by the cable against the side of the block after that jerry replaced the wheel and by means of the rope heaved up on the car till the trolley once more rested properly on the cable  all this took time more than an hour and a half had elapsed since his arrival at the empty car and now for the first time he dropped out of his saddle and down into the car he removed the detaining ropes and the trolleywheels began slowly to revolve the car was moving and he knew that somewhere beyond although he could not see the car of spillane was likewise moving and in the opposite direction  there was no need for a brake for his weight sufficiently counterbalanced the weight in the other car and soon he saw the cliff rising out of the cloud depths and the old familiar drum going round and round  jerry climbed out and made the car securely fast he did it deliberately and carefully and then quite unherolike he sank down by the drum regardless of the pelting storm and burst out sobbing  there were many reasons why he sobbedpartly from the pain of his hands which was excruciating partly from exhaustion partly from relief and release from the nervetension he had been under for so long and in a large measure from thankfulness that the man and woman were saved  they were not there to thank him but somewhere beyond that howling stormdriven gulf he knew they were hurrying over the trail toward the clover leaf  jerry staggered to the cabin and his hand left the white knob red with blood as he opened the door but he took no notice of it  he was too proudly contented with himself for he was certain that he had done well and he was honest enough to admit to himself that he had done well but a small regret arose and persisted in his thoughtsif his father had only been there to see     chris farrington able seaman   if you vas in der old country ships a liddle shaver like you vood pe only der boy und you vood wait on der able seamen und ven der able

sailors on the sophie sutherland and there was no difference made with any of us havent i always done my work did i ever shirk did you or any other man ever have to take a wheel for me or a lookout or go aloft  chris is right interrupted a young english sailor no man has had to do a tap of his work yet he signed as good as any of us and hes shown himself as good  better broke in a nova scotia man better than some of us when we struck the sealinggrounds he turned out to be next to the best boatsteerer aboard only french louis whod been at it for years could beat him im only a boatpuller and youre only a boatpuller too emil johansen for all your twentytwo years at sea why dont you become a boatsteerer  too clumsy laughed the englishman and too slow  little that counts one way or the other joined in dane jurgensen coming to the aid of his scandinavian brother emil is a man grown and an able seaman the boy is neither  and so the argument raged back and forth the swedes norwegians and danes because of race kinship taking the part of johansen and the english canadians and americans taking the part of chris from an unprejudiced point of view the right was on the side of chris as he had truly said he did a mans work and the same work that any of them did but they were prejudiced and badly so and out of the words which passed rose a standing quarrel which divided the forecastle into two parties                                       the sophie sutherland was a sealhunter registered out of san francisco and engaged in hunting the furry seaanimals along the japanese coast north to bering sea the other vessels were twomasted schooners but she was a threemaster and the largest in the fleet in fact she was a fullrigged threetopmast schooner newly built  although chris farrington knew that justice was with him and that he performed all his work faithfully and well many a time in secret thought he longed for some pressing emergency to arise whereby he could demonstrate to the scandinavian seamen that he also was an able seaman  but one stormy night by an accident for which he was in nowise accountable in overhauling a spare anchorchain he had all the fingers of his left hand badly crushed and his hopes were likewise crushed for it was impossible for him to continue hunting with the boats and he was forced to stay idly aboard until his fingers should heal yet although he little dreamed it this very accident was to give him the longlookedfor opportunity  one afternoon in the latter part of may the sophie sutherland rolled sluggishly in a breathless calm the seals were abundant the hunting good and the boats were all away and out of sight and with them was almost every man of the crew besides chris there remained only the captain the sailingmaster and the chinese cook  the captain was captain only by courtesy he was an old man past eighty and blissfully ignorant of the sea and its ways but he was the owner of the vessel and hence the honorable title of course the sailingmaster who was really captain was a thoroughgoing seaman the mate whose post was aboard was out with the boats having temporarily taken chriss place as boatsteerer  when good weather and good sport came together the boats were accustomed to range far and wide and often did not return to the schooner until long after dark but for all that it was a perfect hunting day chris noted a growing anxiety on the part of the sailingmaster he paced the deck nervously and was constantly sweeping the horizon with his marine glasses not a boat was in sight as sunset arrived he even sent chris aloft to the mizzentopmasthead but with no better luck the boats could not possibly be back before midnight  since noon the barometer had been falling with startling rapidity and all the signs were ripe for a great stormhow great not even the sailingmaster anticipated he and chris set to work to prepare for it they put storm gaskets on the furled topsails lowered and stowed the foresail and spanker and took in the two inner jibs in the one remaining jib they put a single reef and a single reef in the mainsail  night had fallen before they finished and with the darkness came the storm a low moan swept over the sea and the wind struck the sophie sutherland flat but she righted quickly and with the sailingmaster at the wheel sheered her bow into within five points of the wind working as well as he could with his bandaged hand and with the feeble aid of the chinese cook chris went forward and backed the jib over to the weather side this with the flat mainsail left the schooner hove to  god help the boats its no gale its a typhoon the sailingmaster shouted to chris at eleven oclock too much canvas got to get two more reefs into that mainsail and got to do it right away he glanced at the old captain shivering in oilskins at the binnacle and holding on for dear life theres only you and i chrisand the cook but hes next to worthless  in order to make the reef it was necessary to lower the mainsail and the removal of this after pressure was bound to make the schooner fall off before the wind and sea because of the forward pressure of the jib  take the wheel the sailingmaster directed and when i give the word hard up with it and when shes square before it steady her and keep her there well heave to again as soon as i get the reefs in  gripping the kicking spokes chris watched him and the reluctant cook go forward into the howling darkness the sophie sutherland was plunging into the huge headseas and wallowing tremendously the tense steel stays and taut rigging humming like harpstrings to the wind a buffeted cry came to his ears and he felt the schooners bow paying off of its own accord the mainsail was down  he ran the wheel hardover and kept anxious track of the changing direction of the wind on his face and of the heave of the vessel this was the crucial moment in performing the evolution she would have to pass broadside to the surge before she could get before it the wind was blowing directly on his right cheek when he felt the sophie sutherland lean over and begin to rise toward the skyupupan infinite distance would she clear the crest of the gigantic wave  again by the feel of it for he could see nothing he knew that a wall of water was rearing and curving far above him along the whole weather side there was an instants calm as the liquid wall intervened and shut off the wind the schooner righted and for that instant seemed at perfect rest then she rolled to meet the descending rush  chris shouted to the captain to hold tight and prepared himself for the shock but the man did not live who could face it an ocean of water smote chriss back and his clutch on the spokes was loosened as if it were a babys stunned powerless like a straw on the face of a torrent he was swept onward he knew not whither missing the corner of the cabin he was dashed forward along the poop runway a hundred feet or more striking violently against the foot of the foremast a second wave crushing inboard hurled him back the way he had come and left him halfdrowned where the poop steps should have been  bruised and bleeding dimly conscious he felt for the rail and dragged himself to his feet unless something could be done he knew the last moment had come as he faced the poop the wind drove into his mouth with suffocating force this brought him back to his senses with a start the wind was blowing from dead aft the schooner was out of the trough and before it but the send of the sea was bound to breach her to again crawling up the runway he managed to get to the wheel just in time to prevent this the binnacle light was still burning they were safe  that is he and the schooner were safe as to the welfare of his three companions he could not say nor did he dare leave the wheel in order to find out for it took every second of his undivided attention to keep the vessel to her course the least fraction of carelessness and the heave of the sea under the quarter was liable to thrust her into the trough so a boy of one hundred and forty pounds he clung to his herculean task of guiding the two hundred straining tons of fabric amid the chaos of the great storm forces  half an hour later groaning and sobbing the captain crawled to chriss feet all was lost he whimpered he was smitten unto death the galley had gone by the board the mainsail and runninggear the cook everything  wheres the sailingmaster chris demanded when he had caught his breath after steadying a wild lurch of the schooner it was no childs play to steer a vessel under singlereefed jib before a typhoon  clean up forard the old man replied jammed under the focslehead but still breathing both his arms are broken he says and he doesnt know how many ribs hes hurt bad  well hell drown there the way shes shipping water through the hawsepipes go forard chris commanded taking charge of things as a matter of course tell him not to worry that im at the wheel help him as much as you can and make him helphe stopped and ran the spokes to starboard as a tremendous billow rose under the stern and yawed the schooner to portand make him help himself for the rest unship the focastle hatch and get him down into a bunk then ship the hatch again  the captain turned his aged face forward and wavered pitifully the waist of the ship was full of water to the bulwarks he had just come through it and knew death lurked every inch of the way  go chris shouted fiercely and as the fearstricken man started and take another look for the cook  two hours later almost dead from suffering the captain returned he had obeyed orders the sailingmaster was helpless although safe in a bunk the cook was gone chris sent the captain below to the cabin to change his clothes  after interminable hours of toil day broke cold and gray chris looked about him the sophie sutherland was racing before the typhoon like a thing possessed there was no rain but the wind whipped the spray of the sea masthigh obscuring everything except in the immediate neighborhood  two waves only could chris see at a timethe one before and the one behind so small and insignificant the schooner seemed on the long pacific roll rushing up a maddening mountain she would poise like a cockleshell on the giddy summit breathless and rolling leap outward and down into the yawning chasm beneath and bury herself in the smother of foam at the bottom then the recovery another mountain another sickening upward rush another poise and the downward crash abreast of him to starboard like a ghost of the storm chris saw the cook dashing apace with the schooner evidently when washed overboard he had grasped and become entangled in a trailing halyard  for three hours more alone with this gruesome companion chris held the sophie sutherland before the wind and sea he had long since forgotten his mangled fingers the bandages had been torn away and the cold salt spray had eaten into the halfhealed wounds until they were numb and no longer pained but he was not cold the terrific labor of steering forced the perspiration from every pore yet he was faint and weak with hunger and exhaustion and hailed with delight the advent on deck of the captain who fed him all of a pound of cakechocolate it strengthened him at once  he ordered the captain to cut the halyard by which the cooks body was towing and also to go forward and cut loose the jibhalyard and sheet when he had done so the jib fluttered a couple of moments like a handkerchief then tore out of the boltropes and vanished the sophie sutherland was running under bare poles  by noon the storm had spent itself and by six in the evening the waves had died down sufficiently to let chris leave the helm it was almost hopeless to dream of the small boats weathering the typhoon but there is always the chance in saving human life and chris at once applied himself to going back over the course along which he had fled he managed to get a reef in one of the inner jibs and two reefs in the spanker and then with the aid of the watchtackle to hoist them to the stiff breeze that yet blew and all through the night tacking back and forth on the back track he shook out canvas as fast as the wind would permit  the injured sailingmaster had turned delirious and between tending him and lending a hand with the ship chris kept the captain busy taught me more seamanship as he afterward said than id learned on the whole voyage but by daybreak the old mans feeble frame succumbed and he fell off into exhausted sleep on the weather poop  chris who could now lash the wheel covered the tired man with blankets from below and went fishing in the lazaretto for something to eat but by the day following he found himself forced to give in drowsing fitfully by the wheel and waking ever and anon to take a look at things  on the afternoon of the third day he picked up a schooner dismasted and battered as he approached closehauled on the wind he saw her decks crowded by an unusually large crew and on sailing in closer made out among others the faces of his missing comrades and he was just in the nick of time for they were fighting a losing fight at the pumps an hour later they with the crew of the sinking craft were aboard the sophie sutherland  having wandered so far from their own vessel they had taken refuge on the strange schooner just before the storm broke she was a canadian sealer on her first voyage and as was now apparent her last  the captain of the sophie sutherland had a story to tell also and he told it wellso well in fact that when all hands were gathered together on deck during the dogwatch emil johansen strode over to chris and gripped him by the hand  chris he said so loudly that all could hear chris i gif in you vas yoost so good a sailorman as i you vas a bully boy und able seaman und i pe proud for you  und chris he turned as if he had forgotten something and called back from dis time always you call me emil mitout der mister     to repel boarders   no honest now bob im sure i was born too late the twentieth centurys no place for me if id had my way  youd have been born in the sixteenth i broke in laughing with drake and hawkins and raleigh and the rest of the seakings  youre right paul affirmed he rolled over upon his back on the little afterdeck with a long sigh of dissatisfaction  it was a little past midnight and with the wind nearly astern we were running down lower san francisco bay to bay farm island paul fairfax and i went to the same school lived next door to each other and chummed it together by saving money by earning more and by each of us foregoing a bicycle on his birthday we had collected the purchaseprice of the mist a beamy twentyeightfooter slooprigged with baby topsail and centerboard pauls father was a yachtsman himself and he had conducted the business for us poking around overhauling sticking his penknife into the timbers and testing the planks with the greatest care in fact it was on his schooner the whim that paul and i had picked up what we knew about boatsailing and now that the mist was ours we were hard at work adding to our knowledge  the mist being broad of beam was comfortable and roomy a man could stand upright in the cabin and what with the stove cookingutensils and bunks we were good for trips in her of a week at a time and we were just starting out on the first of such trips and it was because it was the first trip that we were sailing by night early in the evening we had beaten out from oakland and we were now off the mouth of alameda creek a large saltwater estuary which fills and empties san leandro bay  men lived in those days paul said so suddenly as to startle me from my own thoughts in the days of the seakings i mean he explained  i said oh sympathetically and began to whistle captain kidd  now ive my ideas about things paul went on they talk about romance and adventure and all that but i say romance and adventure are dead were too civilized we dont have adventures in the twentieth century we go to the circus  but i strove to interrupt though he would not listen to me  you look here bob he said in all the time you and ive gone together what adventures have we had true we were out in the hills once and didnt get back till late at night and we were good and hungry but we werent even lost we knew where we were all the time it was only a case of walk what i mean is weve never had to fight for our lives understand weve never had a pistol fired at us or a cannon or a sword waving over our heads oror anything  youd better slack away three or four feet of that mainsheet he said in a hopeless sort of way as though it did not matter much anyway the winds still veering around  why in the old times the sea was one constant glorious adventure he continued a boy left school and became a midshipman and in a few weeks was cruising after spanish galleons or locking yardarms with a french privateer ordoing lots of things  wellthere are adventures today i objected  but paul went on as though i had not spoken  and today we go from school to high school and from high school to college and then we go into the office or become doctors and things and the only adventures we know about are the ones we read in books why just as sure as im sitting here on the stern of the sloop mist just so sure am i that we wouldnt know what to do if a real adventure came along now would we  oh i dont know i answered noncommittally  well you wouldnt be a coward would you he demanded  i was sure i wouldnt and said so  but you dont have to be a coward to lose your head do you  i agreed that brave men might get excited  well then paul summed up with a note of regret in his voice the chances are that wed spoil the adventure so its a shame and thats all i can say about it  the adventure hasnt come yet i answered not caring to see him down in the mouth over nothing you see paul was a peculiar fellow in some things and i knew him pretty well he read a good deal and had a quick imagination and once in a while hed get into moods like this one so i said the adventure hasnt come yet so theres no use worrying about its being spoiled for all we know it might turn out splendidly  paul didnt say anything for some time and i was thinking he was out of the mood when he spoke up suddenly  just imagine bob kellogg as were sailing along now just as we are and never mind what for that a boat should bear down upon us with armed men in it what would you do to repel boarders think you could rise to it  what would you do i asked pointedly remember we havent even a single shotgun aboard  you would surrender then he demanded angrily but suppose they were going to kill you  im not saying what id do i answered stiffly beginning to get a little angry myself im asking what youd do without weapons of any sort  id find something he repliedrather shortly i thought  i began to chuckle then the adventure wouldnt be spoiled would it and youve been talking rubbish  paul struck a match looked at his watch and remarked that it was nearly one oclocka way he had when the argument went against him besides this was the nearest we ever came to quarreling now though our share of squabbles had fallen to us in the earlier days of our friendship i had just seen a little white light ahead when paul spoke again  anchorlight he said funny place for people to drop the hook it may be a scowschooner with a dinky astern so youd better go wide  i eased the mist several points and the wind puffing up we went plowing along at a pretty fair speed passing the light so wide that we could not make out what manner of craft it marked suddenly the mist slacked up in a slow and easy way as though running upon soft mud we were both startled the wind was blowing stronger than ever and yet we were almost at a standstill  mudflat out here never heard of such a thing  so paul exclaimed with a snort of unbelief and seizing an oar shoved it down over the side and straight down it went till the water wet his hand there was no bottom then we were dumbfounded the wind was whistling by and still the mist was moving ahead at a snails pace there seemed something dead about her and it was all i could do at the tiller to keep her from swinging up into the wind  listen i laid my hand on pauls arm we could hear the sound of rowlocks and saw the little white light bobbing up and down and now very close to us theres your armed boat i whispered in fun beat the crew to quarters and stand by to repel boarders  we both laughed and were still laughing when a wild scream of rage came out of the darkness and the approaching boat shot under our stern by the light of the lantern it carried we could see the two men in it distinctly they were foreignlooking fellows with sunbronzed faces and with knitted tamoshanters perched seaman fashion on their heads brightcolored woolen sashes were around their waists and long seaboots covered their legs i remember yet the cold chill which passed along my backbone as i noted the tiny gold earrings in the ears of one for all the world they were like pirates stepped out of the pages of romance and to make the picture complete their faces were distorted with anger and each flourished a long knife they were both shouting in highpitched voices some foreign jargon we could not understand  one of them the smaller of the two and if anything the more viciouslooking put his hands on the rail of the mist and started to come aboard quick as a flash paul placed the end of the oar against the mans chest and shoved him back into his boat he fell in a heap but scrambled to his feet waving the knife and shrieking  you breaka my neta you breaka my neta  and he held forth in the jargon again his companion joining him and both preparing to make another dash to come aboard the mist  theyre italian fishermen i cried the facts of the case breaking in upon me weve run over their smeltnet and its slipped along the keel and fouled our rudder were anchored to it  yes and theyre murderous chaps too paul said sparring at them with the oar to make them keep their distance  say you fellows he called to them give us a chance and well get it clear for you we didnt know your net was there we didnt mean to do it you know  you wont lose anything i added well pay the damages  but they could not understand what we were saying or did not care to understand  you breaka my neta you breaka my neta the smaller man the one with the earrings screamed back making furious gestures i fixa you youa see i fixa you  this time when paul thrust him back he seized the oar in his hands and his companion jumped aboard i put my back against the tiller and no sooner had he landed and before he had caught his balance than i met him with another oar and he fell heavily backward into the boat it was getting serious and when he arose and caught my oar and i realized his strength i confess that i felt a goodly tinge of fear but though he was stronger than i instead of dragging me overboard when he wrenched on the oar he merely pulled his boat in closer and when i shoved the boat was forced away besides the knife still in his right hand made him awkward and somewhat counterbalanced the advantage his superior strength gave him paul and his enemy were in the same situationa sort of deadlock which continued for several seconds but which could not last several times i shouted that we would pay for whatever damage their net had suffered but my words seemed to be without effect  then my man began to tuck the oar under his arm and to come up along it slowly hand over hand the small man did the same with paul moment by moment they came closer and closer and we knew that the end was only a question of time  hard up bob paul called softly to me  i gave him a quick glance and caught an instants glimpse of what i took to be a very pale face and a very set jaw  oh bob he pleaded hard up your helm hard up your helm bob  and his meaning dawned upon me still holding to my end of the oar i shoved the tiller over with my back and even bent my body to keep it over as it was the mist was nearly dead before the wind and this maneuver was bound to force her to jibe her mainsail from one side to the other i could tell by the feel when the wind spilled out of the canvas and the boom tilted up pauls man had now gained a footing on the little deck and my man was just scrambling up  look out i shouted to paul here she comes  both he and i let go the oars and tumbled into the cockpit the next instant the big boom and the heavy blocks swept over our heads the mainsheet whipping past like a great coiling snake and the mist heeling over with a violent jar both men had jumped for it but in some way the little man either got his knifehand jammed or fell upon it for the first sight we caught of him he was standing in his boat his bleeding fingers clasped close between his knees and his face all twisted with pain and helpless rage  nows our chance paul whispered over with you  and on either side of the rudder we lowered ourselves into the water pressing the net down with our feet till with a jerk it went clear then it was up and in paul at the mainsheet and i at the tiller the mist plunging ahead with freedom in her motion and the little white light astern growing small and smaller  now that youve had your adventure do you feel any better i remember asking when we had changed our clothes and were sitting dry and comfortable again in the cockpit  well if i dont have the nightmare for a week to comepaul paused and puckered his brows in judicial fashionit will be because i cant sleep thats one thing sure     an adventure in the upper sea   i am a retired captain of the upper sea that is to say when i was a younger man which is not so long ago i was an aeronaut and navigated that aerial ocean which is all around about us and above us naturally it is a hazardous profession and naturally i have had many thrilling experiences the most thrilling or at least the most nerveracking being the one i am about to relate  it happened before i went in for hydrogen gas balloons all of varnished silk doubled and lined and all that and fit for voyages of days instead of mere hours the little nassau named after the great nassau of many years back was the balloon i was making ascents in at the time it was a fairsized hotair affair of single thickness good for an hours flight or so and capable of attaining an altitude of a mile or more it answered my purpose for my act at the time was making halfmile parachute jumps at recreation parks and country fairs i was in oakland a california town filling a summers engagement with a street railway company the company owned a large park outside the city and of course it was to its interest to provide attractions which would send the townspeople over its line when they went out to get a whiff of country air my contract called for two ascensions weekly and my act was an especially taking feature for it was on my days that the largest crowds were drawn  before you can understand what happened i must first explain a bit about the nature of the hot air balloon which is used for parachute jumping if you have ever witnessed such a jump you will remember that directly the parachute was cut loose the balloon turned upside down emptied itself of its smoke and heated air flattened out and fell straight down beating the parachute to the ground thus there is no chasing a big deserted bag for miles and miles across the country and much time as well as trouble is thereby saved this maneuver is accomplished by attaching a weight at the end of a long rope to the top of the balloon the aeronaut with his parachute and trapeze hangs to the bottom of the balloon and weighing more keeps it right side down but when he lets go the weight attached to the top immediately drags the top down and the bottom which is the open mouth goes up the heated air pouring out the weight used for this purpose on the little nassau was a bag of sand  on the particular day i have in mind there was an unusually large crowd in attendance and the police had their hands full keeping the people back there was much pushing and shoving and the ropes were bulging with the pressure of men women and children as i came down from the dressing room i noticed two girls outside the ropes of about fourteen and sixteen and inside the rope a youngster of eight or nine they were holding him by the hands and he was struggling excitedly and half in laughter to get away from them i thought nothing of it at the timejust a bit of childish play no more and it was only in the light of after events that the scene was impressed vividly upon me  keep them cleared out george i called to my assistant we dont want any accidents  ay he answered that i will charley  george guppy had helped me in no end of ascents and because of his coolness judgment and absolute reliability i had come to trust my life in his hands with the utmost confidence his business it was to overlook the inflating of the balloon and to see that everything about the parachute was in perfect working order  the little nassau was already filled and straining at the guys the parachute lay flat along the ground and beyond it the trapeze i tossed aside my overcoat took my position and gave the signal to let go as you know the first rush upward from the earth is very sudden and this time the balloon when it first caught the wind heeled violently over and was longer than usual in righting i looked down at the old familiar sight of the world rushing away from me and there were the thousands of people every face silently upturned and the silence startled me for as crowds went this was the time for them to catch their first breath and send up a roar of applause but there was no handclapping whistling cheeringonly silence and instead clear as a bell and distinct without the slightest shake or quaver came georges voice through the megaphone  ride her down charley ride the balloon down  what had happened i waved my hand to show that i had heard and began to think had something gone wrong with the parachute why should i ride the balloon down instead of making the jump which thousands were waiting to see what was the matter and as i puzzled i received another start the earth was a thousand feet beneath and yet i heard a child crying softly and seemingly very close to hand and though the little nassau was shooting skyward like a rocket the crying did not grow fainter and fainter and die away i confess i was almost on the edge of a funk when unconsciously following up the noise with my eyes i looked above me and saw a boy astride the sandbag which was to bring the little nassau to earth and it was the same little boy i had seen struggling with the two girlshis sisters as i afterward learned  there he was astride the sandbag and holding on to the rope for dear life a puff of wind heeled the balloon slightly and he swung out into space for ten or a dozen feet and back again fetching up against the tight canvas with a thud which even shook me thirty feet or more beneath i thought to see him dashed loose but he clung on and whimpered they told me afterward how at the moment they were casting off the balloon the little fellow had torn away from his sisters ducked under the rope and deliberately jumped astride the sandbag it has always been a wonder to me that he was not jerked off in the first rush  well i felt sick all over as i looked at him there and i understood why the balloon had taken longer to right itself and why george had called after me to ride her down should i cut loose with the parachute the bag would at once turn upside down empty itself and begin its swift descent the only hope lay in my riding her down and in the boy holding on there was no possible way for me to reach him no man could climb the slim closed parachute and even if a man could and made the mouth of the balloon what could he do straight out and fifteen feet away trailed the boy on his ticklish perch and those fifteen feet were empty space  i thought far more quickly than it takes to tell all this and realized on the instant that the boys attention must be called away from his terrible danger exercising all the selfcontrol i possessed and striving to make myself very calm i said cheerily  hello up there who are you  he looked down at me choking back his tears and brightening up but just then the balloon ran into a crosscurrent turned half around and lay over this set him swinging back and forth and he fetched the canvas another bump then he began to cry again  isnt it great i asked heartily as though it was the most enjoyable thing in the world and without waiting for him to answer whats your name  tommy dermott he answered  glad to make your acquaintance tommy dermott i went on but id like to know who said you could ride up with me  he laughed and said he just thought hed ride up for the fun of it and so we went on i sick with fear for him and cudgeling my brains to keep up the conversation i knew that it was all i could do and that his life depended upon my ability to keep his mind off his danger i pointed out to him the great panorama spreading away to the horizon and four thousand feet beneath us there lay san francisco bay like a great placid lake the haze of smoke over the city the golden gate the ocean fogrim beyond and mount tamalpais over all clearcut and sharp against the sky directly below us i could see a buggy apparently crawling but i knew from experience that the men in it were lashing the horses on our trail  but he grew tired of looking around and i could see he was beginning to get frightened  how would you like to go in for the business i asked  he cheered up at once and asked do you get good pay  but the little nassau beginning to cool had started on its long descent and ran into counter currents which bobbed it roughly about this swung the boy around pretty lively smashing him into the bag once quite severely his lip began to tremble at this and he was crying again i tried to joke and laugh but it was no use his pluck was oozing out and at any moment i was prepared to see him go shooting past me  i was in despair then suddenly i remembered how one fright could destroy another fright and i frowned up at him and shouted sternly  you just hold on to that rope if you dont ill thrash you within an inch of your life when i get you down on the ground understand  yeyeyes sir he whimpered and i saw that the thing had worked i was nearer to him than the earth and he was more afraid of me than of falling  why youve got a snap up there on that soft bag i rattled on  yes i assured him this bar down here is hard and narrow and it hurts to sit on it  then a thought struck him and he forgot all about his aching fingers  when are you going to jump he asked thats what i came up to see  i was sorry to disappoint him but i wasnt going to make any jump  but he objected to that it said so in the papers he said  i dont care i answered im feeling sort of lazy today and im just going to ride down the balloon its my balloon and i guess i can do as i please about it and anyway were almost down now  and we were too and sinking fast and right there and then that youngster began to argue with me as to whether it was right for me to disappoint the people and to urge their claims upon me and it was with a happy heart that i held up my end of it justifying myself in a thousand different ways till we shot over a grove of eucalyptus trees and dipped to meet the earth  hold on tight i shouted swinging down from the trapeze by my hands in order to make a landing on my feet  we skimmed past a barn missed a mesh of clothesline frightened the barnyard chickens into a panic and rose up again clear over a haystackall this almost quicker than it takes to tell then we came down in an orchard and when my feet had touched the ground i fetched up the balloon by a couple of turns of the trapeze around an apple tree  i have had my balloon catch fire in mid air i have hung on the cornice of a tenstory house i have dropped like a bullet for six hundred feet when a parachute was slow in opening but never have i felt so weak and faint and sick as when i staggered toward the unscratched boy and gripped him by the arm  tommy dermott i said when i had got my nerves back somewhat tommy dermott im going to lay you across my knee and give you the greatest thrashing a boy ever got in the worlds history  no you dont he answered squirming around you said you wouldnt if i held on tight  thats all right i said but im going to just the same the fellows who go up in balloons are bad unprincipled men and im going to give you a lesson right now to make you stay away from them and from balloons too  and then i gave it to him and if it wasnt the greatest thrashing in the world it was the greatest he ever got  but it took all the grit out of me left me nervebroken that experience i canceled the engagement with the street railway company and later on went in for gas gas is much the safer anyway     baldface   talkin of bear  the klondike king paused meditatively and the group on the hotel porch hitched their chairs up closer  talkin of bear he went on now up in the northern country there are various kinds on the little pelly for instance they come down that thick in the summer to feed on the salmon that you cant get an indian or white man to go nigher than a days journey to the place and up in the rampart mountains theres a curious kind of bear called the sidehill grizzly thats because hes traveled on the sidehills ever since the flood and the two legs on the downhill side are twice as long as the two on the uphill and he can outrun a jack rabbit when he gets steam up dangerous catch you bless you no all a man has to do is to circle down the hill and run the other way you see that throws mister bears long legs up the hill and the short ones down yes hes a mighty peculiar creature but that wasnt what i started in to tell about  theyve got another kind of bear up on the yukon and his legs are all right too hes called the baldface grizzly and hes jest as big as he is bad its only the fool white men that think of hunting him indians got too much sense but theres one thing about the baldface that a man has to learn he never gives the trail to mortal creature if you see him comin and you value your skin you get out of his path if you dont theres bound to be trouble if the baldface met jehovah himself on the trail hed not give him an inch o hes a selfish beggar take my word for it but i had to learn all this didnt know anything about bear when i went into the country exceptin when i was a youngster id seen a heap of cinnamons and that little black kind and they was nothin to be scared at  well after wed got settled down on our claim i went up on the hill lookin for a likely piece of birch to make an axhandle out of but it was pretty hard to find the right kind and i kept agoin and kept agoin for nigh on two hours wasnt in no hurry to make my choice you see for i was headin down to the forks where i was goin to borrow a logbit from old joe gee when i started id put a couple of sourdough biscuits and some sowbelly in my pocket in case i might get hungry and im tellin you that lunch came in right handy before i was done with it  bimeby i hit upon the likeliest little birch saplin right in the middle of a clump of jack pine jest as i raised my handax i happened to cast my eyes down the hill there was a big bear comin up swingin along on all fours right in my direction it was a baldface but little i knew then about such kind  jest watch me scare him i says to myself and i stayed out of sight in the trees  well i waited till he was about a hundred feet off then out i runs into the open  oof oof i hollered at him expectin to see him turn tail like chain lightning  turn tail he jest throwed up his head for one good look and came a comin  oof oof i hollered loudern ever but he jest came a comin  consarn you i says to myself gettin mad ill make you jump the trail  so i grabs my hat and wavin and hollerin starts down the trail to meet him a big sugar pine had gone down in a windfall and lay about breast high i stops jest behind it old baldface comin all the time it was jest then that fear came to me i yelled like a comanche indian as he raised up to come over the log and fired my hat full in his face then i lit out  say i rounded the end of that log and put down the hill at a twotwenty clip old baldface reachin for me at every jump at the bottom was a broad open flat quarter of a mile to timber and full of niggerheads i knew if ever i slipped i was a goner but i hit only the high places till you couldnt aseen my trail for smoke and the old devil snortin along hot after me midway across he reached for me jest strikin the heel of my moccasin with his claw tell you i was doin some tall thinkin jest then i knew he had the wind of me and i could never make the brush so i pulled my little lunch out of my pocket and dropped it on the fly  never looked back till i hit the timber and then he was mouthing the biscuits in a way which wasnt nice to see considerin how close hed been to me i never slacked up no sir jest kept hittin the trail for all there was in me but jest as i came around a bend heelin it right lively i tell you whatd i see in middle of the trail before me and comin my way but another baldface  whoof he says when he spotted me and he came arunnin  instanter i was about and hittin the back trail twice as fast as id come the way this one was puffin after me id clean forgot all about the other baldface first thing i knew i seen him mosying along kind of easy wonderin most likely what had become of me and if i tasted as good as my lunch say when he seen me he looked real pleased and then he came ajumpin for me  whoof he says  whoof says the one behind me  bang i goes slap off the trail sideways aplungin and aclawin through the brush like a wild man by this time i was clean crazed thought the whole country was full of baldfaces next thing i knowswhop i comes up against something in a tangle of wild blackberry bushes then that something hits me a slap and closes in on me another baldface and then and there i knew i was gone for sure but i made up to die game and of all the rampin and roarin and rippin and tearin you ever see that was the worst  my god o my wife it says and i looked and it was a man i was hammering into kingdom come  thought you was a bear says i  he kind of caught his breath and looked at me then he says same here  seemed as though hed been chased by a baldface too and had hid in the blackberries so thats how we mistook each other  but by that time the racket on the trail was something terrible and we didnt wait to explain matters that afternoon we got joe gee and some rifles and came back loaded for bear mebbe you wont believe me but when we got to the spot there was the two baldfaces lyin dead you see when i jumped out they came together and each refused to give trail to the other so they fought it out talkin of bear as i was sayin     in yeddo bay   somewhere along theater street he had lost it he remembered being hustled somewhat roughly on the bridge over one of the canals that cross that busy thoroughfare possibly some slanteyed lightfingered pickpocket was even then enjoying the fiftyodd yen his purse had contained and then again he thought he might have lost it himself just lost it carelessly  hopelessly and for the twentieth time he searched in all his pockets for the missing purse it was not there his hand lingered in his empty hippocket and he woefully regarded the voluble and vociferous restaurantkeeper who insanely clamored twentyfive sen you pay now twentyfive sen  but my purse the boy said i tell you ive lost it somewhere  whereupon the restaurantkeeper lifted his arms indignantly and shrieked twentyfive sen twentyfive sen you pay now  quite a crowd had collected and it was growing embarrassing for alf davis  it was so ridiculous and petty alf thought such a disturbance about nothing and decidedly he must be doing something thoughts of diving wildly through that forest of legs and of striking out at whomsoever opposed him flashed through his mind but as though divining his purpose one of the waiters a short and chunky chap with an evillooking cast in one eye seized him by the arm  you pay now you pay now twentyfive sen yelled the proprietor hoarse with rage  alf was red in the face too from mortification but he resolutely set out on another exploration he had given up the purse pinning his last hope on stray coins in the little changepocket of his coat he found a tensen piece and fivecopper sen and remembering having recently missed a tensen piece he cut the seam of the pocket and resurrected the coin from the depths of the lining twentyfive sen he held in his hand the sum required to pay for the supper he had eaten he turned them over to the proprietor who counted them grew suddenly calm and bowed obsequiouslyin fact the whole crowd bowed obsequiously and melted away  alf davis was a young sailor just turned sixteen on board the annie mine an american sailingschooner which had run into yokohama to ship its seasons catch of skins to london and in this his second trip ashore he was beginning to snatch his first puzzling glimpses of the oriental mind he laughed when the bowing and kotowing was over and turned on his heel to confront another problem how was he to get aboard ship it was eleven oclock at night and there would be no ships boats ashore while the outlook for hiring a native boatman with nothing but empty pockets to draw upon was not particularly inviting  keeping a sharp lookout for shipmates he went down to the pier at yokohama there are no long lines of wharves the shipping lies out at anchor enabling a few hundred of the shortlegged people to make a livelihood by carrying passengers to and from the shore  a dozen sampan men and boys hailed alf and offered their services he selected the most favorablelooking one an old and beneficentappearing man with a withered leg alf stepped into his sampan and sat down it was quite dark and he could not see what the old fellow was doing though he evidently was doing nothing about shoving off and getting under way at last he limped over and peered into alfs face  ten sen he said  yes i know ten sen alf answered carelessly but hurry up american schooner  ten sen you pay now the old fellow insisted  alf felt himself grow hot all over at the hateful words pay now you take me to american schooner then i pay he said  but the man stood up patiently before him held out his hand and said ten sen you pay now  alf tried to explain he had no money he had lost his purse but he would pay as soon as he got aboard the american schooner then he would pay no he would not even go aboard the american schooner he would call to his shipmates and they would give the sampan man the ten sen first after that he would go aboard so it was all right of course  to all of which the beneficentappearing old man replied you pay now ten sen and to make matters worse the other sampan men squatted on the pier steps listening  alf chagrined and angry stood up to step ashore but the old fellow laid a detaining hand on his sleeve you give shirt now i take you merican schooner he proposed  then it was that all of alfs american independence flamed up in his breast the anglosaxon has a born dislike of being imposed upon and to alf this was sheer robbery ten sen was equivalent to six american cents while his shirt which was of good quality and was new had cost him two dollars  he turned his back on the man without a word and went out to the end of the pier the crowd laughing with great gusto following at his heels the majority of them were heavyset muscular fellows and the july night being one of sweltering heat they were clad in the least possible raiment the waterpeople of any race are rough and turbulent and it struck alf that to be out at midnight on a pierend with such a crowd of wharfmen in a big japanese city was not as safe as it might be  one burly fellow with a shock of black hair and ferocious eyes came up the rest shoved in after him to take part in the discussion  give me shoes the man said give me shoes now i take you merican schooner  alf shook his head whereat the crowd clamored that he accept the proposal now the anglosaxon is so constituted that to browbeat or bully him is the last way under the sun of getting him to do any certain thing he will dare willingly but he will not permit himself to be driven so this attempt of the boatmen to force alf only aroused all the dogged stubbornness of his race the same qualities were in him that are in men who lead forlorn hopes and there under the stars on the lonely pier encircled by the jostling and shouldering gang he resolved that he would die rather than submit to the indignity of being robbed of a single stitch of clothing not value but principle was at stake  then somebody thrust roughly against him from behind he whirled about with flashing eyes and the circle involuntarily gave ground but the crowd was growing more boisterous each and every article of clothing he had on was demanded by one or another and these demands were shouted simultaneously at the tops of very healthy lungs  alf had long since ceased to say anything but he knew that the situation was getting dangerous and that the only thing left to him was to get away his face was set doggedly his eyes glinted like points of steel and his body was firmly and confidently poised this air of determination sufficiently impressed the boatmen to make them give way before him when he started to walk toward the shoreend of the pier but they trooped along beside him and behind him shouting and laughing more noisily than ever one of the youngsters about alfs size and build impudently snatched his cap from his head but before he could put it on his own head alf struck out from the shoulder and sent the fellow rolling on the stones  the cap flew out of his hand and disappeared among the many legs alf did some quick thinking his sailor pride would not permit him to leave the cap in their hands he followed in the direction it had sped and soon found it under the bare foot of a stalwart fellow who kept his weight stolidly upon it alf tried to get the cap out by a sudden jerk but failed he shoved against the mans leg but the man only grunted it was challenge direct and alf accepted it like a flash one leg was behind the man and alf had thrust strongly with his shoulder against the fellows chest nothing could save the man from the fierce vigorousness of the trick and he was hurled over and backward  next the cap was on alfs head and his fists were up before him then he whirled about to prevent attack from behind and all those in that quarter fled precipitately this was what he wanted none remained between him and the shore end the pier was narrow facing them and threatening with his fist those who attempted to pass him on either side he continued his retreat it was exciting work walking backward and at the same time checking that surging mass of men but the darkskinned peoples the world over have learned to respect the white mans fist and it was the battles fought by many sailors more than his own warlike front that gave alf the victory  where the pier adjoins the shore was the station of the harbor police and alf backed into the electriclighted office very much to the amusement of the dapper lieutenant in charge the sampan men grown quiet and orderly clustered like flies by the open door through which they could see and hear what passed  alf explained his difficulty in few words and demanded as the privilege of a stranger in a strange land that the lieutenant put him aboard in the policeboat the lieutenant in turn who knew all the rules and regulations by heart explained that the harbor police were not ferrymen and that the policeboats had other functions to perform than that of transporting belated and penniless sailormen to their ships he also said he knew the sampan men to be naturalborn robbers but that so long as they robbed within the law he was powerless it was their right to collect fares in advance and who was he to command them to take a passenger and collect fare at the journeys end alf acknowledged the justice of his remarks but suggested that while he could not command he might persuade the lieutenant was willing to oblige and went to the door from where he delivered a speech to the crowd but they too knew their rights and when the officer had finished shouted in chorus their abominable ten sen you pay now you pay now  you see i can do nothing said the lieutenant who by the way spoke perfect english but i have warned them not to harm or molest you so you will be safe at least the night is warm and half over lie down somewhere and go to sleep i would permit you to sleep here in the office were it not against the rules and regulations  alf thanked him for his kindness and courtesy but the sampan men had aroused all his pride of race and doggedness and the problem could not be solved that way to sleep out the night on the stones was an acknowledgment of defeat  the sampan men refuse to take me out  the lieutenant nodded  and you refuse to take me out  again the lieutenant nodded  well then its not in the rules and regulations that you can prevent my taking myself out  the lieutenant was perplexed there is no boat he said  thats not the question alf proclaimed hotly if i take myself out everybodys satisfied and no harm done  yes what you say is true persisted the puzzled lieutenant but you cannot take yourself out  you just watch me was the retort  down went alfs cap on the office floor right and left he kicked off his lowcut shoes trousers and shirt followed  remember he said in ringing tones i as a citizen of the united states shall hold you the city of yokohama and the government of japan responsible for those clothes good night  he plunged through the doorway scattering the astounded boatmen to either side and ran out on the pier but they quickly recovered and ran after him shouting with glee at the new phase the situation had taken on it was a night long remembered among the waterfolk of yokohama town straight to the end alf ran and without pause dived off cleanly and neatly into the water he struck out with a lusty singleoverhand stroke till curiosity prompted him to halt for a moment out of the darkness from where the pier should be voices were calling to him  he turned on his back floated and listened  all right all right he could distinguish from the babel no pay now pay bime by come back come back now pay bime by  no thank you he called back no pay at all good night  then he faced about in order to locate the annie mine she was fully a mile away and in the darkness it was no easy task to get her bearings first he settled upon a blaze of lights which he knew nothing but a manofwar could make that must be the united states warship lancaster somewhere to the left and beyond should be the annie mine but to the left he made out three lights close together that could not be the schooner for the moment he was confused he rolled over on his back and shut his eyes striving to construct a mental picture of the harbor as he had seen it in daytime with a snort of satisfaction he rolled back again the three lights evidently belonged to the big english tramp steamer therefore the schooner must lie somewhere between the three lights and the lancaster he gazed long and steadily and there very dim and low but at the point he expected burned a single lightthe anchorlight of the annie mine  and it was a fine swim under the starshine the air was warm as the water and the water as warm as tepid milk the good salt taste of it was in his mouth the tingling of it along his limbs and the steady beat of his heart heavy and strong made him glad for living  but beyond being glorious the swim was uneventful on the right hand he passed the manylighted lancaster on the left hand the english tramp and ere long the annie mine loomed large above him he grasped the hanging ropeladder and drew himself noiselessly on deck there was no one in sight he saw a light in the galley and knew that the captains son who kept the lonely anchorwatch was making coffee alf went forward to the forecastle the men were snoring in their bunks and in that confined space the heat seemed to him insufferable so he put on a thin cotton shirt and a pair of dungaree trousers tucked blanket and pillow under his arm and went up on deck and out on the forecastlehead  hardly had he begun to doze when he was roused by a boat coming alongside and hailing the anchorwatch it was the policeboat and to alf it was given to enjoy the excited conversation that ensued yes the captains son recognized the clothes they belonged to alf davis one of the seamen what had happened no alf davis had not come aboard he was ashore he was not ashore then he must be drowned here both the lieutenant and the captains son talked at the same time and alf could make out nothing then he heard them come forward and rouse out the crew the crew grumbled sleepily and said that alf davis was not in the forecastle whereupon the captains son waxed indignant at the yokohama police and their ways and the lieutenant quoted rules and regulations in despairing accents  alf rose up from the forecastlehead and extended his hand saying  i guess ill take those clothes thank you for bringing them aboard so promptly  i dont see why he couldnt have brought you aboard inside of them said the captains son  and the police lieutenant said nothing though he turned the clothes over somewhat sheepishly to their rightful owner  the next day when alf started to go ashore he found himself surrounded by shouting and gesticulating though very respectful sampan men all extraordinarily anxious to have him for a passenger nor did the one he selected say you pay now when he entered his boat when alf prepared to step out on to the pier he offered the man the customary ten sen but the man drew himself up and shook his head  you all right he said you no pay you never no pay you bully boy and all right  and for the rest of the annie mines stay in port the sampan men refused money at alf daviss hand out of admiration for his pluck and independence they had given him the freedom of the harbor     whose business is to live   stanton davies and jim wemple ceased from their talk to listen to an increase of uproar in the street a volley of stones thrummed and boomed the wire mosquito nettings that protected the windows it was a hot night and the sweat of the heat stood on their faces as they listened arose the incoherent clamor of the mob punctuated by individual cries in mexicanspanish least terrible among the obscene threats were death to the gringos kill the american pigs drown the american dogs in the sea  stanton davies and jim wemple shrugged their shoulders patiently to each other and resumed their conversation talking louder in order to make themselves heard above the uproar  the question is how wemple said its fortyseven miles to panuco by river  and the lands impossible with zaragozas and villas men on the loot and maybe fraternizing davies agreed  wemple nodded and continued and shes at the east coast magnolia two miles beyond if she isnt back at the hunting camp weve got to get her  weve played pretty square in this matter wemple davies said and we might as well speak up and acknowledge what each of us knows the other knows you want her i want her  wemple lighted a cigarette and nodded  and nows the time when its up to us to make a show as if we didnt want her and that all we want is just to save her and get her down here  and a truce until we do save heri get you wempel affirmed  a truce until we get her safe and sound back here in tampico or aboard a battleship after that   both men shrugged shoulders and beamed on each other as their hands met in ratification  fresh volleys of stones thrummed against the wirescreened windows a boys voice rose shrilly above the clamor proclaiming death to the gringos and the house reverberated to the heavy crash of some battering ram against the streetdoor downstairs both men snatching up automatic rifles ran down to where their fire could command the threatened door  if they break in weve got to let them have it wemple said  davies nodded quiet agreement then inconsistently burst out with a lurid string of oaths  to think of it he explained his wrath one out of three of those curs outside has worked for you or meleanbellied barefooted povertystricken glad for ten centavos a day if they could only get work and weve given them steady jobs and a hundred and fifty centavos a a day and here they are yelling for our blood  only the half breeds davies corrected  you know what i mean wemple replied the only peons weve lost are those that have been run off or shot  the attack on the door ceasing they returned upstairs half a dozen scattered shots from farther along the street seemed to draw away the mob for the neighborhood became comparatively quiet  a whistle came to them through the open windows and a mans voice calling  wemple open the door its habert want to talk to you  wemple went down returning in several minutes with a tidilypaunched wellbuilt grayhaired american of fifty he shook hands with davies and flung himself into a chair breathing heavily he did not relinquish his clutch on the colts 44 automatic pistol although he immediately addressed himself to the task of fishing a filled clip of cartridges from the pocket of his linen coat he had arrived hatless and breathless and the blood from a stonecut on the cheek oozed down his face he too in a fit of anger springing to his feet when he had changed clips in his pistol burst out with mouthfilling profanity  they had an american flag in the dirt stamping and spitting on it and they told me to spit on it  wemple and davies regarded him with silent interrogation  oh i know what youre wondering he flared out would i aspit on it in the pinch thats whats eating you ill answer straight out brass tacks i would put that in your pipe and smoke it  he paused to help himself to a cigar from the box on the table and to light it with a steady and defiant hand  helli guess this neck of the woods knows anthony habert and you can bank on it that its never located his yellow streak sure in the pinch id spit on old glory what the hell dye think im going on the streets for a night like this didnt i skin out of the southern hotel half an hour ago where there are forty buck americans not counting their women and all armed that was safety what dye think i came here forto rescue you  his indignation lumped his throat into silence and he seemed shaken as with an apoplexy  spit it out davies commanded dryly  ill tell you habert exploded its billy boy fifty miles up country and twentythousand throatcutting federals and rebels between him and me dye know what that boyd do if he was here in tampico and i was fifty miles up the panuco well i know and im going to do the samego and get him  were figuring on going up wemple assured him  and thats why i headed heremiss drexel of course  both men acquiesced and smiled it was a time when men dared speak of matters which at other times tabooed speech  then the things to get started habert exclaimed looking at his watch its midnight now weve got to get to the river and get a boat  but the clamor of the returning mob came through the windows in answer  davies was about to speak when the telephone rang and wemple sprang to the instrument  its carson he interjected as he listened they havent cut the wires across the river yethello carson was it a break or a cut  bully for you yes move the mules across to the potrero beyond tamcochin whos at the water station  can you still phone him  tell him to keep the tanks full and to shut off the main to arico also to hang on till the

wemple queried  the man to whom he talked was across the panuco on the south side at the tank farm  says there isnt any getaway wemple vouchsafed to the other two the federals are all over the shop and he cant understand why they havent raided him hours ago   who campos that skunk  all right dont be worried if you dont hear from me im going up river with davies and habert use your judgment and if you get a safe chance at campos pot him oh a hot time over here theyre battering our doors now yes by all means  goodby old man  wemple lighted a cigarette and wiped his forehead  you know campos josé h campos he volunteered the dirty curs stuck carson up for twenty thousand pesos we had to pay or hed have compelled half our peons to enlist or set the wells on fire and you know davies what weve done for him in past years gratitude simple decency great scott                                       it was the night of april twentyfirst on the morning of the twentyfirst the american marines and bluejackets had landed at vera cruz and seized the custom house and the city immediately the news was telegraphed the vengeful mexican mob had taken possession of the streets of tampico and expressed its disapproval of the action of the united states by tearing down american flags and crying death to the americans  there was nothing save its own spinelessness to deter the mob from carrying out its threat had it battered down the doors of the southern hotel or of other hotels or of residences such as wemples a fight would have started in which the thousands of federal soldiers in tampico would have joined their civilian compatriots in the laudable task of decreasing the gringo population of that particular portion of mexico there should have been american warships to act as deterrents but through some inexplicable excess of delicacy or strategy or heaven knows what the united states when it gave its orders to take vera cruz had very carefully withdrawn its warships from tampico to the open gulf a dozen miles away this order had come to admiral mayo by wireless from washington and thrice he had demanded the order to be repeated ere with tears in his eyes he had turned his back on his countrymen and countrywomen and steamed to sea                                       of all asinine things to leave us in the lurch this way habert was denouncing the powers that be of his country mayod never have done it mark my words he had to take program from washington and here we are and our dear ones scattered for fifty miles back up country say if i lose billy boy ill never dare go home to face the wifecome on let the three of us make a start we can throw the fear of god into any gang on the streets  come on over and take a squint davies invited from where he stood somewhat back from the window looking down into the street  it was gorged with rioters all haranguing cursing crying out death and urging one another to smash the doors but each hanging back from the death he knew waited behind those doors for the first of the rush  we cant break through a bunch like that habert was davies comment  and if we die under their feet well be of little use to billy boy or anybody else up the panuco wemple added and if  a new movement of the mob caused him to break off it was splitting before a slow and silent advance of a file of whiteclad men  bluejacketsmayos come back for us after all habert muttered  then we can get a navy launch davies said  the bedlam of the mob died away and in silence the sailors reached the street door and knocked for admittance all three went down to open it and to discover that the callers were not americans but two german lieutenants and half a dozen german marines at sight of the americans the rage of the mob rose again and was quelled by the grounding of the rifle butts of the marines  no thank you the senior lieutenant in passable english declined the invitation to enter he unconcernedly kept his cigar alive at such times that the mob drowned his voice we are on the way back to our ship our commander conferred with the english and dutch commanders but they declined to cooperate so our commander has undertaken the entire responsibility we have been the round of the hotels they are to hold their own until daybreak when well take them off we have given them rockets such as thesetake them if your house is entered hold your own and send up a rocket from the roof we can be here in force in fortyfive minutes steam is up in all our launches launch crews and marines for shore duty are in the launches and at the first rocket we shall start  since you are going aboard now we should like to go with you davies said after having rendered due thanks  the surprise and distaste on both lieutenants faces was patent  oh no davies laughed we dont want refuge we have friends fifty miles up river and we want to get to the river in order to go up after them  the pleasure on the officers faces was immediate as they looked a silent conference at each other  since our commander has undertaken grave responsibility on a night like this may we do less than take minor responsibility queried the elder  to this the younger heartily agreed in a trice upstairs and down again equipped with extra ammunition extra pistols and a pocketbulging supply of cigars cigarettes and matches the three americans were ready wemple called last instructions up the stairway to imaginary occupants being left behind ascertained that the spring lock was on and slammed the door  the officers led followed by the americans the rear brought up by the six marines and the spitting howling mob not daring to cast a stone gave way before them                                       as they came alongside the gangway of the cruiser they saw launches and barges lying in strings to the boatbooms filled with men waiting for the rocket signal from the beleaguered hotels a gun thundered from close at hand up river followed by the thunder of numerous guns and the reports of many rifles fired very rapidly  now whats the topila whanging away at habert complained then joined the others in gazing at the picture  a searchlight evidently emanating from the mexican gunboat was stabbing the darkness to the middle of the river where it played upon the water and across the water the center of the moving circle of light flashed a long lean speedboat a shell burst in the air a hundred feet astern of it somewhere outside the light other shells were bursting in the water for they saw the boat rocked by the waves from the explosions they could guess the whizzing of the rifle bullets  but for only several minutes the spectacle lasted such was the speed of the boat that it gained shelter behind the german when the mexican gunboat was compelled to cease fire the speedboat slowed down turned in a wide and heeling circle and ranged up alongside the launch at the gangway  the lights from the gangway showed but one occupant a towheaded greasyfaced blond youth of twenty very lean very calm very much satisfied with himself  if it aint peter tonsburg habert ejaculated reaching out a hand to shake howdy peter howdy and where in hell are you hellbent for surging by the topila in such scandalous fashion  peter a texasborn swede of immigrant parents filled with the old texas traditions greasily shook hands with

quietly  who miss drexel why didnt you say so at first peter demanded grievedly he sighed and added well climb in an make a start better get your dutch friends to donate me about twenty gallons of gasoline if you want to get anywhere                                       wont do you no good to lay low peter tonsburg remarked as at full speed headed up river the topilas searchlight stabbed them high or low if one of them shells hits in the vicinitygood night  immediately thereafter the topila erupted the roar of the chills exhaust nearly drowned the roar of the guns but the fragile hull of the craft was shaken and rocked by the bursting shells an occasional bullet thudded into or pinged off the chill and despite peters warning that high or low they were bound to get it if it came to them every man on board including peter crouched with chest contracted by drawnin shoulders in an instinctive and purely unconscious effort to lessen the area of body he presented as a target or receptacle for flying fragments of steel  the topila was a federal gunboat to complicate the affair the constitutionalists gathered on the north shore in the siege of tampico opened up on the speedboat with many rifles and a machine gun  lord im glad theyre mexicans and not americans habert observed after five mad minutes in which no damage had been received mexicans are born with guns in their hands and they never learn to use them  nor was the chill or any man aboard damaged when at last she rounded the bend of river that shielded her from the searchlight  ill have you in panuco town in lessn three hours  if we dont hit a log peter leaned back and shouted in wemples ear and if we do hit driftwood ill have you in the swim quicker than that  chill ii tore her way through the darkness steered by the towheaded youth who knew every foot of the river and who guided his course by the loom of the banks in the dim starlight a smart breeze kicking up spiteful wavelets on the wider reaches splashed them with sheeted water as well as fineflung spray and in the face of the warmth of the tropic night the wind added to the speed of the boat chilled them through their wet clothes  now i know why she was named the chill habert observed betwixt chattering teeth  but conversation languished during the nearly three hours of drive through the darkness once by the exhaust they knew that they passed an unlighted launch bound down stream and once a glare of light near the south bank as they passed through the toreno field aroused brief debate as to whether it was the toreno wells or the bungalow on merricks banana plantation that flared so fiercely  at the end of an hour peter slowed down and ran in to the bank  i got a cache of gasoline hereten gallons he explained and its just as well to know its here for the back trip without leaving the boat fishing armdeep into the brush he announced all hunkydory he proceeded to oil the engine huh he soliloquized for their benefit i was just readin a magazine yarn last night whose business is to die was its title an all i got to say is the hell it is a mans business is to live maybe you thought it was our business to die when the topila was pepperin us but you was wrong were alive aint we we beat her to it thats the game nobodys got any business to die i aint never goin to die if ive got any say about it  he turned over the crank and the roar and rush of the chill put an end to speech  there was no need for wemple or davies to speak further in the affair closest to their hearts their truce to lovemaking had been made as binding as it was brief and each rival honored the other with a firm belief that he would commit no infraction of the truce afterward was another matter in the meantime they were one in the effort to get beth drexel back to the safety of riotous tampico or of a war vessel  it was four oclock when they passed by panuco town shouts and songs told them that the federal detachment holding the place was celebrating its indignation at the landing of american bluejackets in vera cruz sentinels challenged the chill from the shore and shot at random at the noise of her in the darkness  a mile beyond where a lighted river steamer with steam up lay at the north bank they ran in at the apshodel wells the steamer was small and the nearly two hundred americansmen women and childrencrowded her capacity blasphemous greetings of pure joy and geniality were exchanged between the men and habert learned that the steamboat was waiting for his billy boy who astride a horse was rounding up isolated drilling gangs who had not yet learned that the united states had seized vera cruz and that all mexico was boiling  habert climbed out to wait and to go down on the steamer while the three that remained on the chill having learned that miss drexel was not with the refugees headed for the dutch company on the south shore this was the big gusher pinched down from one hundred and eightyfive thousand daily barrels to the quantity the company was able to handle mexico had no quarrel with holland so that the superintendent while up with night guards out to prevent drunken soldiers from firing his vast lakes of oil was quite unemotional yes the last he had heard was that miss drexel and her brother were back at the hunting lodge no he had not sent any warnings and he doubted that anybody else had not till ten oclock the previous evening had he learned of the landing at vera cruz the mexicans had turned nasty as soon as they heard of it and they had killed miles forman at the empire wells run off his labor and looted the camp horses no he didnt have horse or mule on the place the federals had commandeered the last animal weeks back it was his belief however that there were a couple of plugs at the lodge too worthless even for the mexicans to take  its a hike davies said cheerfully  six miles of it wemple agreed equally cheerfully lets beat it  a shot from the river where they had left peter in the boat started them on the run for the bank a scattering of shots as from two rifles followed and while the dutch superintendent in execrable spanish shouted affirmations of dutch neutrality into the menacing dark across the gunwale of chill ii they found the body of the towheaded youth whose business it had been not to die                                       for the first hour talking little davies and wemple stumbled along the apology for a road that led through the jungle to the lodge they did discuss the glares of several fires to the east along the south bank of panuco river and hoped fervently that they were dwellings and not wells  two billion dollars worth of oil right here in the ebaño field alone davies grumbled  and a drunken mexican whose whole carcass and immortal soul arent worth ten pesos including hair hide and tallow can start the bonfire with a lighted wad of cotton waste was wemples contribution and if ever she starts shell gut the field of its last barrel  dawn at five enabled them to accelerate their pace and six oclock found them routing out the occupants of the lodge  dress for rough travel and dont stop for any frills wemple called around the corner of miss drexels screened sleeping porch  not a wash nothing davies supplemented grimly as he shook hands with charley drexel who yawned and slippered up to them in pajamas where are those horses charley still alive  wemple finished giving orders to the sleepy peons to remain and care for the place occupying their spare time with hiding the more valuable things and was calling around the corner to miss drexel the news of the capture of vera cruz when davies returned with the information that the horses consisted of a pair of motheaten skates that could be depended upon to lie down and die in the first half mile  beth drexel emerged first protesting that under no circumstances would she be guilty of riding the creatures and next her brunette skin and dark eyes still flushed warm with sleep greeting the two rescuers  it would be just as well if you washed your face stanton she told davies and to wemple youre just as bad jim you are a pair of dirty boys  and so will you be wemple assured her before you get back to tampico are you ready  as soon as juanita packs my hand bag  heavens beth dont waste time exclaimed wemple jump in and grab up what you want  make a startmake a start chanted davies hustle hustlecharley get the rifle you like best and take it along get a couple for us  is it as serious as that miss drexel queried  both men nodded  the mexicans are tearing loose davies explained how they missed this place i dont know a movement in the adjoining room startled him whos that he cried  why mrs morgan miss drexel answered  good heavens wemple id forgotten her groaned davies how will we ever get her anywhere  let beth walk and relay the lady on the nags  she weighs a hundred and eighty miss drexel laughed oh hurry martha were waiting on you to start  muffled speech came through the partition and then emerged a very short stout muchflustered woman of middle age  i simply cant walk and you boys neednt demand it of me was her plaint its no use i couldnt walk half a mile to save my life and its six of the worst miles to the river  they regarded her in despair  then youll ride said davies come on charley well get a saddle on each of the nags  along the road through the tropic jungle miss drexel and juanita her indian maid led the way her brother carrying the three rifles brought up the rear while in the middle davies and wemple struggled with mrs morgan and the two decrepit steeds one a fleabitten roan groaned continually from the moment mrs morgans burden was put upon him till she was shifted to the other horse and this other a mangy sorrel invariably lay down at the end of a quarter of a mile of mrs morgan  miss drexel laughed and joked and encouraged and wemple in brutal fashion compelled mrs morgan to walk every third quarter of a mile at the end of an hour the sorrel refused positively to get up and so was abandoned thereafter mrs morgan rode the roan alternate quarters of miles and between times walkedif walk may describe her stumbling progress on two preposterously tiny feet with a man supporting her on either side  a mile from the river the road became more civilized running along the side of a thousand acres of banana plantation  parslows young drexel said hell lose a years crop now on account of this mixup  oh look what ive found miss drexel called from the lead  first machine that ever tackled this road was young drexels judgment as they halted to stare at the tiretracks  but look at the tracks his sister urged the machine must have come right out of the bananas and climbed the bank  some machine to climb a bank like that was davies comment what it did do was to go down the banktake a scout after it charley while wemple and i get mrs morgan off her fractious mount no machine ever built could travel far through those bananas  the fleabitten roan on its four legs upstanding continued bravely to stand until the lady was removed whereupon with a long sigh it sank down on the ground mrs morgan likewise sighed sat down and regarded her tiny feet mournfully  go on boys she said maybe you can find something at the river and send back for me  but their indignant rejection of the plan never attained speech for at that instant from the green sea of banana trees beneath them came the sudden purr of an engine a minute later the splutter of an exhaust told them the silencer had been taken off the hugefronded banana trees were violently agitated as by the threshing of a hidden titan they could identify the changing of gears and the reversing and going ahead until at the end of five minutes a long low black car burst from the wall of greenery and charged the soft earth bank but the earth was too soft and when twothirds of the way up beaten charley drexel braked the car to a standstill the earth crumbled from under the tires and he ran it down and back the way he had come until halfburied in the bananas  a merry oldsmobile miss drexel quoted from the popular song clapping her hands now martha your troubles are over  sixcylinder and sounds as if it hadnt been out of the shop a week or may i never ride in a machine again wemple remarked looking to davies for confirmation  davies nodded  its allisons he said campos tried to shake him down for a private loan andwell you know allison he told campos to go to and campos in revenge commandeered his new car that was two days ago before we lifted a hand at vera cruz allison told me yesterday the last hed heard of the car it was on a steamboat bound up river and heres where they ditched itbut lets get a hustle on and get her into the running  three attempts they made with young drexel at the wheel but the soft earth and the pitch of the grade baffled  shes got the power all right young drexel protested but she cant bite into that mush  so far they had spread on the ground the robes found in the car the men now added their coats and wemple for additional traction unsaddled the roan and spread the cinches stirrup leathers saddle blanket and bridle in the way of the wheels the car took the treacherous slope in a rush with churning wheels biting into the woven fabrics and with no more than a hint of hesitation it cleared the crest and swung into the road  isnt she the spunky devil drexel exulted say she could climb the side of a house if she could get traction  better put on that silencer again if you dont want to play tag with every soldier in the district wemple ordered as they helped mrs morgan in  the road to the dutch gusher compelled them to go through the outskirts of panuco town indian and half breed women gazed stolidly at the strange vehicle while the children and barking dogs clamorously advertised its progress once passing long lines of tethered federal horses they were challenged by a sentry but at wemples throw on the juice the car took the rutted road at fifty miles an hour a shot whistled after them but it was not the shot that made mrs morgan scream the cause was a series of hogwallows masked with mud which nearly tore the steering wheel from drexels hands before he could reduce speed  wonder it didnt break an axle davies growled go on and take it easy charley were past any interference  they swung into the dutch camp and into the beginning of their real troubles the refugee steamboat had departed down river from the asphodel camp chill ii had disappeared the superintendent knew not how along with the body of peter tonsburg and the superintendent was dubious of their remaining  ive got to consider the owners he told them this is the biggest well in mexico and you know ita hundred and eightyfive thousand barrels daily flow ive no right to risk it we have no trouble with the mexicans its you americans if you stay here ill have to protect you and i cant protect you anyway well all lose our lives and theyll destroy the well in the bargain and if they fire it it means the entire ebaño oil field the stratas too broken were flowing twenty thousand barrels now and we cant pinch down any further as it is the oils coming up outside the pipe and we cant have a fight weve got to keep the oil moving  the men nodded it was coldblooded logic but there was no fault to it  the harassed expression eased on the superintendents face and he almost beamed on them for agreeing with him  youve got a good machine there he continued the ferrys at the bank at panuco and once youre across the rebels arent so thick on the north shore why you can beat the steamboat back to tampico by hours and it hasnt rained for days the road wont be at all bad                                       which is all very good davies observed to wemple as they approached panuco except for the fact that the road on the other side was never built for automobiles much less for a longbodied one like this i wish it were the four instead of the six  and it would bother you with a four to negotiate that hill at aliso where the road switchbacks above the river  and were going to do it with a six or lose a perfectly good six in trying beth drexel laughed to them  avoiding the cavalry camp they entered panuco with all the speed the ruts permitted swinging dizzy corners to the squawking of chickens and barking of dogs to gain the ferry they had to pass down one side of the great plaza which was the heart of the city peon soldiers drowsing in the sun or clustering around the cantinas stared stupidly at them as they flashed past then a drunken major shouted a challenge from the doorway of a cantina and began vociferating orders and as they left the plaza behind they could hear rising the familiar mobcry kill the gringoes  if any shooting begins you women get down in the bottom of the car davies commanded and theres the ferry all right be careful charley  the machine plunged directly down the bank through a cut so deep that it was more like a chute struck the gangplank with a terrific bump and seemed fairly to leap on board the ferry was scarcely longer than the machine and drexel visibly shaken by the closeness of the shave managed to stop only when six inches remained between the front wheels and overboard  it was a cable ferry operated by gasoline and while wemple cast off the mooring lines davies was making swift acquaintance with the engine the third turnover started it and he threw it into gear with the windlass that began winding up the cable from the rivers bottom  by the time they were in midstream a score of horsemen rode out on the bank they had just left and opened a scattering fire the party crowded in the shelter of the car and listened to the occasional richochet of a bullet once only the car was struck  herewhat are you up to wemple demanded suddenly of drexel who had exposed himself to fish a rifle out of the car  going to show the skunks what shooting is was his answer  no you dont wemple said were not here to fight but to get this party to tampico he remembered peter tonsburgs remark whose business is to live charleythats our business anybody can get killed its too easy these days  still under fire they moored at the north shore and when davies had tossed overboard the igniter from the ferry engine and commandeered ten gallons of its surplus gasoline they took the steep soft road up the bank in a rush  look at her climb drexel uttered gleefully that aliso hill wont bother us at all shell put a crimp in it thats what shell do  it isnt the hill its the sharp turn of the zigzag thats liable to put a crimp in her davies answered that road was never laid out for autos and no auto has ever been over it they steamboated this one up  but trouble came before aliso was reached where the road dipped abruptly into a small jag of hollow that was almost vshaped it arose out and became a hundred yards of deep sand in order to have speed left for the sand after he cleared the stiff upgrade of the v drexel was compelled to hit the trough of the v with speed wemple clutched miss drexel as she was on the verge of being bounced out mrs morgan too solid for such airiness screamed from the pain of the bump and even the imperturbable juanita fell to crossing herself and uttering prayers with exceeding rapidity  the car cleared the crest and encountered the sand going slower from moment to moment slewing and writhing and squirming from side to side the men leaped out and began shoving miss drexel urged juanita out and followed but the car came to a standstill and drexel looking back and pointing showed the first sign of being beaten two things he pointed to a constitutional soldier on horseback a quarter of a mile in the rear and a portion of the narrow road that had fallen out bodily on the far slope of the v  cant get at this sand unless we go back and try over and we ditch the car if we try to back up that  the ditch was a huge natural sumphole the stagnant surface of which was acrawl with slime twenty feet beneath  davies and wemple sprang to take the boys place  you cant do it he urged you can get the back wheels past but right there you hit that little curve and if you make it your front wheel will be off the bank if you dont make it your back wheelll be off  both men studied it carefully then looked at each other  weve got to said davies  and were going to wemple said shoving his rival aside in comradely fashion and taking the post of danger at the wheel youre just as good as i at the wheel davies he explained but youre a better shot your jobs cut out to go back and hold off any greasers that show up  davies took a rifle and strolled back with so ominous an air that the lone cavalryman put spurs to his horse and fled mrs morgan was helped out and sent plodding and tottering unaided on her way to the end of the sand stretch miss drexel and juanita joined charley in spreading the coats and robes on the sand and in gathering and spreading small branches brush and armfuls of a dry brittle shrub but all three ceased from their exertions to watch wemple as he shot the car backward down the v and up the car seemed first to stand on one end then on the other and to reel drunkenly and to threaten to turn over into the sumphole when its right front wheel fell into the air where the road had ceased to be but the hind wheels bit and climbed the grade and out  without pause gathering speed down the perilous slope wemple came ahead and up gaining fifty feet of sand over the previous failure more of the alluvial soil of the road had dropped out at the bad place but he took the v in reverse overhung the front wheel as before and from the top came ahead again four times he did this gaining each time but each time knocking a bigger hole where the road fell out until miss drexel begged him not to try again  he pointed to a squad of horsemen coming at a gallop along the road a mile in the rear and took the v once again in reverse  if only we had more stuff drexel groaned to his sister as he threw down a meager hardgathered armful of the dry and brittle shrub and as wemple once more with rush and roar shot down the v  for an instant it seemed that the great car would turn over into the sump but the next instant it was past it struck the bottom of the hollow a mighty wallop and bounced and upended to the steep pitch of the climb miss drexel seized by inspiration or desperation with a quick movement stripped off her short corduroy trampingskirt and looking very lithe and boyish in slendercut pongee bloomers ran along the sand and dropped the skirt for a foothold for the slowly revolving wheels almost but not quite did the car stop then gathering way with the others running alongside and shoving it emerged on the hard road  while they tossed the robes and coats and miss drexels skirt into the bottom of the car and got mrs morgan on board davies overtook them  down on the bottomall of you he shouted as he gained the running board and the machine sprang away a scattering of shots came from the rear  whose business is to livehunch down davies yelled in wemples ear accompanying the instruction with an openhanded blow on the shoulder  live yourself wemple grumbled as he obediently hunched get your head down youre exposing yourself  the pursuit lasted but a little while and died away in an occasional distant shot  theyve quit davies announced it never entered their stupid heads that they could have caught us on aliso hill                                       it cant be done was charley drexels quick judgment of youth as the machine stopped and they surveyed the acuteangled turn on the stiff upgrade of aliso beneath was the swiftrunning river  get out everybody wemple commanded upside all of you if you dont want the car to turn over on you spread traction wherever she needs it  shoot her ahead or backshe cant stop davies said quietly from the outer edge of the road where he had taken position the earths crumbling away from under the tires every second she stands still  get out from under or shell be on top of you wemple ordered as he went ahead several yards  but again after the car rested a minute the light dry earth began to crack and crumble away from under the tires rolling in a miniature avalanche down the steep declivity into the water and not until wemple had backed fifty yards down the narrow road did he find solid resting for the car he came ahead on foot and examined the acute angle formed by the two zigzags together with davies he planned what was to be done  when you come youve got to come ahumping davies advised if you stop anywhere for more than seconds its good night and the walking wont be fine  shes full of fight and she can do it see that hard formation right there on the inside wall it couldnt have come at a better spot if i dont make her hind wheels climb half way up it well start walking about a second thereafter  shes a twofisted piece of machinery davies encouraged i know her kind if she cant do it no machine can that was ever made am i right beth  shes a regular spunky shedevil miss drexel laughed agreement and so are the pair of youerof the male persuasion i mean  miss drexel had never seemed so fascinating to either of them as she was then in the excitement quite unconscious of her abbreviated costume her brown hair flying her eyes sparkling her lips smiling each man caught the other in that moments pause to look and each man sighed to the other and looked frankly into each others eyes ere he turned to the work at hand  wemple came up with his usual rush but it was a gauged rush and davies took the post of danger the outside running board where his weight would help the broad tires to bite a little deeper into the treacherous surface if the roadedge crumbled away it was inevitable that he would be caught under the car as it rolled over and down to the river  it was ahead and reverse ahead and reverse with only the briefest of pauses in which to shift the gears wemple backed up the hard formation on the inside bank till the car seemed standing on end rushed ahead till the earth of the outer edge broke under the front tires and splashed in the water davies now off and again on the running board when needed accompanied the car in its jerky and erratic progress tossing robes and coats under the tires calling instructions to drexel similarly occupied on the other side and warning miss drexel out of the way  oh you merry olds you merry olds you merry olds wemple muttered aloud as if in prayer as he wrestled the car about the narrow area gaining sometimes inches in pivoting it sometimes fetching back up the inner wall precisely at the spot previously attained and once having the car with the surface of the roadbed under it slide bodily and sidewise two feet down the road  the clapping of miss drexels hands was the first warning davies received that the feat was accomplished and swinging on to the running board he found the car backing in the straightaway up the next zigzag and wemple still chanting ecstatically oh you merry olds you merry olds  there were no more grades nor zigzags between them and tampico but so narrow was the primitive road two miles farther were backed before space was found in which to turn around one thing of importance did lie between them and tampiconamely the investing lines of the constitutionalists but here at noon fortune favored in the form of three american soldiers of fortune operators of machine guns who had fought the entire campaign with villa from the beginning of the advance from the texan border under a white flag wemple drove the car across the zone of debate into the federal lines where good fortune in the guise of an ubiquitous german naval officer again received them  i think you are nearly the only americans left in tampico he told them about all the rest are lying out in the gulf on the different warships but at the southern hotel there are several and the situation seems quieter  as they got out at the southern davies laid his hand on the car and murmured good old girl wemple followed suit and miss drexel engaging both mens eyes and about to say something was guilty of a sudden moisture in her own eyes that made her turn to the car with a caressing hand and repeat good old girl
