twisting herself about uneasily on the sofa in her pretty room i never thought before that the days could be so long as they are now  poor you said her sister maude sympathetically maude was moving briskly about the room putting it into the beautiful order that mother insisted on it was nans week to care for their room but nan had sprained her ankle three days ago and could do nothing but lie on the sofa ever since and very tired of it too was wideawake active nan  and the picnic this afternoon too she sighed ive looked forward to it all summer and its a perfect dayand ive got to stay here and nurse this foot  nan looked vindictively at the bandaged member while maude leaned out of the window to pull a pink climbing rose as she did so she nodded to someone in the village street below  who is passing asked nan  florrie hamilton  is she going to the picnic asked nan indifferently  no she wasnt asked of course i dont suppose she expected to be she knows she isnt in our set she must feel horribly out of place at school a lot of the girls say it is ridiculous of her father to send her to miss braxtons private schoola factory overseers daughter  she ought to have been asked to the picnic all the same said nan shortly she is in our class if she isnt in our set of course i dont suppose she would have enjoyed herselfor even gone at all for that matter she certainly doesnt push herself in among us one would think she hadnt a tongue in her head  she is the best student in the class admitted maude arranging her roses in a vase and putting them on the table at nans elbow but patty morrison and wilhelmina patterson had the most to say about the invitations and they wouldnt have her there nannie dear arent those lovely ill leave them here to be company for you  im going to have more company than that said nan thumping her pillow energetically im not going to mope here alone all the afternoon with you off having a jolly time at the picnic write a little note for me to florrie hastings will you ill do as much for you when you sprain your foot  what shall i put in it said maude rummaging out her portfolio obligingly  oh just ask her if she will come down and cheer a poor invalid up this afternoon shell come i know and she is such good company get dickie to run right out and mail it  i do wonder if florrie hamilton will feel hurt over not being asked to the picnic speculated maude absently as she slipped her note into an envelope and addressed it  florrie hamilton herself could best have answered that question as she walked along the street in the fresh morning sunshine she did feel hurtmuch more keenly than she would acknowledge even to herself it was not that she cared about the picnic itself as nan wallace had said she would not have been likely to enjoy herself if she had gone among a crowd of girls many of whom looked down on her and ignored her but to be left out when every other girl in the school was invited florries lip quivered as she thought of it  ill get father to let me to go to the public school after vacation she murmured i hate going to miss braxtons  florrie was a newcomer in winboro her father had recently come to take a position in the largest factory of the small town for this reason florrie was slighted at school by some of the ruder girls and severely left alone by most of the others some it is true tried at the start to be friends but florrie too keenly sensitive to the atmosphere around her to respond was believed to be decidedly dull and mopy she retreated further and further into herself and was almost as solitary at miss braxtons as if she had been on a desert island  they dont like me because i am plainly dressed and because my father is not a wealthy man thought florrie bitterly and there was enough truth in this in regard to many of miss braxtons girls to make a very uncomfortable state of affairs  heres a letter for you flo said her brother jack at noon got it at the office on my way home who is your swell correspondent  florrie opened the dainty perfumed note and read it with a face that puzzled at first suddenly grew radiant  listen jack she said excitedly      dear florrie      nan is confined to house room and sofa with a sprained     foot as she will be all alone this afternoon wont you come     down and spend it with her she very much wants you to     comeshe is so lonesome and thinks you will be just the one     to cheer her up                                   yours cordially                                     maude wallace  are you going asked jack  yesi dont knowill think about it said florrie absently then she hurried upstairs to her room  shall i go she thought yes i will i dare say nan has asked me just out of pity because i was not invited to the picnic but even so it was sweet of her ive always thought i would like those wallace girls if i could get really acquainted with them theyve always been nice to me tooi dont know why i am always so tonguetied and stupid with them but ill go anyway  that afternoon mrs wallace came into nans room  nan dear florrie hamilton is downstairs asking for you  florriehamilton  yes she said something about a note you sent her this morning shall i ask her to come up  yes of course said nan lamely when her mother had gone out she fell back on her pillows and thought rapidly  florrie hamilton maude must have addressed that note to her by mistake but she mustnt know it was a mistakemustnt suspect it oh dear what shall i ever find to talk to her about she is so quiet and shy  further reflections were cut short by florries entrance nan held out her hand with a chummy smile  its good of you to give your afternoon up to visiting a cranky invalid she said heartily you dont know how lonesome ive been since maude went away take off your hat and pick out the nicest chair you can find and lets be comfy  somehow nans frank greeting did away with florries embarrassment and made her feel at home she sat down in maudes rocker then glancing over to a vase filled with roses her eyes kindled with pleasure seeing this nan said arent they lovely we wallaces are very fond of our climbing roses our greatgrandmother brought the roots out from england with her sixty years ago and they grow nowhere else in this country  i know said florrie with a smile i recognized them as soon as i came into the room they are the same kind of roses as those which grow about grandmother hamiltons house in england i used to love them so  in england were you ever in england  oh yes laughed florrie and ive been in pretty nearly every other country upon earthevery one that a ship could get to at least  why florrie hamilton are you in earnest  indeed yes perhaps you dont know that our nowmother as jack says sometimes is fathers second wife my own mother died when i was a baby and my aunt who had no children of her own took me to bring up her husband was a seacaptain and she always went on his seavoyages with him so i went too i almost grew up on shipboard we had delightful times i never went to school auntie had been a teacher before her marriage and she taught me two years ago when i was fourteen father married again and then he wanted me to go home to him and jack and our new mother so i did although at first i was very sorry to leave auntie and the dear old ship and all our lovely wanderings  oh tell me all about them demanded nan why florrie hamilton to think youve never said a word about your wonderful experiences i love to hear about foreign countries from people who have really been there please just talkand ill listen and ask questions  florrie did talk im not sure whether she or nan was the more surprised to find that she could talk so well and describe her travels so brightly and humorously the afternoon passed quickly and when florrie went away at dusk after a dainty tea served up in nans room it was with a cordial invitation to come again soon  ive enjoyed your visit so much said nan sincerely im going down to see you as soon as i can walk but dont wait for that let us be good chummy friends without any ceremony  when florrie with a light heart and a happy smile had gone came maude sunburned and glowing from her picnic  such a nice time as we had she exclaimed wasnt i sorry to think of you cooped up here did florrie come  one florrie did maude you addressed that note to florrie hamilton today instead of florrie hastings  nan surely not im sure  yes you did and she came here was i not taken aback at first maude  i was thinking about her when i addressed it and i must have put her name down by mistake im so sorry  you neednt be i havent been entertained so charmingly for a long while why maude she has travelled almost everywhereand is so bright and witty when she thaws out she didnt seem like the same girl at all she is just perfectly lovely  well im glad you had such a nice time together do you know some of the girls were very much vexed because she wasnt asked to the picnic they said that it was sheer rudeness not to ask her and that it reflected on us all even if patty and wilhelmina were responsible for it im afraid we girls at miss braxtons have been getting snobbish and some of us are beginning to find it out and be ashamed of it  just wait until school opens said nanvaguely enough it would seem but maude understood  however they did not have to wait until school opened long before that time winboro girlhood discovered that the wallace girls were taking florrie hamilton into their lives if the wallace girls liked her there must be something in the girl more than was at first thoughtthus more than one of miss braxtons girls reasoned and gradually the other girls found as nan had found that florrie was full of fun and an allround good companion when drawn out of her diffidence when miss braxtons school reopened florrie was the class favourite between her and nan wallace a beautiful and helpful friendship had been formed which was to grow and deepen through their whole lives  and all because maude in a fit of abstraction wrote hamilton for hastings said nan to herself one day but that is something florrie hamilton will never know     an unpremeditated ceremony   selwyn grant sauntered in upon the assembled family at the homestead as if he were returning from an hours absence instead of a western sojourn of ten years guided by the sound of voices on the still pungent autumnal air he went around to the door of the dining room which opened directly on the poppy walk in the garden  nobody noticed him for a moment and he stood in the doorway looking at them with a smile wondering what was the reason of the festal air that hung about them all as visibly as a garment his mother sat by the table industriously polishing the best silver spoons which as he remembered were only brought forth upon some great occasion her eyes were as bright her form as erect her nosethe carston noseas pronounced and aristocratic as of yore  selwyn saw little change in her but was it possible that the tall handsome young lady with the sleek brown pompadour and a nose unmistakably and plebeianly grant who sat by the window doing something to a heap of lace and organdy in her lap was the little curlyheaded sunburned sister of thirteen whom he remembered the young man leaning against the sideboard must be leo of course a finelooking broadshouldered young fellow who made selwyn think suddenly that he must be growing old and there was the little thin grey father in the corner peering at his newspaper with nearsighted eyes selwyns heart gave a bound at the sight of him which not even his mother had caused dear old dad the years had been kind to him  mrs grant held up a glistening spoon and surveyed it complacently there i think that is bright enough even to suit margaret graham i shall take over the whole two dozen teas and one dozen desserts i wish bertha that you would tie a red cord around each of the handles for me the carmody spoons are the same pattern and i shall always be convinced that mrs carmody carried off two of ours the time that jenny graham was married i dont mean to take any more risks and father  something made the mother look around and she saw her firstborn  when the commotion was over selwyn asked why the family spoons were being rubbed up  for the wedding of course said mrs grant polishing her goldbowed spectacles and deciding that there was no more time for tears and sentiment just then and there theyre not half doneand well have to dress in another hour bertha is no earthly useshe is so taken up with her bridesmaid finery  wedding whose wedding demanded selwyn in bewilderment  why leos of course leo is to be married tonight didnt you get your invitation wasnt that what brought you home  hand me a chair quick implored selwyn leo are you going to commit matrimony in this headlong fashion are you sure youre grown up  six feet is a pretty good imitation of it isnt it grinned leo brace up old fellow its not so bad as it might be shes quite a respectable girl we wrote you all about it three weeks ago and broke the news as gently as possible  i left for the east a month ago and have been wandering around preying on old college chums ever since havent seen a letter there im better now no you neednt fan me sis well no family can get through the world without its seasons of tribulations who is the party of the second part little brother  alice graham replied mrs grant who had a habit of speaking for her children none of whom had the carston nose  alice graham that child exclaimed selwyn in astonishment  leo roared come come sel perhaps were not very progressive here in croyden but we dont actually stand still girls are apt to stretch out some between ten and twenty you know you old bachelors think nobody ever grows up why sel youre grey around your temples  too well i know it but a mans own brother shouldnt be the first to cast such things up to him ill admit since i come to think of it that alice has probably grown bigger is she any betterlooking than she used to be  alice is a charming girl said mrs grant impressively she is a beauty and she is also sweet and sensible which beauties are not always we are all very much pleased with leos choice but we have really no more time to spare just now the wedding is at seven oclock and it is four already  is there anybody you can send to the station for my luggage asked selwyn luckily i have a new suit otherwise i shouldnt have the face to go  well i must be off said mrs grant father take selwyn away so that i shant be tempted to waste time talking to him  in the library father and son looked at each other affectionately  dad its a blessing to see you just the same im a little dizzy with all these changes bertha grown up and leo within an inch of being married to alice graham at that whom i cant think of yet as anything else than the longlegged blackeyed imp of mischief she was when a kiddy to tell you the truth dad i dont feel in a mood for going to a wedding at wishtonwish tonight im sure you dont either youve always hated fusses cant we shirk it  they smiled at each other with chummy remembrance of many a family festival they had shirked together in the old days but mr grant shook his head not this time sonny there are some things a decent man cant shirk and one of them is his own boys wedding its a nuisance but i must go through with it youll understand how it is when youre a family man yourself by the way why arent you a family man by this time why havent i been put to the bother and inconvenience of attending your wedding before now son  selwyn laughed with a little vibrant note of bitterness in the laughter which the fathers quick ears detected ive been too busy with law books dad to find me a wife  mr grant shook his bushy grey head thats not the real reason son the world has a wife for every man if he hasnt found her by the time hes thirtyfive theres some real reason for it well i dont want to pry into yours but i hope its a sound one and not a mean sneaking selfish sort of reason perhaps youll choose a madam selwyn some day yet in case you should im going to give you a small bit of good advice your mothernow shes a splendid woman selwyn a splendid woman she cant be matched as a housekeeper and she has improved my finances until i dont know them when i meet them shes been a good wife and a good mother if i were a young man id court her and marry her over again that i would but son when you pick a wife pick one with a nice little commonplace nose not a family nose never marry a woman with a family nose son  a woman with a family nose came into the library at this juncture and beamed maternally upon them both theres a bite for you in the dining room after youve eaten it you must dress mind you brush your hair well down father the green room is ready for you selwyn tomorrow ill have a good talk with you but tonight ill be too busy to remember youre around how are we all going to get over to wishtonwish leo and bertha are going in the pony carriage it wont hold a third passenger youll have to squeeze in with father and me in the buggy selwyn  by no means replied selwyn briskly ill walk over to wishtonwish ifs only half a mile across lots i suppose the old way is still open  it ought to be answered mr grant drily leo has kept it well trodden if youve forgotten how it runs he can tell you  i havent forgotten said selwyn a little brusquely he had his own reasons for remembering the wood path leo had not been the first grant to go courting to wishtonwish  when he started the moon was rising round and red and hazy in an eastern hillgap the autumn air was mild and spicy long shadows stretched across the fields on his right and silvery mosaics patterned the floor of the old beechwood lane selwyn walked slowly he was thinking of esme graham or rather of the girl who had been esme graham and wondering if he would see her at the wedding it was probable and he did not want to see her in spite of ten years effort he did not think he could yet look upon tom st clairs wife with the proper calm indifference at the best it would taint his own memory of her he would never again be able to think of her as esme graham but only as esme st clair  the grahams had come to wishtonwish eleven years before there was a big family of girls of whom the tall brownhaired esme was the oldest there was one summer during which selwyn grant had haunted wishtonwish the merry comrade of the younger girls the boyishly silently devoted lover of esme tom st clair had always been there too in his right as second cousin selwyn had supposed one day he found out that tom and esme had been engaged ever since she was sixteen one of her sisters told him that had been all he had gone away soon after and some time later a letter from home made casual mention of tom st clairs marriage  he narrowly missed being late for the wedding ceremony the bridal party entered the parlour at wishtonwish at the same moment as he slipped in by another door selwyn almost whistled with amazement at sight of the bride that alice graham that tall stately blushing young woman with her masses of deadblack hair frosted over by the film of wedding veil could that be the scrawny little tomboy of ten years ago she looked not unlike esme with that subtle family resemblance that is quite independent of feature and colouring  where was esme selwyn cast his eyes furtively over the assembled guests while the minister read the marriage ceremony he recognized several of the graham girls but he did not see esme although tom st clair stout and florid and prosperouslooking was standing on a chair in a faraway corner peering over the heads of the women  after the turmoil of handshakings and congratulations selwyn fled to the cool still outdoors where the rosy glow of chinese lanterns mingled with the waves of moonshine to make fairyland and there he met her as she came out of the house by a side door a tall slender woman in some glistening clinging garment with white flowers shining like stars in the coils of her brown hair in the soft glow she looked even more beautiful than in the days of her girlhood and selwyns heart throbbed dangerously at sight of her  esme he said involuntarily  she started and he had an idea that she changed colour although it was too dim to be sure selwyn she exclaimed putting out her hands why selwyn grant is it really you or are you such stuff as dreams are made of i did not know you were here i did not know you were home  he caught her hands and held them tightly drawing her a little closer to him forgetting that she was tom st clairs wife remembering only that she was the woman to whom he had given all his love and lifes devotion to the entire beggaring of his heart  i reached home only four hours ago and was haled straightway here to leos wedding im dizzy esme i cant adjust my old conceptions to this new state of affairs all at once it seems ridiculous to think that leo and alice are married im sure they cant be really grown up  esme laughed as she drew away her hands we are all ten years older she said lightly  not you you are more beautiful than ever esme that sunflower compliment is permissible in an old friend isnt it  this mellow glow is kinder to me than sunlight now i am thirty you know selwyn  and i have some grey hairs he confessed i knew i had them but i had a sneaking hope that other folks didnt until leo destroyed it today these young brothers and sisters who wont stay children are nuisances youll be telling me next thing that baby is grown up  baby is eighteen and has a beau laughed esme and i give you fair warning that she insists on being called laura now do you want to come for a walk with medown under the beeches to the old lane gate i came out to see if the fresh air would do my bit of a headache good i shall have to help with the supper later on  they went slowly across the lawn and turned into a dim moonlight lane beyond their old favourite ramble selwyn felt like a man in a dream a pleasant dream from which he dreads to awaken the voices and laughter echoing out from the house died away behind them and the great silence of the night fell about them as they came to the old gate beyond which was a range of shining moonlightmisted fields  for a little while neither of them spoke the woman looked out across the white spaces and the man watched the glimmering curve of her neck and the soft darkness of her rich hair how virginal how sacred she looked the thought of tom st clair was a sacrilege  its nice to see you again selwyn said esme frankly at last there are so few of our old set left and so many of the babies grown up sometimes i dont know my own world it has changed so its an uncomfortable feeling you give me a pleasant sensation of really belonging here id be lonesome tonight if i dared im going to miss alice so much there will be only mother and baby and i left now our family circle has dwindled woefully  mother and baby and you selwyn felt his head whirling again why where is tom  he felt that it was an idiotic question but it slipped from his tongue before he could catch it esme turned her head and looked at him wonderingly he knew that in the sunlight her eyes were as mistily blue as early meadow violets but here they looked dark and unfathomably tender  tom she said perplexedly do you mean tom st clair he is here of course he and his wife didnt you see her that pretty woman in pale pink lil meredith why you used to know lil didnt you one of the uxbridge merediths  to the day of his death selwyn grant will firmly believe that if he had not clutched fast hold of the top bar of the gate he would have tumbled down on the moss under the beeches in speechless astonishment all the surprises of that surprising evening were as nothing to this he had a swift conviction that there were no words in the english language that could fully express his feelings and that it would be a waste of time to try to find any therefore he laid hold of the first baldly commonplace ones that came handy and said tamely i thought you were married to tom  youthoughtiwasmarriedtotom repeated esme slowly and have you thought that all these years selwyn grant  yes i have is it any wonder you were engaged to tom when i went away jenny told me you were and a year later bertha wrote me a letter in which she made some reference to toms marriage she didnt say to whom but hadnt i the right to suppose it was to you  oh the word was partly a sigh and partly a little cry of longconcealed longdenied pain its been all a funny misunderstanding tom and i were engaged oncea boyandgirl affair in the beginning then we both found out that we had made a mistakethat what we had thought was love was merely the affection of good comrades we broke our engagement shortly before you went away all the older girls knew it was broken but i suppose nobody mentioned the matter to jen she was such a child we never thought about her and youve thought i was toms wife all this time itsfunny  funny you mean tragic look here esme im not going to risk any more misunderstanding theres nothing for it but plain talk when matters get to such a state as this i love youand ive loved you ever since i met you i went away because i could not stay here and see you married to another man ive stayed away for the same reason esme is it too late did you ever care anything for me  yes i did she said slowly  do you care still he asked  she hid her face against his shoulder yes she whispered  then well go back to the house and be married he said joyfully  esme broke away and stared at him married  yes married weve wasted ten years and were not going to waste another minute were not i say  selwyn its impossible  i have expurgated that word from my dictionary its the very simplest thing when you look at it in an unprejudiced way here is a readymade wedding and decorations and assembled guests a minister on the spot and a state where no licence is required you have a very pretty new dress on and you love me i have a plain gold ring on my little finger that will fit you arent all the conditions fulfilled where is the sense of waiting and having another family upheaval in a few weeks time  i understand why you have made such a success of the law said esme but  there are no buts come with me esme im going to hunt up your mother and mine and talk to them  half an hour later an astonishing whisper went circulating among the guests before they could grasp its significance tom st clair and jens husband broadly smiling were hustling scattered folk into the parlour again and making clear a passage in the hall the minister came in with his blue book and then selwyn grant and esme graham walked in hand in hand  when the second ceremony was over mr grant shook his sons hand vigorously theres no need to wish you happiness son youve got it and youve made one fuss and bother do for both weddings thats what i call genius andthis in a careful whisper while esme was temporarily obliterated in mrs grants capacious embraceshes got the right sort of a nose but your mother is a grand woman son a grand woman     at the bay shore farm   the newburys were agog with excitement over the governors picnic as they talked it over on the verandah at sunset they felt that life could not be worth living to those unfortunate people who had not been invited to it not that there were many of the latter in claymont for it was the governors native village and the claymonters were getting up the picnic for him during his political visit to the city fifteen miles away  each of the newburys had a special reason for wishing to attend the governors picnic ralph and elliott wanted to see the governor himself he was a pet hero of theirs had he not once been a claymont lad just like themselves had he not risen to the highest office in the state by dint of sheer hard work and persistency had he not won a national reputation by his prompt and decisive measures during the big strike at campden and was he not a man personally and politically whom any boy might be proud to imitate yes to all of these questions hence to the newbury boys the interest of the picnic centred in the governor  i shall feel two inches taller just to get a look at him said ralph enthusiastically  he isnt much to look at said frances rather patronizingly i saw him once at campdenhe came to the school when his daughter was graduated he is bald and fat oh of course he is famous and all that but i want to go to the picnic to see sara beaumont shes to be there with the chandlers from campden and mary spearman who knows her by sight is going to point her out to me i suppose it would be too much to expect to be introduced to her i shall probably have to content myself with just looking at her  ralph resented hearing the governor called bald and fat somehow it seemed as if his hero were being reduced to the level of common clay  thats like a girl he said loftily thinking more about a woman who writes books than about a man like the governor  id rather see sara beaumont than forty governors retorted frances why shes famousand her books are perfect if i could ever hope to write anything like them its been the dream of my life just to see her ever since i read the story of idlewild and now to think that it is to be fulfilled it seems too good to be true that tomorrowtomorrow newburysi shall see sara beaumont  well said cecilia gentlycecilia was always gentle even in her enthusiasmi shall like to see the governor and sara beaumont too but im going to the picnic more for the sake of seeing nan harris than anything else its three years since she went away you know and ive never had another chum whom i love so dearly im just looking forward to meeting her and talking over all our dear good old times i do wonder if she has changed much but i am sure i shall know her  by her red hair and her freckles questioned elliott teasingly theyll be the same as ever ill be bound  cecilia flushed and looked as angry as she couldwhich isnt saying much after all she didnt mind when elliott teased her about her pug nose and her big mouth but it always hurt her when he made fun of nan  nans family had once lived across the street from the newburys nan and cecilia had been playmates all through childhood but when both girls were fourteen the harrises had moved out west cecilia had never seen nan since but now the latter had come east for a visit and was with her relatives in campden she was to be at the picnic and cecilias cup of delight brimmed over  mrs newbury came briskly into the middle of their sunset plans she had been down to the post office and she carried an open letter in her hand  mother said frances straightening up anxiously you have a pitying expression on your face which of us is it forspeak outdont keep us in suspense has mary spearman told you that sara beaumont isnt going to be at the picnic  or that the governor isnt going to be there  or that nan harris isnt coming  or that somethings happened to put off the affair altogether cried ralph and cecilia and elliott all at once  mrs newbury laughed no its none of those things and i dont know just whom i do pity but it is one of you girls this is a letter from grandmother newbury tomorrow is her birthday and she wants either frances or cecilia to go out to ashland on the early morning train and spend the day at the bay shore farm  there was silence on the verandah of the newburys for the space of ten seconds then frances burst out with mother you know neither of us can go tomorrow if it were any other day but the day of the picnic  im sorry but one of you must go said mrs newbury firmly your father said so when i called at the store to show him the letter grandmother newbury would be very much hurt and displeased if her invitation were disregardedyou know that but we leave it to yourselves to decide which one shall go  dont do that implored frances miserably pick one of us yourselfpull strawsanything to shorten the agony  no you must settle it for yourselves said mrs newbury but in spite of herself she looked at cecilia cecilia was apt to be looked at someway when things were to be given up mostly it was cecilia who gave them up the family had come to expect it of her they all said that cecilia was very unselfish  cecilia knew that her mother looked at her but did not turn her face she couldnt just then she looked away out over the hills and tried to swallow something that came up in her throat  glad im not a girl said ralph when mrs newbury had gone into the house whew nothing could induce me to give up that picnicnot if a dozen grandmother newburys were offended wheres your sparkle gone now fran  its too bad of grandmother newbury declared frances angrily  oh fran she didnt know about the picnic said ceciliabut still without turning round  well she neednt always be so annoyed if we dont go when we are invited another day would do just as well said frances shortly something in her voice sounded choked too she rose and walked to the other end of the verandah where she stood and scowled down the road ralph and elliott feeling uncomfortable went away  the verandah was very still for a little while the sun had quite set and it was growing dark when frances came back to the steps  well what are you going to do about it she said shortly which of us is to go to the bay shore  i suppose i had better go said cecilia slowlyvery slowly indeed  frances kicked her slippered toe against the fern jardinière  you may see nan harris somewhere else before she goes back she said consolingly  yes i may said cecilia she knew quite well that she would not nan would return to campden on the special train and she was going back west in three days  it was hard to give the picnic up but cecilia was used to giving things up nobody ever expected frances to give things up she was so brilliant and popular that the good things of life came her way naturally it never seemed to matter so much about quiet cecilia                                       cecilia cried herself to sleep that night she felt that it was horribly selfish of her to do so but she couldnt help it she awoke in the morning with a confused idea that it was very late why hadnt mary called her as she had been told to do  through the open door between her room and francess she could see that the latters bed was empty then she saw a little note addressed to her pinned on the pillow      dear saint cecilia it ran when you read this i shall be on     the train to ashland to spend the day with grandmother     newbury youve been giving up things so often and so long     that i suppose you think you have a monopoly of it but you     see you havent i didnt tell you this last night because i     hadnt quite made up my mind but after you went upstairs i     fought it out to a finish and came to a decision sara     beaumont would keep but nan harris wouldnt so you must go     to the picnic i told mary to call me instead of you this     morning and now im off you neednt spoil your fun pitying     me now that the wrench is over i feel a most delightful glow     of virtuous satisfaction                                               fran  if by running after frances cecilia could have brought her back cecilia would have run but a glance at her watch told her that frances must already be halfway to ashland so she could only accept the situation  well anyway she thought ill get mary to point sara beaumont out to me and ill store up a description of her in my mind to tell fran tonight i must remember to take notice of the colour of her eyes fran has always been exercised about that  it was midforenoon when frances arrived at ashland station grandmother newburys man hiram was waiting for her with the pony carriage and frances heartily enjoyed the threemile drive to the bay shore farm  grandmother newbury came to the door to meet her granddaughter she was a tall handsome old lady with piercing black eyes and thick white hair there was no savour of the traditional grandmother of caps and knitting about her she was like a stately old princess and much as her grandchildren admired her they were decidedly in awe of her  so it is frances she said bending her head graciously that frances might kiss her still rosy cheek i expected it would be cecilia i heard after i had written you that there was to be a gubernatorial picnic in claymont today so i was quite sure it would be cecilia why isnt it cecilia  frances flushed a little there was a meaning tone in grandmother newburys voice  cecilia was very anxious to go to the picnic today to see an old friend of hers she answered she was willing to come here but you know grandmother that cecilia is always willing to do the things somebody else ought to do so i decided i would stand on my rights as miss newbury for once and come to the bay shore  grandmother newbury smiled she understood frances had always been her favourite granddaughter but she had never been blind clearsighted old lady that she was to the little leaven of easygoing selfishness in the girls nature she was pleased to see that frances had conquered it this time  im glad it is you who have comeprincipally because you are cleverer than cecilia she said brusquely or at least you are the better talker and i want a clever girl and a good talker to help me entertain a guest today shes clever herself and she likes young girls she is a particular friend of your uncle roberts family down south and that is why i have asked her to spend a few days with me youll like her  here grandmother newbury led frances into the sittingroom  mrs kennedy this is my granddaughter frances newbury i told you about her and her ambitions last night you see frances we have talked you over  mrs kennedy was a much younger woman than grandmother newbury she was certainly no more than fifty and in spite of her grey hair looked almost girlish so bright were her dark eyes so clearcut and fresh her delicate face and so smart her general appearance frances although not given to sudden likings took one for mrs kennedy she thought she had never seen so charming a face  she found herself enjoying the day immensely in fact she forgot the governors picnic and sara beaumont altogether mrs kennedy proved to be a delightful companion she had travelled extensively and was an excellent raconteur she had seen much of men and women and crystallized her experiences into sparkling little sentences and epigrams which made frances feel as if she were listening to one of the witty people in clever books but under all her sparkling wit there was a strongly felt undercurrent of true womanly sympathy and kindheartedness which won affection as speedily as her brilliance won admiration frances listened and laughed and enjoyed once she found time to think that she would have missed a great deal if she had not come to bay shore farm that day surely talking to a woman like mrs kennedy was better than looking at sara beaumont from a distance  ive been rewarded in the most approved storybook style she thought with amusement  in the afternoon grandmother newbury packed mrs kennedy and frances off for a walk  the old woman wants to have her regular nap she told them frances take mrs kennedy to the fern walk and show her the famous newbury bubble among the rocks i want to be rid of you both until teatime  frances and mrs kennedy went to the fern walk and the beautiful bubblea clear round spring of amberhued water set down in a cup of rock overhung with ferns and beeches it was a spot frances had always loved she found herself talking freely to mrs kennedy of her hopes and plans the older woman drew the girl out with tactful sympathy until she found that francess dearest ambition was some day to be a writer of books like sara beaumont  not that i expect ever to write books like hers she said hurriedly and i know it must be a long while before i can write anything worth while at all but do you thinkif i try hard and work hardthat i might do something in this line some day  i think so said mrs kennedy smiling if as you say you are willing to work hard and study hard there will be a great deal of both and many disappointments sara beaumont herself had a hard time at firstand for a very long first too her family was poor you know and sara earned enough money to send away her first manuscripts by making a pot of jelly for a neighbour the manuscripts came back and sara made more jelly and wrote more stories still they came back once she thought she had better give up writing stories and stick to the jelly alone there did seem some little demand for the one and none at all for the other but she determined to keep on until she either succeeded or proved to her own satisfaction that she could make better jelly than stories and you see she did succeed but it means perseverance and patience and much hard work prepare yourself for that frances and one day you will win your place then you will look back to the newbury bubble and you will tell me what a good prophetess i was  they talked longeran earnest helpful talk that went far to inspire francess hazy ambition with a definite purpose she understood that she must not write merely to win fame for herself or even for the higher motive of pure pleasure in her work she must aim however humbly to help her readers to higher planes of thought and endeavour then and only then would it be worth while  mrs kennedy is going to drive you to the station said grandmother newbury after tea i am much obliged to you frances for giving up the picnic today and coming to the bay shore to gratify an old womans inconvenient whim but i shall not burden you with too much gratitude for i think you have enjoyed yourself  indeed i have said frances heartily then she added with a laugh i think i would feel much more meritorious if it had not been so pleasant it has robbed me of all the selfsacrificing complacency i felt this morning you see i wanted to go to that picnic to see sara beaumont and i felt quite like a martyr at giving it up  grandmother newburys eyes twinkled you would have been beautifully disappointed had you gone sara beaumont was not there mrs kennedy i see you havent told our secret frances my dear let me introduce you two over again this lady is mrs sara beaumont kennedy the writer of the story of idlewild and all those other books you so much admire                                       the newburys were sitting on the verandah at dusk too tired and too happy to talk ralph and elliott had seen the governor more than that they had been introduced to him and he had shaken hands with them both and told them that their father and he had been chums when just their size and cecilia had spent a whole day with nan harris who had not changed at all except to grow taller but there was one little cloud on her content  i wanted to see sara beaumont to tell frances about her but i couldnt get a glimpse of her i dont even know if she was there  there comes fran up the station road now said ralph my eyes hasnt she a step  frances came smiling over the lawn and up the steps  so you are all home safe she said gaily i hope you feasted your eyes on your beloved governor boys i can tell that cecilia forgathered with nan by the beatific look on her face  oh fran it was lovely cried cecilia but i felt so sorrywhy didnt you let me go to ashland it was too bad you missed itand sara beaumont  sara beaumont was at the bay shore farm said frances ill tell you all about it when i get my breathive been breathless ever since grandmother newbury told me of it theres only one drawback to my supreme blissthe remembrance of how complacently selfsacrificing i felt this morning it humiliates me wholesomely to remember it     elizabeths child   the ingelows of ingelow grange were not a marrying family only one of them elizabeth had married and perhaps it was her poor match that discouraged the others at any rate ellen and charlotte and george ingelow at the grange were single and so was paul down at greenwood farm  it was seventeen years since elizabeth had married james sheldon in the face of the most decided opposition on the part of her family sheldon was a handsome shiftless neerdowell without any violent bad habits but also without any backbone as the ingelows declared there is sometimes hope of a man who is actively bad charlotte ingelow had said sententiously but who ever heard of reforming a jellyfish  elizabeth and her husband had gone west and settled on a prairie farm in manitoba she had never been home since perhaps her pride kept her away for she had the ingelow share of that and she soon discovered that her familys estimate of james sheldon had been the true one there was no active resentment on either side and once in a long while letters were exchanged still ever since her marriage elizabeth had been practically an outsider and an alien as the years came and went the ingelows at home remembered only at long intervals that they had a sister on the western prairies  one of these remembrances came to charlotte ingelow on a spring afternoon when the great orchards about the grange were pink and white with apple and cherry blossoms and over every hill and field was a delicate flowerstarred green a soft breeze was blowing loose petals from the august sweeting through the open door of the wide hall when charlotte came through it ellen and george were standing on the steps outside  this kind of a day always makes me think of elizabeth said charlotte dreamily it was in appleblossom time she went away the ingelows always spoke of elizabeths going away never of her marrying  seventeen years ago said ellen why elizabeths oldest child must be quite a young woman now ii a sudden idea swept over and left her a little breathless i would really like to see her  then why dont you write and ask her to come east and visit us asked george who did not often speak but who always spoke to some purpose when he did  ellen and charlotte looked at each other i would like to see elizabeths child repeated ellen firmly  do you think she would come asked charlotte you know when james sheldon died five years ago we wrote to elizabeth and asked her to come home and live with us and she seemed almost resentful in the letter she wrote back ive never said so before but ive often thought it  yes she did said ellen who had often thought so too but never said so  elizabeth was always very independent remarked george perhaps she thought your letter savoured of charity or pity no ingelow would endure that  at any rate you know she refused to come even for a visit she said she could not leave the farm she may refuse to let her child come  it wont do any harm to ask her said george  in the end charlotte wrote to elizabeth and asked her to let her daughter visit the old homestead the letter was written and mailed in much perplexity and distrust when once the glow of momentary enthusiasm in the new idea had passed  what if elizabeths child is like her father queried charlotte in a halfwhisper  let us hope she wont be cried ellen fervently indeed she felt that a feminine edition of james sheldon would be more than she could endure  she may not like us or our ways sighed charlotte we dont know how she has been brought up she will seem like a stranger after all i really long to see elizabeths child but i cant help fearing we have done a rash thing ellen  perhaps she may not come suggested ellen wondering whether she hoped it or feared it  but worth sheldon did come elizabeth wrote back a prompt acceptance with no trace of the proud bitterness that had permeated her answer to the former invitation the ingelows at the grange were thrown into a flutter when the letter came in another week elizabeths child would be with them  if only she isnt like her father said charlotte with foreboding as she aired and swept the southeast spare room for their expected guest they had three spare rooms at the grange but the aunts had selected the southeast one for their niece because it was done in white and white seems the most appropriate for a young girl ellen said as she arranged a pitcher of wild roses on the table  i think everything is ready announced charlotte i put the very finest sheets on the bed they smell deliciously of lavender and we had very good luck doing up the muslin curtains it is pleasant to be expecting a guest isnt it ellen i have often thought although i have never said so before that our lives were too selfcentred we seemed to have no interests outside of ourselves even elizabeth has been really nothing to us you know she seemed to have become a stranger i hope her child will be the means of bringing us nearer together again  if she has james sheldons round face and big blue eyes and curly yellow hair i shall never really like her no matter how ingelowish she may be inside said ellen decidedly  when worth sheldon came each of her aunts drew a long breath of relief worth was not in the least like her father in appearance neither did she resemble her mother who had been a sprightly blackhaired and blackeyed girl worth was tall and straight with a long braid of thick wavy brown hair large levelgazing grey eyes a square jaw and an excellent chin with a dimple in it  she is the very image of mothers sister aunt alice who died so long ago said charlotte you dont remember her ellen but i do very well she was the sweetest woman that ever drew breath she was pauls favourite aunt too charlotte added with a sigh pauls antagonistic attitude was the only drawback to the joy of this meeting how delightful it would have been if he had not refused to be there too to welcome elizabeths child  worth came to hearts prepared to love her but they must have loved her in any case in a day aunt charlotte and aunt ellen and shy quiet uncle george had yielded wholly to her charm she was girlishly bright and merry frankly delighted with the old homestead and the quaint oldfashioned daintily kept rooms yet there was no suggestion of gush about her she did not go into raptures but her pleasure shone out in eyes and tones there was so much to tell and ask and remember the first day that it was not until the second morning after her arrival that worth asked the question her aunts had been dreading she asked it out in the orchard in the emerald gloom of a long arcade of stout old trees that grandfather ingelow had planted fifty years ago  aunt charlotte when is uncle paul coming up to see me i long to see him mother has talked so much to me about him she was his favourite sister wasnt she  charlotte and ellen looked at each other ellen nodded slyly it would be better to tell worth the whole truth at once she would certainly find it out soon  i do not think my dear said aunt charlotte quietly that your uncle paul will be up to see you at all  why not asked worth her serious grey eyes looking straight into aunt charlottes troubled dark ones aunt charlotte understood that elizabeth had never told worth anything about her familys resentment of her marriage it was not a pleasant thing to have to explain it all to elizabeths child but it must be done  i think my dear she said gently that i will have to tell you a little bit of our family history that may not be very pleasant to hear or tell perhaps you dont know that when your mother married wewedid not exactly approve of her marriage perhaps we were mistaken at any rate it was wrong and foolish to let it come between us and her as we have done but that is how it was none of us approved as i have said but none of us was so bitter as your uncle paul your mother was his favourite sister and he was very deeply attached to her she was only a year younger than he when he bought the greenwood farm she went and kept house for him for three years before her marriage when she married paul was terribly angry he was always a strange man very determined and unyielding he said he would never forgive her and he never has he has never married and he has lived so long alone at greenwood with only deaf old mrs bree to keep house for him that he has grown odder than ever one of us wanted to go and keep house for him but he would not let us andi must tell you this although i hate tohe was very angry when he heard we had invited you to visit us and he said he would not come near the grange as long as you were here oh you cant realize how bitter and obstinate he is we pleaded with him but i think that only made him worse we have felt so bad over it your aunt ellen and your uncle george and i but we can do nothing at all  worth had listened gravely the story was all new to her but she had long thought there must be a something at the root of her mothers indifferent relations with her old home and friends when aunt charlotte flushed and halftearful finished speaking a little glimmer of fun came into worths grey eyes and her dimple was very pronounced as she said  then if uncle paul will not come to see me i must go to see him  my dear cried both her aunts together in dismay aunt ellen got her breath first  oh my dear child you must not think of such a thing she cried nervously it would never do he wouldi dont know what he would doorder you off the premises or say something dreadful no no wait perhaps he will come after allwe will see you must have patience  worth shook her head and the smile in her eyes deepened  i dont think he will come she said mother has told me something about the ingelow stubbornness she says i have it in full measure but i like to call it determination it sounds so much better no the mountain will not come to mohammed so mohammed will go to the mountain i think i will walk down to greenwood this afternoon there dear aunties dont look so troubled uncle paul wont run at me with a pitchfork will he he cant do worse than order me off his premises as you say  aunt charlotte shook her head she understood that no argument would turn the girl from her purpose if she had the ingelow will so she said nothing more in the afternoon worth set out for greenwood a mile away  oh what will paul say exclaimed the aunts with dismal forebodings  worth met her uncle paul at the garden gate he was standing there when she came up the slope of the long lane a tall massive figure of a man with deepset black eyes a long prematurely white beard and a hooked nose handsome and stubborn enough paul ingelow looked it was not without reason that his neighbours called him the oddest ingelow of them all  behind him was a fine old farmhouse in beautiful grounds worth felt almost as much interested in greenwood as in the grange it had been her mothers home for three years and elizabeth ingelow had loved it and talked much to her daughter of it  paul ingelow did not move or speak although he probably guessed who his visitor was worth held out her hand how do you do uncle paul she said  paul ignored the outstretched hand who are you he asked gruffly  i am worth sheldon your sister elizabeths daughter she answered wont you shake hands with me uncle paul  i have no sister elizabeth he answered unbendingly  worth folded her hands on the gatepost and met his frowning gaze unshrinkingly oh yes you have she said calmly you cant do away with natural ties by simply ignoring them uncle paul they go on existing i never knew until this morning that you were at enmity with my mother she never told me but she has talked a great deal of you to me she has told me often how much you and she loved each other and how good you always were to her she sent her love to you  years ago i had a sister elizabeth said paul ingelow harshly i loved her very tenderly but she married against my will a shiftless scamp who  worth lifted her hand slightly he was my father uncle paul and he was always kind to me whatever his faults may have been i cannot listen to a word against him  you shouldnt have come here then he said but he said it less harshly there was even a certain reluctant approval of this composed independent niece in his eyes didnt they tell you at the grange that i didnt want to see you  yes they told me this morning but i wanted to see you so i came why cannot we be friends uncle paul not because we are uncle and niece but simply because you are you and i am i let us leave my father and mother out of the question and start fair on our own account  for a moment uncle paul looked at her she met his gaze frankly and firmly with a merry smile lurking in her eyes then he threw back his head and laughed a hearty laugh that was good to hear very well he said it is a bargain  he put his hand over the gate and shook hers then he opened the gate and invited her into the house worth stayed to tea and uncle paul showed her all over greenwood  you are to come here as often as you like he told her when a young lady and i make a compact of friendship i am going to live up to it but you are not to talk to me about your mother remember we are friends because i am i and you are you and there is no question of anybody else  the grange ingelows were amazed to see paul bringing worth home in his buggy that evening when worth had gone into the house charlotte told him that she was glad to see that he had relented towards elizabeths child  i have not he made stern answer i dont know whom you mean by elizabeths child that young woman and i have taken a liking for each other which we mean to cultivate on our own account dont call her elizabeths child to me again  as the days and weeks went by worth grew dearer and dearer to the grange folk the aunts often wondered to themselves how they had existed before worth came and oftener yet how they could do without her when the time came for her to go home meanwhile the odd friendship between her and uncle paul deepened and grew they read and drove and walked together worth spent half her time at greenwood once uncle paul said to her as if speaking half to himself  to think that james sheldon could have a daughter like you  up went worths head worths grey eyes flashed i thought we were not to speak of my parents she said you ought not to have been the first to break the compact uncle paul  i accept the rebuke and beg your pardon he said he liked her all the better for those little flashes of spirit across her girlish composure  one day in september they were together in the garden at greenwood worth looking lovingly and regretfully down the sunflecked avenue of box said with a sigh next month i must go home how sorry i shall be to leave the grange and greenwood i have had such a delightful summer and i have learned to love all the old nooks and corners as well as if i had lived here all my life  stay here said uncle paul abruptly stay here with me i want you worth let greenwood be your home henceforth and adopt your crusty old bachelor uncle for a father  oh uncle paul cried worth i dont knowi dont thinkoh you surprise me  i surprise myself perhaps but i mean it worth i am a rich lonely old man and i want to keep this new interest you have brought into my life stay with me i will try to give you a very happy life my child and all i have shall be yours  seeing her troubled face he added there i dont ask you to decide right here i suppose you have other claims to adjust take time to think it over  thank you said worth she went back to the grange as one in a dream and shut herself up in the white southeast room to think she knew that she wanted to accept this unexpected offer of uncle pauls worths loyal tongue had never betrayed even to the loving aunts any discontent in the prairie farm life that had always been hers but it had been a hard life for the girl narrow and povertybounded she longed to put forth her hand and take this other life which opened so temptingly before her she knew too that her mother ambitious for her child would not be likely to interpose any objections she had only to go to uncle paul and all that she longed for would be given her together with the faithful protecting fatherly love and care that in all its strength and sweetness had never been hers  she must decide for herself not even of aunt charlotte or aunt ellen could she ask advice she knew they would entreat her to accept and she needed no such incentive to her own wishes far on into the night worth sat at the whitecurtained dormer window looking at the stars over the apple trees and fighting her battle between inclination and duty it was a hard and stubbornly contested battle but with that square chin and those unfaltering grey eyes it could end in only one way next day worth went down to greenwood  well what is it to be said uncle paul without preface as he met her in the garden  i cannot come uncle paul said worth steadily i cannot give up my mother  i dont ask you to give her up he said gruffly you can write to her and visit her i dont want to come between parent and child  that isnt the point exactly uncle paul i hope you will not be angry with me for not accepting your offer i wanted toyou dont know how much i wanted tobut i cannot mother and i are so much to each other uncle paul more i am sure than even most mothers and daughters you have never let me speak of her but i must tell you this mother has often told me that when i came to her things were going very hard with her and that i was heavens own gift to comfort and encourage her then in the ten years that followed the three other babies that came to her all died before they were two years old and with each loss mother said i grew dearer to her dont you see uncle paul im not merely just one child to her but im all those children six years ago the twins were born and they are dear bright little lads but they are very small yet so mother has really nobody but me i know she would consent to let me stay here because she would think it best for me but it wouldnt be really best for me it couldnt be best for a girl to do what wasnt right i love you uncle paul and i love greenwood and i want to stay so much but i cannot i have thought it all over and i must go back to mother  uncle paul did not say one word he turned his back on worth and walked the full length of the box alley twice worth watched him wistfully was he very angry would he forgive her  you are an ingelow worth he said when he came back that was all but worth understood that her decision was not to cause any estrangement between them  a month later worths last day at the grange came she was to leave for the west the next morning they were all out in grandfather ingelows arcade uncle george and aunt charlotte and aunt ellen and worth enjoying the ripe mellow sunshine of the october day when paul ingelow came up the slope worth went to meet him with outstretched hands he took them both in his and looked at her very gravely  i have not come to say goodbye worth i will not say it you are coming back to me  worth shook her brown head sadly oh i cannot uncle paul you knowi told you  yes i know he interrupted i have been thinking it all over every day since you know yourself what the ingelow determination is its a good thing in a good cause but a bad thing in a bad one and it is no easy thing to conquer when youve let it rule you for years as i have done but i have conquered it or you have conquered it for me child here is a letter it is to your mothermy sister elizabeth in it i have asked her to forgive me and to forget our long estrangement i have asked her to come back to me with you and her boys i want you allallat greenwood and i will do the best i can for you all  oh uncle paul cried worth her face aglow and quivering with smiles and tears and sunshine  do you think she will forgive me and come  i know she will cried worth i know how she has longed for you and home oh i am so happy uncle paul  he smiled at her and put his arm over her shoulder together they walked up the golden arcade to tell the others that night charlotte and ellen cried with happiness as they talked it over in the twilight  how beautiful murmured charlotte softly we shall not lose worth after all ellen i could not have borne it to see that girl go utterly out of our lives again  i always hoped and believed that elizabeths child would somehow bring us all together again said ellen happily     fredas adopted grave   north point where freda lived was the bleakest settlement in the world even its inhabitants who loved it had to admit that the northeast winds swept whistling up the bay and blew rawly over the long hill that sloped down to it blighting everything that was in their way only the sturdy firs and spruces could hold their own against it so there were no orchards or groves or flower gardens in north point  just over the hill in a sheltered southwest valley was the north point church with the graveyard behind it and this graveyard was the most beautiful spot in north point or near it the north point folk loved flowers they could not have them about their homes so they had them in their graveyard it was a matter of pride with each family to keep the separate plot neatly trimmed and weeded and adorned with beautiful blossoms  it was one of the unwritten laws of the little community that on some selected day in may everybody would repair to the graveyard to plant trim and clip it was not an unpleasant duty even to those whose sorrow was fresh it seemed as if they were still doing something for the friends who had gone when they made their earthly resting places beautiful  as for the children they looked forward to graveyard day as a very delightful anniversary and it divided its spring honours with the amount of the herring catch  tomorrow is graveyard day said minnie hutchinson at school recess when all the little girls were sitting on the fence aint i glad ive got the loveliest big white rosebush to plant by grandma hutchinsons grave uncle robert sent it out from town  my mother has ten tuberoses to set out said nan gray proudly  were going to plant a row of lilies right around our plot said katie morris  every little girl had some boast to make that is every little girl but freda freda sat in a corner all by herself and felt miserably outside of everything she had no part or lot in graveyard day  are you going to plant anything freda asked nan with a wink at the others  freda shook her head mutely  freda cant plant anything said winnie bell cruelly although she did not mean to be cruel she hasnt got a grave  just then freda felt as if her gravelessness were a positive disgrace and crime as if not to have an interest in a single grave in north point cemetery branded you as an outcast forever and ever it very nearly did in north point the other little girls pitied freda but at the same time they rather looked down upon her for it with the complacency of those who had been born into a good heritage of family graves and had an undisputed right to celebrate graveyard day  freda felt that her cup of wretchedness was full she sat miserably on the fence while the other girls ran off to play and she walked home alone at night it seemed to her that she could not bear it any longer  freda was ten years old four years ago mrs wilson had taken her from the orphan asylum in town mrs wilson lived just this side of the hill from the graveyard and everybody in north point called her a crank they pitied any child she took they said it would be worked to death and treated like a slave at first they tried to pump freda concerning mrs wilsons treatment of her but freda was not to be pumped she was a quiet little mite with big wistful dark eyes that had a disconcerting fashion of looking the gossips out of countenance but if freda had been disposed to complain the north point people would have found out that they had been only too correct in their predictions  mrs wilson freda said timidly that night why havent we got a grave  mrs wilson averred that such a question gave her the creeps  you ought to be very thankful that we havent she said severely that graveyard day is a heathenish custom anyhow they make a regular picnic of it and it makes me sick to hear those school girls chattering about what they mean to plant each one trying to outblow the other if i had a grave there i wouldnt make a flower garden of it  freda did not go to the graveyard the next day although it was a holiday but in the evening when everybody had gone home she crept over the hill and through the beech grove to see what had been done the plots were all very neat and prettily set out with plants and bulbs some perennials were already in bud the grave of katie morris greatuncle who had been dead for forty years was covered with blossoming purple pansies every grave no matter how small or old had its share of promiseevery grave except one freda came across it with a feeling of surprise it was away down in the lower corner where there were no plots it was shut off from the others by a growth of young poplars and was sunken and overgrown with blueberry shrubs there was no headstone and it looked dismally neglected freda felt a sympathy for it she had no grave and this grave had nobody to tend it or care for it  when she went home she asked mrs wilson whose it was  humph said mrs wilson if you have so much spare time lying round loose youd better put it into your sewing instead of prowling about graveyards do you expect me to work my fingers to the bone making clothes for you i wish id left you in the asylum that grave is jordan slades i suppose he died twenty years ago and a worthless drunken scamp he was he served a term in the penitentiary for breaking into andrew messerveys store and after it he had the face to come back to north point but respectable people would have nothing to do with him and he went to the dogs altogetherhad to be buried on charity when he died he hasnt any relations here there was a sister a little girl of ten who used to live with the cogswells over at east point after jord died some rich folks saw her and was so struck with her good looks that they took her away with them i dont know what become of her and i dont care go and bring the cows up  when freda went to bed that night her mind was made up she would adopt jordan slades grave  thereafter freda spent her few precious sparetime moments in the graveyard she clipped the blueberry shrubs and long tangled grasses from the grave with a pair of rusty old shears that blistered her little brown hands badly she brought ferns from the woods to plant about it she begged a root of heliotrope from nan gray a clump of day lilies from katie morris a rosebush slip from nellie bell some pansy seed from old mrs bennett and a geranium shoot from minnie hutchinsons big sister she planted weeded and watered faithfully and her efforts were rewarded her grave soon looked as nice as any in the graveyard  nobody but freda knew about it the poplar growth concealed the corner from sight and everybody had quite forgotten poor disreputable jordan slades grave at least it seemed as if everybody had but one evening when freda slipped down to the graveyard with a little can of water and rounded the corner of the poplars she saw a lady standing by the gravea strange lady dressed in black with the loveliest face freda had ever seen and tears in her eyes  the lady gave a little start when she saw freda with her can of water  can you tell me who has been looking after this grave she said  itit was i faltered freda wondering if the lady would be angry with her pleasm it was i but i didnt mean any harm all the other little girls had a grave and i hadnt any so i just adopted this one  did you know whose it was asked the lady gently  yesmjordan slades mrs wilson told me  jordan slade was my brother said the lady he went sadly astray but he was not all bad he was weak and too easily influenced but whatever his faults he was good and kindoh so good and kindto me when i was a child i loved him with all my heart it has always been my wish to come back and visit his grave but i have never been able to come my home has been so far away i expected to find it neglected i cannot tell you how pleased and touched i am to find it kept so beautifully thank you over and over again my dear child  then youre not cross maam said freda eagerly and i may go on looking after it may i oh it just seems as if i couldnt bear not to  you may look after it as long as you want to my dear i will help you too i am to be at east point all summer this will be our graveyours and mine  that summer was a wonderful one for freda she had found a firm friend in mrs halliday the latter was a wealthy woman her husband had died a short time previously and she had no children when she went away in the fall freda went with her to be her own little girl for always mrs wilson consented grudgingly to give freda up although she grumbled a great deal about ingratitude  before they went they paid a farewell visit to their grave mrs halliday had arranged with some of the north point people to keep it well attended to but freda cried at leaving it  dont feel badly about it dear comforted mrs halliday we are coming back every summer to see it it will always be our grave  freda slipped her hand into mrs hallidays and smiled up at her  id never have found you aunty if it hadnt been for this grave she said happily im so glad i adopted it     how don was saved   will barrie went whistling down the lane of the locksley farm took a short cut over a field of clover aftermath and through a sloping orchard where the trees were laden with apples and emerged into the farmhouse yard where curtis locksley was sitting on a pile of logs idly whittling at a stick  you look as if you had a corner in time curt said will i call that luck for i want you to go chestnutting up to griers hill with me i met old tom grier on the road yesterday and he told me i might go any day nice old man tom grier  good said curtis heartily as he sprang up if i havent exactly a corner in time i have a day off at least uncle doesnt need me today wait till i whistle for don may as well take him with us  curtis whistled accordingly but don his handsome newfoundland dog did not appear after calling and whistling about the yard and barns for several minutes curtis turned away disappointedly  he cant be anywhere around it is very strange don never used to go away from home without me but lately he has been missing several times and twice last week he wasnt here in the morning and didnt turn up until midday  id keep him shut up until i broke him of the habit of playing truant if i were you said will as they turned into the lane  don hates to be shut up howls all the time so mournfully that i cant stand it responded curtis  well said will hesitatingly maybe that would be better after all than letting him stray away with other dogs who may teach him bad habits i saw don myself one evening last week ambling down the harbour road with that big brown dog of sam ventnors ventnors dog is beginning to have a bad reputation you know there have been several sheep worried lately and  don wouldnt touch a sheep interrupted curtis hotly  i daresay not not yet but ventnors dog is under suspicion and if don runs with him hell learn the trick sure as preaching the farmers are growling a good bit already and if they hear of don and ventnors dog going about in company theyll put it on them both better keep don shut up awhile let him howl as he likes  i believe i will said curtis soberly i dont want don to fall under suspicion of sheepworrying though im sure he would never do it anyhow i dont want him to run with ventnors dog ill chain him up in the barn when i go home i couldnt stand it if anything happened to don after you hes the only chum ive gotand hes a good one  will agreed he was almost as fond of don as curtis was but he did not feel so sure that the dog would not worry a sheep will knew that don was suspected already but he did not like to tell curtis so and of course there was as yet no positive proofmerely mutterings and suggestions among the bayside farmers who had lost sheep and were anxious to locate their slayer there were many other dogs in bayside and the surrounding districts who were just as likely to be the guilty animals and will hoped that if don were shut up for a time suspicion might be averted from him especially if the worryings still went on  he had felt a little doubtful about hinting the truth to curtis who was a highspirited lad and always resented any slur cast upon don much more bitterly than if it were meant for himself but he knew that curtis would take it better from him than from the other bayside boys one or the other of whom would be sure soon to cast something up to curtis about his dog will felt decidedly relieved to find that curtis took his advice in the spirit in which it was offered  who have lost sheep lately queried curtis as they left the main road and struck into a wood path through the ranks of beeches on tom griers land  nearly everybody on the hollow farms answered will until last week nobody on the hill farms had lost any but tuesday night old paul stockton had six fine sheep killed in his upland pasture behind the fir woods he is furious about it i believe and vows hell find out what dog did it and have him shot  curtis looked grave paul stocktons farm was only about a quarter of a mile from the locksley homestead and he knew that paul had an old family grudge against his uncle arnold which included his nephew and all belonging to him moreover curtis remembered with a sinking heart that wednesday morning had been one of the mornings upon which don was missing  but i dont care he thought miserably i know don didnt kill those sheep  talking of old paul said will who thought it advisable to turn the conversation reminds me that they are getting anxious at the harbour about george finleys schooner the amy reade she was due three days ago and theres no sign of her yet and there have been two bad gales since she left morro oscar stockton is on board of her you know and his father is worried about him there are five other men on her all from the harbour and their folks down there are pretty wild about the schooner  nothing more was said about the sheep and soon in the pleasures of chestnutting curtis forgot his anxiety old tom grier had called to the boys as they passed his house to come back and have dinner there when the time came this they did and it was late in the afternoon when curtis with his bag of chestnuts over his shoulder walked into the locksley yard  his uncle was standing before the open barn doors talking to an elderly grizzled man with a thin shrewd face  curtiss heart sank as he recognized old paul stockton what could have brought him over  curtis called his uncle come here  as curtis crossed the yard don came bounding down the slope from the house to meet him he put his hand on the dogs big head and the two of them walked slowly to the barn old paul included them both in a vindictive scowl  curtis said his uncle gravely heres a bad business mr stockton tells me that your dog has been worrying his sheep  its a began curtis angrily then he checked himself and went on more calmly  that cant be so mr stockton my dog would not harm anything  he killed or helped to kill six of the finest sheep in my flock retorted old paul  what proof have you of it demanded curtis trying to keep his anger within bounds  abner peck saw your dog and ventnors running together through my sheep pasture at sundown on tuesday evening answered old paul wednesday morning i found this in the corner of the pasture where the sheep were worried your uncle admits that it was tied around your dogs neck on tuesday  and old paul held out triumphantly a faded red ribbon curtis recognized it at a glance it was the ribbon his little cousin lena had tied around dons neck tuesday afternoon he remembered how they had laughed at the effect of that frivolous red collar and bow on dons massive body  im sure don isnt guilty he cried passionately  mr locksley shook his head  im afraid he is curtis the case looks very black against him and sheepstealing is a serious offence  the dog must be shot said old paul decidedly i leave the matter in your hands mr locksley ive got enough proof to convict the dog and if you dont have him killed ill make you pay for the sheep he worried  as old paul strode away curtis looked beseechingly at his uncle  don mustnt be shot uncle he said desperately ill chain him up all the time  and have him howling night and day as if we had a brood of banshees about the place said mr locksley sarcastically he was a stern man with little sentiment in his nature and no understanding whatever of curtiss affection for don the bayside people said that arnold locksley had always been very severe with his nephew no no curtis you must look at the matter sensibly the dog is a nuisance and must be shot you cant keep him shut up forever and if he has once learned the trick of sheepworrying he will never forget it you can get another dog if you must have one ill get charles pippey to come and shoot don tomorrow no sulking now curtis you are too big a boy for that tie the dog up for the night and then go and put the calves in there is a storm coming the wind is blowing hard from the northeast now  his uncle walked away leaving the boy white and miserable in the yard he looked at don who sat on his haunches and returned his gaze frankly and openheartedly he did not look like a guilty dog could it be possible that he had really worried those sheep  ill never believe it of you old fellow curtis said as he led the dog into a corner of the carriage house and tied him up there then he flung himself down on a pile of sacks beside him and buried his face in dons curly black fur the boy felt sullen rebellious and wretched  he lay there until dark thinking his own bitter thoughts and listening to the rapidly increasing gale finally he got up and flung off after the calves with dons melancholy howls at finding himself deserted ringing in his ears  hell be quiet enough tomorrow night thought curtis wretchedly as he went upstairs to bed after housing the calves for a long while he lay awake but finally dropped into a heavy slumber which lasted until his aunt called him for milking  the wind was blowing more furiously than ever up over the fields came the roar and crash of the surges on the outside shore the harbour to the east of bayside was rough and stormy  they were just rising from breakfast when will barrie burst into the kitchen  the amy reade is ashore on gleesons rocks he shouted struck there at daylight this morning come on curt  curtis sprang for his cap his uncle following suit more deliberately as the two boys ran through the yard curtis heard don howling  ill take him with me he muttered wait a minute will  the harbour road was thronged with people hurrying to the outside shore for the news of the amy readers disaster had spread rapidly as the boys with the rejoicing don at their heels pelted along sam morrow overtook them in a cart and told them to jump in sam had already been down to the shore and had gone back to tell his father as they jolted along he screamed information at them over the shriek of the gale  bad business this shes pounding on a reef bout a quarter of a mile out theyre sure shes going to break upold tub you knowleakyrotten the seas tremenjus high and the surfs going dean over her there cant be no boat launched for hours yettheyll all be drowned old pauls down there like a madmanoffering everything hes got to the man wholl save oscar but it cant be done  by this time they had reached the shore which was black with excited people out on gleesons reef the illfated little schooner was visible amid the flying spray a grizzled old harbour fisherman to whom sam shouted a question shook his head  no cant do nothin no boat cd live in that surf fr a moment the schoonerll go to pieces mighty soon im feared its turrible turrible to stan by an watch yer neighbours drown like this  curtis and will elbowed their way down to the waters edge the relatives of the crew were all there in various stages of despair but old paul stockton seemed like a man demented he ran up and down the beach crying and praying his only son was on the amy reade and he could do nothing to save him  what are they doing asked will of martin clark  trying to get a line ashore by throwing out a small rope with a stick tied to it answered martin its young stockton thats trying now but it isnt any use the crosscurrents on that reef are too powerful  why don will bring that line ashore exclaimed curtis here don don i say  the dog bounded back along the shore with a quick bark curtis grasped him by the collar and pointed to the stick which young stockton had just hurled again into the water don with another bark of comprehension dashed into the sea the onlookers grasping the situation gave a cheer and then relapsed into silence only the shriek of the gale and the crash of the waves could be heard as they watched the magnificent dog swimming out through the breakers his big black head now rising on the crest of a wave and now disappearing in the hollow behind it when don finally reached the tossing stick grasped it in his mouth and turned shoreward another great shout went up from the beach a woman behind curtis whose husband was on the schooner dropped on her knees on the pebbles sobbing and thanking god curtis himself felt the stinging tears start to his eyes  when don reached the shore he dropped the stick at curtiss feet and gave himself a tremendous shake curtis caught at the stick while a dozen men and women threw themselves bodily on don hugging him and kissing his wet fur like distracted creatures old paul stockton was among them over his shoulder dons big black head looked up his eyes asking as plainly as speech what all this fuss was about  meanwhile some of the men had already pulled a big hawser ashore and made it fast in half an hour the crew of the amy reade were safe on shore chilled and dripping before they were hurried away to warmth and shelter old paul stockton caught curtiss hand the tears were running freely down his hard old face  tell your uncle he is not to lay a finger on that dog he said he never killed a sheep of minehe couldnt and if he did i dont care hes welcome to kill them all if nothing but muttonll serve his turn  curtis walked home with a glad heart mr locksley heard old pauls message with a smile he too had been touched by dons splendid feat  well curtis im very glad that it has turned old paul in his favour but we must shut don up for a week or so no matter how hard he takes it you can see that for yourself after all he might have worried the sheep and anyway he must be broken of his intimacy with ventnors dog  curtis acknowledged the justice of this and poor don was tied up again his captivity was not long however for ventnors dog was soon shot when don was released curtis had an anxious time for a week or two but no more sheep were worried and dons innocence was triumphantly established as for old paul stockton it seemed as if he could not do enough for curtis and don his ancient grudge against the locksleys was completely forgotten and from that date he was a firm friend of curtis in regard to don old paul would say  why there never was such a dog before sir never he just talks with his eyes that dog does and if youd just a seen him swimming out to that schooner bones yes sir every time that dog comes here hes to get the best bones weve got for himand moren bones too that dogs a hero sir thats what he is     miss madelines proposal   auntie i have something to tell you said lina with a blush that made her look more than ever like one of the climbing roses that nodded about the windows of the old churchill place as it was always called in lower wentworth  miss madeline sitting in the low rocker by the parlour window seemed like the presiding genius of the place everything about her matched her sweet oldfashionedness from the crown of her soft brown hair dressed in the style of her long ago girlhood to the toes of her daintily slippered feet outside of the old churchill place in the busy streets of the uptodate little town miss madeline might have seemed out of harmony with her surroundings but here in this dim room faintly scented with whiffs from the rose garden outside she was like a note in some sweet perfect melody of old time  lina sitting on a little stool at miss madelines feet with her curly head in her aunts lap was as pretty as miss madeline herself had once been she was also very happy and her happiness seemed to envelop her as in an atmosphere and lend her a new radiance and charm miss madeline loved her pretty niece very dearly and patted the curly head tenderly with her slender white hands  what is it my dear  imim engaged whispered lina hiding her face in miss madelines flowered muslin lap  engaged miss madelines tone was one of surprise and awe she blushed as she said the word as deeply as lina had done then she went on with a little quiver of excitement in her voice to whom my dear  oh you dont know him auntie but i hope you will soon his name is ralph wylde isnt it pretty i met him last winter and we became very good friends but we had a quarrel before i came down here and oh i have been so unhappy over it three weeks ago he wrote me and begged my pardonso nice of him because i was really all to blame you know and he said he loved me andall that you know  no i dont know said miss madeline gently butbuti can imagine  oh i was so happy i wrote back and i had this letter from him today he is coming down tomorrow youll be glad to see him wont you auntie  oh yes my dear and i am glad for your sakevery glad you are sure you love him  yes indeed said lina with a little laugh as if wondering how anyone could doubt it  presently miss madeline said in a shy voice lina diddid you ever receive a proposal of marriage from anybody besides mr wylde  lina laughed roguishly why yes auntie ever so many a dozen at least  oh my dear cried miss madeline in a slightly shocked tone  but i did really sometimes it was horrid and sometimes it was funny it all depended on the man dear me how red and uncomfortable most of them lookedall but the fifth he was so cool and business like that he almost surprised me into accepting him  andand what did you feel like lina  oh frightened mostlybut i always wanted to laugh too you must know how it is yourself auntie what did you feel like when somebody proposed to you  miss madeline flushed from chin to brow  oh lina she faltered as if she were confessing something very disgraceful yet to which she was impelled by her strict truthfulness iinever had a proposal in my lifenot one  lina opened her big brown eyes in amazement why aunt madeline and you so pretty what was the reason  ive often wondered said miss madeline faintly i was pretty as you sayits so long ago i can say that now and i had many gentlemen friends but nobody ever wanted to marry me i sometimes wish thatthat i could have had just one proposal not that i wanted to marry you know i do not mean that but just so that it wouldnt have seemed that i was different from anybody else it is very foolish of me to wish it i know and even wickedfor if i had not cared for the person it would have made him very unhappy but then he would have forgotten and i would have remembered it would always have been something to be a little proud of  yes said lina absently her thoughts had gone back to ralph  that evening a letter was left at the front door of the old churchill place it was addressed in a scholarly hand to miss madeline churchill and amelia kent took it in amelia had been miss madelines help for years and had grown grey in her service in amelias loyal eyes miss madeline was still young and beautiful she never doubted that the letter was for her mistress nobody else there was ever addressed as miss madeline  miss madeline was sitting by the window of her own room watching the sunset through the elms and reading her evening portion of thomas à kempis she never liked to be disturbed when so employed but she read her letter after amelia had gone out  when she came to a certain paragraph she turned very pale and thomas à kempis fell to the floor unheeded when she had finished the letter she laid it on her lap clasped her hands and said oh oh oh in a faint tremulous voice her cheeks were very pink and her eyes very bright she did not even pick up thomas à kempis but went to the door and called lina  what is it auntie asked lina curiously noticing the signs of unusual excitement about miss madeline  miss madeline held out her letter with a trembling hand  lina dear this is a letter from the rev cecil thorne itit isa proposal of marriage i feel terribly upset how very strange that it should come so soon after our talk this morning i want you to read it perhaps i ought not to show it to anyonebut i would like you to see it  lina took the letter and read it through it was unmistakably a proposal of marriage and was moreover a very charming epistle of its kind albeit a little stiff and oldfashioned  how funny said lina when she came to the end  funny exclaimed miss madeline with a trace of indignation in her gentle voice  oh i didnt mean that the letter was funny lina hastened to explain only that as you said it is odd to think of it coming so soon after our talk  but this was a little fib on linas part she had thought that the letter or rather the fact that it had been written to miss madeline funny the rev cecil thorne was miss madelines pastor he was a handsome scholarly man of middle age and lina had seen a good deal of him during her summer in lower wentworth she had taught the infant class in sunday school and sometimes she had thought that the minister was in love with her but she must have been mistaken she reflected it must have been her aunt after all and the rev cecil thornes shyly displayed interest in her must have been purely professional  what a goose i was to be afraid he was in love with me she thought aloud she said he says he will call tomorrow evening to receive your answer  and oh what can i say to him murmured miss madeline in dismay she wished she had a little of linas experience  you are going toyou will accept him wont you asked lina curiously  oh my dear no cried miss madeline almost vehemently i couldnt think of such a thing i am very sorry do you think he will feel badly  judging from his letter i feel sure he will said lina decidedly  miss madeline sighed oh dear me it is very unpleasant but of course i must refuse him what a beautiful letter he writes too i feel very much disturbed by this  miss madeline picked up thomas à kempis smoothed him out repentantly and placed the letter between his leaves                                       when the rev cecil thorne called at the old churchill place next evening at sunset and asked for miss madeline churchill amelia showed him into the parlour and went to call her mistress mr thorne sat down by the window that looked out on the lawn his heart gave a bound as he caught a glimpse of an airy white muslin among the trees and a ripple of distant laughter the next minute lina appeared strolling down the secluded path that curved about the birches a young man was walking beside her with his arm around her they crossed the green square before the house and disappeared in the rose garden  mr thorne leaned back in his chair and put his hand over his eyes he felt that he had received his answer and it was a very bitter moment for him he had hardly dared hope that this bright beautiful child could care for him yet the realization came home to him none the less keenly when miss madeline paling and flushing by turns came shyly in he had recovered his selfcontrol sufficiently to be able to say good evening in a calm voice  miss madeline sat down opposite to him at that moment she was devoutly thankful that she had never had any other proposal to refuse it was a dreadful ordeal if he would only help her out but he did not speak and every moment of silence made it worse  ireceived your letter mr thorne she faltered at last looking distressfully down at the floor  my letter mr thorne turned towards her in her agitation miss madeline did not notice the surprise in his face and tone  yes she said gaining a little courage since the ice was broken ititwas a very great surprise to me i never thought youyou cared for me asas you said and i am very sorry becausebecause i cannot return your affection and so of course i cannot marry you  mr thorne put his hand over his eyes again he understood now that there had been some mistake and that miss madeline had received the letter he had written to her niece well it did not matterthe appearance of the young man in the garden had settled that would he tell miss madeline of her mistake no it would only humiliate her and it made no difference since she had refused him  i suppose it is of no use to ask you to reconsider your decision he said  oh no cried miss madeline almost aghast she was afraid he might ask it after all not in the least use i am sorryso very sorrybut i could not answer differently wei hopethis will make no difference in our friendly relations mr thorne  not at all said mr thorne gravely we will try to forget that it has happened  he bowed sadly and went out miss madeline watched him guiltily as he walked across the lawn he looked heartbroken how dreadful it had been and lina had refused twelve men how could she have lived through it  perhaps one gets accustomed to doing it reflected miss madeline but i am sure i never could  did mr thorne feel very badly whispered lina that night  im afraid he did confessed miss madeline sorrowfully he looked so pale and sad lina that my heart ached for him i am very thankful that i have never had any other proposals to decline it is a very unpleasant experience but she added with a little tinge of satisfaction in her sweet voice i am glad i had one itit has made me feel more like other people you know dear     miss sallys company   how beautiful said mary seymour delightedly as they dismounted from their wheels on the crest of the hill ida who could have supposed that such a view would be our reward for climbing that long tedious hill with its ruts and stones dont you feel repaid  yes but i am dreadfully thirsty said ida who was always practical and never as enthusiastic over anything as mary was yet she too felt a keen pleasure in the beauty of the scene before them almost at their feet lay the sea creaming and shimmering in the mellow sunshine beyond on either hand stretched rugged brown cliffs and rocks here running out to sea in misty purple headlands there curving into bays and coves that seemed filled up with sunlight and glamour and pearly hazes a beautiful shore and seemingly a lonely one the only house visible from where the girls stood was a tiny grey one with odd low eaves and big chimneys that stood down in the little valley on their right where the cliffs broke away to let a brook run out to sea and formed a small cove on whose sandy shore the waves lapped and crooned within a stones throw of the house on either side of the cove a headland made out to sea curving around to enclose the sparkling water as in a cup  what a picturesque spot said mary  but what a lonely one protested ida why there isnt another house in sight i wonder who lives in it anyway im going down to ask them for a drink of water  id like to ask for a square meal too said mary laughing i am discovering that i am hungry fine scenery is very satisfying to the soul to be sure but it doesnt still the cravings of the inner girl and weve wheeled ten miles this afternoon im getting hungrier every minute  they reached the little grey house by way of a sloping grassy lane everything about it was very neat and trim in front a whitewashed paling shut in the garden which sheltered as it was by the house was ablaze with poppies and hollyhocks and geraniums a path bordered by big white clam shells led through it to the front door whose steps were slabs of smooth red sandstone from the beach  no children here certainly whispered ida every one of those clam shells is placed just so and this walk is swept every day no we shall never dare to ask for anything to eat here they would be afraid of our scattering crumbs  ida lifted her hand to knock but before she could do so the door was thrown open and a breathless little lady appeared on the threshold  she was very small with an eager delicately featured face and dark eyes twinkling behind goldrimmed glasses she was dressed immaculately in an oldfashioned gown of grey silk with a white muslin fichu crossed over her shoulders and her silvery hair fell on each side of her face in long smooth curls that just touched her shoulders and bobbed and fluttered with her every motion behind it was caught up in a knot on her head and surmounted by a tiny lace cap  she looks as if she had just stepped out of a bandbox of last century thought mary  are you cousin abners girls demanded the little lady eagerly there was such excitement and expectation in her face and voice that both the seymour girls felt uncomfortably that they ought to be cousin abners girls  no said mary reluctantly were not we are onlymartin seymours girls  all the light went out of the little ladys face as if some illuminating lamp had suddenly been quenched behind it she seemed fairly to droop under her disappointment as for the rest the name of martin seymour evidently conveyed no especial meaning to her ears how could she know that he was a multimillionaire who was popularly supposed to breakfast on railroads and lunch on small corporations and that his daughters were girls whom all people delighted to honour  no of course you are not cousin abners girls she said sorrowfully id have known you couldnt be if i had just stopped to think because you are dark and they would be fair of course cousin abner and his wife were both fair but when i saw you coming down the lanei was peeking through the hall window upstairs you know i and julianai was sure you were helen and beatrice at last and i cant help wishing you were  i wish we were too since you expected them said mary smiling but  oh i wasnt really expecting them broke in the little lady only i am always hoping that they will come they never have yet but trenton isnt so very far away and it is so lonely here i just long for companyi and julianaand i thought i was going to have it today cousin abner came to see me once since i moved here and he said the girls would come too but that was six months ago and they havent come yet but perhaps they will soon it is always something to look forward to you know  she talked in a sweet chirpy voice like a birds there were pathetic notes in it too as the girls instinctively felt how very quaint and sweet and unworldly she was mary found herself feeling indignant at cousin abners girls whoever they were for their neglect  we are out for a spin on our wheels said ida and we are very thirsty we thought perhaps you would be kind enough to give us a drink of water  oh my dear anythinganything i have is at your service said the little lady delightedly if you will come in i will get you some lemonade  i am afraid it is too much trouble began mary  oh no no cried the little lady it is a pleasure i love doing things for people i wish more of them would come to give me the chance i never have any company and i do so long for it its very lonesome here at golden gate oh if you would only stay to tea with me it would make me so happy i am all prepared i prepare every saturday morning in particular so that if cousin abners girls did come i would be all ready and when nobody comes juliana and i have to eat everything up ourselves and that is bad for usit gives juliana indigestion if you would only stay  we will agreed ida promptly and were glad of the chance we are both terribly hungry and it is very good of you to ask us  oh indeed it isnt its just selfishness in me thats what it is pure selfishness i want company so much come in my dears and i suppose i must introduce myself because you dont know me do you now im miss sally temple and this is golden gate cottage dear me this is something like living you are special providences that you are indeed  she whisked them through a quaint little parlour where everything was as dainty and neat and oldfashioned as herself and into a spare bedroom beyond it to put off their hats  now just excuse me a minute while i run out and tell juliana that we are going to have company to tea she will be so glad juliana will make yourselves at home my dears  isnt she delicious said mary when miss sally had tripped out id like to shake cousin abners girls this is what dot halliday would call an adventure ida  isnt it miss sally and this quaint old spot both seem like a chapter out of the novels our grandmothers cried over look here mary she is lonely and our visit seems like a treat to her let us try to make it one lets just chum with her and tell her all about ourselves and our amusements and our dresses that sounds frivolous but you know what i mean shell like it lets be company in real earnest for her  when miss sally came back she was attended by juliana carrying a tray of lemonade glasses juliana proved to be a diminutive lass of about fourteen whose cheerful freckled face wore an expansive grin of pleasure evidently juliana was as fond of company as her mistress was afterwards the girls overheard a subdued colloquy between miss sally and juliana out in the hall  go set the table juliana and put on grandmother temples wedding chinabe sure you dust it carefullyand the best tableclothand be sure you get the crease straightand put some sweet peas in the centreand be sure they are fresh i want everything extra nice juliana  yesm miss sally ill see to it isnt it great to have company miss sally whispered juliana  the seymour girls long remembered that tea table and the delicacies with which it was heaped privately they did not wonder that juliana had indigestion when she had to eat many such unaided being hungry they did full justice to miss sallys good things much to that little ladys delight  she told them all about herself she had lived at golden gate cottage only a year  before that i lived away down the country at millbridge with a cousin my uncle ephraim owned golden gate cottage and when he died he left it to me and i came here to live it is a pretty place isnt it you see those two headlands out there in the morning when the sun rises the water between them is just a sea of gold and that is why uncle ephraim had a fancy to call his place golden gate i love it here it is so nice to have a home of my own i would be quite content if i had more company but i have you today and perhaps beatrice and helen will come next week so ive really a great deal to be thankful for  what is your cousin abners other name asked mary with a vague recollection of hearing of beatrice and helensomebodyin trenton  reedabner abimelech reed answered miss sally promptly aa reed he signs himself now he is very welltodo i am told and he carries on business in town he was a very fine young man my cousin abner i dont know his wife  mary and ida exchanged glances beatrice and helen reed they knew them slightly as the daughters of a newrich family who were hangerson of the fashionable society in trenton they were regarded as decidedly vulgar and so far their efforts to gain an entry into the exclusive circle where the seymours and their like revolved had not been very successful  im afraid miss sally will wait a long while before she sees cousin abners girls said mary when they had gone back to the parlour and miss sally had excused herself to superintend the washing of grandmother temples wedding china they probably look on her as a poor relation to be ignored altogether whereas if they were only like her trenton society would have made a place for them long ago  the seymour girls enjoyed that visit as much as miss sally did she was eager to hear all about their girlish lives and amusements they told her of their travels of famous men and women they had seen of parties they had attended the dresses they wore the little fads and hobbies of their setall jumbled up together and all listened to eagerly by miss sally and also by juliana who was permitted to sit on the stairs out in the hall and so gather in the crumbs of this intellectual feast  oh youve been such pleasant company said miss sally when the girls went away  mary took the little ladys hands in hers and looked affectionately down into her face  would you like ityou and julianaif we came out to see you often and perhaps brought some of our friends with us  oh if you only would breathed miss sally  mary laughed and obeying a sudden impulse bent and kissed miss sallys cheek  well come then she promised please look upon us as your steady company henceforth  the girls kept their word thereafter nearly every saturday of the summer found them taking tea with miss sally at golden gate sometimes they came alone sometimes they brought other girls it soon became a decided fad in their set to go to see miss sally everybody who met her loved her at sight it was considered a special treat to be taken by the seymours to golden gate  as for miss sally her cup of happiness was almost full she had company to her hearts content and of the very kind she lovedbright merry funloving girls who devoured her dainties with a frank zest that delighted her filled the quaint old rooms with laughter and life and chattered to her of all their plans and frolics and hopes there was just one little cloud on miss sallys fair sky  if only cousin abners girls would come she once said wistfully to mary nobody can quite take the place of ones own you know my heart yearns after them  mary was very silent and thoughtful as she drove back to trenton that night two days afterwards she went to mrs gardiners lawn party the reed girls were there they were tall fair handsome girls somewhat too lavishly and pronouncedly dressed in expensive gowns and hats and looking as they felt very much on the outside of things they brightened and bridled however when mrs gardiner brought mary seymour up and introduced her if there was one thing on earth that the reed girls longed for more than another it was to get in with the seymour girls  after mary had chatted with them for a few minutes in a friendly way she said i think we have a mutual friend in miss sally temple of golden gate havent we im sure ive heard her speak of you  the reed girls flushed they did not care to have the rich seymour girls know of their connection with that queer old cousin of their fathers who lived in that outoftheworld spot upcountry  she is a distant cousin of ours said beatrice carelessly but weve never met her  oh how much you have missed said mary frankly she is the sweetest and most charming little lady i have ever met and i am proud to number her among my friends golden gate is such an idyllic little spot too we go there so often that i fear miss sally will think we mean to outwear our welcome we hope to have her visit us in town this winter well goodby for now ill tell miss sally ive met you she will be pleased to hear about you  when mary had gone the reed girls looked at each other  i suppose we ought to have gone to see cousin sally before said beatrice father said we ought to  how on earth did the seymours pick her up said helen of course we must go and see her  go they did the very next day miss sallys cup of happiness brimmed right over for cousin abners girls came to golden gate at last they were very nice to her too indeed in spite of a good deal of snobbishness and false views of life they were goodhearted girls under it all and some plain common sense they had inherited from their father came to the surface and taught them to see that miss sally was a relative of whom anyone might be proud they succumbed to her charm as the others had done and thoroughly enjoyed their visit to golden gate they went away promising to come often again and i may say right here that they kept their promise and a real friendship grew up between miss sally and cousin abners girls that was destined to work wonders for the latter not only socially and mentally but spiritually as well for it taught them that sincerity and honest kindliness of heart and manner are the best passports everywhere and that pretence of any kind is a vulgarity not to be tolerated this took time of course the reed girls could not discard their snobbishness all at once but in the end it was pretty well taken out of them  miss sally never dreamed of this or the need for it she loved cousin abners girls from the first and always admired them exceedingly  and then it is so good to have your own folks coming as company she told the seymour girls oh im just in the seventh heaven of happiness but dearies i think you will always be my favouritesmine and julianas ive plenty of company now and its all thanks to you  oh no said mary quickly miss sally your company comes to you for just your own sake youve made golden gate a veritable mecca for us all you dont know and you never will know how much good you have done us you are so good and true and sweet that we girls all feel as if we were bound to live up to you dont you see and we all love you miss sally  im so glad breathed miss sally with shining eyes and so is juliana     mrs marchs revenge   i declare it is a real fall day said mrs stapp dropping into a chair with a sigh of relief as mrs march ushered her into the cosy little sittingroom the wind would chill the marrow in your bones winterll be here before you know it  thats so assented mrs march bustling about to stir up the fire but i dont know as i mind it at all winter is real pleasant when it does come but i must say i dont fancy these betwixtandbetween days much sit up to the fire theodosia you look real blue  i feel so too lawful heart but this is comfort this chimneycorner of yours anna is the cosiest spot in the world  when did you get home from maitland asked mrs march did you have a pleasant time and how did you leave emily and the children  mrs stapp took this trio of interrogations in calm detail  i came home saturday she said as she unrolled her knitting nice wet day it was too and as for my visit yes i enjoyed myself pretty well not but what i worried over peters rheumatism a good deal emily is well and the children ought to be for such rampageous young ones i never saw emily cant do no more with them than an old hen with a brood of ducks but lawful heart anna dont mind about my little affairs the news peter had for me about you when i got home fairly took my breath he came down to the garden gate to shout it before i was out of the wagon i couldnt believe but what he was joking at first you should have seen peter he had an old red shawl tied round his rheumatic shoulder and he was waving his arms like a crazy man i declare i thought the chimney was afire theodosia theodosia he shouted anna march has had a fortune left her by her brother in australy and shes bought the old carroll place and is going to move up there that was his salute when i got home id have been over before this to hear all about it but things were at such sixes and sevens in the house that i couldnt go visiting until id straightened them out a bit peters real neat as men go but lawful heart such a mess as he makes of housekeeping i didnt know you had a brother living  no more did i theodosia i thought as everyone else did that poor charles was at the bottom of the sea forty years ago its that long since he ran away from home he had a quarrel with father and he was always dreadful highspirited he went to sea and we heard that he had sailed for england in the helen ray she was never heard of after and we all supposed that my poor brother had perished with her and four weeks ago i got a letter from a firm of lawyers in melbourne australia saying that my brother charles bennett had died and left all his fortune to me i couldnt believe it at first but they sent me some things of his that he had when he left home and there was an old picture of myself among them with my name written on it in my own hand so then i knew there was no mistake but whether charles did sail in the helen ray or if he did how he escaped from her and got to australia i dont know and it isnt likely i ever will  well of all wonderful things commented mrs stapp  i was glad to hear that i was heir to so much money said mrs march firmly at first i felt as if it were awful of me to be glad when it came to me by my brothers death but i mourned for poor charles forty years ago and i cant sense that he has only just died not but what id rather have seen him come home alive than have all the money in the world but it has come about otherwise and as the money is lawfully mine i may as well feel pleased about it  and youve bought the carroll place said mrs stapp with the freedom of a privileged friend whatever made you do it im sure you are as cosy here as need be and nobody but yourself isnt this house big enough for you  no it isnt all my life ive been hankering for a good big roomy house and all my life ive had to put up with little boxes of places not big enough to turn round in ive been contented and made the best of what i had but now that i can afford it i mean to have a house that will suit me the carroll house is just what i want for all it is a little oldfashioned ive always had a notion of that house although i never expected to own it any more than the moon  its a real handsome place admitted mrs stapp but i expect it will need a lot of fixing up nobody has lived in it for six years when are you going to move in  in about three weeks if all goes well im having it all painted and done over inside the outside can wait until the spring  its queer how things come about said mrs stapp meditatively i guess old mrs carroll never imagined her home was going to pass into other folks hands as it has when you and i were girls and louise carroll was giving herself such airs over us you didnt much expect to ever stand in her shoes did you do you remember lou  yes i do said mrs march sharply a change came over her sonsy smiling face it actually looked hard and revengeful and a cruel light flickered in her dark brown eyes ill not forget lou carroll as long as i live she is the only person in this world i ever hated i suppose it is sinful to say it but i hate her still and always will  i never liked her myself admitted mrs stapp she thought herself above us all well for that matter i suppose she wasbut she neednt have rubbed it in so  well she might have been above me said mrs march bitterly but she wasnt above twitting and snubbing me every chance she got she always had a spite at me from the time we were children together at school when we grew up it was worse i couldnt begin to tell you all the times that girl insulted me but there was once in particularill never forgive her for it i was at a party and she was there too and so was that young trenham manning who was visiting the ashleys do you remember him dosia he was a handsome young fellow and lou had a liking for him so all the girls said but he never looked at her that night and he kept by me the whole time it made lou furious and at last she came up to me with a sneer on her face and her black eyes just snapping and said miss bennett mother told me to tell you to tell your ma that if that plain sewing isnt done by tomorrow night shell send for it and give it to somebody else if people engage to have work done by a certain time and dont keep their word they neednt expect to get it oh how badly i felt mother and i were poor and had to work hard but we had feelings just like other people and to be insulted like that before trenham manning i just burst out crying then and there and ran away and hid it was very silly of me but i couldnt help it that stings me yet if i was ever to get a chance to pay lou carroll out for that id take it without any compunction  oh but that is unchristian protested mrs stapp feebly  perhaps so but its the way i feel old parson jones used to say that people were marbled good and bad pretty even but that in everybody there were one or two streaks just pure wicked i guess lou carroll is my wicked streak i havent seen or heard of her for yearsever since she married that worthless dency baxter and went away she may be dead for all i know i dont expect ever to have a chance to pay her out but mark what i say theodosia if i ever have i will  mrs march snipped off her thread as if she challenged the world mrs stapp felt uncomfortable over the unusual display of feeling she had evoked and hastened to change the subject  in three weeks time mrs march was established in her new home and the old carroll house blossomed out into renewed splendour theodosia stapp who had dropped in to see it was in a rapture of admiration  you have a lovely home now anna i used to think it fine enough in the carrolls time but it wasnt as grand as this and that reminds me i have something to tell you but i dont want you to get as excited as you did the last time i mentioned her name you remember the last day i was to see you we were talking of lou carroll well next day i was downtown in a store and who should sail in but mrs joel kent from oriental you know mrs joelsarah chapple that was she and her man keep a little hotel up at oriental theyre not very well off she is a cousin of old mrs carroll but lawful heart the carrolls didnt used to make much of the relationship well mrs joel and i had a chat she told me all her troublesshe always has lots of them sarah was always of a grumbling turn and she had a brandnew stock of them this time what do you think anna march lou carrollor mrs baxter i suppose i should sayis up there at joel kents at oriental dying of consumption leastwise mrs joel says she is  lou carroll dying at oriental cried mrs march  yes she came there from goodness knows where about a month agomight as well have dropped from the clouds mrs joel says for all she expected of it her husband is dead and i guess he led her a life of it when he was alive and shes as poor as second skimmings she was aiming to come here mrs joel says but when she got to oriental she wasnt fit to stir a step further and the kents had to keep her i gather from what mrs joel said that shes rather touched in her mind too and has an awful hankering to get home hereto this very house she appears to have the idea that it is hers and all just the same as it used to be i guess she is a sight of trouble and mrs joel aint the woman to like that but there she has to work most awful hard and i suppose a sick person doesnt come handy in a hotel i guess youve got your revenge anna without lifting a finger to get it think of lou carroll coming to that  the next day was cold and raw the ragged bare trees in the old carroll grounds shook and writhed in the gusts of wind now and then a drifting scud of rain dashed across the windows mrs march looked out with a shiver and turned thankfully to her own cosy fireside again  presently she thought she heard a low knock at the front door and went to see as she opened it a savage swirl of damp wind rushed in and the shrinking figure leaning against one of the fluted columns of the grecian porch seemed to cower before its fury it was a woman who stood there a woman whose emaciated face wore a piteous expression as she lifted it to mrs march  you dont know me of course she said with a feeble attempt at dignity i am mrs baxter ii used to live here long ago i thought id walk over today and see my old home  a fit of coughing interrupted her words and she trembled like a leaf  gracious me exclaimed mrs march blankly you dont mean to tell me that you have walked over from oriental todayand you a sick woman for pitys sake come in quick and if youre not wet to the skin  she fairly pulled her visitor into the hall and led her to the sittingroom  sit down take this big easychair right up to the fireso let me take your bonnet and shawl i must run right out to tell hannah to get you a hot drink  you are very kind whispered the other i dont know you but you look like a woman i used to know when i was a girl she was a mrs bennett and she had a daughter anna do you know what became of her i forget i forget everything now  my name is march said mrs march briefly ignoring the question i dont suppose you ever heard it before  she wrapped her own warm shawl about the other womans thin shoulders then she hastened to the kitchen and soon returned carrying a tray of food and a steaming hot drink she wheeled a small table up to her visitors side and said very kindly  now take a bite my dear and this raspberry vinegar will warm you right up it is a dreadful day for you to be out why on earth didnt joel kent drive you over  they didnt know i was coming whispered mrs baxter anxiously ii ran away sarah wouldnt have let me come if she had known but i wanted to come so much it is so nice to be home again  mrs march watched her guest as she ate and drank it was plain enough that her mind or rather her memory was affected she did not realize that this was no longer her home at moments she seemed to fancy herself back in the past again once or twice she called mrs march mother  presently a sharp knock was heard at the hall door mrs march excused herself and went out in the porch stood theodosia stapp and a woman whom mrs march did not at first glance recognizea tall aggressivelooking person whose sharp black eyes darted in past mrs march and searched every corner of the hall before anyone had time to speak  lawful heart puffed mrs stapp as she stepped in out of the biting wind im right out of breath mrs march allow me to introduce mrs kent were looking for mrs baxter she has run away and we thought perhaps she came here did she  she is in my sittingroom now said mrs march quietly  didnt i say so demanded mrs kent turning to mrs stapp she spoke in a sharp highpitched tone that grated on mrs marchs nerves doesnt she beat all she slipped away this morning when i was busy in the kitchen and to think of her walking six miles over here in this wind i dunno how she did it i dont believe shes half as sick as she pretends well ive got my wagon out here mrs march and ill be much obliged if youll tell her im here to take her home i spose well have a fearful scene  i dont see that there is any call for a scene said mrs march firmly the poor woman has just got here and she thinks she has got home she might as well think so if it is of any comfort to her youd better leave her here  theodosia gave a stifled gasp of amazement but mrs march went serenely on  ill take care of the poor soul as long as she needs itand that will not be very long in my opinion for if ever i saw death in a womans face it is looking out of hers ive plenty of time to look after her and make her comfortable  mrs joel kent was voluble in her thanks it was evident that she was delighted to get the sick woman off her hands mrs march cut her short with an invitation to stay to tea but mrs kent declined  ive got to hurry home straight off and get the mens suppers such a scamper to have over that woman im sure im thankful youre willing to let her stay for shed never be contented anywhere else ill send over what few things she has tomorrow  when mrs kent had gone mrs march and mrs stapp looked at each other  and so this is your revenge anna march said the latter solemnly do you remember what you said to me about her  yes i do theodosia and i thought i meant every word of it but i guess my wicked streak ran out just when i needed it to depend on besides you see ive thought of lou carroll all these years as she was when i knew herhandsome and saucy and proud but that poor creature in there isnt any more like the lou carroll i knew than you arenot a mite the old lou carroll is dead already and my spite is dead with her will you come in and see her  well no not just now she wouldnt know me and mrs joel says strangers kind of excite hera pretty bad place the hotel would be for her at that rate i should think i must go and tell peter about it and ill send up some of my black currant jam for her  when mrs stapp had gone mrs march went back to her guest lou baxter had fallen asleep with her head pillowed on the soft plush back of her chair mrs march looked at the hollow hectic cheeks and the changed wasted features and her bright brown eyes softened with tears  poor lou she said softly as she brushed a loose lock of grey hair back from the sleeping womans brow     nan   nan was polishing the tumblers at the pantry window outside of which john osborne was leaning among the vines his arms were folded on the sill and his straw hat was pushed back from his flushed eager face as he watched nans deft movements  beyond them old abe stewart was mowing the grass in the orchard with a scythe and casting uneasy glances at the pair old abe did not approve of john osborne as a suitor for nan john was poor and old abe although he was the wealthiest farmer in granville was bent on nans making a good match he looked upon john osborne as a mere fortunehunter and it was a thorn in the flesh to see him talking to nan while he old abe was too far away to hear what they were saying he had a good deal of confidence in nan she was a sensible levelheaded girl still there was no knowing what freak even a sensible girl might take into her head and nan was so determined when she did make up her mind she was his own daughter in that  however old abe need not have worried himself it could not be said that nan was helping john osborne on in his wooing at all instead she was teasing and snubbing him by turns  nan was very pretty moreover nan was well aware of the fact she knew that the way her dark hair curled around her ears and forehead was bewitching that her complexion was the envy of every girl in granville that her long lashes had a trick of drooping over very soft dark eyes in a fashion calculated to turn masculine heads hopelessly john osborne knew all this too to his cost he had called to ask nan to go with him to the lone lake picnic the next day at this request nan dropped her eyes and murmured that she was sorry but he was too lateshe had promised to go with somebody else there was no need of nans making such a mystery about it the somebody else was her only cousin ned bennett who had had a quarrel with his own girl the latter lived at lone lake and ned had coaxed nan to go over with him and try her hand at patching matters up between him and his offended ladylove and nan who was an amiable creature and tenderhearted where anybodys lover except her own was concerned had agreed to go  but john osborne at once jumped to the conclusionas nan had very possibly meant him to dothat the mysterious somebody was bryan lee and the thought was gall and wormwood to him  whom are you going with he asked  that would be telling nan said with maddening indifference  is it bryan lee demanded john  it might be said nan reflectively and then again you know it mightnt  john was silent he was no match for nan when it came to a war of words he scowled moodily at the shining tumblers  nan im going out west he said finally  nan stared at him with her last tumbler poised in midair very much as if he had announced his intention of going to the north pole or equatorial africa  john osborne are you crazy  not quite and im in earnest i can tell you that  nan set the glass down with a decided thud johns curtness displeased her he neednt suppose that it made any difference to her if he took it into his stupid head to go to afghanistan  oh she remarked carelessly well i suppose if youve got the western fever your case is hopeless would it be impertinent to inquire why you are going  theres nothing else for me to do nan said john bryan lee is going to foreclose the mortgage next month and ill have to clear out he says he cant wait any longer ive worked hard enough and done my best to keep the old place but its been uphill work and im beaten at last  nan sat blankly down on the stool by the window her face was a study which john osborne watching old abes movements missed  well i never she gasped john osborne do you mean to tell me that bryan lee is going to do that how did he come to get your mortgage  bought it from old townsend answered john briefly oh hes within his rights ill admit ive even got behind with the interest this past year ill go out west and begin over again  its a burning shame said nan violently  john looked around in time to see two very red spots on her cheeks  you dont care though nan  i dont like to see anyone unjustly treated declared nan and that is what youve been youve never had half a chance and after the way youve slaved too  if lee would wait a little i might do something yet now that aunt alice is gone said john bitterly im not afraid of work but he wont he means to take his spite out at last  nan hesitated  surely bryan isnt so mean as that she stammered perhaps hell change his mind ifif  osborne wheeled about with face aflame  dont you say a word to him about it nan he cried dont you go interceding with him for me ive got some pride left he can take the farm from me and he can take you maybe but he cant take my selfrespect i wont beg him for mercy dont you dare to say a word to him about it  nans eyes flashed she was offended to find her sympathy flung back in her face  dont be alarmed she said tartly i shant bother myself about your concerns ive no doubt youre able to look out for them yourself  osborne turned away as he did so he saw bryan lee driving up the lane perhaps nan saw it too at any rate she leaned out of the window  john john osborne half turned youll be up again soon wont you  his face hardened ill come to say goodbye before i go of course he answered shortly  he came face to face with lee at the gate where the latter was tying his sleek chestnut to a poplar he acknowledged his rivals condescending nod with a scowl lee looked after him with a satisfied smile  poor beggar he muttered he feels pretty cheap i reckon ive spoiled his chances in this quarter old abe doesnt want any povertystricken hangerson about his place and nan wont dream of taking him when she knows he hasnt a roof over his head  he stopped for a chat with old abe old abe approved of bryan lee he was a soninlaw after old abes heart  meanwhile nan had seated herself at the pantry window and was ostentatiously hemming towels in apparent oblivion of suitor no 2 nevertheless when bryan came up she greeted him with an unusually sweet smile and at once plunged into an animated conversation bryan had not come to ask her to go to the picnicbusiness prevented him from going but he meant to find out if she were going with john osborne as nan was serenely impervious to all hints he was finally forced to ask her bluntly if she was going to the picnic  well yes she expected to  oh might he ask with whom  nan didnt know that it was a question of public interest at all  it isnt with that osborne fellow is it demanded bryan incautiously  nan tossed her head well why not she asked  look here nan said lee angrily if youre going to the picnic with john osborne im surprised at you what do you mean by encouraging him so hes as poor as jobs turkey i suppose youve heard that ive been compelled to foreclose the mortgage on his farm  nan kept her temper sweetlya dangerous sign had bryan but known it  yes he was telling me so this morning she answered slowly  oh was he i suppose he gave me my character  no he didnt say very much about it at all he said of course you were within your rights but do you really mean to do it bryan  of course i do said bryan promptly i cant wait any longer for my money and id never get it if i did osborne cant even pay the interest  it isnt because he hasnt worked hard enough then said nan he has just slaved on that place ever since he grew up  well yes he has worked hard in a way but hes kind of shiftless for all thatno manager as you might say some folks would have been clear by now but osborne is one of those men that are bound to get behind he hasnt got any business faculty  he isnt shiftless said nan quickly and it isnt his fault if he has got behind its all because of his care for his aunt he has had to spend more on her doctors bills than would have raised the mortgage and now that she is dead and he might have a chance to pull up you go and foreclose  a man must look out for number one said bryan easily admiring nans downcast eyes and rosy cheeks i havent any spite against osborne but business is business you know  nan opened her lips to say something but remembering osbornes parting injunction she shut them again she shot a scornful glance at lee as he stood with his arms folded on the sill beside her  bryan lingered talking small talk until nan announced that she must see about getting tea  and you wont tell me who is going to take you to the picnic he coaxed  oh its ned bennett said nan indifferently  bryan felt relieved he unpinned the huge cluster of violets on his coat and laid them down on the sill beside her before he went nan flicked them off with her fingers as she watched him cross the lawn his own selfsatisfied smile upon his face                                       a week later the osborne homestead had passed into bryan lees hands and john osborne was staying with his cousin at thornhope pending his departure for the west he had never been to see nan since that last afternoon but bryan lee haunted the stewart place one day he suddenly stopped coming and although nan was discreetly silent in due time it came to old abes ears by various driblets of gossip that nan had refused him  old abe marched straightway home to nan in a fury and demanded if this were true nan curtly admitted that it was old abe was so much taken aback by her coolness that he asked almost meekly what was her reason for doing such a fool trick  because he turned john osborne out of house and home returned nan composedly if he hadnt done that there is no telling what might have happened i might even have married him because i liked him very well and it would have pleased you at any rate i wouldnt have married john when you were against him now i mean to  old abe stormed furiously at this but nan kept so provokingly cool that he was conscious of wasting breath he went off in a rage but nan did not feel particularly anxious now that the announcement was over he would cool down she knew john osborne worried her more she didnt see clearly how she was to marry him unless he asked her and he had studiously avoided her since the foreclosure  but nan did not mean to be baffled or to let her lover slip through her fingers for want of a little courage she was not old abe stewarts daughter for nothing  one day ned bennett dropped in and said that john osborne would start for the west in three days that evening nan went up to her room and dressed herself in the prettiest dress she owned combed her hair around her sparkling face in bewitching curls pinned a cluster of apple blossoms at her belt and thus equipped marched down in the golden sunset light to the mill creek bridge john osborne on his return from thornhope half an hour later found her there leaning over the rail among the willows  nan started in wellassumed surprise and then asked him why he had not been to see her john blushedstammereddidnt knowhad been busy nan cut short his halting excuses by demanding to know if he were really going away and what he intended to do  ill go out on the prairies and take up a claim said osborne sturdily begin life over again free of debt itll be hard work but im not afraid of that i will succeed if it takes me years  they walked on in silence nan came to the conclusion that osborne meant to hold his peace  john she said tremulously wontwont you find it very lonely out there  of coursei expect that i shall have to get used to it  nan grew nervous proposing to a man was really very dreadful  wouldnt it benicer for youshe falteredthat isit wouldnt be so lonely for youwould itifif you had me out there with you  john osborne stopped squarely in the dusty road and looked at her nan he exclaimed  oh if you cant take a hint said nan in despair  it was all of an hour later that a man drove past them as they loitered up the hill road in the twilight it was bryan lee he had taken from osborne his house and land but he had not been able to take nan stewart after all     natty of blue point   natty miller strolled down to the wharf where bliss ford was tying up the cockawee bliss was scowling darkly at the boat a trim new one painted white whose furled sails seemed unaccountably wet and whose glistening interior likewise dripped with moisture a group of fishermen on the wharf were shaking their heads sagely as natty drew near  might as well split her up for kindlings bliss said jake mclaren youll never get men to sail in her it passed the first time seeing as only young johnson was skipper but when a boat turns turtle with captain frank in command theres something serious wrong with her  whats up asked natty  the cockawee upset out in the bay again this morning answered will scott thats the second time the grey gull picked up the men and towed her in its no use trying to sail her lobstermen aint going to risk their lives in a boat like that hows things over at blue point natty  pretty well responded natty laconically natty never wasted words he had not talked a great deal in his fourteen years of life but he was much given to thinking he was rather undersized and insignificant looking but there were a few boys of his own age on the mainland who knew that natty had muscles  has everett heard anything from ottawa about the lighthouse business yet asked will  natty shook his head  think hes any chance of getting the appintment queried adam lewis  not the ghost of a chance said cooper creasy decidedly hes on the wrong side of politics thats what er rather his father was a torys son aint going to get an appintment from a libral government thats what  mr barr says that everett is too young to be trusted in such a responsible position quoted natty gravely  cooper shrugged his shoulders  mebbemebbe eighteen is kind of green but everybody knows that evs been the real lighthouse keeper for two years since your father took sick irving elliott wants that lighthas wanted it for yearsand hes a pretty strong pull at headquarters thats what barr owes him something for years of hard work at elections i aint saying anything against elliott either hes a good man but your fathers son ought to have that light as sure as he wont get it thats what  any of you going to take in the sports tomorrow down at summerside asked will scott in order to switch cooper away from politics which were apt to excite him  im going for one said adam theres to be a yacht race atween the summerside and charlottetown boat clubs yes i am going give you a chance down to the station natty if you want one  natty shook his head  not going he said briefly  you should celebrate victoria day said adam patriotically twentyfourth o mays the queens birthday ef we dont get a holiday well all run away as we used to say at school the good old queen is dead but the days been appinted a national holiday in honour of her memory and you should celebrate it becoming nattyboy  ev and i cant both go and hes going explained natty prue and ill stay home to light up must be getting back now looks squally  i misdoubt if well have queens weather tomorrow said cooper squinting critically at the sky looks like a northeast blow thats what there goes bliss striding off and looking pretty mad the cockawees a dead loss to him thats what nats offhe knows how to handle a boat middling well too pity hes such a puny youngster not much to him i reckon  natty had cast loose in his boat the merry maid and hoisted his sail in a few minutes he was skimming gaily down the bay the wind was fair and piping and the merry maid went like a bird natty at the rudder steered for blue point island a reflective frown on his face he was feeling in no mood for victoria day sports in a very short time he and ev and prue must leave blue point lighthouse where they had lived all their lives to natty it seemed as if the end of all things would come then where would life be worth living away from lonely windy blue point island  david miller had died the preceding winter after a long illness he had been lighthouse keeper at blue point for thirty years his three children had been born and brought up there and there four years ago the mother had died but womanly little prue had taken her place well and the boys were devoted to their sister when their father died everett had applied for the position of lighthouse keeper the matter was not yet publicly decided but old cooper creasy had sized the situation up accurately the millers had no real hope that everett would be appointed  victoria day while not absolutely stormy proved to be rather unpleasant a choppy northeast wind blew up the bay and the water was rough enough the sky was overcast with clouds and the may air was raw and chilly at blue point the millers were early astir for if everett wanted to sail over to the mainland in time to catch the excursion train no morning naps were permissible he was going alone since only one of the boys could go natty had insisted that it should be everett and prue had elected to stay home with natty prue had small heart for victoria day that year she did not feel even a thrill of enthusiasm when natty hoisted a flag and wreathed the queens picture with creeping spruce prue felt as badly about leaving blue point island as the boys did  the day passed slowly in the afternoon the wind fell away to a dead calm but there was still a heavy swell on and shortly before sunset a fog came creeping up from the east and spread over the bay and islands so thick and white that prue and natty could not even see little bear island on the right  im glad everett isnt coming back tonight said prue he could never find his way cross the harbour in that fog  isnt it thick though said natty the light wont show far tonight  at sunset they lighted the great lamps and then settled down to an evening of reading but it was not long before natty looked up from his book to say hello prue what was that thought i heard a noise  so did i said prue i sounded like someone calling  they hurried to the door which looked out on the harbour the night owing to the fog was dark with a darkness that seemed almost tangible from somewhere out of that darkness came a muffled shouting like that of a person in distress  prue theres somebody in trouble out there exclaimed natty  oh its surely never ev cried prue  natty shook his head  dont think so ev had no intention of coming back tonight get that lantern prue i must go and see what and who it is  oh natty you mustnt cried prue in distress theres a heavy swell on yetand the fogoh if you get lost  ill not get lost and i must go prue maybe somebody is drowning out there its not ev of course but suppose it were thats a good girl  prue with set face had brought the lantern resolutely choking back the words of fear and protest that rushed to her lips they hurried down to the shore and natty sprang into the little skiff he used for rowing he hastily lashed the lantern in the stern cast loose the painter and lifted the oars  ill be back as soon as possible he called to prue wait here for me  in a minute the shore was out of sight and natty found himself alone in the black fog with no guide but the cries for help which already were becoming fainter they seemed to come from the direction of little bear and thither natty rowed it was a tough pull and the water was rough enough for the little dory but natty had been at home with the oars from babyhood and his long training and tough sinews stood him in good stead now steadily and intrepidly he rowed along the water grew rougher as he passed out from the shelter of blue point into the channel between the latter and little bear the cries were becoming very faint what if he should be too late he bent to the oars with all his energy presently by the smoother water he knew he must be in the lea of little bear the cries sounded nearer he must already have rowed nearly a mile the next minute he shot around a small headland and right before him dimly visible in the faint light cast by the lantern through the fog was an upturned boat with two men clinging to it one on each side evidently almost exhausted natty rowed cautiously up to the one nearest him knowing that he must be wary lest the grip of the drowning man overturn his own light skiff  let go when i say he shouted and dontgrabanything do you hear dontgrab now let go  the next minute the man lay in the dory dragged over the stern by nettys grip on his collar  lie still ordered natty clutching the oars to row around the overturned boat amid the swirl of water about her was a task that taxed nettys skill and strength to the utmost the other man was dragged in over the bow and with a gasp of relief natty pulled away from the sinking boat once clear of her he could not row for a few minutes he was shaking from head to foot with the reaction from tremendous effort and strain  thisll never do he muttered im not going to be a baby now but will i ever be able to row back  presently however he was able to grip his oars again and pull for the lighthouse whose beacon loomed dimly through the fog like a great blur of whiter mist the men obedient to his orders lay quietly where he had placed them and before long natty was back again at the lighthouse landing where prue was waiting wild with anxiety the men were helped out and assisted up to the lighthouse where natty went to hunt up dry clothes for them and prue flew about to prepare hot drinks  to think that that child saved us exclaimed one of the men why i didnt think a grown man had the strength to do what he did he is your brother i suppose miss miller you have another brother i think  oh yeseverettbut he is away explained prue we heard your shouts and natty insisted on going at once to your rescue  well he came just in time i couldnt have held on another minutewas so done up i couldnt have moved or spoken all the way here even if he hadnt commanded me to keep perfectly still  natty returned at this moment and exclaimed why it is mr barr i didnt recognize you before  barr it is young man this gentleman is my friend mr blackmore we have been celebrating victoria day by a shooting tramp over little bear we hired a boat from ford at the harbour head this morningthe cockawee he called herand sailed over i dont know much about running a boat but blackmore here thinks he does we were at the other side of the island when the fog came up we hurried across it but it was almost dark when we reached our boat we sailed around the point and then the boat just simply upsetdont know why  but i know why interrupted natty indignantly that cockawee does nothing but upset she has turned turtle twice out in the harbour in fine weather ford was a rascal to let her to you he might have known what would happen whywhyit was almost murder to let you go  i thought there must be something queer about her declared mr blackmore i do know how to handle a boat despite my friends gibe and there was no reason why she should have upset like that that ford ought to be horsewhipped  thanks to prues stinging hot decoctions of black currant drink the two gentlemen were no worse for their drenching and exposure and the next morning natty took them to the mainland in the merry maid when he parted with them mr barr shook his hand heartily and said thank you my boy youre a plucky youngster and a skilful one too tell your brother that if i can get the blue point lighthouse berth for him i will and as for yourself you will always find a friend in me and if i can ever do anything for you i will  two weeks later everett received an official document formally appointing him keeper of blue point island light natty carried the news to the mainland where it was joyfully received among the fishermen  only right and fair said cooper creasy blue point without a miller to light up wouldnt seem the thing at all thats what and its nothing but evs doo  guess natty had more to do with it than ev said adam perpetrating a very poor pun and being immensely applauded therefor it keyed will scott up to rival adam  you said that irving had a pull and the millers hadnt he said jocularly but it looks as if twas nattys pull did the business after allhis pull over to bear island and back  it was about a miracle that a boy could do what he did on such a night said charles macey  wheres ford asked natty uncomfortably he hated to have his exploit talked about  ford has cleared out said cooper gone down to summerside to go into tobe meekinss factory there best thing he could do thats what folks here hadnt no use for him after letting that death trap to them two meneven if they was librals the cockawee druv ashore on little bear and there shes going to remain i guess dye want a berth in my mackerel boat this summer natty  i do said natty but i thought you said you were full  i guess i can make room for you said cooper a boy with such grit and muscle aint to be allowed to go to seed on blue point thats what yesser well make room for you  and nattys cup of happiness was full     penelopes party waist   its perfectly horrid to be so poor grumbled penelope penelope did not often grumble but just now as she sat tapping with one pinktipped finger her invitation to blanche andersons party she felt that grumbling was the only relief she had  penelope was seventeen and when one is seventeen and cannot go to a party because one hasnt a suitable dress to wear the world is very apt to seem a howling wilderness  i wish i could think of some way to get you a new waist said doris with what these sisters called the poverty pucker coming in the centre of her pretty forehead if your black skirt were sponged and pressed and rehung it would do very well  penelope saw the poverty pucker and immediately repented with all her impetuous heart having grumbled that pucker came often enough without being brought there by extra worries  well there is no use sitting here sighing for the unattainable she said jumping up briskly id better be putting my grey matter into that algebra instead of wasting it plotting for a party dress that i certainly cant get its a sad thing for a body to lack brains when she wants to be a teacher isnt it if i could only absorb algebra and history as i can music what a blessing it would be come now dorrie dear smooth that pucker out next year i shall be earning a princely salary which we can squander on party gowns at willif people havent given up inviting us by that time in sheer despair of ever being able to conquer our exclusiveness  penelope went off to her detested algebra with a laugh but the pucker did not go out of doris forehead she wanted penelope to go to that party  penelope has studied so hard all winter and she hasnt gone anywhere thought the older sister wistfully she is getting discouraged over those examinations and she needs just a good jolly time to hearten her up if it could only be managed  but doris did not see how it could it took every cent of her small salary as typewriter in an uptown office to run their tiny establishment and keep penelope in school dresses and books indeed she could not have done even that much if they had not owned their little cottage next year it would be easier if penelope got through her examinations successfully but just now there was absolutely not a spare penny  it is hard to be poor we are a pair of misfits said doris with a patient little smile thinking of penelopes uncultivated talent for music and her own housewifely gifts which had small chance of flowering out in her business life  doris dreamed of pretty dresses all that night and thought about them all the next day so it must be confessed did penelope though she would not have admitted it for the world  when doris reached home the next evening she found penelope hovering over a bulky parcel on the sittingroom table  im so glad youve come she said with an exaggerated gasp of relief i really dont think my curiosity could have borne the strain for another five minutes the expressman brought this parcel an hour ago and theres a letter for you from aunt adella on the clock shelf and i think they belong to each other hurry up and find out dorrie darling what if it should be aapresent of some sort or other  i suppose it cant be anything else smiled doris she knew that penelope had started out to say a new dress she cut the strings and removed the wrappings both girls stared  is itit isntyes it is doris hunter i believe its an old quilt  doris unfolded the odd present with a queer feeling of disappointment she did not know just what she had expected the package to contain but certainly not this she laughed a little shakily  well we cant say after this that aunt adella never gave us anything she said when she had opened her letter listen penelope      my dear doris      i have decided to give up housekeeping and go out west to     live with robert so i am disposing of such of the family     heirlooms as i do not wish to take with me i am sending you     by express your grandmother hunters silk quilt it is a     handsome article still and i hope you will prize it as you     should it took your grandmother five years to make it there     is a bit of the wedding dress of every member of the family in     it love to penelope and yourself                            your affectionate aunt                                     adella hunter  i dont see its beauty said penelope with a grimace it may have been pretty once but it is all faded now it is a monument of patience though the pattern is what they call little thousands isnt it tell me dorrie does it argue a lack of proper respect for my ancestors that i cant feel very enthusiastic over this heirloomespecially when grandmother hunter died years before i was born  it was very kind of aunt adella to send it said doris dutifully  oh very agreed penelope drolly only dont ever ask me to sleep under it it would give me the nightmare ooh  this last was a little squeal of admiration as doris turned the quilt over and brought to view the shimmering lining  why the wrong side is ever so much prettier than the right exclaimed penelope what lovely oldtimey stuff and not a bit faded  the lining was certainly very pretty it was a soft creamy yellow silk with a design of brocaded pink rosebuds all over it  that was a dress grandmother hunter had when she was a girl said doris absently i remember hearing aunt adella speak of it when it became oldfashioned grandmother used it to line her quilt i declare it is as good as new  well let us go and have tea said penelope im decidedly hungry besides i see the poverty pucker coming put the quilt in the spare room it is something to possess an heirloom after all it gives one a nice importantfamily feeling  after tea when penelope was patiently grinding away at her studies and thinking dolefully enough of the nearapproaching examinations which she dreaded and of teaching which she confidently expected to hate doris went up to the tiny spare room to look at the wrong side of the quilt again  it would make the loveliest party waist she said under her breath creamy yellow is penelopes colour and i could use that bit of old black lace and those knots of velvet ribbon that i have to trim it i wonder if grandmother hunters reproachful spirit will forever haunt me if i do it  doris knew very well that she would do ithad known it ever since she had looked at that lovely lining and a vision of penelopes vivid face and redbrown hair rising above a waist of the quaint old silk had flashed before her mental sight that night after penelope had gone to bed doris ripped the lining out of grandmother hunters silk quilt  if aunt adella saw me now she laughed softly to herself as she worked  in the three following evenings doris made the waist she thought it a wonderful bit of good luck that penelope went out each of the evenings to study some especially difficult problems with a school chum  it will be such a nice surprise for her the sister mused jubilantly  penelope was surprised as much as the tender sisterly heart could wish when doris flashed out upon her triumphantly on the evening of the party with the black skirt nicely pressed and rehung and the prettiest waist imaginablea waist that was a positive creation of dainty rosebesprinkled silk with a girdle and knots of black velvet  doris hunter you are a veritable little witch do you mean to tell me that you conjured that perfectly lovely thing for me out of the lining of grandmother hunters quilt  so penelope went to blanches party and her dress was the admiration of every girl there mrs fairweather who was visiting mrs anderson looked closely at it also she was a very sweet old lady with silver hair which she wore in delightful oldfashioned puffs and she had very bright dark eyes penelope thought her altogether charming  she looks as if she had just stepped out of the frame of some lovely old picture she said to herself i wish she belonged to me id just love to have a grandmother like her and i do wonder who it is ive seen who looks so much like her  a little later on the knowledge came to her suddenly and she thought with inward surprise why it is doris of course if my sister doris lives to be seventy years old and wears her hair in pretty white puffs she will look exactly as mrs fairweather does now  mrs fairweather asked to have penelope introduced to her and when they found themselves alone together she said gently my dear i am going to ask a very impertinent question will you tell me where you got the silk of which your waist is made  poor penelopes pretty young face turned crimson she was not troubled with false pride by any means but she simply could not bring herself to tell mrs fairweather that her waist was made out of the lining of an old heirloom quilt  my aunt adella gave megave usthe material she stammered and my elder sister doris made the waist for me i think the silk once belonged to my grandmother hunter  what was your grandmothers maiden name asked mrs fairweather eagerly  penelope saverne i am named after her  mrs fairweather suddenly put her arm about penelope and drew the young girl to her her lovely old face aglow with delight and tenderness  then you are my grandniece she said your grandmother was my halfsister when i saw your dress i felt sure you were related to her i should recognize that rosebud silk if i came across it in thibet penelope saverne was the daughter of my mother by her first husband penelope was four years older than i was but we were devoted to each other oddly enough our birthdays fell on the same day and when penelope was twenty and i sixteen my father gave us each a silk dress of this very material i have mine yet  soon after this our mother died and our household was broken up penelope went to live with her aunt and i went west with father this was long ago you know when travelling and correspondence were not the easy matterofcourse things they are now after a few years i lost touch with my halfsister i married out west and have lived there all my life i never knew what had become of penelope but tonight when i saw you come in in that waist made of the rosebud silk the whole past rose before me and i felt like a girl again my dear i am a very lonely old woman with nobody belonging to me you dont know how delighted i am to find that i have two grandnieces  penelope had listened silently like a girl in a dream now she patted mrs fairweathers soft old hand affectionately  it sounds like a storybook she said gaily you must come and see doris she is such a darling sister i wouldnt have had this waist if it hadnt been for her i will tell you the whole truthi dont mind it now doris made my party waist for me out of the lining of an old silk quilt of grandmother hunters that aunt adella sent us  mrs fairweather did go to see doris the very next day and quite wonderful things came to pass from that interview doris and penelope found their lives and plans changed in the twinkling of an eye they were both to go and live with aunt estheras mrs fairweather had said they must call her penelope was to have at last her longedfor musical education and doris was to be the home girl  you must take the place of my own dear little granddaughter said aunt esther she died six years ago and i have been so lonely since  when mrs fairweather had gone doris and penelope looked at each other  pinch me please said penelope im half afraid ill wake up and find i have been dreaming isnt it all wonderful doris hunter  doris nodded radiantly  oh penelope think of it music for yousomebody to pet and fuss over for meand such a dear sweet aunty for us both  and no more contriving party waists out of old silk linings laughed penelope but it was very fortunate that you did it for once sister mine and no more poverty puckers she concluded     the girl and the wild race   if judith would only get married mrs theodora whitney was wont to sigh dolorously  now there was no valid reason why judith ought to get married unless she wanted to but judith was twentyseven and mrs theodora thought it was a terrible disgrace to be an old maid  there has never been an old maid in our family so far back as we know of she lamented and to think that there should be one now it just drags us down to the level of the mcgregors they have always been noted for their old maids  judith took all her aunts lamentations goodnaturedly sometimes she argued the subject placidly  why are you in such a hurry to be rid of me aunt theo im sure were very comfortable here together and you know you would miss me terribly if i went away  if you took the right one you wouldnt go so very far said mrs theodora darkly significant and anyhow id put up with any amount of lonesomeness rather than have an old maid in the family its all very fine now when youre still young enough and good looking with lots of beaus at your beck and call but that wont last much longer and if you go on with your dillydallying youll wake up some fine day to find that your time for choosing has gone by your mother used to be dreadful proud of your good looks when you was a baby i told her she neednt be nine times out of ten a beauty dont marry as well as an ordinary girl  im not much set on marrying at all declared judith sharply any reference to the right one always disturbed her placidity the real root of the trouble was that mrs theodoras right one and judiths right one were two different people  the ramble valley young men were very fond of dancing attendance on judith even if she were verging on old maidenhood her prettiness was undeniable the stewarts came to maturity late and at twentyseven judiths dower of milkywhite flesh dimpled red lips and shining bronze hair was at its fullest splendor besides she was jolly and jollity went a long way in ramble valley popularity  of all judiths admirers eben king alone found favor in mrs theodoras eyes he owned the adjoining farm was well off and homelyso homely that judith declared it made her eyes ache to look at him  bruce marshall judiths right one was handsome but mrs theodora looked upon him with sour disapproval he owned a stony little farm at the remote end of ramble valley and was reputed to be fonder of many things than of work to be sure judith had enough capability and energy for two but mrs theodora detested a lazy man she ordered judith not to encourage him and judith obeyed judith generally obeyed her aunt but though she renounced bruce marshall she would have nothing to do with eben king or anybody else and all mrs theodoras grumblings did not mend matters  the afternoon that mrs tony mack came in mrs theodora felt more aggrieved than ever ellie mcgregor had been married the previous weekellie who was the same age as judith and not half so good looking mrs theodora had been nagging judith ever since  but i might as well talk to the trees down there in that hollow she complained to mrs tony that girl is so set and contrary minded she doesnt care a bit for my feelings  this was not said behind judiths back the girl herself was standing at the open door drinking in all the delicate evasive beauty of the spring afternoon the whitney house crested a bare hill that looked down on misty intervals feathered with young firs that were golden green in the pale sunlight the fields were bare and smoking although the lanes and shadowy places were full of moist snow judiths face was aglow with the delight of mere life and she bent out to front the brisk dancing wind that blew up from the valley resinous with the odors of firs and damp mosses  at her aunts words the glow went out of her face she listened with her eyes brooding on the hollow and a glowing flame of temper smouldering in them judiths long patience was giving way she had been flicked on the raw too often of late and now her aunt was confiding her grievances to mrs tony mackthe most notorious gossip in ramble valley or out of it  i cant sleep at nights for worrying over what will become of her when im gone went on mrs theodora dismally shell just have to live on alone herea lonesome witheredup old maid and her that might have had her pick mrs tony though i do say it as shouldnt you must feel real thankful to have all your girls married offespecially when none of them was extry goodlooking some people have all the luck im tired of talking to judith folksll be saying soon that nobody ever really wanted her for all her flirting but she just wont marry  i will  judith whirled about on the sun warm door step and came in her black eyes were flashing and her round cheeks were crimson  such a temper you never saw reported mrs tony afterwards though twerent to be wondered at theodora was most awful aggravating  i will repeated judith stormily im tired of being nagged day in and day out ill marryand what is more ill marry the very first man that asks methat i will if it is old widower delane himself how does that suit you aunt theodora  mrs theodoras mental processes were never slow she dropped her knitting ball and stooped for it in that time she had decided what to do she knew that judith would stick to her word stewartlike and she must trim her sails to catch this new wind  it suits me real well judith she said calmly you can marry the first man that asks you and ill say no word to hinder  the color went out of judiths face leaving it pale as ashes her hasty assertion had no sooner been uttered than it was repented of but she must stand by it now she went out of the kitchen without another glance at her aunt or the delighted mrs tony and dashed up the stairs to her own little room which looked out over the whole of ramble valley it was warm with the march sunshine and the leafless boughs of the creeper that covered the end of the house were tapping a gay tattoo on the window panes to the music of the wind  judith sat down in her little rocker and dropped her pointed chin in her hands far down the valley over the firs on the mcgregor hill and the blue mirror of the cranston pond bruce marshalls little gray house peeped out from a semicircle of whitestemmed birches she had not seen bruce since before christmas he had been angry at her then because she had refused to let him drive her home from prayer meeting since then she had heard a rumor that he was going to see kitty leigh at the upper valley  judith looked sombrely down at the marshall homestead she had always loved the quaint picturesque old place so different from all the commonplace spick and span new houses of the prosperous valley judith had never been able to decide whether she really cared very much for bruce marshall or not but she knew that she loved that rambling cornery house of his with the gable festooned with the real ivy that bruce marshalls greatgrandmother had brought with her from england judith thought contrastingly of eben kings staring primrosecolored house in all its bare intrusive grandeur she gave a little shrug of distaste  i wish bruce knew of this she thought flushing even in her solitude at the idea although if it is true that he is going to see kitty leigh i dont suppose hed care and aunt theo will be sure to send word to eben by hook or crook whatever possessed me to say such a mad thing there goes mrs tony now all agog to spread such a delectable bit of gossip  mrs tony had indeed gone refusing mrs theodoras invitation to stay to tea so eager was she to tell her story and mrs theodora at that very minute was out in her kitchen yard giving her instructions to potter vane the twelve year old urchin who cut her wood and did sundry other chores for her  potter she said excitedly run over to the kings and tell eben to come over here immediatelyno matter what hes at tell him i want to see him about something of the greatest importance  mrs theodora thought that this was a master stroke  that match is as good as made she thought triumphantly as she picked up chips to start the tea fire if judith suspects that eben is here she is quite likely to stay in her room and refuse to come down but if she does ill march him upstairs to her door and make him ask her through the keyhole you cant stump theodora whitney  alas ten minutes later potter returned with the unwelcome news that eben was away from home  he went to wexbridge about half an hour ago his ma said she said shed tell him to come right over as soon as he kem home  mrs theodora had to content herself with this but she felt troubled she knew mrs tony macks capabilities for spreading news what if bruce marshall should hear it before eben  that evening jacob plowdens store at wexbridge was full of men sitting about on kegs and counters or huddling around the stove for the march air had grown sharp as the sun lowered in the creamy sky over the ramble valley hills eben king had a keg in the corner he was in no hurry to go home for he loved gossip dearly and the wexbridge stores abounded with it he had exhausted the news of peter stanleys store across the bridge and now he meant to hear what was saying at plowdens bruce marshall was there too buying groceries and being waited on by nora plowden who was by no means averse to the service although as a rule her fathers customers received scanty tolerance at her hands  what are the valley roads like marshall asked a wexbridge man between two squirts of tobacco juice  bad said bruce briefly another warm day will finish the sleighing  are they crossing at malleys creek yet asked plowden  no jack carr got in there day before yesterday nearly lost his mare i came round by the main road responded bruce  the door opened at this point and tony mack came in as soon as he closed the door he doubled up in a fit of chuckles which lasted until he was purple in the face  is the man crazy demanded plowden who had never seen lean little tony visited like this before  crazy nothin retorted tony youll laugh too when you hear it such a joke heeteeteeheee theodora whitney has been badgering judith stewart so much about bein an old maid that judiths got mad and vowed shell marry the first man that asks her heeteeteeheeeee my old woman was there and heard her shell keep her word too she aint old joshua stewarts daughter for nothin if he said hed do a thing he did it if it tuck the hair off if i was a young feller now heeteeteeheeeee  bruce marshall swung round on one foot his face was crimson and if looks could kill tony mack would have fallen dead in the middle of his sniggers  you neednt mind doing up that parcel for me he said to nora ill not wait for it  on his way to the door eben king brushed past him a shout of laughter from the assembled men followed them the others streamed out in their wake realizing that a race was afoot tony alone remained inside helpless with chuckling  eben kings horse was tied at the door he had nothing to do but step in and drive off bruce had put his mare in at billy benders across the bridge intending to spend the evening there he knew that this would handicap him seriously but he strode down the road with a determined expression on his handsome face fifteen minutes later he drove past the store his gray mare going at a sharp gait the crowd in front of plowdens cheered him their sympathies were with him for king was not popular tony had come out and shouted heres luck to you brother after which he doubled up with renewed laughter such a lark and he tony had set it afoot it would be a story to tell for years  marshall with his lips set and his dreamy gray eyes for once glittering with a steely light urged lady jane up the wexbridge hill from its top it was five miles to ramble valley by the main road a full mile ahead of him he saw eben king getting along through mud and slush and occasional big slumpy drifts of old snow as fast as his cleanlimbed trotter could carry him as a rule eben was exceedingly careful of his horses but now he was sending bay billy along for all that was in him  for a second bruce hesitated then he turned his mare down the field cut to malleys creek it was taking lady janes life and possibly his own in his hand but it was his only chance he could never have overtaken bay billy on the main road  do your best lady jane he muttered and lady jane plunged down the steep hillside through the glutinous mud of a ploughed field as if she meant to do it  beyond the field was a ravine full of firs through which malleys creek ran to cross it meant a fourmile cut to ramble valley the ice looked black and rotten to the left was the ragged hole where jack carrs mare had struggled for her life bruce headed lady jane higher up if a crossing could be made at all it was only between malleys springhole and the old ice road lady jane swerved at the bank and whickered  on old girl said bruce in a tense voice unwillingly she advanced picking her steps with catlike sagacity once her foot went through bruce pulled her up with hands that did not tremble the next moment she was scrambling up the opposite bank glancing back bruce saw the ice parting in her footprints and the black water gurgling up  but the race was not yet decided by crossing the creek he had won no more than an equal chance with eben king and the field road before him was much worse than the main road there was little snow on it and some bad sloughs but lady jane was good for it for once she should not be spared  just as the red ball of the sun touched the wooded hills of the valley mrs theodora looking from the cowstable door saw two sleighs approaching the horses of which were going at a gallop one was trundling down the main road headlong through old drifts and slumpy snow where a false step might send the horse floundering to the bottom the other was coming up from the direction of the creek full tilt through tony macks stump land where not a vestige of snow coated the huge roots over which the runners bumped  for a moment mrs theodora stood at a gaze then she recognized both drivers she dropped her milking pail and ran to the house thinking as she ran she knew that judith was alone in the kitchen if eben king got there first well and good but if bruce marshall won the race he must encounter her mrs theodora  he wont propose to judith as long as im round she panted i know himhes too shy but eben wont mindill tip him the wink  potter vane was chopping wood before the door mrs theodora recognizing in him a further obstacle to marshalls wooing caught him unceremoniously by the arm and hauled him axe and all over the doorstone and into the kitchen just as bruce marshall and eben king drove into the yard with not a second to spare between them there was a woeful cut on bay billys slender foreleg and the reeking lady jane was trembling like a leaf the staunch little mare had brought her master over that stretch of sticky field road in time but she was almost exhausted  both men sprang from their sleighs and ran to the door bruce marshall won it by footroom and burst into the kitchen with his rival hot on his heels mrs theodora stood defiantly in the middle of the room still grasping the dazed and dismayed potter in a corner judith turned from the window whence she had been watching the finish of the race she was pale and tense from excitement in those few gasping moments she had looked on her heart as on an open book she knew at last that she loved bruce marshall and her eyes met his fiery gray ones as he sprang over the threshold  judith will you marry me gasped bruce before eben who had first looked at mrs theodora and the squirming potter had located the girl  yes said judith she burst into hysterical tears as she said it and sat limply down in a chair  mrs theodora loosed her grip on potter  you can go back to your work she said dully she followed him out and eben king followed her on the step she reached behind him and closed the door  trust a king for being too late she said bitterly and unjustly  eben went home with bay billy potter gazed after him until mrs theodora ordered him to put marshalls mare in the stable and rub her down  anyway judith wont be an old maid she comforted herself     the promise of lucy ellen   cecily foster came down the sloping firfringed road from the village at a leisurely pace usually she walked with a long determined stride but today the drowsy mellowing influence of the autumn afternoon was strong upon her and filled her with placid content without being actively conscious of it she was satisfied with the existing circumstances of her life it was half over now the half of it yet to be lived stretched before her tranquil pleasant and uneventful like the afternoon filled with unhurried duties and calmly interesting days cecily liked the prospect  when she came to her own lane she paused folding her hands on the top of the whitewashed gate while she basked for a moment in the warmth that seemed cupped in the little grassy hollow hedged about with young firtrees  before her lay sere brooding fields sloping down to a sandy shore where long foamy ripples were lapping with a murmur that threaded the hushed air like a faint minor melody  on the crest of the little hill to her right was her homehers and lucy ellens the house was an oldfashioned weathergray one low in the eaves with gables and porches overgrown with vines that had turned to winereds and rich bronzes in the october frosts on three sides it was closed in by tall old spruces their outer sides bared and grim from long wrestling with the atlantic winds but their inner green and feathery on the fourth side a trim white paling shut in the flower garden before the front door cecily could see the beds of purple and scarlet asters making rich whorls of color under the parlor and sittingroom windows lucy ellens bed was gayer and larger than cecilys lucy ellen had always had better luck with flowers  she could see old boxer asleep on the front porch step and lucy ellens white cat stretched out on the parlor windowsill there was no other sign of life about the place cecily drew a long leisurely breath of satisfaction  after tea ill dig up those dahlia roots she said aloud theyd ought to be up my how blue and soft that sea is i never saw such a lovely day ive been gone longer than i expected i wonder if lucy ellens been lonesome  when cecily looked back from the misty ocean to the house she was surprised to see a man coming with a jaunty step down the lane under the gnarled spruces she looked at him perplexedly he must be a stranger for she was sure no man in oriental walked like that  some agent has been pestering lucy ellen i suppose she muttered vexedly  the stranger came on with an airy briskness utterly foreign to orientalites cecily opened the gate and went through they met under the ambertinted sugar maple in the heart of the hollow as he passed the man lifted his hat and bowed with an ingratiating smile  he was about fortyfive well although somewhat loudly dressed and with an air of selfsatisfied prosperity pervading his whole personality he had a heavy gold watch chain and a large seal ring on the hand that lifted his hat he was bald with a high shaksperian forehead and a halo of sandy curls his face was ruddy and weak but goodnatured his eyes were large and blue and he had a little strawcolored moustache with a juvenile twist and curl in it  cecily did not recognize him yet there was something vaguely familiar about him she walked rapidly up to the house in the sittingroom she found lucy ellen peering out between the muslin window curtains when the latter turned there was an air of repressed excitement about her  who was that man lucy ellen cecily asked  to cecilys amazement lucy ellen blusheda warm springlike flood of color that rolled over her delicate little face like a miracle of rejuvenescence  didnt you know him that was cromwell biron she simpered although lucy ellen was forty and in most respects sensible she could not help simpering upon occasion  cromwell biron repeated cecily in an emotionless voice she took off her bonnet mechanically brushed the dust from its ribbons and bows and went to put it carefully away in its white box in the spare bedroom she felt as if she had had a severe shock and she dared not ask anything more just then lucy ellens blush had frightened her it seemed to open up dizzying possibilities of change  but she promisedshe promised said cecily fiercely under her breath  while cecily was changing her dress lucy ellen was getting the tea ready in the little kitchen now and then she broke out into singing but always checked herself guiltily cecily heard her and set her firm mouth a little firmer  if a man had jilted me twenty years ago i wouldnt be so overwhelmingly glad to see him when he came backespecially if he had got fat and baldheaded she added her face involuntarily twitching into a smile cecily in spite of her serious expression and intense way of looking at life had an irrepressible sense of humor  tea that evening was not the pleasant meal it usually was the two women were wont to talk animatedly to each other and cecily had many things to tell lucy ellen she did not tell them neither did lucy ellen ask any questions her illconcealed excitement hanging around her like a festal garment  cecilys heart was on fire with alarm and jealousy she smiled a little cruelly as she buttered and ate her toast  and so that was cromwell biron she said with studied carelessness i thought there was something familiar about him when did he come home  he got to oriental yesterday fluttered back lucy ellen hes going to be home for two months wewe had such an interesting talk this afternoon hehes as full of jokes as ever i wished youd been here  this was a fib cecily knew it  i dont then she said contemptuously you know i never had much use for cromwell biron i think he had a face of his own to come down here to see you uninvited after the way he treated you  lucy ellen blushed scorchingly and was miserably silent  hes changed terrible in his looks went on cecily relentlessly how bald hes gotand fat to think of the spruce cromwell biron got to be bald and fat to be sure he still has the same sheepish expression will you pass me the currant jell lucy ellen  i dont think hes so very fat she said resentfully when cecily had left the table and i dont care if he is  twenty years before this biron had jilted lucy ellen foster she was the prettiest girl in oriental then but the new school teacher over at the crossways was prettier with a dash of piquancy which lucy ellen lacked into the bargain cromwell and the school teacher had run away and been married and lucy ellen was left to pick up the tattered shreds of her poor romance as best she could  she never had another lover she told herself that she would always be faithful to the one love of her life this sounded romantic and she found a certain comfort in it  she had been brought up by her uncle and aunt when they died she and her cousin cecily foster found themselves except for each other alone in the world  cecily loved lucy ellen as a sister but she believed that lucy ellen would yet marry and her heart sank at the prospect of being left without a soul to love and care for  it was lucy ellen that had first proposed their mutual promise but cecily had grasped at it eagerly the two women verging on decisive old maidenhood solemnly promised each other that they would never marry and would always live together from that time cecilys mind had been at ease in her eyes a promise was a sacred thing  the next evening at prayermeeting cromwell biron received quite an ovation from old friends and neighbors cromwell had been a favorite in his boyhood he had now the additional glamour of novelty and reputed wealth  he was beaming and expansive he went into the choir to help sing lucy ellen sat beside him and they sang from the same book two red spots burned on her thin cheeks and she had a cluster of lavender chrysanthemums pinned on her jacket she looked almost girlish and cromwell biron gazed at her with sidelong admiration while cecily watched them both fiercely from her pew she knew that cromwell biron had come home wooing his old love  but he shant get her cecily whispered into her hymnbook somehow it was a comfort to articulate the words she promised  on the church steps cromwell offered his arm to lucy ellen with a flourish she took it shyly and they started down the road in the crisp autumn moonlight for the first time in ten years cecily walked home from prayermeeting alone she went upstairs and flung herself on her bed reckless for once of her second best hat and gown  lucy ellen did not venture to ask cromwell in she was too much in awe of cecily for that but she loitered with him at the gate until the grandfathers clock in the hall struck eleven then cromwell went away whistling gaily with lucy ellens chrysanthemum in his buttonhole and lucy ellen went in and cried half the night but cecily did not cry she lay savagely awake until morning  cromwell biron is courting you again she said bluntly to lucy ellen at the breakfast table  lucy ellen blushed nervously  oh nonsense cecily she protested with a simper  it isnt nonsense said cecily calmly he is there is no fool like an old fool and cromwell biron never had much sense the presumption of him  lucy ellens hands trembled as she put her teacup down  hes not so very old she said faintly and everybody but you likes himand hes welltodo i dont see that theres any presumption  maybe notif you look at it so youre very forgiving lucy ellen youve forgotten how he treated you once  nooo i havent faltered lucy ellen  anyway said cecily coldly you shouldnt encourage his attentions lucy ellen you know you couldnt marry him even if he asked you you promised  all the fitful color went out of lucy ellens face under cecilys pitiless eyes she wilted and drooped  i know she said deprecatingly i havent forgotten you are talking nonsense cecily i like to see cromwell and he likes to see me because im almost the only one of his old set that is left he feels lonesome in oriental now  lucy ellen lifted her fawncolored little head more erectly at the last of her protest she had saved her selfrespect  in the month that followed cromwell biron pressed his suit persistently unintimidated by cecilys antagonism october drifted into november and the chill drear days came to cecily the whole outer world seemed the dismal reflex of her painbitten heart yet she constantly laughed at herself too and her laughter was real if bitter  one evening she came home late from a neighbors cromwell biron passed her in the hollow under the bare boughs of the maple that were outlined against the silvery moonlit sky  when cecily went into the house lucy ellen opened the parlor door she was very pale but her eyes burned in her face and her hands were clasped before her  i wish youd come in here for a few minutes cecily she said feverishly  cecily followed silently into the room  cecily she said faintly cromwell was here tonight he asked me to marry him i told him to come tomorrow night for his answer  she paused and looked imploringly at cecily cecily did not speak she stood tall and unrelenting by the table the rigidity of her face and figure smote lucy ellen like a blow she threw out her bleached little hands and spoke with a sudden passion utterly foreign to her  cecily i want to marry him iilove him i always have i never thought of this when i promised oh cecily youll let me off my promise wont you  no said cecily it was all she said lucy ellens hands fell to her sides and the light went out of her face  you wont she said hopelessly  cecily went out at the door she turned  when john edwards asked me to marry him six years ago i said no for your sake to my mind a promise is a promise but you were always weak and romantic lucy ellen  lucy ellen made no response she stood limply on the hearthrug like a faded blossom bitten by frost  after cromwell biron had gone away the next evening with all his brisk jauntiness shorn from him for the time lucy ellen went up to cecilys room she stood for a moment in the narrow doorway with the lamplight striking upward with a gruesome effect on her wan face  ive sent him away she said lifelessly ive kept my promise cecily  there was silence for a moment cecily did not know what to say suddenly lucy ellen burst out bitterly  i wish i was dead  then she turned swiftly and ran across the hall to her own room cecily gave a little moan of pain this was her reward for all the love she had lavished on lucy ellen  anyway it is all over she said looking dourly into the moonlit boughs of the firs lucy ellenll get over it when cromwell is gone shell forget all about him im not going to fret she promised and she wanted the promise first  during the next fortnight tragedy held grim sway in the little weathergray house among the firsa tragedy tempered with grim comedy for cecily who amid all her agony could not help being amused at lucy ellens romantic way of sorrowing  lucy ellen did her mornings work listlessly and drooped through the afternoons cecily would have felt it as a relief if lucy ellen had upbraided her but after her outburst on the night she sent cromwell away lucy ellen never uttered a word of reproach or complaint  one evening cecily made a neighborly call in the village cromwell biron happened to be there and gallantly insisted upon seeing her home  she understood from cromwells unaltered manner that lucy ellen had not told him why she had refused him she felt a sudden admiration for her cousin  when they reached the house cromwell halted suddenly in the banner of light that streamed from the sittingroom window they saw lucy ellen sitting alone before the fire her arms folded on the table and her head bowed on them her white cat sat unnoticed at the table beside her cecily gave a gasp of surrender  youd better come in she said harshly lucy ellen looks lonesome  cromwell muttered sheepishly im afraid i wouldnt be company for her lucy ellen doesnt like me much  oh doesnt she said cecily bitterly she likes you better than she likes me for all ivebut its no matter its been all my faultshell explain tell her i said she could come in i say  she caught the still reluctant cromwell by the arm and fairly dragged him over the geranium beds and through the front door she opened the sittingroom door and pushed him in lucy ellen rose in amazement over cromwells bald head loomed cecilys dark face tragic and determined  heres your beau lucy ellen she said and i give you back your promise  she shut the door upon the sudden illumination of lucy ellens face and went upstairs with the tears rolling down her cheeks  its my turn to wish i was dead she muttered then she laughed hysterically  that goose of a cromwell how queer he did look standing there frightened to death of lucy ellen poor little lucy ellen well i hope hell be good to her     the pursuit of the ideal   fredas snuggery was aglow with the rosered splendour of an open fire which was triumphantly warding off the stealthy approaches of the dull grey autumn twilight roger st clair stretched himself out luxuriously in an easychair with a sigh of pleasure  freda your armchairs are the most comfy in the world how do you get them to fit into a fellows kinks so splendidly  freda smiled at him out of big owlish eyes that were the same tint as the coppery grey sea upon which the north window of the snuggery looked  any armchair will fit a lazy fellows kinks she said  im not lazy protested roger that you should say so freda when i have wheeled all the way out of town this dismal afternoon over the worst bicycle road in three kingdoms to see you bonnie maid  i like lazy people said freda softly tilting her spoon on a cup of chocolate with a slender brown hand  roger smiled at her chummily  you are such a comfortable girl he said i like to talk to you and tell you things  you have something to tell me today it has been fairly sticking out of your eyes ever since you came now fess  freda put away her cup and saucer got up and stood by the fireplace with one arm outstretched along the quaintly carved old mantel she laid her head down on its curve and looked expectantly at roger  i have seen my ideal freda said roger gravely  freda lifted her head and then laid it down again she did not speak roger was glad of it even at the moment he found himself thinking that freda had a genius for silence any other girl he knew would have broken in at once with surprised exclamations and questions and spoiled his story  you have not forgotten what my ideal woman is like he said  freda shook her head she was not likely to forget she remembered only too keenly the afternoon he had told her they had been sitting in the snuggery herself in the inglenook and roger coiled up in his big pet chair that nobody else ever sat in  what must my lady be that i must love her he had quoted well i will paint my dreamlove for you freda she must be tall and slender with chestnut hair of wonderful gloss with just the suggestion of a ripple in it she must have an oval face colourless ivory in hue with the expression of a madonna and her eyes must be passionless peaceful blue deep and tender as a twilight sky  freda looking at herself along her arm in the mirror recalled this description and smiled faintly she was short and plump with a piquant irregular little face vivid tinting curly unmanageable hair of ruddy brown and big grey eyes certainly she was not his ideal  when and where did you meet your lady of the madonna face and twilight eyes she asked  roger frowned fredas face was solemn enough but her eyes looked as if she might be laughing at him  i havent met her yet i have only seen her it was in the park yesterday she was in a carriage with the mandersons so beautiful freda our eyes met as she drove past and i realized that i had found my longsought ideal i rushed back to town and hunted up pete manderson at the club pete is a donkey but he has his ways of being useful he told me who she was her name is stephanie gardiner she is his cousin from the south and is visiting his mother and freda i am to dine at the mandersons tonight i shall meet her  do goddesses and ideals and madonnas eat said freda in an awed whisper her eyes were certainly laughing now roger got up stiffly  i must confess i did not expect that you would ridicule my confidence freda he said frigidly it is very unlike you but if you are not interested i will not bore you with any further details and it is time i was getting back to town anyhow  when he had gone freda ran to the west window and flung it open she leaned out and waved both hands at him over the spruce hedge  roger roger i was a horrid little beast forget it immediately please and come out tomorrow and tell me all about her  roger came he bored freda terribly with his raptures but she never betrayed it she was all sympathyor at least as much sympathy as a woman can be who must listen while the man of men sings another womans praises to her she sent roger away in perfect good humour with himself and all the world then she curled herself up in the snuggery pulled a rug over her head and cried  roger came out to lowlands oftener than ever after that he had to talk to somebody about stephanie gardiner and freda was the safest vent the pursuit of the ideal as she called it went on with vim and fervour sometimes roger would be on the heights of hope and elation the next visit he would be in the depths of despair and humility freda had learned to tell which it was by the way he opened the snuggery door  one day when roger came he found six feet of young man reposing at ease in his particular chair freda was sipping chocolate in her corner and looking over the rim of her cup at the intruder just as she had been wont to look at roger she had on a new dark red gown and looked vivid and rosehued  she introduced the stranger as mr grayson and called him tim they seemed to be excellent friends roger sat bolt upright on the edge of a fragile gilded chair which freda kept to hide a shabby spot in the carpet and glared at tim until the latter said goodbye and lounged out  youll be over tomorrow said freda  cant i come this evening he pleaded  freda nodded yesand well make taffy you used to make such delicious stuff tim  who is that fellow freda roger inquired crossly as soon as the door closed  freda began to make a fresh pot of chocolate she smiled dreamily as if thinking of something pleasant  why that was tim graysondear old tim he used to live next door to us when we were children and we were such chumsalways together making mud pies and getting into scrapes he is just the same old tim and is home from the west for a long visit i was so glad to see him again  so it would appear said roger grumpily well now that dear old tim is gone i suppose i can have my own chair can i and do give me some chocolate i didnt know you made taffy  oh i dont its tim he can do everything he used to make it long ago and i washed up after him and helped him eat it how is the pursuit of the ideal coming on rogerboy  roger did not feel as if he wanted to talk about the ideal he noticed how vivid fredas smile was and how lovable were the curves of her neck where the dusky curls were caught up from it he had also an inner vision of freda making taffy with tim and he did not approve of it  he refused to talk about the ideal on his way back to town he found himself thinking that freda had the most charming glad little laugh of any girl he knew he suddenly remembered that he had never heard the ideal laugh she smiled placidlyhe had raved to freda about that smilebut she did not laugh roger began to wonder what an ideal without any sense of humour would be like when translated into the real  he went to lowlands the next afternoon and found tim therein his chair again he detested the fellow but he could not deny that he was goodlooking and had charming manners freda was very nice to tim on his way back to town roger decided that tim was in love with freda he was furious at the idea the presumption of the man  he also remembered that he had not said a word to freda about the ideal and he never did say much moreperhaps because he could not get the chance tim was always there before him and generally outstayed him  one day when he went out he did not find freda at home her aunt told him that she was out riding with mr grayson on his way back he met them as they cantered by freda waved her riding whip at him her face was full of warm ripe kissable tints her loose lovelocks were blowing about it and her eyes shone like grey pools mirroring stars roger turned and watched them out of sight behind the firs that cupped lowlands  that night at mrs crandalls dinner table somebody began to talk about freda roger strained his ears to listen mrs kitty carr was speakingmrs kitty knew everything and everybody  she is simply the most charming girl in the world when you get really acquainted with her said mrs kitty with the air of having discovered and patented freda she is so vivid and unconventional and lovablespirit and fire and dew you know tim grayson is a very lucky fellow  are they engaged someone asked  not yet i fancy but of course it is only a question of time tim simply adores her he is a good soul and has lots of money so hell do but really you know i think a prince wouldnt be good enough for freda  roger suddenly became conscious that the ideal was asking him a question of which he had not heard a word he apologized and was forgiven but he went home a very miserable man  he did not go to lowlands for two weeks they were the longest most wretched two weeks he had ever lived through one afternoon he heard that tim grayson had gone back west mrs kitty told it mournfully  of course this means that freda has refused him she said she is such an odd girl  roger went straight out to lowlands he found freda in the snuggery and held out his hands to her  freda will you marry me it will take a lifetime to tell you how much i love you  but the ideal questioned freda  i have just discovered what my ideal is said roger she is a dear loyal companionable little girl with the jolliest laugh and the warmest truest heart in the world she has starry grey eyes two dimples and a mouth i must and will kisstheretherethere freda tell me you love me a little bit although ive been such a besotted idiot  i will not let you call my husbandthatistobe names said freda snuggling down into the curve of his shoulder but indeed rogerboy you will have to make me very very happy to square matters up you have made me so unutterably unhappy for two months  the pursuit of the ideal is ended declared roger     the softening of miss cynthia   i wonder if id better flavour this cake with lemon or vanilla its the most perplexing thing i ever heard of in my life  miss cynthia put down the bottles with a vexed frown her perplexity had nothing whatever to do with flavouring the golden mixture in her cake bowl mrs john joe knew that the latter had dropped in in a flurry of curiosity concerning the little boy whom she had seen about miss cynthias place for the last two days her daughter kitty was with her they both sat close together on the kitchen sofa  it is too bad said mrs john joe sympathetically i dont wonder you are mixed up so unexpected too when did he come  tuesday night said miss cynthia she had decided on the vanilla and was whipping it briskly in i saw an express wagon drive into the yard with a boy and a trunk in it and i went out just as he got down are you my aunt cynthia he said who in the world are you i asked and he says im wilbur merrivale and my father was john merrivale he died three weeks ago and he said i was to come to you because you were his sister well you could just have knocked me down with a feather  im sure said mrs john joe but i didnt know you had a brother and his namemerrivale  well he wasnt any relation really i was about six years old when my father married his mother the widow merrivale john was just my age and we were brought up together just like brother and sister he was a real nice fellow i must say but he went out to californy years ago and i havent heard a word of him for fifteen yearsdidnt know if he was alive or dead but it seems from what i can make out from the boy that his mother died when he was a baby and him and john roughed it along togetherpretty poor too i guesstill john took a fever and died and he told some of his friends to send the boy to me for hed no relations there and not a cent in the world and the child came all the way from californy and here he is ive been just distracted ever since ive never been used to children and to have the house kept in perpetual uproar is more than i can stand hes about twelve and a born mischief hell tear through the rooms with his dirty feet and hes smashed one of my blue vases and torn down a curtain and set towser on the cat half a dozen times alreadyi never was so worried ive got him out on the verandah shelling peas now to keep him quiet for a little spell  im really sorry for you said mrs john joe but poor child i suppose hes never had anyone to look after him and come all the way from californy alone toohe must be real smart  too smart i guess he must take after his mother whoever she was for there aint a bit of merrivale in him and hes been brought up pretty rough  well itll be a great responsibility for you cynthia of course but hell be company too and hell be real handy to run errands and  im not going to keep him said miss cynthia determinedly her thin lips set themselves firmly and her voice had a hard ring  not going to keep him said mrs john joe blankly you cant send him back to californy  i dont intend to but as for having him here to worry my life out and keep me in a perpetual stew i just wont do it dye think im going to trouble myself about children at my age and all hed cost for clothes and schooling too i cant afford it i dont suppose his father expected it either i suppose he expected me to look after him a bitand of course i will a boy of his age ought to be able to earn his keep anyway if i look out a place for him somewhere where he can do odd jobs and go to school in the winter i think its all anyone can expect of me when he aint really no blood relation  miss cynthia flung the last sentence at mrs john joe rather defiantly not liking the expression on that ladys face  i suppose nobody could expect more cynthy said mrs john joe deprecatingly he would be an awful bother ive no doubt and youve lived alone so long with no one to worry you that you wouldnt know what to do with him boys are always getting into mischiefmy four just keep me on the dead jump still its a pity for him poor little fellow no mother or fatherit seems hard  miss cynthias face grew grimmer than ever as she went to the door with her callers and watched them down the garden path as soon as mrs john joe saw that the door was shut she unburdened her mind to her daughter  did you ever hear tell of the like i thought i knew cynthia henderson well if anybody in wilmot did but this beats me just think kittythere she is no one knows how rich and not a soul in the world belonging to her and she wont even take in her brothers child she must be a hard woman but its just meanness pure and simple she grudges him what hed eat and wear the poor mite doesnt look as if hed need much cynthia didnt used to be like that but its growing on her every day shes got hard as rocks  that afternoon miss cynthia harnessed her fat grey pony into the phaeton herselfshe kept neither man nor maid but lived in her big immaculate house in solitary stateand drove away down the dusty buttercupbordered road leaving wilbur sitting on the verandah she returned in an hours time and drove into the yard shutting the gate behind her with a vigorous snap wilbur was not in sight and fearful lest he should be in mischief she hurriedly tied the pony to the railing and went in search of him she found him sitting by the well his chin in his hands he was pale and his eyes were red miss cynthia hardened her heart and took him into the house  ive been down to see mr robins this afternoon wilbur she said pretending to brush some invisible dust from the bottom of her nice black cashmere skirt for an excuse to avoid looking at him and hes agreed to take you on trial its a real good chancebetter than you could expect he says hell board and clothe you and let you go to school in the winter  the boy seemed to shrink  daddy said that i would stay with you he said wistfully he said you were so good and kind and would love me for his sake  for a moment miss cynthia softened she had been very fond of her stepbrother it seemed that his voice appealed to her across the grave in behalf of his child but the crust of years was not to be so easily broken  your father meant that i would look after you she said and i mean to but i cant afford to keep you here youll have a good place at mr robins if you behave yourself im going to take you down now before i unharness the pony so go and wash your face while i put up your things dont look so woebegone for pitys sake im not taking you to prison  wilbur turned and went silently to the kitchen miss cynthia thought she heard a sob she went with a firm step into the little bedroom off the hall and took a purse out of a drawer  i spose i ought she said doubtfully i dont spose he has a cent i daresay hell lose or waste it  she counted out seventyfive cents carefully when she came out wilbur was at the door she put the money awkwardly into his hand  there see that you dont spend it on any foolishness                                       miss cynthias action made a good deal of talk in wilmot the women headed by mrs john joewho said behind cynthias back what she did not dare say to her facecondemned her the men laughed and said that cynthia was a shrewd one there was no getting round her miss cynthia herself was far from easy she could not forget wilburs wistful eyes and she had heard that robins was a hard master  a week after the boy had gone she saw him one day at the store he was lifting heavy bags from a cart the work was beyond his strength and he was flushed and panting miss cynthias conscience gave her a hard stab she bought a roll of peppermints and took them over to him he thanked her timidly and drove quickly away  robins hasnt any business putting such work on a child she said to herself indignantly ill speak to him about it  and she didand got an answer that made her ears tingle mr robins bluntly told her he guessed he knew what was what about his hands he werent no nigger driver if she wasnt satisfied she might take the boy away as soon as she liked  miss cynthia did not get much comfort out of life that summer almost everywhere she went she was sure to meet wilbur engaged in some hard task she could not help seeing how miserably pale and thin he had become the worry had its effect on her the neighbours said that cynthy was sharper than ever even her churchgoing was embittered she had always enjoyed walking up the aisle with her rich silk skirt rustling over the carpet her cashmere shawl folded correctly over her shoulders and her lace bonnet set precisely on her thin shining crimps but she could take no pleasure in that or in the sermon now when wilbur sat right across from her pew between hardfeatured robins and his sulkylooking wife the boys eyes had grown too large for his thin face  the softening of miss cynthia was a very gradual process but it reached a climax one september morning when mrs john joe came into the formers kitchen with an important face miss cynthia was preserving her plums  no thank you ill not sit downi only run ini suppose youve heard it that little merrivale boy has took awful sick with fever they say hes been worked half to death this summereveryone knows what robins is with his helpand they say he has fretted a good deal for his father and been homesick and hes run down i spose anyway robins took him over to the hospital at stanford last nightgood gracious cynthy are you sick  miss cynthia had staggered to a seat by the table her face was pallid  no its only your news gave me a turnit came so suddenlyi didnt know  i must hurry back and see to the mens dinners i thought id come and tell you though i didnt know as youd care  this parting shot was unheeded by miss cynthia she laid her face in her hands its a judgement on me she moaned hes going to die and im his murderess this is the account ill have to give john merrivale of his boy ive been a wicked selfish woman and im justly punished  it was a humbled miss cynthia who met the doctor at the hospital that afternoon he shook his head at her eager questions  its a pretty bad case the boy seems run down every way no it is impossible to think of moving him again bringing him here last night did him a great deal of harm yes you may see him but he will not know you i fearhe is delirious and raves of his father and california  miss cynthia followed the doctor down the long ward when he paused by a cot she pushed past him wilbur lay tossing restlessly on his pillow he was thin to emaciation but his cheeks were crimson and his eyes burning bright  miss cynthia stooped and took the hot dry hands in hers  wilbur she sobbed dont you know meaunt cynthia  you are not my aunt cynthia said wilbur daddy said aunt cynthia was good and kindyou are a cross bad woman i want daddy why doesnt he come why doesnt he come to little wilbur  miss cynthia got up and faced the doctor  hes got to get better she said stubbornly spare no expense or trouble if he dies i will be a murderess he must live and give me a chance to make it up for him  and he did live but for a long time it was a hard fight and there were days when it seemed that death must win miss cynthia got so thin and wan that even mrs john joe pitied her  the earth seemed to miss cynthia to laugh out in prodigal joyousness on the afternoon she drove home when wilbur had been pronounced out of danger how tranquil the hills looked with warm october sunshine sleeping on their sides and faint blue hazes on their brows how gallantly the maples flaunted their crimson flags how kind and friendly was every face she met afterwards miss cynthia said she began to live that day  wilburs recovery was slow every day miss cynthia drove over with some dainty and her loving gentleness sat none the less gracefully on her because of its newness wilbur grew to look for and welcome her coming when it was thought safe to remove him miss cynthia went to the hospital with a phaetonload of shawls and pillows  i have come to take you away she said  wilbur shrank back not to mr robins he said piteously oh not there aunt cynthia     them notorious pigs   john harrington was a womanhater or thought that he was which amounts to the same thing he was fortyfive and having been handsome in his youth was a finelooking man still he had a remarkably good farm and was a remarkably good farmer he also had a garden which was the pride and delight of his heart or at least it was before mrs haydens pigs got into it  sarah king harringtons aunt and housekeeper was deaf and crabbed and very few visitors ever came to the house this suited harrington he was a good citizen and did his duty by the community but his bump of sociability was undeveloped he was also a contented man looking after his farm improving his stock and experimenting with new bulbs in undisturbed serenity this however was all too good to last a man is bound to have some troubles in this life and harringtons were near their beginning when perry hayden bought the adjoining farm from the heirs of shakespeare ely deceased and moved in  to be sure perry hayden poor fellow did not bother harrington much for he died of pneumonia a month after he came there but his widow carried on the farm with the assistance of a lank hired boy her own children charles and theodore commonly known as bobbles and ted were as yet little more than babies  the real trouble began when mary haydens pigs fourteen in number and of halfgrown voracity got into harringtons garden a railing a fir grove and an apple orchard separated the two establishments but these failed to keep the pigs within bounds  harrington had just got his garden planted for the season and to go out one morning and find a horde of enterprising porkers rooting about in it was to put it mildly trying he was angry but as it was a first offence he drove the pigs out with tolerable calmness mended the fence and spent the rest of the day repairing damages  three days later the pigs got in again harrington relieved his mind by some scathing reflections on women who tried to run farms then he sent mordecai his hired man over to the hayden place to ask mrs hayden if she would be kind enough to keep her pigs out of his garden mrs hayden sent back word that she was very sorry and would not let it occur again nobody not even john harrington could doubt that she meant what she said but she had reckoned without the pigs they had not forgotten the flavour of egyptian fleshpots as represented by the succulent young shoots in the harrington domains a week later mordecai came in and told harrington that them notorious pigs were in his garden again  there is a limit to everyones patience harrington left mordecai to drive them out while he put on his hat and stalked over to the haydens place ted and bobbles were playing at marbles in the lane and ran when they saw him coming he got close up to the little low house among the apple trees before mordecai appeared in the yard driving the pigs around the barn mrs hayden was sitting on her doorstep paring her dinner potatoes and stood up hastily when she saw her visitor  harrington had never seen his neighbour at close quarters before now he could not help seeing that she was a very pretty little woman with wistful dark blue eyes and an appealing expression mary hayden had been next to a beauty in her girlhood and she had a good deal of her bloom left yet although hard work and worry were doing their best to rob her of it but john harrington was an angry man and did not care whether the woman in question was pretty or not her pigs had rooted up his gardenthat fact filled his mind  mrs hayden those pigs of yours have been in my garden again i simply cant put up with this any longer why in the name of reason dont you look after your animals better if i find them in again ill set my dog on them i give you fair warning  a faint colour had crept into mary haydens soft milkywhite cheeks during this tirade and her voice trembled as she said im very sorry mr harrington i suppose bobbles forgot to shut the gate of their pen again this morning he is so forgetful  id lengthen his memory then if i were you returned harrington grimly supposing that bobbles was the hired man im not going to have my garden ruined just because he happens to be forgetful i am speaking my mind plainly madam if you cant keep your stock from being a nuisance to other people you ought not to try to run a farm at all  then did mrs hayden sit down upon the doorstep and burst into tears harrington felt as sarah king would have expressed it every which way at once here was a nice mess what a nuisance women wereworse than the pigs  oh dont cry mrs hayden he said awkwardly i didnt meanwell i suppose i spoke too strongly of course i know you didnt mean to let the pigs in there do stop crying i beg your pardon if ive hurt your feelings  oh it isnt that sobbed mrs hayden wiping away her tears its onlyive tried so hardand everything seems to go wrong i make such mistakes as for your garden sir ill pay for the damage my pigs have done if youll let me know what it comes to  she sobbed again and caught her breath like a grieved child harrington felt like a brute he had a queer notion that if he put his arm around her and told her not to worry over things women were not created to attend to he would be expressing his feelings better than in any other way but of course he couldnt do that instead he muttered that the damage didnt amount to much after all and he hoped she wouldnt mind what he said and then he got himself away and strode through the orchard like a man in a desperate hurry  mordecai had gone home and the pigs were not to be seen but a chubby little face peeped at him from between two scrub bloomwhite cherry trees  gway you bad man said bobbles vindictively gway you made my mommer cryi saw you im only bobbles now but when i grow up ill be charles henry hayden and you wont dare to make my mommer cry then  harrington smiled grimly so youre the lad who forgets to shut the pigpen gate are you come out here and let me see you who is in there with you  ted is hes littler than me but i wont come out i dont like you gway home  harrington obeyed he went home and to work in his garden but work as hard as he would he could not forget mary haydens grieved face  i was a brute he thought why couldnt i have mentioned the matter gently i daresay she has enough to trouble her confound those pigs                                       after that there was a time of calm evidently something had been done to bobbles memory or perhaps mrs hayden attended to the gate herself at all events the pigs were not seen and harringtons garden blossomed like the rose but harrington himself was in a bad state  for one thing wherever he looked he saw the mental picture of his neighbours tired sweet face and the tears in her blue eyes the original he never saw which only made matters worse he wondered what opinion she had of him and decided that she must think him a cross old bear this worried him he wished the pigs would break in again so that he might have a chance to show how forbearing he could be  one day he gathered a nice mess of tender young greens and sent them over to mrs hayden by mordecai at first he had thought of sending her some flowers but that seemed silly and besides mordecai and flowers were incongruous mrs hayden sent back a very pretty message of thanks whereat harrington looked radiant and mordecai who could see through a stone wall as well as most people went out to the barn and chuckled  ef the little widder haint caught him whod athought it  the next day one adventurous pig found its way alone into the harrington garden harrington saw it get in and at the same moment he saw mrs hayden running through her orchard she was in his yard by the time he got out  her sunbonnet had fallen back and some loose tendrils of her auburn hair were curling around her forehead her cheeks were so pink and her eyes so bright from running that she looked almost girlish  oh mr harrington she said breathlessly that pet pig of bobbles is in your garden again he only got in this minute i saw him coming and i ran right after him  hes there all right said harrington cheerfully but ill get him out in a jiffy dont tire yourself wont you go into the house and rest while i drive him around  mrs hayden however was determined to help and they both went around to the garden set the gate open and tried to drive the pig out but harrington was not thinking about pigs and mrs hayden did not know quite so much about driving them as mordecai did as a consequence they did not make much headway in her excitement mrs hayden ran over beds and whatever came in her way and harrington in order to keep near her ran after her between them they spoiled things about as much as a whole drove of pigs would have done  but at last the pig grew tired of the fun bolted out of the gate and ran across the yard to his own place mrs hayden followed slowly and harrington walked beside her  those pigs are all to be shut up tomorrow she said hiram has been fixing up a place for them in his spare moments and it is ready at last  oh i wouldnt said harrington hastily it isnt good for pigs to be shut up so young youd better let them run a while yet  no said mrs hayden decidedly they have almost worried me to death already in they go tomorrow  they were at the lane gate now and harrington had to open it and let her pass through he felt quite desperate as he watched her trip up through the rows of apple trees her blue gingham skirt brushing the lush grasses where a lacy tangle of sunbeams and shadows lay bobbles and ted came running to meet her and the three hand in hand disappeared from sight  harrington went back to the house feeling that life was flat stale and unprofitable that evening at the tea table he caught himself wondering what it would be like to see mary hayden sitting at his table in place of sarah king with bobbles and ted on either hand then he found out what was the matter with him he was in love fathoms deep with the blueeyed widow  presumably the pigs were shut up the next day for harringtons garden was invaded no more he stood it for a week and then surrendered at discretion he filled a basket with early strawberries and went across to the hayden place boldly enough to all appearance but with his heart thumping like any schoolboys  the front door stood hospitably open flanked by rows of defiant red and yellow hollyhocks harrington paused on the step with his hand outstretched to knock somewhere inside he heard a low sobbing forgetting all about knocking he stepped softly in and walked to the door of the little sittingroom bobbles was standing behind him in the middle of the kitchen but harrington did not see him he was looking at mary hayden who was sitting by the table in the room with her arms flung out over it and her head bowed on them she was crying softly in a hopeless fashion  harrington put down his strawberries mary he exclaimed  mrs hayden straightened herself up with a start and looked at him her lips quivering and her eyes full of tears  what is the matter said harrington anxiously is anything wrong  oh nothing much said mrs hayden trying to recover herself yes there is too but it is very foolish of me to be going on like this i didnt know anyone was near and i was feeling so discouraged the colt broke his leg in the swamp pasture today and hiram had to shoot him it was teds colt but there there is no use in crying over it  and by way of proving this the poor tired overburdened little woman began to cry again she was past caring whether harrington saw her or not  the womanhater was so distressed that he forgot to be nervous he sat down and put his arm around her and spoke out what was in his mind without further parley  dont cry mary listen to me you were never meant to run a farm and be killed with worry you ought to be looked after and petted i want you to marry me and then everything will be all right ive loved you ever since that day i came over here and made you cry do you think you can like me a little mary  it may be that mrs hayden was not very much surprised because harringtons face had been like an open book the day they chased the pig out of the garden together as for what she said perhaps bobbles who was surreptitiously gorging himself on harringtons strawberries may tell you but i certainly shall not  the little brown house among the apple trees is shut up now and the boundary fence belongs to ancient history sarah king has gone also and mrs john harrington reigns royally in her place bobbles and ted have a small blueeyed muchspoiled sister and there is a pig on the estate who may die of old age but will never meet his doom otherwise it is bobbles pig and one of the famous fourteen  mordecai still shambles around and worships mrs harrington the garden is the same as of yore but the house is a different place and harrington is a different man and mordecai will tell you with a chuckle it was them notorious pigs as did it all     why not ask miss price   frances allen came in from the post office and laid an open letter on the table beside her mother who was making mincemeat alma allen looked up from the cake she was frosting to ask what is the matter you look as if your letter contained unwelcome news fan  so it does it is from aunt clara to say she cannot come she has received a telegram that her sisterinlaw is very ill and she must go to her at once  mrs allen looked regretful and alma cast her spoon away with a tragic air  that is too bad i feel as if our celebration were spoiled but i suppose it cant be helped  no agreed frances sitting down and beginning to peel apples so there is no use in lamenting or i would certainly sit down and cry i feel so disappointed  is uncle frank coming  yes aunt clara says he will come down from stellarton if mrs king does not get worse so that will leave just one vacant place we must invite someone to fill it up who shall it be  both girls looked rather puzzled mrs allen smiled a quiet little smile all to herself and went on chopping suet she had handed the thanksgiving dinner over to frances and alma this year they were to attend to all the preparations and invite all the guests but although they had made or planned several innovations in the dinner itself they had made no change in the usual list of guests  it must just be the timehonoured family affair frances had declared if we begin inviting other folks there is no knowing when to draw the line we cant have more than fourteen and some of our friends would be sure to feel slighted  so the same old list it was but now aunt claradear jolly aunt clara whom everybody in the connection loved and admiredcould not come and her place must be filled  we cant invite the new minister because we would have to have his sister too said frances and there is no reason for asking any one of our girl chums more than another  mother you will have to help us out said alma cant you suggest a substitute guest  mrs allen looked down at the two bright girlish faces turned up to her and said slowly i think i can but i am not sure my choice will please you why not ask miss price  miss price they had never thought of her she was the pale timidlooking little teacher in the primary department of the hazelwood school  miss price repeated frances slowly why mother we hardly know her she is dreadfully dull and quiet i think  and so shy said alma why at the wards party the other night she looked startled to death if anyone spoke to her i believe she would be frightened to come here for thanksgiving  she is a very lonely little creature said mrs allen gently and doesnt seem to have anyone belonging to her i think she would be very glad to get an invitation to spend thanksgiving elsewhere than in that cheerless little boardinghouse where she lives  of course if you would like to have her mother we will ask her said frances  no girls said mrs allen seriously you must not ask miss price on my account if you do not feel prepared to make her welcome for her own sake i had hoped that your own kind hearts might have prompted you to extend a little thanksgiving cheer in a truly thanksgiving spirit to a lonely hardworking girl whose life i do not think is a happy one but there i shall not preach this is your dinner and you must please yourselves as to your guests  frances and alma had both flushed and they now remained silent for a few minutes then frances sprang up and threw her arms around her mother  youre right mother dear as you always are and we are very selfish girls we will ask miss price and try to give her a nice time ill go down this very evening and see her                                       in the grey twilight of the chilly autumn evening bertha price walked home to her boardinghouse her pale little face paler and her grey eyes sadder than ever in the fading light only two days until thanksgivingbut there would be no real thanksgiving for her why she asked herself rebelliously when there seemed so much love in the world was she denied her share  her landlady met her in the hall  miss allen is in the parlour miss price she wants to see you  bertha went into the parlour somewhat reluctantly she had met frances allen only once or twice and she was secretly almost afraid of the handsome vivacious girl who was so different from herself  i am sorry you have had to wait miss allen she said shyly i went to see a pupil of mine who is ill and i was kept later than i expected  my errand wont take very long said frances brightly mother wants you to spend thanksgiving day with us miss price if you have no other engagement we will have a few other guests but nobody outside our own family except mr seeley who is the law partner and intimate friend of my brother ernest in town youll come wont you  oh thank you yes said bertha in pleased surprise i shall be very glad to go why it is so nice to think of it i expected my thanksgiving day to be lonely and sadnot a bit thanksgivingy  we shall expect you then said frances with a cordial little handsqueeze come early in the morning and we will have a real friendly pleasant day  that night frances said to her mother and sister you never saw such a transfigured face as miss prices when i asked her up she looked positively prettysuch a lovely pink came out on her cheeks and her eyes shone like stars she reminded me so much of somebody ive seen but i cant think who it is im so glad weve asked her here for thanksgiving                                       thanksgiving came as bright and beautiful as a day could be and the allens guests came with it bertha price was among them paler and shyer than ever ernest allen and his friend maxwell seeley came out from town on the morning train  after all the necessary introductions had been made frances flew to the kitchen  ive found out who it is miss price reminds me of she said as she bustled about the range its max seeley you neednt laugh al its a fact i noticed it the minute i introduced them hes plump and prosperous and shes pinched and pale but theres a resemblance nevertheless look for yourself and see if it isnt so  back in the big cheery parlour the thanksgiving guests were amusing themselves in various ways max seeley had given an odd little start when he was introduced to miss price and as soon as possible he followed her to the corner where she had taken refuge ernest allen was out in the kitchen talking to his sisters the uncles and cousins and aunts were all chattering to each other and mr seeley and miss price were quite unnoticed  you will excuse me wont you miss price if i ask you something about yourself he said eagerly the truth is you look so strikingly like someone i used to know that i feel sure you must be related to her i do not think i have any relatives of your name have you any of mine  bertha flushed hesitated for an instant then said frankly no i do not think so but i may as well tell you that price is not my real name and i do not know what it is although i think it begins with s i believe that my parents died when i was about three years old and i was then taken to an orphan asylum the next year i was taken from there and adopted by mrs price she was very kind to me and treated me as her own daughter i had a happy home with her although we were poor mrs price wished me to bear her name and i did so she never told me my true surname perhaps she did not know it she died when i was sixteen and since then i have been quite alone in the world that is all i know about myself  max seeley was plainly excited  why do you think your real name begins with s he asked  i have a watch which belonged to my mother with the monogram bs on the case it was left with the matron of the asylum and she gave it to mrs price for me here it is  max seeley almost snatched the oldfashioned little silver watch from her hand and opened the case an exclamation escaped him as he pointed to some scratches on the inner side they looked like the initials mas  let me tell my story now he said my name is maxwell seeley my father died when i was seven years old and my mother a year later my little sister bertha then three years old and i were left quite alone and very poor we had no relatives i was adopted by a welltodo old bachelor who had known my father my sister was taken to an orphan asylum in a city some distance away i was very much attached to her and grieved bitterly over our parting my adopted father was very kind to me and gave me a good education i did not forget my sister and as soon as i could i went to the asylum i found that she had been taken away long before and i could not even discover who had adopted her for the original building with all its records had been destroyed by fire two years previous to my visit i never could find any clue to her whereabouts and long since gave up all hope of finding her but i have found her at last you are bertha seeley my little sister  ohcan it be possible  more than possibleit is certain you are the image of my mother as i remember her and as an old daguerreotype i have pictures her and this is her watchsee i scratched my own initials on the case one day there is no doubt in the world oh bertha are you half as glad as i am  glad  berthas eyes were shining like stars she tried to smile but burst into tears instead and her head went down on her brothers shoulder by this time everybody in the room was staring at the extraordinary tableau and ernest coming through the hall gave a whistle of astonishment that brought the two in the corner back to a sense of their surroundings  i havent suddenly gone crazy ernest old fellow smiled max ladies and gentlemen all this little schoolmaam was introduced to you as miss price but that was a mistake let me introduce her again as miss bertha seeley my longlost and newlyfound sister  well they had an amazing time then of course they laughed and questioned and explained until the dinner was in imminent danger of getting stonecold on the diningroom table luckily alma and frances remembered it just in the nick of time and they all got out somehow and into their places it was a splendid dinner but i believe that maxwell and bertha seeley didnt know what they were eating any more than if it had been sawdust however the rest of the guests made up for that and did full justice to the girls cookery  in the afternoon they all went to church and at least two hearts were truly and devoutly thankful that day  when the dusk came ernest and maxwell had to catch the last train for town and the other guests went home with the exception of bertha who was to stay all night just as soon as her resignation could be effected she was to join her brother  meanwhile ill see about getting a house to put you in said max no more boarding out for me ernest you may consider me as a family man henceforth  frances and alma talked it all over before they went to sleep that night  just think said frances if we hadnt asked her here today she might never have found her brother its all mothers doing bless her things do happen like a storybook sometimes dont they al and didnt i tell you they looked alike
