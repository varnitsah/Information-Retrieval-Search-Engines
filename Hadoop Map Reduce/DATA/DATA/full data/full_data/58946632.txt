58946632	heretics   by  gilbert k chesterton    to my father    source  heretics was copyrighted in 1905 by the john lane company this electronic text is derived from the twelfth 1919 edition published by the john lane company of new york city and printed by the plimpton press of norwood massachusetts  the text carefully follows that of the published edition including british spelling   the author  gilbert keith chesterton was born in london england on the 29th of may 1874  though he considered himself a mere rollicking journalist he was actually a prolific and gifted writer in virtually every area of literature  a man of strong opinions and enormously talented at defending them his exuberant personality nevertheless allowed him to maintain warm friendships with peoplesuch as george bernard shaw and h g wellswith whom he vehemently disagreed  chesterton had no difficulty standing up for what he believed he was one of the few journalists to oppose the boer war his 1922 eugenics and other evils attacked what was at that time the most progressive of all ideas the idea that the human race could and should breed a superior version of itself in the nazi experience history demonstrated the wisdom of his once reactionary views  his poetry runs the gamut from the comic 1908 on running after ones hat to dark and serious ballads  during the dark days of 1940 when britain stood virtually alone against the armed might of nazi germany these lines from his 1911 ballad of the white horse were often quoted      i tell you naught for your comfort     yea naught for your desire     save that the sky grows darker yet     and the sea rises higher  though not written for a scholarly audience his biographies of authors and historical figures like charles dickens and st francis of assisi often contain brilliant insights into their subjects his father brown mystery stories written between 1911 and 1936 are still being read and adapted for television  his politics fitted with his deep distrust of concentrated wealth and power of any sort  along with his friend hilaire belloc and in books like the 1910 whats wrong with the world he advocated a view called distributionism that was best summed up by his expression that every man ought to be allowed to own three acres and a cow though not known as a political thinker his political influence has circled the world some see in him the father of the small is beautiful movement and a newspaper article by him is credited with provoking gandhi to seek a genuine nationalism for india rather than one that imitated the british  heretics belongs to yet another area of literature at which chesterton excelled  a funloving and gregarious man he was nevertheless troubled in his adolescence by thoughts of suicide  in christianity he found the answers to the dilemmas and paradoxes he saw in life other books in that same series include his 1908 orthodoxy written in response to attacks on this book and his 1925 the everlasting man orthodoxy is also available as electronic text  chesterton died on the 14th of june 1936 in beaconsfield buckinghamshire england  during his life he published 69 books and at least another ten based on his writings have been published after his death  many of those books are still in print ignatius press is systematically publishing his collected writings     table of

the importance of orthodoxy  nothing more strangely indicates an enormous and silent evil of modern society than the extraordinary use which is made nowadays of the word orthodox  in former days the heretic was proud of not being a heretic  it was the kingdoms of the world and the police and the judges who were heretics he was orthodox  he had no pride in having rebelled against them they had rebelled against him  the armies with their cruel security the kings with their cold faces the decorous processes of state the reasonable processes of lawall these like sheep had gone astray the man was proud of being orthodox was proud of being right if he stood alone in a howling wilderness he was more than a man he was a church  he was the centre of the universe it was round him that the stars swung  all the tortures torn out of forgotten hells could not make him admit that he was heretical but a few modern phrases have made him boast of it  he says with a conscious laugh i suppose i am very heretical and looks round for applause  the word heresy not only means no longer being wrong it practically means being clearheaded and courageous the word orthodoxy not only no longer means being right it practically means being wrong  all this can mean one thing and one thing only  it means that people care less for whether they are philosophically right  for obviously a man ought to confess himself crazy before he confesses himself heretical the bohemian with a red tie ought to pique himself on his orthodoxy the dynamiter laying a bomb ought to feel that whatever else he is at least he is orthodox  it is foolish generally speaking for a philosopher to set fire to another philosopher in smithfield market because they do not agree in their theory of the universe  that was done very frequently in the last decadence of the middle ages and it failed altogether in its object  but there is one thing that is infinitely more absurd and unpractical than burning a man for his philosophy this is the habit of saying that his philosophy does not matter and this is done universally in the twentieth century in the decadence of the great revolutionary period general theories are everywhere contemned the doctrine of the rights of man is dismissed with the doctrine of the fall of man atheism itself is too theological for us today revolution itself is too much of a system liberty itself is too much of a restraint we will have no generalizations  mr bernard shaw has put the view in a perfect epigram  the golden rule is that there is no golden rule we are more and more to discuss details in art politics literature a mans opinion on tramcars matters his opinion on botticelli matters his opinion on all things does not matter  he may turn over and explore a million objects but he must not find that strange object the universe for if he does he will have a religion and be lost everything mattersexcept everything  examples are scarcely needed of this total levity on the subject of cosmic philosophy  examples are scarcely needed to show that whatever else we think of as affecting practical affairs we do not think it matters whether a man is a pessimist or an optimist a cartesian or a hegelian a materialist or a spiritualist let me however take a random instance  at any innocent teatable we may easily hear a man say life is not worth living we regard it as we regard the statement that it is a fine day nobody thinks that it can possibly have any serious effect on the man or on the world  and yet if that utterance were really believed the world would stand on its head murderers would be given medals for saving men from life firemen would be denounced for keeping men from death poisons would be used as medicines doctors would be called in when people were well the royal humane society would be rooted out like a horde of assassins yet we never speculate as to whether the conversational pessimist will strengthen or disorganize society for we are convinced that theories do not matter  this was certainly not the idea of those who introduced our freedom when the old liberals removed the gags from all the heresies their idea was that religious and philosophical discoveries might thus be made their view was that cosmic truth was so important that every one ought to bear independent testimony  the modern idea is that cosmic truth is so unimportant that it cannot matter what any one says the former freed inquiry as men loose a noble hound the latter frees inquiry as men fling back into the sea a fish unfit for eating never has there been so little discussion about the nature of men as now when for the first time any one can discuss it  the old restriction meant that only the orthodox were allowed to discuss religion modern liberty means that nobody is allowed to discuss it good taste the last and vilest of human superstitions has succeeded in silencing us where all the rest have failed sixty years ago it was bad taste to be an avowed atheist then came the bradlaughites the last religious men the last men who cared about god but they could not alter it  it is still bad taste to be an avowed atheist  but their agony has achieved just histhat now it is equally bad taste to be an avowed christian emancipation has only locked the saint in the same tower of silence as the heresiarch  then we talk about lord anglesey and the weather and call it the complete liberty of all the creeds  but there are some people neverthelessand i am one of themwho think that the most practical and important thing about a man is still his view of the universe  we think that for a landlady considering a lodger it is important to know his income but still more important to know his philosophy  we think that for a general about to fight an enemy it is important to know the enemys numbers but still more important to know the enemys philosophy we think the question is not whether the theory of the cosmos affects matters but whether in the long run anything else affects them in the fifteenth century men crossexamined and tormented a man because he preached some immoral attitude in the nineteenth century we feted and flattered oscar wilde because he preached such an attitude and then broke his heart in penal servitude because he carried it out it may be a question which of the two methods was the more cruel there can be no kind of question which was the more ludicrous the age of the inquisition has not at least the disgrace of having produced a society which made an idol of the very same man for preaching the very same things which it made him a convict for practising  now in our time philosophy or religion our theory that is about ultimate things has been driven out more or less simultaneously from two fields which it used to occupy  general ideals used to dominate literature  they have been driven out by the cry of art for arts sake  general ideals used to dominate politics they have been driven out by the cry of efficiency which may roughly be translated as politics for politics sake persistently for the last twenty years the ideals of order or liberty have dwindled in our books the ambitions of wit and eloquence have dwindled in our parliaments literature has purposely become less political politics have purposely become less literary general theories of the relation of things have thus been extruded from both and we are in a position to ask what have we gained or lost by this extrusion  is literature better is politics better for having discarded the moralist and the philosopher  when everything about a people is for the time growing weak and ineffective it begins to talk about efficiency  so it is that when a mans body is a wreck he begins for the first time to talk about health vigorous organisms talk not about their processes but about their aims there cannot be any better proof of the physical efficiency of a man than that he talks cheerfully of a journey to the end of the world and there cannot be any better proof of the practical efficiency of a nation than that it talks constantly of a journey to the end of the world a journey to the judgment day and the new jerusalem there can be no stronger sign of a coarse material health than the tendency to run after high and wild ideals it is in the first exuberance of infancy that we cry for the moon none of the strong men in the strong ages would have understood what you meant by working for efficiency hildebrand would have said that he was working not for efficiency but for the catholic church danton would have said that he was working not for efficiency but for liberty equality and fraternity  even if the ideal of such men were simply the ideal of kicking a man downstairs they thought of the end like men not of the process like paralytics they did not say efficiently elevating my right leg using you will notice the muscles of the thigh and calf which are in excellent order i their feeling was quite different they were so filled with the beautiful vision of the man lying flat at the foot of the staircase that in that ecstasy the rest followed in a flash  in practice the habit of generalizing and idealizing did not by any means mean worldly weakness the time of big theories was the time of big results  in the era of sentiment and fine words at the end of the eighteenth century men were really robust and effective  the sentimentalists conquered napoleon the cynics could not catch de wet  a hundred years ago our affairs for good or evil were wielded triumphantly by rhetoricians now our affairs are hopelessly muddled by strong silent men and just as this repudiation of big words and big visions has brought forth a race of small men in politics so it has brought forth a race of small men in the arts  our modern politicians claim the colossal license of caesar and the superman claim that they are too practical to be pure and too patriotic to be moral but the upshot of it all is that a mediocrity is chancellor of the exchequer our new artistic philosophers call for the same moral license for a freedom to wreck heaven and earth with their energy but the upshot of it all is that a mediocrity is poet laureate i do not say that there are no stronger men than these but will any one say that there are any men stronger than those men of old who were dominated by their philosophy and steeped in their religion whether bondage be better than freedom may be discussed but that their bondage came to more than our freedom it will be difficult for any one to deny  the theory of the unmorality of art has established itself firmly in the strictly artistic classes  they are free to produce anything they like  they are free to write a paradise lost in which satan shall conquer god  they are free to write a divine comedy in which heaven shall be under the floor of hell and what have they done  have they produced in their universality anything grander or more beautiful than the things uttered by the fierce ghibbeline catholic by the rigid puritan schoolmaster we know that they have produced only a few roundels milton does not merely beat them at his piety he beats them at their own irreverence  in all their little books of verse you will not find a finer defiance of god than satans nor will you find the grandeur of paganism felt as that fiery christian felt it who described faranata lifting his head as in disdain of hell and the reason is very obvious  blasphemy is an artistic effect because blasphemy depends upon a philosophical conviction blasphemy depends upon belief and is fading with it if any one doubts this let him sit down seriously and try to think blasphemous thoughts about thor  i think his family will find him at the end of the day in a state of some exhaustion  neither in the world of politics nor that of literature then has the rejection of general theories proved a success it may be that there have been many moonstruck and misleading ideals that have from time to time perplexed mankind  but assuredly there has been no ideal in practice so moonstruck and misleading as the ideal of practicality nothing has lost so many opportunities as the opportunism of lord rosebery  he is indeed a standing symbol of this epochthe man who is theoretically a practical man and practically more unpractical than any theorist  nothing in this universe is so unwise as that kind of worship of worldly wisdom a man who is perpetually thinking of whether this race or that race is strong of whether this cause or that cause is promising is the man who will never believe in anything long enough to make it succeed the opportunist politician is like a man who should abandon billiards because he was beaten at billiards and abandon golf because he was beaten at golf  there is nothing which is so weak for working purposes as this enormous importance attached to immediate victory there is nothing that fails like success  and having discovered that opportunism does fail i have been induced to look at it more largely and in consequence to see that it must fail i perceive that it is far more practical to begin at the beginning and discuss theories  i see that the men who killed each other about the orthodoxy of the homoousion were far more sensible than the people who are quarrelling about the education act for the christian dogmatists were trying to establish a reign of holiness and trying to get defined first of all what was really holy but our modern educationists are trying to bring about a religious liberty without attempting to settle what is religion or what is liberty  if the old priests forced a statement on mankind at least they previously took some trouble to make it lucid it has been left for the modern mobs of anglicans and nonconformists to persecute for a doctrine without even stating it  for these reasons and for many more i for one have come to believe in going back to fundamentals  such is the general idea of this book  i wish to deal with my most distinguished contemporaries not personally or in a merely literary manner but in relation to the real body of doctrine which they teach i am not concerned with mr rudyard kipling as a vivid artist or a vigorous personality i am concerned with him as a hereticthat is to say a man whose view of things has the hardihood to differ from mine  i am not concerned with mr bernard shaw as one of the most brilliant and one of the most honest men alive i am concerned with him as a hereticthat is to say a man whose philosophy is quite solid quite coherent and quite wrong i revert to the doctrinal methods of the thirteenth century inspired by the general hope of getting something done  suppose that a great commotion arises in the street about something let us say a lamppost which many influential persons desire to pull down  a greyclad monk who is the spirit of the middle ages is approached upon the matter and begins to say in the arid manner of the schoolmen let us first of all consider my brethren the value of light  if light be in itself good at this point he is somewhat excusably knocked down  all the people make a rush for the lamppost the lamppost is down in ten minutes and they go about congratulating each other on their unmediaeval practicality but as things go on they do not work out so easily  some people have pulled the lamppost down because they wanted the electric light some because they wanted old iron some because they wanted darkness because their deeds were evil some thought it not enough of a lamppost some too much some acted because they wanted to smash municipal machinery some because they wanted to smash something and there is war in the night no man knowing whom he strikes so gradually and inevitably today tomorrow or the next day there comes back the conviction that the monk was right after all and that all depends on what is the philosophy of light only what we might have discussed under the gaslamp we now must discuss in the dark    ii  on the negative spirit  much has been said and said truly of the monkish morbidity of the hysteria which as often gone with the visions of hermits or nuns but let us never forget that this visionary religion is in one sense necessarily more wholesome than our modern and reasonable morality it is more wholesome for this reason that it can contemplate the idea of success or triumph in the hopeless fight towards the ethical ideal in what stevenson called with his usual startling felicity the lost fight of virtue  a modern morality on the other hand can only point with absolute conviction to the horrors that follow breaches of law its only certainty is a certainty of ill it can only point to imperfection  it has no perfection to point to but the monk meditating upon christ or buddha has in his mind an image of perfect health a thing of clear colours and clean air he may contemplate this ideal wholeness and happiness far more than he ought he may contemplate it to the neglect of exclusion of essential things he may contemplate it until he has become a dreamer or a driveller but still it is wholeness and happiness that he is contemplating he may even go mad but he is going mad for the love of sanity but the modern student of ethics even if he remains sane remains sane from an insane dread of insanity  the anchorite rolling on the stones in a frenzy of submission is a healthier person fundamentally than many a sober man in a silk hat who is walking down cheapside  for many such are good only through a withering knowledge of evil i am not at this moment claiming for the devotee anything more than this primary advantage that though he may be making himself personally weak and miserable he is still fixing his thoughts largely on gigantic strength and happiness on a strength that has no limits and a happiness that has no end doubtless there are other objections which can be urged without unreason against the influence of gods and visions in morality whether in the cell or street  but this advantage the mystic morality must always haveit is always jollier  a young man may keep himself from vice by continually thinking of disease he may keep himself from it also by continually thinking of the virgin mary  there may be question about which method is the more reasonable or even about which is the more efficient but surely there can be no question about which is the more wholesome  i remember a pamphlet by that able and sincere secularist mr g w foote which contained a phrase sharply symbolizing and dividing these two methods  the pamphlet was called beer and bible those two very noble things all the nobler for a conjunction which mr foote in his stern old puritan way seemed to think sardonic but which i confess to thinking appropriate and charming i have not the work by me but i remember that mr foote dismissed very contemptuously any attempts to deal with the problem of strong drink by religious offices or intercessions and said that a picture of a drunkards liver would be more efficacious in the matter of temperance than any prayer or praise in that picturesque expression it seems to me is perfectly embodied the incurable morbidity of modern ethics in that temple the lights are low the crowds kneel the solemn anthems are uplifted  but that upon the altar to which all men kneel is no longer the perfect flesh the body and substance of the perfect man it is still flesh but it is diseased it is the drunkards liver of the new testament that is marred for us which we take in remembrance of him  now it is this great gap in modern ethics the absence of vivid pictures of purity and spiritual triumph which lies at the back of the real objection felt by so many sane men to the realistic literature of the nineteenth century  if any ordinary man ever said that he was horrified by the subjects discussed in ibsen or maupassant or by the plain language in which they are spoken of that ordinary man was lying  the average conversation of average men throughout the whole of modern civilization in every class or trade is such as zola would never dream of printing nor is the habit of writing thus of these things a new habit on the contrary it is the victorian prudery and silence which is new still though it is already dying  the tradition of calling a spade a spade starts very early in our literature and comes down very late  but the truth is that the ordinary honest man whatever vague account he may have given of his feelings was not either disgusted or even annoyed at the candour of the moderns what disgusted him and very justly was not the presence of a clear realism but the absence of a clear idealism strong and genuine religious sentiment has never had any objection to realism on the contrary religion was the realistic thing the brutal thing the thing that called names  this is the great difference between some recent developments of nonconformity and the great puritanism of the seventeenth century  it was the whole point of the puritans that they cared nothing for decency modern nonconformist newspapers distinguish themselves by suppressing precisely those nouns and adjectives which the founders of nonconformity distinguished themselves by flinging at kings and queens but if it was a chief claim of religion that it spoke plainly about evil it was the chief claim of all that it spoke plainly about good the thing which is resented and as i think rightly resented in that great modern literature of which ibsen is typical is that while the eye that can perceive what are the wrong things increases in an uncanny and devouring clarity the eye which sees what things are right is growing mistier and mistier every moment till it goes almost blind with doubt  if we compare let us say the morality of the divine comedy with the morality of ibsens ghosts we shall see all that modern ethics have really done no one i imagine will accuse the author of the inferno of an early victorian prudishness or a podsnapian optimism but dante describes three moral instrumentsheaven purgatory and hell the vision of perfection the vision of improvement and the vision of failure  ibsen has only onehell it is often said and with perfect truth that no one could read a play like ghosts and remain indifferent to the necessity of an ethical selfcommand that is quite true and the same is to be said of the most monstrous and material descriptions of the eternal fire it is quite certain the realists like zola do in one sense promote moralitythey promote it in the sense in which the hangman promotes it in the sense in which the devil promotes it but they only affect that small minority which will accept any virtue of courage  most healthy people dismiss these moral dangers as they dismiss the possibility of bombs or microbes modern realists are indeed terrorists like the dynamiters and they fail just as much in their effort to create a thrill both realists and dynamiters are wellmeaning people engaged in the task so obviously ultimately hopeless of using science to promote morality  i do not wish the reader to confuse me for a moment with those vague persons who imagine that ibsen is what they call a pessimist there are plenty of wholesome people in ibsen plenty of good people plenty of happy people plenty of examples of men acting wisely and things ending well  that is not my meaning my meaning is that ibsen has throughout and does not disguise a certain vagueness and a changing attitude as well as a doubting attitude towards what is really wisdom and virtue in this lifea vagueness which contrasts very remarkably with the decisiveness with which he pounces on something which he perceives to be a root of evil some convention some deception some ignorance we know that the hero of ghosts is mad and we know why he is mad we do also know that dr stockman is sane but we do not know why he is sane ibsen does not profess to know how virtue and happiness are brought about in the sense that he professes to know how our modern sexual tragedies are brought about falsehood works ruin in the pillars of society but truth works equal ruin in the wild duck  there are no cardinal virtues of ibsenism there is no ideal man of ibsen  all this is not only admitted but vaunted in the most valuable and thoughtful of all the eulogies upon ibsen mr bernard shaws quintessence of ibsenism mr shaw sums up ibsens teaching in the phrase the golden rule is that there is no golden rule  in his eyes this absence of an enduring and positive ideal this absence of a permanent key to virtue is the one great ibsen merit i am not discussing now with any fullness whether this is so or not all i venture to point out with an increased firmness is that this omission good or bad does leave us face to face with the problem of a human consciousness filled with very definite images of evil and with no definite image of good to us light must be henceforward the dark thingthe thing of which we cannot speak  to us as to miltons devils in pandemonium it is darkness that is visible  the human race according to religion fell once and in falling gained knowledge of good and of evil now we have fallen a second time and only the knowledge of evil remains to us  a great silent collapse an enormous unspoken disappointment has in our time fallen on our northern civilization  all previous ages have sweated and been crucified in an attempt to realize what is really the right life what was really the good man a definite part of the modern world has come beyond question to the conclusion that there is no answer to these questions that the most that we can do is to set up a few noticeboards at places of obvious danger to warn men for instance against drinking themselves to death or ignoring the mere existence of their neighbours  ibsen is the first to return from the baffled hunt to bring us the tidings of great failure  every one of the popular modern phrases and ideals is a dodge in order to shirk the problem of what is good we are fond of talking about liberty that as we talk of it is a dodge to avoid discussing what is good  we are fond of talking about progress that is a dodge to avoid discussing what is good we are fond of talking about education that is a dodge to avoid discussing what is good  the modern man says let us leave all these arbitrary standards and embrace liberty this is logically rendered let us not decide what is good but let it be considered good not to decide it  he says away with your old moral formulae i am for progress this logically stated means let us not settle what is good but let us settle whether we are getting more of it he says neither in religion nor morality my friend lie the hopes of the race but in education this clearly expressed means we cannot decide what is good but let us give it to our children  mr hg wells that exceedingly clearsighted man has pointed out in a recent work that this has happened in connection with economic questions the old economists he says made generalizations and they were in mr wellss view mostly wrong  but the new economists he says seem to have lost the power of making any generalizations at all and they cover this incapacity with a general claim to be in specific cases regarded as experts a claim proper enough in a hairdresser or a fashionable physician but indecent in a philosopher or a man of science but in spite of the refreshing rationality with which mr wells has indicated this it must also be said that he himself has fallen into the same enormous modern error  in the opening pages of that excellent book mankind in the making he dismisses the ideals of art religion abstract morality and the rest and says that he is going to consider men in their chief function the function of parenthood he is going to discuss life as a tissue of births  he is not going to ask what will produce satisfactory saints or satisfactory heroes but what will produce satisfactory fathers and mothers  the whole is set forward so sensibly that it is a few moments at least before the reader realises that it is another example of unconscious shirking  what is the good of begetting a man until we have settled what is the good of being a man you are merely handing on to him a problem you dare not settle yourself it is as if a man were asked what is the use of a hammer and answered to make hammers and when asked and of those hammers what is the use answered to make hammers again just as such a man would be perpetually putting off the question of the ultimate use of carpentry so mr wells and all the rest of us are by these phrases successfully putting off the question of the ultimate value of the human life  the case of the general talk of progress is indeed an extreme one as enunciated today progress is simply a comparative of which we have not settled the superlative we meet every ideal of religion patriotism beauty or brute pleasure with the alternative ideal of progressthat is to say we meet every proposal of getting something that we know about with an alternative proposal of getting a great deal more of nobody knows what  progress properly understood has indeed a most dignified and legitimate meaning  but as used in opposition to precise moral ideals it is ludicrous  so far from it being the truth that the ideal of progress is to be set against that of ethical or religious finality the reverse is the truth nobody has any business to use the word progress unless he has a definite creed and a castiron code of morals nobody can be progressive without being doctrinal i might almost say that nobody can be progressive without being infallibleat any rate without believing in some infallibility for progress by its very name indicates a direction and the moment we are in the least doubtful about the direction we become in the same degree doubtful about the progress never perhaps since the beginning of the world has there been an age that had less right to use the word progress than we in the catholic twelfth century in the philosophic eighteenth century the direction may have been a good or a bad one men may have differed more or less about how far they went and in what direction but about the direction they did in the main agree and consequently they had the genuine sensation of progress but it is precisely about the direction that we disagree whether the future excellence lies in more law or less law in more liberty or less liberty whether property will be finally concentrated or finally cut up whether sexual passion will reach its sanest in an almost virgin intellectualism or in a full animal freedom whether we should love everybody with tolstoy or spare nobody with nietzschethese are the things about which we are actually fighting most  it is not merely true that the age which has settled least what is progress is this progressive age it is moreover true that the people who have settled least what is progress are the most progressive people in it the ordinary mass the men who have never troubled about progress might be trusted perhaps to progress  the particular individuals who talk about progress would certainly fly to the four winds of heaven when the pistolshot started the race i do not therefore say that the word progress is unmeaning i say it is unmeaning without the previous definition of a moral doctrine and that it can only be applied to groups of persons who hold that doctrine in common progress is not an illegitimate word but it is logically evident that it is illegitimate for us it is a sacred word a word which could only rightly be used by rigid believers and in the ages of faith    iii  on mr rudyard kipling and making the world small  there is no such thing on earth as an uninteresting subject the only thing that can exist is an uninterested person nothing is more keenly required than a defence of bores when byron divided humanity into the bores and bored he omitted to notice that the higher qualities exist entirely in the bores the lower qualities in the bored among whom he counted himself the bore by his starry enthusiasm his solemn happiness may in some sense have proved himself poetical  the bored has certainly proved himself prosaic  we might no doubt find it a nuisance to count all the blades of grass or all the leaves of the trees but this would not be because of our boldness or gaiety but because of our lack of boldness and gaiety the bore would go onward bold and gay and find the blades of grass as splendid as the swords of an army  the bore is stronger and more joyous than we are he is a demigodnay he is a god for it is the gods who do not tire of the iteration of things to them the nightfall is always new and the last rose as red as the first  the sense that everything is poetical is a thing solid and absolute it is not a mere matter of phraseology or persuasion  it is not merely true it is ascertainable  men may be challenged to deny it men may be challenged to mention anything that is not a matter of poetry i remember a long time ago a sensible subeditor coming up to me with a book in his hand called mr smith or the smith family or some such thing  he said well you wont get any of your damned mysticism out of this or words to that effect  i am happy to say that i undeceived him but the victory was too obvious and easy in most cases the name is unpoetical although the fact is poetical in the case of smith the name is so poetical that it must be an arduous and heroic matter for the man to live up to it the name of smith is the name of the one trade that even kings respected it could claim half the glory of that arma virumque which all epics acclaimed  the spirit of the smithy is so close to the spirit of song that it has mixed in a million poems and every blacksmith is a harmonious blacksmith  even the village children feel that in some dim way the smith is poetic as the grocer and the cobbler are not poetic when they feast on the dancing sparks and deafening blows in the cavern of that creative violence  the brute repose of nature the passionate cunning of man the strongest of earthly metals the wierdest of earthly elements the unconquerable iron subdued by its only conqueror the wheel and the ploughshare the sword and the steamhammer the arraying of armies and the whole legend of arms all these things are written briefly indeed but quite legibly on the visitingcard of mr smith yet our novelists call their hero aylmer valence which means nothing or vernon raymond which means nothing when it is in their power to give him this sacred name of smiththis name made of iron and flame it would be very natural if a certain hauteur a certain carriage of the head a certain curl of the lip distinguished every one whose name is smith  perhaps it does i trust so whoever else are parvenus the smiths are not parvenus from the darkest dawn of history this clan has gone forth to battle its trophies are on every hand its name is everywhere it is older than the nations and its sign is the hammer of thor but as i also remarked it is not quite the usual case it is common enough that common things should be poetical it is not so common that common names should be poetical in most cases it is the name that is the obstacle a great many people talk as if this claim of ours that all things are poetical were a mere literary ingenuity a play on words precisely the contrary is true  it is the idea that some things are not poetical which is literary which is a mere product of words the word signalbox is unpoetical  but the thing signalbox is not unpoetical it is a place where men in an agony of vigilance light bloodred and seagreen fires to keep other men from death that is the plain genuine description of what it is the prose only comes in with what it is called  the word pillarbox is unpoetical but the thing pillarbox is not unpoetical it is the place to which friends and lovers commit their messages conscious that when they have done so they are sacred and not to be touched not only by others but even religious touch by themselves that red turret is one of the last of the temples  posting a letter and getting married are among the few things left that are entirely romantic for to be entirely romantic a thing must be irrevocable we think a pillarbox prosaic because there is no rhyme to it we think a pillarbox unpoetical because we have never seen it in a poem  but the bold fact is entirely on the side of poetry a signalbox is only called a signalbox it is a house of life and death a pillarbox is only called a pillarbox it is a sanctuary of human words  if you think the name of smith prosaic it is not because you are practical and sensible it is because you are too much affected with literary refinements  the name shouts poetry at you if you think of it otherwise it is because you are steeped and sodden with verbal reminiscences because you remember everything in punch or comic cuts about mr smith being drunk or mr smith being henpecked  all these things were given to you poetical it is only by a long and elaborate process of literary effort that you have made them prosaic  now the first and fairest thing to say about rudyard kipling is that he has borne a brilliant part in thus recovering the lost provinces of poetry  he has not been frightened by that brutal materialistic air which clings only to words he has pierced through to the romantic imaginative matter of the things themselves he has perceived the significance and philosophy of steam and of slang steam may be if you like a dirty byproduct of science slang may be if you like a dirty byproduct of language but at least he has been among the few who saw the divine parentage of these things and knew that where there is smoke there is firethat is that wherever there is the foulest of things there also is the purest above all he has had something to say a definite view of things to utter and that always means that a man is fearless and faces everything for the moment we have a view of the universe we possess it  now the message of rudyard kipling that upon which he has really concentrated is the only thing worth worrying about in him or in any other man  he has often written bad poetry like wordsworth  he has often said silly things like plato he has often given way to mere political hysteria like gladstone but no one can reasonably doubt that he means steadily and sincerely to say something and the only serious question is what is that which he has tried to say  perhaps the best way of stating this fairly will be to begin with that element which has been most insisted by himself and by his opponentsi mean his interest in militarism but when we are seeking for the real merits of a man it is unwise to go to his enemies and much more foolish to go to himself  now mr kipling is certainly wrong in his worship of militarism but his opponents are generally speaking quite as wrong as he the evil of militarism is not that it shows certain men to be fierce and haughty and excessively warlike  the evil of militarism is that it shows most men to be tame and timid and excessively peaceable the professional soldier gains more and more power as the general courage of a community declines  thus the pretorian guard became more and more important in rome as rome became more and more luxurious and feeble  the military man gains the civil power in proportion as the civilian loses the military virtues and as it was in ancient rome so it is in contemporary europe there never was a time when nations were more militarist there never was a time when men were less brave  all ages and all epics have sung of arms and the man but we have effected simultaneously the deterioration of the man and the fantastic perfection of the arms militarism demonstrated the decadence of rome and it demonstrates the decadence of prussia  and unconsciously mr kipling has proved this and proved it admirably for in so far as his work is earnestly understood the military trade does not by any means emerge as the most important or attractive he has not written so well about soldiers as he has about railway men or bridge builders or even journalists the fact is that what attracts mr kipling to militarism is not the idea of courage but the idea of discipline there was far more courage to the square mile in the middle ages when no king had a standing army but every man had a bow or sword but the fascination of the standing army upon mr kipling is not courage which scarcely interests him but discipline which is when all is said and done his primary theme  the modern army is not a miracle of courage it has not enough opportunities owing to the cowardice of everybody else  but it is really a miracle of organization and that is the truly kiplingite ideal kiplings subject is not that valour which properly belongs to war but that interdependence and efficiency which belongs quite as much to engineers or sailors or mules or railway engines and thus it is that when he writes of engineers or sailors or mules or steamengines he writes at his best  the real poetry the true romance which mr kipling has taught is the romance of the division of labour and the discipline of all the trades he sings the arts of peace much more accurately than the arts of war and his main contention is vital and valuable  every thing is military in the sense that everything depends upon obedience  there is no perfectly epicurean corner there is no perfectly irresponsible place everywhere men have made the way for us with sweat and submission we may fling ourselves into a hammock in a fit of divine carelessness but we are glad that the netmaker did not make the hammock in a fit of divine carelessness  we may jump upon a childs rockinghorse for a joke but we are glad that the carpenter did not leave the legs of it unglued for a joke  so far from having merely preached that a soldier cleaning his sidearm is to be adored because he is military kipling at his best and clearest has preached that the baker baking loaves and the tailor cutting coats is as military as anybody  being devoted to this multitudinous vision of duty mr kipling is naturally a cosmopolitan  he happens to find his examples in the british empire but almost any other empire would do as well or indeed any other highly civilized country that which he admires in the british army he would find even more apparent in the german army that which he desires in the british police he would find flourishing in the french police the ideal of discipline is not the whole of life but it is spread over the whole of the world  and the worship of it tends to confirm in mr kipling a certain note of worldly wisdom of the experience of the wanderer which is one of the genuine charms of his best work  the great gap in his mind is what may be roughly called the lack of patriotismthat is to say he lacks altogether the faculty of attaching himself to any cause or community finally and tragically for all finality must be tragic  he admires england but he does not love her for we admire things with reasons but love them without reasons he admires england because she is strong not because she is english there is no harshness in saying this for to do him justice he avows it with his usual picturesque candour  in a very interesting poem he says that    if england was what england seems  that is weak and inefficient if england were not what as he believes she isthat is powerful and practical    how quick wed chuck er but she aint  he admits that is that his devotion is the result of a criticism and this is quite enough to put it in another category altogether from the patriotism of the boers whom he hounded down in south africa in speaking of the really patriotic peoples such as the irish he has some difficulty in keeping a shrill irritation out of his language the frame of mind which he really describes with beauty and nobility is the frame of mind of the cosmopolitan man who has seen men and cities    for to admire and for to see    for to beold this world so wide  he is a perfect master of that light melancholy with which a man looks back on having been the citizen of many communities of that light melancholy with which a man looks back on having been the lover of many women  he is the philanderer of the nations but a man may have learnt much about women in flirtations and still be ignorant of first love a man may have known as many lands as ulysses and still be ignorant of patriotism  mr rudyard kipling has asked in a celebrated epigram what they can know of england who know england only  it is a far deeper and sharper question to ask what can they know of england who know only the world for the world does not include england any more than it includes the church  the moment we care for anything deeply the worldthat is all the other miscellaneous interestsbecomes our enemy christians showed it when they talked of keeping ones self unspotted from the world but lovers talk of it just as much when they talk of the world well lost  astronomically speaking i understand that england is situated on the world similarly i suppose that the church was a part of the world and even the lovers inhabitants of that orb  but they all felt a certain truththe truth that the moment you love anything the world becomes your foe thus mr kipling does certainly know the world he is a man of the world with all the narrowness that belongs to those imprisoned in that planet he knows england as an intelligent english gentleman knows venice he has been to england a great many times he has stopped there for long visits  but he does not belong to it or to any place and the proof of it is this that he thinks of england as a place the moment we are rooted in a place the place vanishes we live like a tree with the whole strength of the universe  the globetrotter lives in a smaller world than the peasant he is always breathing an air of locality  london is a place to be compared to chicago chicago is a place to be compared to timbuctoo but timbuctoo is not a place since there at least live men who regard it as the universe and breathe not an air of locality but the winds of the world  the man in the saloon steamer has seen all the races of men and he is thinking of the things that divide mendiet dress decorum rings in the nose as in africa or in the ears as in europe blue paint among the ancients or red paint among the modern britons  the man in the cabbage field has seen nothing at all but he is thinking of the things that unite menhunger and babies and the beauty of women and the promise or menace of the sky  mr kipling with all his merits is the globetrotter he has not the patience to become part of anything so great and genuine a man is not to be accused of a merely cynical cosmopolitanism still his cosmopolitanism is his weakness that weakness is splendidly expressed in one of his finest poems the sestina of the tramp royal in which a man declares that he can endure anything in the way of hunger or horror but not permanent presence in one place  in this there is certainly danger the more dead and dry and dusty a thing is the more it travels about dust is like this and the thistledown and the high commissioner in south africa  fertile things are somewhat heavier like the heavy fruit trees on the pregnant mud of the nile  in the heated idleness of youth we were all rather inclined to quarrel with the implication of that proverb which says that a rolling stone gathers no moss  we were inclined to ask who wants to gather moss except silly old ladies but for all that we begin to perceive that the proverb is right the rolling stone rolls echoing from rock to rock but the rolling stone is dead  the moss is silent because the moss is alive  the truth is that exploration and enlargement make the world smaller the telegraph and the steamboat make the world smaller the telescope makes the world smaller it is only the microscope that makes it larger  before long the world will be cloven with a war between the telescopists and the microscopists the first study large things and live in a small world the second study small things and live in a large world  it is inspiriting without doubt to whizz in a motorcar round the earth to feel arabia as a whirl of sand or china as a flash of ricefields but arabia is not a whirl of sand and china is not a flash of ricefields they are ancient civilizations with strange virtues buried like treasures if we wish to understand them it must not be as tourists or inquirers it must be with the loyalty of children and the great patience of poets to conquer these places is to lose them  the man standing in his own kitchengarden with fairyland opening at the gate is the man with large ideas  his mind creates distance the motorcar stupidly destroys it  moderns think of the earth as a globe as something one can easily get round the spirit of a schoolmistress this is shown in the odd mistake perpetually made about cecil rhodes his enemies say that he may have had large ideas but he was a bad man his friends say that he may have been a bad man but he certainly had large ideas  the truth is that he was not a man essentially bad he was a man of much geniality and many good intentions but a man with singularly small views  there is nothing large about painting the map red it is an innocent game for children it is just as easy to think in continents as to think in cobblestones the difficulty comes in when we seek to know the substance of either of them rhodes prophecies about the boer resistance are an admirable comment on how the large ideas prosper when it is not a question of thinking in continents but of understanding a few twolegged men and under all this vast illusion of the cosmopolitan planet with its empires and its reuters agency the real life of man goes on concerned with this tree or that temple with this harvest or that drinkingsong totally uncomprehended totally untouched and it watches from its splendid parochialism possibly with a smile of amusement motorcar civilization going its triumphant way outstripping time consuming space seeing all and seeing nothing roaring on at last to the capture of the solar system only to find the sun cockney and the stars suburban    iv  mr bernard shaw  in the glad old days before the rise of modern morbidities when genial old ibsen filled the world with wholesome joy and the kindly tales of the forgotten emile zola kept our firesides merry and pure it used to be thought a disadvantage to be misunderstood it may be doubted whether it is always or even generally a disadvantage the man who is misunderstood has always this advantage over his enemies that they do not know his weak point or his plan of campaign they go out against a bird with nets and against a fish with arrows there are several modern examples of this situation  mr chamberlain for instance is a very good one  he constantly eludes or vanquishes his opponents because his real powers and deficiencies are quite different to those with which he is credited both by friends and foes his friends depict him as a strenuous man of action his opponents depict him as a coarse man of business when as a fact he is neither one nor the other but an admirable romantic orator and romantic actor he has one power which is the soul of melodramathe power of pretending even when backed by a huge majority that he has his back to the wall for all mobs are so far chivalrous that their heroes must make some show of misfortunethat sort of hypocrisy is the homage that strength pays to weakness  he talks foolishly and yet very finely about his own city that has never deserted him he wears a flaming and fantastic flower like a decadent minor poet as for his bluffness and toughness and appeals to common sense all that is of course simply the first trick of rhetoric he fronts his audiences with the venerable affectation of mark antony    i am no orator as brutus is    but as you know me all a plain blunt man  it is the whole difference between the aim of the orator and the aim of any other artist such as the poet or the sculptor the aim of the sculptor is to convince us that he is a sculptor the aim of the orator is to convince us that he is not an orator once let mr chamberlain be mistaken for a practical man and his game is won  he has only to compose a theme on empire and people will say that these plain men say great things on great occasions he has only to drift in the large loose notions common to all artists of the second rank and people will say that business men have the biggest ideals after all all his schemes have ended in smoke he has touched nothing that he did not confuse about his figure there is a celtic pathos like the gaels in matthew arnolds quotation he went forth to battle but he always fell he is a mountain of proposals a mountain of failures but still a mountain  and a mountain is always romantic  there is another man in the modern world who might be called the antithesis of mr chamberlain in every point who is also a standing monument of the advantage of being misunderstood mr bernard shaw is always represented by those who disagree with him and i fear also if such exist by those who agree with him as a capering humorist a dazzling acrobat a quickchange artist it is said that he cannot be taken seriously that he will defend anything or attack anything that he will do anything to startle and amuse all this is not only untrue but it is glaringly the opposite of the truth it is as wild as to say that dickens had not the boisterous masculinity of jane austen the whole force and triumph of mr bernard shaw lie in the fact that he is a thoroughly consistent man so far from his power consisting in jumping through hoops or standing on his head his power consists in holding his own fortress night and day he puts the shaw test rapidly and rigorously to everything that happens in heaven or earth  his standard never varies the thing which weakminded revolutionists and weakminded conservatives really hate and fear in him is exactly this that his scales such as they are are held even and that his law such as it is is justly enforced  you may attack his principles as i do but i do not know of any instance in which you can attack their application if he dislikes lawlessness he dislikes the lawlessness of socialists as much as that of individualists  if he dislikes the fever of patriotism he dislikes it in boers and irishmen as well as in englishmen if he dislikes the vows and bonds of marriage he dislikes still more the fiercer bonds and wilder vows that are made by lawless love if he laughs at the authority of priests he laughs louder at the pomposity of men of science  if he condemns the irresponsibility of faith he condemns with a sane consistency the equal irresponsibility of art he has pleased all the bohemians by saying that women are equal to men but he has infuriated them by suggesting that men are equal to women he is almost mechanically just he has something of the terrible quality of a machine  the man who is really wild and whirling the man who is really fantastic and incalculable is not mr shaw but the average cabinet minister  it is sir michael hicksbeach who jumps through hoops  it is sir henry fowler who stands on his head the solid and respectable statesman of that type does really leap from position to position he is really ready to defend anything or nothing he is really not to be taken seriously i know perfectly well what mr bernard shaw will be saying thirty years hence he will be saying what he has always said if thirty years hence i meet mr shaw a reverent being with a silver beard sweeping the earth and say to him one can never of course make a verbal attack upon a lady the patriarch will lift his aged hand and fell me to the earth we know i say what mr shaw will be saying thirty years hence but is there any one so darkly read in stars and oracles that he will dare to predict what mr asquith will be saying thirty years hence  the truth is that it is quite an error to suppose that absence of definite convictions gives the mind freedom and agility a man who believes something is ready and witty because he has all his weapons about him  he can apply his test in an instant the man engaged in conflict with a man like mr bernard shaw may fancy he has ten faces similarly a man engaged against a brilliant duellist may fancy that the sword of his foe has turned to ten swords in his hand  but this is not really because the man is playing with ten swords it is because he is aiming very straight with one moreover a man with a definite belief always appears bizarre because he does not change with the world he has climbed into a fixed star and the earth whizzes below him like a zoetrope millions of mild blackcoated men call themselves sane and sensible merely because they always catch the fashionable insanity because they are hurried into madness after madness by the maelstrom of the world  people accuse mr shaw and many much sillier persons of proving that black is white  but they never ask whether the current colourlanguage is always correct  ordinary sensible phraseology sometimes calls black white it certainly calls yellow white and green white and reddishbrown white we call wine white wine which is as yellow as a bluecoat boys legs we call grapes white grapes which are manifestly pale green we give to the european whose complexion is a sort of pink drab the horrible title of a white mana picture more bloodcurdling than any spectre in poe  now it is undoubtedly true that if a man asked a waiter in a restaurant for a bottle of yellow wine and some greenishyellow grapes the waiter would think him mad  it is undoubtedly true that if a government official reporting on the europeans in burmah said there are only two thousand pinkish men here he would be accused of cracking jokes and kicked out of his post  but it is equally obvious that both men would have come to grief through telling the strict truth that too truthful man in the restaurant that too truthful man in burmah is mr bernard shaw  he appears eccentric and grotesque because he will not accept the general belief that white is yellow he has based all his brilliancy and solidity upon the hackneyed but yet forgotten fact that truth is stranger than fiction truth of course must of necessity be stranger than fiction for we have made fiction to suit ourselves  so much then a reasonable appreciation will find in mr shaw to be bracing and excellent  he claims to see things as they are and some things at any rate he does see as they are which the whole of our civilization does not see at all but in mr shaws realism there is something lacking and that thing which is lacking is serious  mr shaws old and recognized philosophy was that powerfully presented in the quintessence of ibsenism  it was in brief that conservative ideals were bad not because they were conservative but because they were ideals  every ideal prevented men from judging justly the particular case every moral generalization oppressed the individual the golden rule was there was no golden rule and the objection to this is simply that it pretends to free men but really restrains them from doing the only thing that men want to do what is the good of telling a community that it has every liberty except the liberty to make laws the liberty to make laws is what constitutes a free people  and what is the good of telling a man or a philosopher that he has every liberty except the liberty to make generalizations  making generalizations is what makes him a man in short when mr shaw forbids men to have strict moral ideals he is acting like one who should forbid them to have children the saying that the golden rule is that there is no golden rule can indeed be simply answered by being turned round that there is no golden rule is itself a golden rule or rather it is much worse than a golden rule  it is an iron rule a fetter on the first movement of a man  but the sensation connected with mr shaw in recent years has been his sudden development of the religion of the superman he who had to all appearance mocked at the faiths in the forgotten past discovered a new god in the unimaginable future  he who had laid all the blame on ideals set up the most impossible of all ideals the ideal of a new creature  but the truth nevertheless is that any one who knows mr shaws mind adequately and admires it properly must have guessed all this long ago  for the truth is that mr shaw has never seen things as they really are if he had he would have fallen on his knees before them he has always had a secret ideal that has withered all the things of this world  he has all the time been silently comparing humanity with something that was not human with a monster from mars with the wise man of the stoics with the economic man of the fabians with julius caesar with siegfried with the superman  now to have this inner and merciless standard may be a very good thing or a very bad one it may be excellent or unfortunate but it is not seeing things as they are it is not seeing things as they are to think first of a briareus with a hundred hands and then call every man a cripple for only having two it is not seeing things as they are to start with a vision of argus with his hundred eyes and then jeer at every man with two eyes as if he had only one and it is not seeing things as they are to imagine a demigod of infinite mental clarity who may or may not appear in the latter days of the earth and then to see all men as idiots  and this is what mr shaw has always in some degree done  when we really see men as they are we do not criticise but worship and very rightly for a monster with mysterious eyes and miraculous thumbs with strange dreams in his skull and a queer tenderness for this place or that baby is truly a wonderful and unnerving matter it is only the quite arbitrary and priggish habit of comparison with something else which makes it possible to be at our ease in front of him a sentiment of superiority keeps us cool and practical the mere facts would make our knees knock under as with religious fear  it is the fact that every instant of conscious life is an unimaginable prodigy it is the fact that every face in the street has the incredible unexpectedness of a fairytale the thing which prevents a man from realizing this is not any clearsightedness or experience it is simply a habit of pedantic and fastidious comparisons between one thing and another  mr shaw on the practical side perhaps the most humane man alive is in this sense inhumane he has even been infected to some extent with the primary intellectual weakness of his new master nietzsche the strange notion that the greater and stronger a man was the more he would despise other things  the greater and stronger a man is the more he would be inclined to prostrate himself before a periwinkle that mr shaw keeps a lifted head and a contemptuous face before the colossal panorama of empires and civilizations this does not in itself convince one that he sees things as they are i should be most effectively convinced that he did if i found him staring with religious astonishment at his own feet what are those two beautiful and industrious beings i can imagine him murmuring to himself whom i see everywhere serving me i know not why what fairy godmother bade them come trotting out of elfland when i was born  what god of the borderland what barbaric god of legs must i propitiate with fire and wine lest they run away with me  the truth is that all genuine appreciation rests on a certain mystery of humility and almost of darkness  the man who said blessed is he that expecteth nothing for he shall not be disappointed put the eulogy quite inadequately and even falsely  the truth blessed is he that expecteth nothing for he shall be gloriously surprised the man who expects nothing sees redder roses than common men can see and greener grass and a more startling sun  blessed is he that expecteth nothing for he shall possess the cities and the mountains blessed is the meek for he shall inherit the earth  until we realize that things might not be we cannot realize that things are until we see the background of darkness we cannot admire the light as a single and created thing  as soon as we have seen that darkness all light is lightening sudden blinding and divine until we picture nonentity we underrate the victory of god and can realize none of the trophies of his ancient war it is one of the million wild jests of truth that we know nothing until we know nothing  now this is i say deliberately the only defect in the greatness of mr shaw the only answer to his claim to be a great man that he is not easily pleased  he is an almost solitary exception to the general and essential maxim that little things please great minds and from this absence of that most uproarious of all things humility comes incidentally the peculiar insistence on the superman after belabouring a great many people for a great many years for being unprogressive mr shaw has discovered with characteristic sense that it is very doubtful whether any existing human being with two legs can be progressive at all  having come to doubt whether humanity can be combined with progress most people easily pleased would have elected to abandon progress and remain with humanity mr shaw not being easily pleased decides to throw over humanity with all its limitations and go in for progress for its own sake if man as we know him is incapable of the philosophy of progress mr shaw asks not for a new kind of philosophy but for a new kind of man  it is rather as if a nurse had tried a rather bitter food for some years on a baby and on discovering that it was not suitable should not throw away the food and ask for a new food but throw the baby out of window and ask for a new baby mr shaw cannot understand that the thing which is valuable and lovable in our eyes is manthe old beerdrinking creedmaking fighting failing sensual respectable man and the things that have been founded on this creature immortally remain the things that have been founded on the fancy of the superman have died with the dying civilizations which alone have given them birth when christ at a symbolic moment was establishing his great society he chose for its cornerstone neither the brilliant paul nor the mystic john but a shuffler a snob a cowardin a word a man and upon this rock he has built his church and the gates of hell have not prevailed against it all the empires and the kingdoms have failed because of this inherent and continual weakness that they were founded by strong men and upon strong men but this one thing the historic christian church was founded on a weak man and for that reason it is indestructible for no chain is stronger than its weakest link    v mr h g wells and the giants  we ought to see far enough into a hypocrite to see even his sincerity we ought to be interested in that darkest and most real part of a man in which dwell not the vices that he does not display but the virtues that he cannot  and the more we approach the problems of human history with this keen and piercing charity the smaller and smaller space we shall allow to pure hypocrisy of any kind the hypocrites shall not deceive us into thinking them saints but neither shall they deceive us into thinking them hypocrites and an increasing number of cases will crowd into our field of inquiry cases in which there is really no question of hypocrisy at all cases in which people were so ingenuous that they seemed absurd and so absurd that they seemed disingenuous  there is one striking instance of an unfair charge of hypocrisy it is always urged against the religious in the past as a point of inconsistency and duplicity that they combined a profession of almost crawling humility with a keen struggle for earthly success and considerable triumph in attaining it  it is felt as a piece of humbug that a man should be very punctilious in calling himself a miserable sinner and also very punctilious in calling himself king of france but the truth is that there is no more conscious inconsistency between the humility of a christian and the rapacity of a christian than there is between the humility of a lover and the rapacity of a lover the truth is that there are no things for which men will make such herculean efforts as the things of which they know they are unworthy there never was a man in love who did not declare that if he strained every nerve to breaking he was going to have his desire and there never was a man in love who did not declare also that he ought not to have it  the whole secret of the practical success of christendom lies in the christian humility however imperfectly fulfilled for with the removal of all question of merit or payment the soul is suddenly released for incredible voyages  if we ask a sane man how much he merits his mind shrinks instinctively and instantaneously it is doubtful whether he merits six feet of earth but if you ask him what he can conquerhe can conquer the stars thus comes the thing called romance a purely christian product a man cannot deserve adventures he cannot earn dragons and hippogriffs the mediaeval europe which asserted humility gained romance the civilization which gained romance has gained the habitable globe how different the pagan and stoical feeling was from this has been admirably expressed in a famous quotation  addison makes the great stoic say    tis not in mortals to command success    but well do more sempronius well deserve it  but the spirit of romance and christendom the spirit which is in every lover the spirit which has bestridden the earth with european adventure is quite opposite  tis not in mortals to deserve success but well do more sempronius well obtain it  and this gay humility this holding of ourselves lightly and yet ready for an infinity of unmerited triumphs this secret is so simple that every one has supposed that it must be something quite sinister and mysterious humility is so practical a virtue that men think it must be a vice humility is so successful that it is mistaken for pride it is mistaken for it all the more easily because it generally goes with a certain simple love of splendour which amounts to vanity humility will always by preference go clad in scarlet and gold pride is that which refuses to let gold and scarlet impress it or please it too much  in a word the failure of this virtue actually lies in its success it is too successful as an investment to be believed in as a virtue humility is not merely too good for this world it is too practical for this world i had almost said it is too worldly for this world  the instance most quoted in our day is the thing called the humility of the man of science and certainly it is a good instance as well as a modern one  men find it extremely difficult to believe that a man who is obviously uprooting mountains and dividing seas tearing down temples and stretching out hands to the stars is really a quiet old gentleman who only asks to be allowed to indulge his harmless old hobby and follow his harmless old nose when a man splits a grain of sand and the universe is turned upside down in consequence it is difficult to realize that to the man who did it the splitting of the grain is the great affair and the capsizing of the cosmos quite a small one  it is hard to enter into the feelings of a man who regards a new heaven and a new earth in the light of a byproduct but undoubtedly it was to this almost eerie innocence of the intellect that the great men of the great scientific period which now appears to be closing owed their enormous power and triumph if they had brought the heavens down like a house of cards their plea was not even that they had done it on principle their quite unanswerable plea was that they had done it by accident whenever there was in them the least touch of pride in what they had done there was a good ground for attacking them but so long as they were wholly humble they were wholly victorious there were possible answers to huxley there was no answer possible to darwin  he was convincing because of his unconsciousness one might almost say because of his dulness  this childlike and prosaic mind is beginning to wane in the world of science men of science are beginning to see themselves as the fine phrase is in the part they are beginning to be proud of their humility they are beginning to be aesthetic like the rest of the world beginning to spell truth with a capital t beginning to talk of the creeds they imagine themselves to have destroyed of the discoveries that their forbears made  like the modern english they are beginning to be soft about their own hardness they are becoming conscious of their own strengththat is they are growing weaker  but one purely modern man has emerged in the strictly modern decades who does carry into our world the clear personal simplicity of the old world of science  one man of genius we have who is an artist but who was a man of science and who seems to be marked above all things with this great scientific humility i mean mr h g wells  and in his case as in the others above spoken of there must be a great preliminary difficulty in convincing the ordinary person that such a virtue is predicable of such a man mr wells began his literary work with violent visionsvisions of the last pangs of this planet can it be that a man who begins with violent visions is humble  he went on to wilder and wilder stories about carving beasts into men and shooting angels like birds is the man who shoots angels and carves beasts into men humble since then he has done something bolder than either of these blasphemies he has prophesied the political future of all men prophesied it with aggressive authority and a ringing decision of detail is the prophet of the future of all men humble  it will indeed be difficult in the present condition of current thought about such things as pride and humility to answer the query of how a man can be humble who does such big things and such bold things for the only answer is the answer which i gave at the beginning of this essay  it is the humble man who does the big things it is the humble man who does the bold things  it is the humble man who has the sensational sights vouchsafed to him and this for three obvious reasons  first that he strains his eyes more than any other men to see them second that he is more overwhelmed and uplifted with them when they come third that he records them more exactly and sincerely and with less adulteration from his more commonplace and more conceited everyday self adventures are to those to whom they are most unexpectedthat is most romantic  adventures are to the shy  in this sense adventures are to the unadventurous  now this arresting mental humility in mr h g wells may be like a great many other things that are vital and vivid difficult to illustrate by examples but if i were asked for an example of it i should have no difficulty about which example to begin with the most interesting thing about mr h g wells is that he is the only one of his many brilliant contemporaries who has not stopped growing  one can lie awake at night and hear him grow of this growth the most evident manifestation is indeed a gradual change of opinions but it is no mere change of opinions it is not a perpetual leaping from one position to another like that of mr george moore  it is a quite continuous advance along a quite solid road in a quite definable direction  but the chief proof that it is not a piece of fickleness and vanity is the fact that it has been upon the whole in advance from more startling opinions to more humdrum opinions  it has been even in some sense an advance from unconventional opinions to conventional opinions this fact fixes mr wellss honesty and proves him to be no poseur mr wells once held that the upper classes and the lower classes would be so much differentiated in the future that one class would eat the other  certainly no paradoxical charlatan who had once found arguments for so startling a view would ever have deserted it except for something yet more startling  mr wells has deserted it in favour of the blameless belief that both classes will be ultimately subordinated or assimilated to a sort of scientific middle class a class of engineers  he has abandoned the sensational theory with the same honourable gravity and simplicity with which he adopted it then he thought it was true now he thinks it is not true he has come to the most dreadful conclusion a literary man can come to the conclusion that the ordinary view is the right one it is only the last and wildest kind of courage that can stand on a tower before ten thousand people and tell them that twice two is four  mr h g wells exists at present in a gay and exhilarating progress of conservativism  he is finding out more and more that conventions though silent are alive  as good an example as any of this humility and sanity of his may be found in his change of view on the subject of science and marriage  he once held i believe the opinion which some singular sociologists still hold that human creatures could successfully be paired and bred after the manner of dogs or horses  he no longer holds that view not only does he no longer hold that view but he has written about it in mankind in the making with such smashing sense and humour that i find it difficult to believe that anybody else can hold it either it is true that his chief objection to the proposal is that it is physically impossible which seems to me a very slight objection and almost negligible compared with the others the one objection to scientific marriage which is worthy of final attention is simply that such a thing could only be imposed on unthinkable slaves and cowards  i do not know whether the scientific marriagemongers are right as they say or wrong as mr wells says in saying that medical supervision would produce strong and healthy men i am only certain that if it did the first act of the strong and healthy men would be to smash the medical supervision  the mistake of all that medical talk lies in the very fact that it connects the idea of health with the idea of care  what has health to do with care  health has to do with carelessness  in special and abnormal cases it is necessary to have care  when we are peculiarly unhealthy it may be necessary to be careful in order to be healthy but even then we are only trying to be healthy in order to be careless if we are doctors we are speaking to exceptionally sick men and they ought to be told to be careful  but when we are sociologists we are addressing the normal man we are addressing humanity and humanity ought to be told to be recklessness itself for all the fundamental functions of a healthy man ought emphatically to be performed with pleasure and for pleasure they emphatically ought not to be performed with precaution or for precaution a man ought to eat because he has a good appetite to satisfy and emphatically not because he has a body to sustain  a man ought to take exercise not because he is too fat but because he loves foils or horses or high mountains and loves them for their own sake and a man ought to marry because he has fallen in love and emphatically not because the world requires to be populated the food will really renovate his tissues as long as he is not thinking about his tissues  the exercise will really get him into training so long as he is thinking about something else  and the marriage will really stand some chance of producing a generousblooded generation if it had its origin in its own natural and generous excitement it is the first law of health that our necessities should not be accepted as necessities they should be accepted as luxuries let us then be careful about the small things such as a scratch or a slight illness or anything that can be managed with care but in the name of all sanity let us be careless about the important things such as marriage or the fountain of our very life will fail  mr wells however is not quite clear enough of the narrower scientific outlook to see that there are some things which actually ought not to be scientific  he is still slightly affected with the great scientific fallacy i mean the habit of beginning not with the human soul which is the first thing a man learns about but with some such thing as protoplasm which is about the last the one defect in his splendid mental equipment is that he does not sufficiently allow for the stuff or material of men in his new utopia he says for instance that a chief point of the utopia will be a disbelief in original sin  if he had begun with the human soulthat is if he had begun on himselfhe would have found original sin almost the first thing to be believed in he would have found to put the matter shortly that a permanent possibility of selfishness arises from the mere fact of having a self and not from any accidents of education or illtreatment and the weakness of all utopias is this that they take the greatest difficulty of man and assume it to be overcome and then give an elaborate account of the overcoming of the smaller ones they first assume that no man will want more than his share and then are very ingenious in explaining whether his share will be delivered by motorcar or balloon  and an even stronger example of mr wellss indifference to the human psychology can be found in his cosmopolitanism the abolition in his utopia of all patriotic boundaries  he says in his innocent way that utopia must be a worldstate or else people might make war on it it does not seem to occur to him that for a good many of us if it were a worldstate we should still make war on it to the end of the world for if we admit that there must be varieties in art or opinion what sense is there in thinking there will not be varieties in government the fact is very simple  unless you are going deliberately to prevent a thing being good you cannot prevent it being worth fighting for it is impossible to prevent a possible conflict of civilizations because it is impossible to prevent a possible conflict between ideals if there were no longer our modern strife between nations there would only be a strife between utopias  for the highest thing does not tend to union only the highest thing tends also to differentiation you can often get men to fight for the union but you can never prevent them from fighting also for the differentiation this variety in the highest thing is the meaning of the fierce patriotism the fierce nationalism of the great european civilization it is also incidentally the meaning of the doctrine of the trinity  but i think the main mistake of mr wellss philosophy is a somewhat deeper one one that he expresses in a very entertaining manner in the introductory part of the new utopia  his philosophy in some sense amounts to a denial of the possibility of philosophy itself at least he maintains that there are no secure and reliable ideas upon which we can rest with a final mental satisfaction it will be both clearer however and more amusing to quote mr wells himself  he says nothing endures nothing is precise and certain except the mind of a pedant  being indeedthere is no being but a universal becoming of individualities and plato turned his back on truth when he turned towards his museum of specific ideals mr wells says again there is no abiding thing in what we know we change from weaker to stronger lights and each more powerful light pierces our hitherto opaque foundations and reveals fresh and different opacities below  now when mr wells says things like this i speak with all respect when i say that he does not observe an evident mental distinction it cannot be true that there is nothing abiding in what we know for if that were so we should not know it all and should not call it knowledge  our mental state may be very different from that of somebody else some thousands of years back but it cannot be entirely different or else we should not be conscious of a difference mr wells must surely realize the first and simplest of the paradoxes that sit by the springs of truth  he must surely see that the fact of two things being different implies that they are similar the hare and the tortoise may differ in the quality of swiftness but they must agree in the quality of motion  the swiftest hare cannot be swifter than an isosceles triangle or the idea of pinkness when we say the hare moves faster we say that the tortoise moves and when we say of a thing that it moves we say without need of other words that there are things that do not move and even in the act of saying that things change we say that there is something unchangeable  but certainly the best example of mr wellss fallacy can be found in the example which he himself chooses  it is quite true that we see a dim light which compared with a darker thing is light but which compared with a stronger light is darkness but the quality of light remains the same thing or else we should not call it a stronger light or recognize it as such if the character of light were not fixed in the mind we should be quite as likely to call a denser shadow a stronger light or vice versa if the character of light became even for an instant unfixed if it became even by a hairsbreadth doubtful if for example there crept into our idea of light some vague idea of blueness then in that flash we have become doubtful whether the new light has more light or less  in brief the progress may be as varying as a cloud but the direction must be as rigid as a french road north and south are relative in the sense that i am north of bournemouth and south of spitzbergen  but if there be any doubt of the position of the north pole there is in equal degree a doubt of whether i am south of spitzbergen at all  the absolute idea of light may be practically unattainable  we may not be able to procure pure light we may not be able to get to the north pole  but because the north pole is unattainable it does not follow that it is indefinable and it is only because the north pole is not indefinable that we can make a satisfactory map of brighton and worthing  in other words plato turned his face to truth but his back on mr h g wells when he turned to his museum of specified ideals it is precisely here that plato shows his sense  it is not true that everything changes the things that change are all the manifest and material things  there is something that does not change and that is precisely the abstract quality the invisible idea mr wells says truly enough that a thing which we have seen in one connection as dark we may see in another connection as light but the thing common to both incidents is the mere idea of lightwhich we have not seen at all mr wells might grow taller and taller for unending aeons till his head was higher than the loneliest star i can imagine his writing a good novel about it  in that case he would see the trees first as tall things and then as short things he would see the clouds first as high and then as low but there would remain with him through the ages in that starry loneliness the idea of tallness he would have in the awful spaces for companion and comfort the definite conception that he was growing taller and not for instance growing fatter  and now it comes to my mind that mr h g wells actually has written a very delightful romance about men growing as tall as trees and that here again he seems to me to have been a victim of this vague relativism  the food of the gods is like mr bernard shaws play in essence a study of the superman idea  and it lies i think even through the veil of a halfpantomimic allegory open to the same intellectual attack  we cannot be expected to have any regard for a great creature if he does not in any manner conform to our standards for unless he passes our standard of greatness we cannot even call him great  nietszche summed up all that is interesting in the superman idea when he said man is a thing which has to be surpassed  but the very word surpass implies the existence of a standard common to us and the thing surpassing us if the superman is more manly than men are of course they will ultimately deify him even if they happen to kill him first but if he is simply more supermanly they may be quite indifferent to him as they would be to another seemingly aimless monstrosity he must submit to our test even in order to overawe us mere force or size even is a standard but that alone will never make men think a man their superior  giants as in the wise old fairytales are vermin  supermen if not good men are vermin  the food of the gods is the tale of jack the giantkiller told from the point of view of the giant  this has not i think been done before in literature but i have little doubt that the psychological substance of it existed in fact  i have little doubt that the giant whom jack killed did regard himself as the superman it is likely enough that he considered jack a narrow and parochial person who wished to frustrate a great forward movement of the lifeforce if as not unfrequently was the case he happened to have two heads he would point out the elementary maxim which declares them to be better than one  he would enlarge on the subtle modernity of such an equipment enabling a giant to look at a subject from two points of view or to correct himself with promptitude but jack was the champion of the enduring human standards of the principle of one man one head and one man one conscience of the single head and the single heart and the single eye jack was quite unimpressed by the question of whether the giant was a particularly gigantic giant  all he wished to know was whether he was a good giantthat is a giant who was any good to us what were the giants religious views what his views on politics and the duties of the citizen  was he fond of childrenor fond of them only in a dark and sinister sense  to use a fine phrase for emotional sanity was his heart in the right place jack had sometimes to cut him up with a sword in order to find out the old and correct story of jack the giantkiller is simply the whole story of man if it were understood we should need no bibles or histories but the modern world in particular does not seem to understand it at all the modern world like mr wells is on the side of the giants the safest place and therefore the meanest and the most prosaic the modern world when it praises its little caesars talks of being strong and brave  but it does not seem to see the eternal paradox involved in the conjunction of these ideas the strong cannot be brave  only the weak can be brave and yet again in practice only those who can be brave can be trusted in time of doubt to be strong  the only way in which a giant could really keep himself in training against the inevitable jack would be by continually fighting other giants ten times as big as himself that is by ceasing to be a giant and becoming a jack thus that sympathy with the small or the defeated as such with which we liberals and nationalists have been often reproached is not a useless sentimentalism at all as mr wells and his friends fancy  it is the first law of practical courage to be in the weakest camp is to be in the strongest school nor can i imagine anything that would do humanity more good than the advent of a race of supermen for them to fight like dragons if the superman is better than we of course we need not fight him but in that case why not call him the saint  but if he is merely stronger whether physically mentally or morally stronger i do not care a farthing then he ought to have to reckon with us at least for all the strength we have  it we are weaker than he that is no reason why we should be weaker than ourselves if we are not tall enough to touch the giants knees that is no reason why we should become shorter by falling on our own but that is at bottom the meaning of all modern heroworship and celebration of the strong man the caesar the superman that he may be something more than man we must be something less  doubtless there is an older and better heroworship than this but the old hero was a being who like achilles was more human than humanity itself  nietzsches superman is cold and friendless achilles is so foolishly fond of his friend that he slaughters armies in the agony of his bereavement  mr shaws sad caesar says in his desolate pride he who has never hoped can never despair the mangod of old answers from his awful hill was ever sorrow like unto my sorrow  a great man is not a man so strong that he feels less than other men he is a man so strong that he feels more and when nietszche says a new commandment i give to you be hard he is really saying a new commandment i give to you be dead sensibility is the definition of life  i recur for a last word to jack the giantkiller i have dwelt on this matter of mr wells and the giants not because it is specially prominent in his mind i know that the superman does not bulk so large in his cosmos as in that of mr bernard shaw i have dwelt on it for the opposite reason because this heresy of immoral heroworship has taken i think a slighter hold of him and may perhaps still be prevented from perverting one of the best thinkers of the day  in the course of the new utopia mr wells makes more than one admiring allusion to mr w e henley that clever and unhappy man lived in admiration of a vague violence and was always going back to rude old tales and rude old ballads to strong and primitive literatures to find the praise of strength and the justification of tyranny  but he could not find it it is not there  the primitive literature is shown in the tale of jack the giantkiller the strong old literature is all in praise of the weak the rude old tales are as tender to minorities as any modern political idealist  the rude old ballads are as sentimentally concerned for the underdog as the aborigines protection society when men were tough and raw when they lived amid hard knocks and hard laws when they knew what fighting really was they had only two kinds of songs  the first was a rejoicing that the weak had conquered the strong the second a lamentation that the strong had for once in a way conquered the weak  for this defiance of the statu quo this constant effort to alter the existing balance this premature challenge to the powerful is the whole nature and inmost secret of the psychological adventure which is called man it is his strength to disdain strength  the forlorn hope is not only a real hope it is the only real hope of mankind in the coarsest ballads of the greenwood men are admired most when they defy not only the king but what is more to the point the hero the moment robin hood becomes a sort of superman that moment the chivalrous chronicler shows us robin thrashed by a poor tinker whom he thought to thrust aside  and the chivalrous chronicler makes robin hood receive the thrashing in a glow of admiration this magnanimity is not a product of modern humanitarianism it is not a product of anything to do with peace this magnanimity is merely one of the lost arts of war the henleyites call for a sturdy and fighting england and they go back to the fierce old stories of the sturdy and fighting english and the thing that they find written across that fierce old literature everywhere is the policy of majuba    vi  christmas and the aesthetes  the world is round so round that the schools of optimism and pessimism have been arguing from the beginning whether it is the right way up the difficulty does not arise so much from the mere fact that good and evil are mingled in roughly equal proportions it arises chiefly from the fact that men always differ about what parts are good and what evil hence the difficulty which besets undenominational religions they profess to include what is beautiful in all creeds but they appear to many to have collected all that is dull in them all the colours mixed together in purity ought to make a perfect white mixed together on any human paintbox they make a thing like mud and a thing very like many new religions  such a blend is often something much worse than any one creed taken separately even the creed of the thugs the error arises from the difficulty of detecting what is really the good part and what is really the bad part of any given religion and this pathos falls rather heavily on those persons who have the misfortune to think of some religion or other that the parts commonly counted good are bad and the parts commonly counted bad are good  it is tragic to admire and honestly admire a human group but to admire it in a photographic negative  it is difficult to congratulate all their whites on being black and all their blacks on their whiteness this will often happen to us in connection with human religions take two institutions which bear witness to the religious energy of the nineteenth century  take the salvation army and the philosophy of auguste comte  the usual verdict of educated people on the salvation army is expressed in some such words as these  i have no doubt they do a great deal of good but they do it in a vulgar and profane style their aims are excellent but their methods are wrong to me unfortunately the precise reverse of this appears to be the truth  i do not know whether the aims of the salvation army are excellent but i am quite sure their methods are admirable their methods are the methods of all intense and hearty religions they are popular like all religion military like all religion public and sensational like all religion  they are not reverent any more than roman catholics are reverent for reverence in the sad and delicate meaning of the term reverence is a thing only possible to infidels that beautiful twilight you will find in euripides in renan in matthew arnold but in men who believe you will not find ityou will find only laughter and war  a man cannot pay that kind of reverence to truth solid as marble they can only be reverent towards a beautiful lie  and the salvation army though their voice has broken out in a mean environment and an ugly shape are really the old voice of glad and angry faith hot as the riots of dionysus wild as the gargoyles of catholicism not to be mistaken for a philosophy professor huxley in one of his clever phrases called the salvation army corybantic christianity  huxley was the last and noblest of those stoics who have never understood the cross  if he had understood christianity he would have known that there never has been and never can be any christianity that is not corybantic  and there is this difference between the matter of aims and the matter of methods that to judge of the aims of a thing like the salvation army is very difficult to judge of their ritual and atmosphere very easy  no one perhaps but a sociologist can see whether general booths housing scheme is right but any healthy person can see that banging brass cymbals together must be right  a page of statistics a plan of model dwellings anything which is rational is always difficult for the lay mind but the thing which is irrational any one can understand that is why religion came so early into the world and spread so far while science came so late into the world and has not spread at all history unanimously attests the fact that it is only mysticism which stands the smallest chance of being understanded of the people common sense has to be kept as an esoteric secret in the dark temple of culture  and so while the philanthropy of the salvationists and its genuineness may be a reasonable matter for the discussion of the doctors there can be no doubt about the genuineness of their brass bands for a brass band is purely spiritual and seeks only to quicken the internal life  the object of philanthropy is to do good the object of religion is to be good if only for a moment amid a crash of brass  and the same antithesis exists about another modern religioni mean the religion of comte generally known as positivism or the worship of humanity  such men as mr frederic harrison that brilliant and chivalrous philosopher who still by his mere personality speaks for the creed would tell us that he offers us the philosophy of comte but not all comtes fantastic proposals for pontiffs and ceremonials the new calendar the new holidays and saints days he does not mean that we should dress ourselves up as priests of humanity or let off fireworks because it is miltons birthday to the solid english comtist all this appears he confesses to be a little absurd  to me it appears the only sensible part of comtism as a philosophy it is unsatisfactory  it is evidently impossible to worship humanity just as it is impossible to worship the savile club both are excellent institutions to which we may happen to belong but we perceive clearly that the savile club did not make the stars and does not fill the universe  and it is surely unreasonable to attack the doctrine of the trinity as a piece of bewildering mysticism and then to ask men to worship a being who is ninety million persons in one god neither confounding the persons nor dividing the substance  but if the wisdom of comte was insufficient the folly of comte was wisdom  in an age of dusty modernity when beauty was thought of as something barbaric and ugliness as something sensible he alone saw that men must always have the sacredness of mummery he saw that while the brutes have all the useful things the things that are truly human are the useless ones  he saw the falsehood of that almost universal notion of today the notion that rites and forms are something artificial additional and corrupt ritual is really much older than thought it is much simpler and much wilder than thought  a feeling touching the nature of things does not only make men feel that there are certain proper things to say it makes them feel that there are certain proper things to do the more agreeable of these consist of dancing building temples and shouting very loud the less agreeable of wearing green carnations and burning other philosophers alive but everywhere the religious dance came before the religious hymn and man was a ritualist before he could speak  if comtism had spread the world would have been converted not by the comtist philosophy but by the comtist calendar  by discouraging what they conceive to be the weakness of their master the english positivists have broken the strength of their religion  a man who has faith must be prepared not only to be a martyr but to be a fool it is absurd to say that a man is ready to toil and die for his convictions when he is not even ready to wear a wreath round his head for them i myself to take a corpus vile am very certain that i would not read the works of comte through for any consideration whatever but i can easily imagine myself with the greatest enthusiasm lighting a bonfire on darwin day  that splendid effort failed and nothing in the style of it has succeeded there has been no rationalist festival no rationalist ecstasy men are still in black for the death of god  when christianity was heavily bombarded in the last century upon no point was it more persistently and brilliantly attacked than upon that of its alleged enmity to human joy shelley and swinburne and all their armies have passed again and again over the ground but they have not altered it  they have not set up a single new trophy or ensign for the worlds merriment to rally to they have not given a name or a new occasion of gaiety mr swinburne does not hang up his stocking on the eve of the birthday of victor hugo  mr william archer does not sing carols descriptive of the infancy of ibsen outside peoples doors in the snow in the round of our rational and mournful year one festival remains out of all those ancient gaieties that once covered the whole earth christmas remains to remind us of those ages whether pagan or christian when the many acted poetry instead of the few writing it in all the winter in our woods there is no tree in glow but the holly  the strange truth about the matter is told in the very word holiday a bank holiday means presumably a day which bankers regard as holy a halfholiday means i suppose a day on which a schoolboy is only partially holy  it is hard to see at first sight why so human a thing as leisure and larkiness should always have a religious origin rationally there appears no reason why we should not sing and give each other presents in honour of anythingthe birth of michael angelo or the opening of euston station  but it does not work as a fact men only become greedily and gloriously material about something spiritualistic  take away the nicene creed and similar things and you do some strange wrong to the sellers of sausages take away the strange beauty of the saints and what has remained to us is the far stranger ugliness of wandsworth take away the supernatural and what remains is the unnatural  and now i have to touch upon a very sad matter  there are in the modern world an admirable class of persons who really make protest on behalf of that antiqua pulchritudo of which augustine spoke who do long for the old feasts and formalities of the childhood of the world william morris and his followers showed how much brighter were the dark ages than the age of manchester  mr w b yeats frames his steps in prehistoric dances but no man knows and joins his voice to forgotten choruses that no one but he can hear  mr george moore collects every fragment of irish paganism that the forgetfulness of the catholic church has left or possibly her wisdom preserved there are innumerable persons with eyeglasses and green garments who pray for the return of the maypole or the olympian games but there is about these people a haunting and alarming something which suggests that it is just possible that they do not keep christmas it is painful to regard human nature in such a light but it seems somehow possible that mr george moore does not wave his spoon and shout when the pudding is set alight it is even possible that mr w b yeats never pulls crackers if so where is the sense of all their dreams of festive traditions here is a solid and ancient festive tradition still plying a roaring trade in the streets and they think it vulgar if this is so let them be very certain of this that they are the kind of people who in the time of the maypole would have thought the maypole vulgar who in the time of the canterbury pilgrimage would have thought the canterbury pilgrimage vulgar who in the time of the olympian games would have thought the olympian games vulgar nor can there be any reasonable doubt that they were vulgar let no man deceive himself if by vulgarity we mean coarseness of speech rowdiness of behaviour gossip horseplay and some heavy drinking vulgarity there always was wherever there was joy wherever there was faith in the gods  wherever you have belief you will have hilarity wherever you have hilarity you will have some dangers  and as creed and mythology produce this gross and vigorous life so in its turn this gross and vigorous life will always produce creed and mythology if we ever get the english back on to the english land they will become again a religious people if all goes well a superstitious people the absence from modern life of both the higher and lower forms of faith is largely due to a divorce from nature and the trees and clouds if we have no more turnip ghosts it is chiefly from the lack of turnips    vii  omar and the sacred vine  a new morality has burst upon us with some violence in connection with the problem of strong drink and enthusiasts in the matter range from the man who is violently thrown out at 1230 to the lady who smashes american bars with an axe  in these discussions it is almost always felt that one very wise and moderate position is to say that wine or such stuff should only be drunk as a medicine with this i should venture to disagree with a peculiar ferocity the one genuinely dangerous and immoral way of drinking wine is to drink it as a medicine  and for this reason if a man drinks wine in order to obtain pleasure he is trying to obtain something exceptional something he does not expect every hour of the day something which unless he is a little insane he will not try to get every hour of the day  but if a man drinks wine in order to obtain health he is trying to get something natural something that is that he ought not to be without something that he may find it difficult to reconcile himself to being without  the man may not be seduced who has seen the ecstasy of being ecstatic it is more dazzling to catch a glimpse of the ecstasy of being ordinary if there were a magic ointment and we took it to a strong man and said this will enable you to jump off the monument doubtless he would jump off the monument but he would not jump off the monument all day long to the delight of the city but if we took it to a blind man saying this will enable you to see he would be under a heavier temptation  it would be hard for him not to rub it on his eyes whenever he heard the hoof of a noble horse or the birds singing at daybreak  it is easy to deny ones self festivity it is difficult to deny ones self normality hence comes the fact which every doctor knows that it is often perilous to give alcohol to the sick even when they need it i need hardly say that i do not mean that i think the giving of alcohol to the sick for stimulus is necessarily unjustifiable but i do mean that giving it to the healthy for fun is the proper use of it and a great deal more consistent with health  the sound rule in the matter would appear to be like many other sound rulesa paradox  drink because you are happy but never because you are miserable  never drink when you are wretched without it or you will be like the greyfaced gindrinker in the slum but drink when you would be happy without it and you will be like the laughing peasant of italy  never drink because you need it for this is rational drinking and the way to death and hell but drink because you do not need it for this is irrational drinking and the ancient health of the world  for more than thirty years the shadow and glory of a great eastern figure has lain upon our english literature fitzgeralds translation of omar khayyam concentrated into an immortal poignancy all the dark and drifting hedonism of our time of the literary splendour of that work it would be merely banal to speak in few other of the books of men has there been anything so combining the gay pugnacity of an epigram with the vague sadness of a song but of its philosophical ethical and religious influence which has been almost as great as its brilliancy i should like to say a word and that word i confess one of uncompromising hostility there are a great many things which might be said against the spirit of the rubaiyat and against its prodigious influence but one matter of indictment towers ominously above the resta genuine disgrace to it a genuine calamity to us  this is the terrible blow that this great poem has struck against sociability and the joy of life  some one called omar the sad glad old persian sad he is glad he is not in any sense of the word whatever he has been a worse foe to gladness than the puritans  a pensive and graceful oriental lies under the rosetree with his winepot and his scroll of poems  it may seem strange that any ones thoughts should at the moment of regarding him fly back to the dark bedside where the doctor doles out brandy it may seem stranger still that they should go back to the grey wastrel shaking with gin in houndsditch but a great philosophical unity links the three in an evil bond omar khayyams winebibbing is bad not because it is winebibbing it is bad and very bad because it is medical winebibbing it is the drinking of a man who drinks because he is not happy his is the wine that shuts out the universe not the wine that reveals it it is not poetical drinking which is joyous and instinctive it is rational drinking which is as prosaic as an investment as unsavoury as a dose of camomile  whole heavens above it from the point of view of sentiment though not of style rises the splendour of some old english drinkingsong    then pass the bowl my comrades all    and let the zider vlow  for this song was caught up by happy men to express the worth of truly worthy things of brotherhood and garrulity and the brief and kindly leisure of the poor  of course the great part of the more stolid reproaches directed against the omarite morality are as false and babyish as such reproaches usually are  one critic whose work i have read had the incredible foolishness to call omar an atheist and a materialist  it is almost impossible for an oriental to be either the east understands metaphysics too well for that of course the real objection which a philosophical christian would bring against the religion of omar is not that he gives no place to god it is that he gives too much place to god his is that terrible theism which can imagine nothing else but deity and which denies altogether the outlines of human personality and human will    the ball no question makes of ayes or noes    but here or there as strikes the player goes    and he that tossed you down into the field    he knows about it allhe knowshe knows  a christian thinker such as augustine or dante would object to this because it ignores freewill which is the valour and dignity of the soul the quarrel of the highest christianity with this scepticism is not in the least that the scepticism denies the existence of god it is that it denies the existence of man  in this cult of the pessimistic pleasureseeker the rubaiyat stands first in our time but it does not stand alone many of the most brilliant intellects of our time have urged us to the same selfconscious snatching at a rare delight walter pater said that we were all under sentence of death and the only course was to enjoy exquisite moments simply for those moments sake  the same lesson was taught by the very powerful and very desolate philosophy of oscar wilde it is the carpe diem religion but the carpe diem religion is not the religion of happy people but of very unhappy people great joy does not gather the rosebuds while it may its eyes are fixed on the immortal rose which dante saw great joy has in it the sense of immortality the very splendour of youth is the sense that it has all space to stretch its legs in in all great comic literature in tristram shandy or pickwick there is this sense of space and incorruptibility we feel the characters are deathless people in an endless tale  it is true enough of course that a pungent happiness comes chiefly in certain passing moments but it is not true that we should think of them as passing or enjoy them simply for those moments sake to do this is to rationalize the happiness and therefore to destroy it happiness is a mystery like religion and should never be rationalized suppose a man experiences a really splendid moment of pleasure i do not mean something connected with a bit of enamel i mean something with a violent happiness in itan almost painful happiness a man may have for instance a moment of ecstasy in first love or a moment of victory in battle  the lover enjoys the moment but precisely not for the moments sake  he enjoys it for the womans sake or his own sake the warrior enjoys the moment but not for the sake of the moment he enjoys it for the sake of the flag the cause which the flag stands for may be foolish and fleeting the love may be calflove and last a week  but the patriot thinks of the flag as eternal the lover thinks of his love as something that cannot end  these moments are filled with eternity these moments are joyful because they do not seem momentary once look at them as moments after paters manner and they become as cold as pater and his style  man cannot love mortal things he can only love immortal things for an instant  paters mistake is revealed in his most famous phrase he asks us to burn with a hard gemlike flame  flames are never hard and never gemlikethey cannot be handled or arranged so human emotions are never hard and never gemlike they are always dangerous like flames to touch or even to examine there is only one way in which our passions can become hard and gemlike and that is by becoming as cold as gems no blow then has ever been struck at the natural loves and laughter of men so sterilizing as this carpe diem of the aesthetes for any kind of pleasure a totally different spirit is required a certain shyness a certain indeterminate hope a certain boyish expectation purity and simplicity are essential to passionsyes even to evil passions  even vice demands a sort of virginity  omars or fitzgeralds effect upon the other world we may let go his hand upon this world has been heavy and paralyzing the puritans as i have said are far jollier than he the new ascetics who follow thoreau or tolstoy are much livelier company for though the surrender of strong drink and such luxuries may strike us as an idle negation it may leave a man with innumerable natural pleasures and above all with mans natural power of happiness thoreau could enjoy the sunrise without a cup of coffee  if tolstoy cannot admire marriage at least he is healthy enough to admire mud nature can be enjoyed without even the most natural luxuries a good bush needs no wine  but neither nature nor wine nor anything else can be enjoyed if we have the wrong attitude towards happiness and omar or fitzgerald did have the wrong attitude towards happiness he and those he has influenced do not see that if we are to be truly gay we must believe that there is some eternal gaiety in the nature of things we cannot enjoy thoroughly even a pasdequatre at a subscription dance unless we believe that the stars are dancing to the same tune  no one can be really hilarious but the serious man  wine says the scripture maketh glad the heart of man but only of the man who has a heart the thing called high spirits is possible only to the spiritual ultimately a man cannot rejoice in anything except the nature of things ultimately a man can enjoy nothing except religion  once in the worlds history men did believe that the stars were dancing to the tune of their temples and they danced as men have never danced since with this old pagan eudaemonism the sage of the rubaiyat has quite as little to do as he has with any christian variety he is no more a bacchanal than he is a saint  dionysus and his church was grounded on a serious joiedevivre like that of walt whitman dionysus made wine not a medicine but a sacrament jesus christ also made wine not a medicine but a sacrament but omar makes it not a sacrament but a medicine  he feasts because life is not joyful he revels because he is not glad drink he says for you know not whence you come nor why drink for you know not when you go nor where  drink because the stars are cruel and the world as idle as a hummingtop drink because there is nothing worth trusting nothing worth fighting for drink because all things are lapsed in a base equality and an evil peace  so he stands offering us the cup in his hand and at the high altar of christianity stands another figure in whose hand also is the cup of the vine drink he says for the whole world is as red as this wine with the crimson of the love and wrath of god  drink for the trumpets are blowing for battle and this is the stirrupcup drink for this my blood of the new testament that is shed for you  drink for i know of whence you come and why drink for i know of when you go and where    viii  the mildness of the yellow press  there is a great deal of protest made from one quarter or another nowadays against the influence of that new journalism which is associated with the names of sir alfred harmsworth and mr pearson but almost everybody who attacks it attacks on the ground that it is very sensational very violent and vulgar and startling i am speaking in no affected contrariety but in the simplicity of a genuine personal impression when i say that this journalism offends as being not sensational or violent enough  the real vice is not that it is startling but that it is quite insupportably tame the whole object is to keep carefully along a certain level of the expected and the commonplace it may be low but it must take care also to be flat never by any chance in it is there any of that real plebeian pungency which can be heard from the ordinary cabman in the ordinary street  we have heard of a certain standard of decorum which demands that things should be funny without being vulgar but the standard of this decorum demands that if things are vulgar they shall be vulgar without being funny  this journalism does not merely fail to exaggerate lifeit positively underrates it and it has to do so because it is intended for the faint and languid recreation of men whom the fierceness of modern life has fatigued this press is not the yellow press at all it is the drab press sir alfred harmsworth must not address to the tired clerk any observation more witty than the tired clerk might be able to address to sir alfred harmsworth  it must not expose anybody anybody who is powerful that is it must not offend anybody it must not even please anybody too much  a general vague idea that in spite of all this our yellow press is sensational arises from such external accidents as large type or lurid headlines it is quite true that these editors print everything they possibly can in large capital letters but they do this not because it is startling but because it is soothing  to people wholly weary or partly drunk in a dimly lighted train it is a simplification and a comfort to have things presented in this vast and obvious manner the editors use this gigantic alphabet in dealing with their readers for exactly the same reason that parents and governesses use a similar gigantic alphabet in teaching children to spell the nursery authorities do not use an a as big as a horseshoe in order to make the child jump on the contrary they use it to put the child at his ease to make things smoother and more evident of the same character is the dim and quiet dame school which sir alfred harmsworth and mr pearson keep  all their sentiments are spellingbook sentimentsthat is to say they are sentiments with which the pupil is already respectfully familiar all their wildest posters are leaves torn from a copybook  of real sensational journalism as it exists in france in ireland and in america we have no trace in this country when a journalist in ireland wishes to create a thrill he creates a thrill worth talking about  he denounces a leading irish member for corruption or he charges the whole police system with a wicked and definite conspiracy when a french journalist desires a frisson there is a frisson he discovers let us say that the president of the republic has murdered three wives our yellow journalists invent quite as unscrupulously as this their moral condition is as regards careful veracity about the same but it is their mental calibre which happens to be such that they can only invent calm and even reassuring things the fictitious version of the massacre of the envoys of pekin was mendacious but it was not interesting except to those who had private reasons for terror or sorrow  it was not connected with any bold and suggestive view of the chinese situation it revealed only a vague idea that nothing could be impressive except a great deal of blood  real sensationalism of which i happen to be very fond may be either moral or immoral but even when it is most immoral it requires moral courage for it is one of the most dangerous things on earth genuinely to surprise anybody  if you make any sentient creature jump you render it by no means improbable that it will jump on you but the leaders of this movement have no moral courage or immoral courage their whole method consists in saying with large and elaborate emphasis the things which everybody else says casually and without remembering what they have said  when they brace themselves up to attack anything they never reach the point of attacking anything which is large and real and would resound with the shock  they do not attack the army as men do in france or the judges as men do in ireland or the democracy itself as men did in england a hundred years ago they attack something like the war officesomething that is which everybody attacks and nobody bothers to defend something which is an old joke in fourthrate comic papers just as a man shows he has a weak voice by straining it to shout so they show the hopelessly unsensational nature of their minds when they really try to be sensational with the whole world full of big and dubious institutions with the whole wickedness of civilization staring them in the face their idea of being bold and bright is to attack the war office they might as well start a campaign against the weather or form a secret society in order to make jokes about mothersinlaw nor is it only from the point of view of particular amateurs of the sensational such as myself that it is permissible to say in the words of cowpers alexander selkirk that their tameness is shocking to me the whole modern world is pining for a genuinely sensational journalism this has been discovered by that very able and honest journalist mr blatchford who started his campaign against christianity warned on all sides i believe that it would ruin his paper but who continued from an honourable sense of intellectual responsibility he discovered however that while he had undoubtedly shocked his readers he had also greatly advanced his newspaper it was boughtfirst by all the people who agreed with him and wanted to read it and secondly by all the people who disagreed with him and wanted to write him letters  those letters were voluminous i helped i am glad to say to swell their volume and they were generally inserted with a generous fulness  thus was accidentally discovered like the steamengine the great journalistic maximthat if an editor can only make people angry enough they will write half his newspaper for him for nothing  some hold that such papers as these are scarcely the proper objects of so serious a consideration but that can scarcely be maintained from a political or ethical point of view in this problem of the mildness and tameness of the harmsworth mind there is mirrored the outlines of a much larger problem which is akin to it  the harmsworthian journalist begins with a worship of success and violence and ends in sheer timidity and mediocrity but he is not alone in this nor does he come by this fate merely because he happens personally to be stupid  every man however brave who begins by worshipping violence must end in mere timidity every man however wise who begins by worshipping success must end in mere mediocrity this strange and paradoxical fate is involved not in the individual but in the philosophy in the point of view it is not the folly of the man which brings about this necessary fall it is his wisdom  the worship of success is the only one out of all possible worships of which this is true that its followers are foredoomed to become slaves and cowards a man may be a hero for the sake of mrs gallups ciphers or for the sake of human sacrifice but not for the sake of success for obviously a man may choose to fail because he loves mrs gallup or human sacrifice but he cannot choose to fail because he loves success when the test of triumph is mens test of everything they never endure long enough to triumph at all as long as matters are really hopeful hope is a mere flattery or platitude it is only when everything is hopeless that hope begins to be a strength at all  like all the christian virtues it is as unreasonable as it is indispensable  it was through this fatal paradox in the nature of things that all these modern adventurers come at last to a sort of tedium and acquiescence they desired strength and to them to desire strength was to admire strength to admire strength was simply to admire the statu quo they thought that he who wished to be strong ought to respect the strong they did not realize the obvious verity that he who wishes to be strong must despise the strong  they sought to be everything to have the whole force of the cosmos behind them to have an energy that would drive the stars  but they did not realize the two great factsfirst that in the attempt to be everything the first and most difficult step is to be something second that the moment a man is something he is essentially defying everything the lower animals say the men of science fought their way up with a blind selfishness  if this be so the only real moral of it is that our unselfishness if it is to triumph must be equally blind the mammoth did not put his head on one side and wonder whether mammoths were a little out of date mammoths were at least as much up to date as that individual mammoth could make them the great elk did not say cloven hoofs are very much worn now he polished his own weapons for his own use  but in the reasoning animal there has arisen a more horrible danger that he may fail through perceiving his own failure  when modern sociologists talk of the necessity of accommodating ones self to the trend of the time they forget that the trend of the time at its best consists entirely of people who will not accommodate themselves to anything at its worst it consists of many millions of frightened creatures all accommodating themselves to a trend that is not there and that is becoming more and more the situation of modern england every man speaks of public opinion and means by public opinion public opinion minus his opinion every man makes his contribution negative under the erroneous impression that the next mans contribution is positive  every man surrenders his fancy to a general tone which is itself a surrender and over all the heartless and fatuous unity spreads this new and wearisome and platitudinous press incapable of invention incapable of audacity capable only of a servility all the more contemptible because it is not even a servility to the strong but all who begin with force and conquest will end in this  the chief characteristic of the new journalism is simply that it is bad journalism  it is beyond all comparison the most shapeless careless and colourless work done in our day  i read yesterday a sentence which should be written in letters of gold and adamant it is the very motto of the new philosophy of empire i found it as the reader has already eagerly guessed in pearsons magazine while i was communing soul to soul with mr c arthur pearson whose first and suppressed name i am afraid is chilperic it occurred in an article on the american presidential election this is the sentence and every one should read it carefully and roll it on the tongue till all the honey be tasted  a little sound common sense often goes further with an audience of american workingmen than much highflown argument  a speaker who as he brought forward his points hammered nails into a board won hundreds of votes for his side at the last presidential election  i do not wish to soil this perfect thing with comment the words of mercury are harsh after the songs of apollo but just think for a moment of the mind the strange inscrutable mind of the man who wrote that of the editor who approved it of the people who are probably impressed by it of the incredible american workingman of whom for all i know it may be true think what their notion of common sense must be  it is delightful to realize that you and i are now able to win thousands of votes should we ever be engaged in a presidential election by doing something of this kind  for i suppose the nails and the board are not essential to the exhibition of common sense there may be variations we may read  a little common sense impresses american workingmen more than highflown argument  a speaker who as he made his points pulled buttons off his waistcoat won thousands of votes for his side or sound common sense tells better in america than highflown argument thus senator budge who threw his false teeth in the air every time he made an epigram won the solid approval of american workingmen or again the sound common sense of a gentleman from earlswood who stuck straws in his hair during the progress of his speech assured the victory of mr roosevelt  there are many other elements in this article on which i should love to linger  but the matter which i wish to point out is that in that sentence is perfectly revealed the whole truth of what our chamberlainites hustlers bustlers empirebuilders and strong silent men really mean by commonsense  they mean knocking with deafening noise and dramatic effect meaningless bits of iron into a useless bit of wood  a man goes on to an american platform and behaves like a mountebank fool with a board and a hammer well i do not blame him i might even admire him he may be a dashing and quite decent strategist  he may be a fine romantic actor like burke flinging the dagger on the floor he may even for all i know be a sublime mystic profoundly impressed with the ancient meaning of the divine trade of the carpenter and offering to the people a parable in the form of a ceremony all i wish to indicate is the abyss of mental confusion in which such wild ritualism can be called sound common sense and it is in that abyss of mental confusion and in that alone that the new imperialism lives and moves and has its being the whole glory and greatness of mr chamberlain consists in this that if a man hits the right nail on the head nobody cares where he hits it to or what it does  they care about the noise of the hammer not about the silent drip of the nail  before and throughout the african war mr chamberlain was always knocking in nails with ringing decisiveness but when we ask but what have these nails held together where is your carpentry  where are your contented outlanders where is your free south africa  where is your british prestige what have your nails done then what answer is there we must go back with an affectionate sigh to our pearson for the answer to the question of what the nails have done the speaker who hammered nails into a board won thousands of votes  now the whole of this passage is admirably characteristic of the new journalism which mr pearson represents the new journalism which has just purchased the standard  to take one instance out of hundreds the incomparable man with the board and nails is described in the pearsons article as calling out as he smote the symbolic nail lie number one nailed to the mast  nailed to the mast  in the whole office there was apparently no compositor or officeboy to point out that we speak of lies being nailed to the counter and not to the mast nobody in the office knew that pearsons magazine was falling into a stale irish bull which must be as old as st patrick this is the real and essential tragedy of the sale of the standard it is not merely that journalism is victorious over literature it is that bad journalism is victorious over good journalism  it is not that one article which we consider costly and beautiful is being ousted by another kind of article which we consider common or unclean it is that of the same article a worse quality is preferred to a better if you like popular journalism as i do you will know that pearsons magazine is poor and weak popular journalism  you will know it as certainly as you know bad butter  you will know as certainly that it is poor popular journalism as you know that the strand in the great days of sherlock holmes was good popular journalism mr pearson has been a monument of this enormous banality about everything he says and does there is something infinitely weakminded he clamours for home trades and employs foreign ones to print his paper  when this glaring fact is pointed out he does not say that the thing was an oversight like a sane man he cuts it off with scissors like a child of three  his very cunning is infantile  and like a child of three he does not cut it quite off in all human records i doubt if there is such an example of a profound simplicity in deception  this is the sort of intelligence which now sits in the seat of the sane and honourable old tory journalism if it were really the triumph of the tropical exuberance of the yankee press it would be vulgar but still tropical  but it is not we are delivered over to the bramble and from the meanest of the shrubs comes the fire upon the cedars of lebanon  the only question now is how much longer the fiction will endure that journalists of this order represent public opinion it may be doubted whether any honest and serious tariff reformer would for a moment maintain that there was any majority for tariff reform in the country comparable to the ludicrous preponderance which money has given it among the great dailies the only inference is that for purposes of real public opinion the press is now a mere plutocratic oligarchy doubtless the public buys the wares of these men for one reason or another but there is no more reason to suppose that the public admires their politics than that the public admires the delicate philosophy of mr crosse or the darker and sterner creed of mr blackwell if these men are merely tradesmen there is nothing to say except that there are plenty like them in the battersea park road and many much better  but if they make any sort of attempt to be politicians we can only point out to them that they are not as yet even good journalists    ix  the moods of mr george moore  mr george moore began his literary career by writing his personal confessions nor is there any harm in this if he had not continued them for the remainder of his life  he is a man of genuinely forcible mind and of great command over a kind of rhetorical and fugitive conviction which excites and pleases he is in a perpetual state of temporary honesty  he has admired all the most admirable modern eccentrics until they could stand it no longer  everything he writes it is to be fully admitted has a genuine mental power  his account of his reason for leaving the roman catholic church is possibly the most admirable tribute to that communion which has been written of late years for the fact of the matter is that the weakness which has rendered barren the many brilliancies of mr moore is actually that weakness which the roman catholic church is at its best in combating mr moore hates catholicism because it breaks up the house of lookingglasses in which he lives  mr moore does not dislike so much being asked to believe in the spiritual existence of miracles or sacraments but he does fundamentally dislike being asked to believe in the actual existence of other people like his master pater and all the aesthetes his real quarrel with life is that it is not a dream that can be moulded by the dreamer it is not the dogma of the reality of the other world that troubles him but the dogma of the reality of this world  the truth is that the tradition of christianity which is still the only coherent ethic of europe rests on two or three paradoxes or mysteries which can easily be impugned in argument and as easily justified in life one of them for instance is the paradox of hope or faiththat the more hopeless is the situation the more hopeful must be the man stevenson understood this and consequently mr moore cannot understand stevenson  another is the paradox of charity or chivalry that the weaker a thing is the more it should be respected that the more indefensible a thing is the more it should appeal to us for a certain kind of defence  thackeray understood this and therefore mr moore does not understand thackeray  now one of these very practical and working mysteries in the christian tradition and one which the roman catholic church as i say has done her best work in singling out is the conception of the sinfulness of pride pride is a weakness in the character it dries up laughter it dries up wonder it dries up chivalry and energy the christian tradition understands this therefore mr moore does not understand the christian tradition  for the truth is much stranger even than it appears in the formal doctrine of the sin of pride  it is not only true that humility is a much wiser and more vigorous thing than pride it is also true that vanity is a much wiser and more vigorous thing than pride  vanity is socialit is almost a kind of comradeship pride is solitary and uncivilized  vanity is active it desires the applause of infinite multitudes pride is passive desiring only the applause of one person which it already has vanity is humorous and can enjoy the joke even of itself pride is dull and cannot even smile  and the whole of this difference is the difference between stevenson and mr george moore who as he informs us has brushed stevenson aside  i do not know where he has been brushed to but wherever it is i fancy he is having a good time because he had the wisdom to be vain and not proud stevenson had a windy vanity mr moore has a dusty egoism hence stevenson could amuse himself as well as us with his vanity while the richest effects of mr moores absurdity are hidden from his eyes  if we compare this solemn folly with the happy folly with which stevenson belauds his own books and berates his own critics we shall not find it difficult to guess why it is that stevenson at least found a final philosophy of some sort to live by while mr moore is always walking the world looking for a new one stevenson had found that the secret of life lies in laughter and humility self is the gorgon vanity sees it in the mirror of other men and lives pride studies it for itself and is turned to stone  it is necessary to dwell on this defect in mr moore because it is really the weakness of work which is not without its strength mr moores egoism is not merely a moral weakness it is a very constant and influential aesthetic weakness as well we should really be much more interested in mr moore if he were not quite so interested in himself  we feel as if we were being shown through a gallery of really fine pictures into each of which by some useless and discordant convention the artist had represented the same figure in the same attitude  the grand canal with a distant view of mr moore effect of mr moore through a scotch mist mr moore by firelight ruins of mr moore by moonlight and so on seems to be the endless series he would no doubt reply that in such a book as this he intended to reveal himself but the answer is that in such a book as this he does not succeed one of the thousand objections to the sin of pride lies precisely in this that selfconsciousness of necessity destroys selfrevelation a man who thinks a great deal about himself will try to be manysided attempt a theatrical excellence at all points will try to be an encyclopaedia of culture and his own real personality will be lost in that false universalism thinking about himself will lead to trying to be the universe trying to be the universe will lead to ceasing to be anything if on the other hand a man is sensible enough to think only about the universe he will think about it in his own individual way he will keep virgin the secret of god he will see the grass as no other man can see it and look at a sun that no man has ever known this fact is very practically brought out in mr moores confessions in reading them we do not feel the presence of a cleancut personality like that of thackeray and matthew arnold we only read a number of quite clever and largely conflicting opinions which might be uttered by any clever person but which we are called upon to admire specifically because they are uttered by mr moore he is the only thread that connects catholicism and protestantism realism and mysticismhe or rather his name  he is profoundly absorbed even in views he no longer holds and he expects us to be and he intrudes the capital i even where it need not be intrudedeven where it weakens the force of a plain statement where another man would say it is a fine day mr moore says seen through my temperament the day appeared fine where another man would say milton has obviously a fine style mr moore would say as a stylist milton had always impressed me the nemesis of this selfcentred spirit is that of being totally ineffectual  mr moore has started many interesting crusades but he has abandoned them before his disciples could begin even when he is on the side of the truth he is as fickle as the children of falsehood  even when he has found reality he cannot find rest one irish quality he has which no irishman was ever withoutpugnacity and that is certainly a great virtue especially in the present age but he has not the tenacity of conviction which goes with the fighting spirit in a man like bernard shaw  his weakness of introspection and selfishness in all their glory cannot prevent him fighting but they will always prevent him winning    x on sandals and simplicity  the great misfortune of the modern english is not at all that they are more boastful than other people they are not it is that they are boastful about those particular things which nobody can boast of without losing them  a frenchman can be proud of being bold and logical and still remain bold and logical a german can be proud of being reflective and orderly and still remain reflective and orderly but an englishman cannot be proud of being simple and direct and still remain simple and direct in the matter of these strange virtues to know them is to kill them a man may be conscious of being heroic or conscious of being divine but he cannot in spite of all the anglosaxon poets be conscious of being unconscious  now i do not think that it can be honestly denied that some portion of this impossibility attaches to a class very different in their own opinion at least to the school of anglosaxonism i mean that school of the simple life commonly associated with tolstoy if a perpetual talk about ones own robustness leads to being less robust it is even more true that a perpetual talking about ones own simplicity leads to being less simple one great complaint i think must stand against the modern upholders of the simple lifethe simple life in all its varied forms from vegetarianism to the honourable consistency of the doukhobors this complaint against them stands that they would make us simple in the unimportant things but complex in the important things they would make us simple in the things that do not matterthat is in diet in costume in etiquette in economic system but they would make us complex in the things that do matterin philosophy in loyalty in spiritual acceptance and spiritual rejection it does not so very much matter whether a man eats a grilled tomato or a plain tomato it does very much matter whether he eats a plain tomato with a grilled mind the only kind of simplicity worth preserving is the simplicity of the heart the simplicity which accepts and enjoys there may be a reasonable doubt as to what system preserves this there can surely be no doubt that a system of simplicity destroys it there is more simplicity in the man who eats caviar on impulse than in the man who eats grapenuts on principle the chief error of these people is to be found in the very phrase to which they are most attachedplain living and high thinking these people do not stand in need of will not be improved by plain living and high thinking  they stand in need of the contrary they would be improved by high living and plain thinking a little high living i say having a full sense of responsibility a little high living would teach them the force and meaning of the human festivities of the banquet that has gone on from the beginning of the world  it would teach them the historic fact that the artificial is if anything older than the natural it would teach them that the lovingcup is as old as any hunger it would teach them that ritualism is older than any religion and a little plain thinking would teach them how harsh and fanciful are the mass of their own ethics how very civilized and very complicated must be the brain of the tolstoyan who really believes it to be evil to love ones country and wicked to strike a blow  a man approaches wearing sandals and simple raiment a raw tomato held firmly in his right hand and says the affections of family and country alike are hindrances to the fuller development of human love but the plain thinker will only answer him with a wonder not untinged with admiration what a great deal of trouble you must have taken in order to feel like that high living will reject the tomato  plain thinking will equally decisively reject the idea of the invariable sinfulness of war high living will convince us that nothing is more materialistic than to despise a pleasure as purely material  and plain thinking will convince us that nothing is more materialistic than to reserve our horror chiefly for material wounds  the only simplicity that matters is the simplicity of the heart if that be gone it can be brought back by no turnips or cellular clothing but only by tears and terror and the fires that are not quenched if that remain it matters very little if a few early victorian armchairs remain along with it  let us put a complex entree into a simple old gentleman let us not put a simple entree into a complex old gentleman  so long as human society will leave my spiritual inside alone i will allow it with a comparative submission to work its wild will with my physical interior  i will submit to cigars i will meekly embrace a bottle of burgundy  i will humble myself to a hansom cab  if only by this means i may preserve to myself the virginity of the spirit which enjoys with astonishment and fear i do not say that these are the only methods of preserving it i incline to the belief that there are others  but i will have nothing to do with simplicity which lacks the fear the astonishment and the joy alike  i will have nothing to do with the devilish vision of a child who is too simple to like toys  the child is indeed in these and many other matters the best guide and in nothing is the child so righteously childlike in nothing does he exhibit more accurately the sounder order of simplicity than in the fact that he sees everything with a simple pleasure even the complex things  the false type of naturalness harps always on the distinction between the natural and the artificial the higher kind of naturalness ignores that distinction to the child the tree and the lamppost are as natural and as artificial as each other or rather neither of them are natural but both supernatural  for both are splendid and unexplained the flower with which god crowns the one and the flame with which sam the lamplighter crowns the other are equally of the gold of fairytales in the middle of the wildest fields the most rustic child is ten to one playing at steamengines and the only spiritual or philosophical objection to steamengines is not that men pay for them or work at them or make them very ugly or even that men are killed by them but merely that men do not play at them the evil is that the childish poetry of clockwork does not remain the wrong is not that engines are too much admired but that they are not admired enough  the sin is not that engines are mechanical but that men are mechanical  in this matter then as in all the other matters treated in this book our main conclusion is that it is a fundamental point of view a philosophy or religion which is needed and not any change in habit or social routine  the things we need most for immediate practical purposes are all abstractions  we need a right view of the human lot a right view of the human society and if we were living eagerly and angrily in the enthusiasm of those things we should ipso facto be living simply in the genuine and spiritual sense desire and danger make every one simple  and to those who talk to us with interfering eloquence about jaeger and the pores of the skin and about plasmon and the coats of the stomach at them shall only be hurled the words that are hurled at fops and gluttons take no thought what ye shall eat or what ye shall drink or wherewithal ye shall be clothed  for after all these things do the gentiles seek but seek first the kingdom of god and his righteousness and all these things shall be added unto you those amazing words are not only extraordinarily good practical politics they are also superlatively good hygiene  the one supreme way of making all those processes go right the processes of health and strength and grace and beauty the one and only way of making certain of their accuracy is to think about something else if a man is bent on climbing into the seventh heaven he may be quite easy about the pores of his skin  if he harnesses his waggon to a star the process will have a most satisfactory effect upon the coats of his stomach  for the thing called taking thought the thing for which the best modern word is rationalizing is in its nature inapplicable to all plain and urgent things men take thought and ponder rationalistically touching remote thingsthings that only theoretically matter such as the transit of venus but only at their peril can men rationalize about so practical a matter as health    xi science and the savages  a permanent disadvantage of the study of folklore and kindred subjects is that the man of science can hardly be in the nature of things very frequently a man of the world  he is a student of nature he is scarcely ever a student of human nature and even where this difficulty is overcome and he is in some sense a student of human nature this is only a very faint beginning of the painful progress towards being human  for the study of primitive race and religion stands apart in one important respect from all or nearly all the ordinary scientific studies a man can understand astronomy only by being an astronomer he can understand entomology only by being an entomologist or perhaps an insect but he can understand a great deal of anthropology merely by being a man  he is himself the animal which he studies hence arises the fact which strikes the eye everywhere in the records of ethnology and folklorethe fact that the same frigid and detached spirit which leads to success in the study of astronomy or botany leads to disaster in the study of mythology or human origins it is necessary to cease to be a man in order to do justice to a microbe it is not necessary to cease to be a man in order to do justice to men  that same suppression of sympathies that same waving away of intuitions or guesswork which make a man preternaturally clever in dealing with the stomach of a spider will make him preternaturally stupid in dealing with the heart of man he is making himself inhuman in order to understand humanity an ignorance of the other world is boasted by many men of science but in this matter their defect arises not from ignorance of the other world but from ignorance of this world  for the secrets about which anthropologists concern themselves can be best learnt not from books or voyages but from the ordinary commerce of man with man the secret of why some savage tribe worships monkeys or the moon is not to be found even by travelling among those savages and taking down their answers in a notebook although the cleverest man may pursue this course  the answer to the riddle is in england it is in london nay it is in his own heart  when a man has discovered why men in bond street wear black hats he will at the same moment have discovered why men in timbuctoo wear red feathers the mystery in the heart of some savage wardance should not be studied in books of scientific travel it should be studied at a subscription ball  if a man desires to find out the origins of religions let him not go to the sandwich islands let him go to church if a man wishes to know the origin of human society to know what society philosophically speaking really is let him not go into the british museum let him go into society  this total misunderstanding of the real nature of ceremonial gives rise to the most awkward and dehumanized versions of the conduct of men in rude lands or ages  the man of science not realizing that ceremonial is essentially a thing which is done without a reason has to find a reason for every sort of ceremonial and as might be supposed the reason is generally a very absurd oneabsurd because it originates not in the simple mind of the barbarian but in the sophisticated mind of the professor  the teamed man will say for instance the natives of mumbojumbo land believe that the dead man can eat and will require food upon his journey to the other world  this is attested by the fact that they place food in the grave and that any family not complying with this rite is the object of the anger of the priests and the tribe to any one acquainted with humanity this way of talking is topsyturvy it is like saying the english in the twentieth century believed that a dead man could smell  this is attested by the fact that they always covered his grave with lilies violets or other flowers some priestly and tribal terrors were evidently attached to the neglect of this action as we have records of several old ladies who were very much disturbed in mind because their wreaths had not arrived in time for the funeral  it may be of course that savages put food with a dead man because they think that a dead man can eat or weapons with a dead man because they think that a dead man can fight but personally i do not believe that they think anything of the kind i believe they put food or weapons on the dead for the same reason that we put flowers because it is an exceedingly natural and obvious thing to do  we do not understand it is true the emotion which makes us think it obvious and natural but that is because like all the important emotions of human existence it is essentially irrational  we do not understand the savage for the same reason that the savage does not understand himself and the savage does not understand himself for the same reason that we do not understand ourselves either  the obvious truth is that the moment any matter has passed through the human mind it is finally and for ever spoilt for all purposes of science  it has become a thing incurably mysterious and infinite this mortal has put on immortality  even what we call our material desires are spiritual because they are human science can analyse a porkchop and say how much of it is phosphorus and how much is protein but science cannot analyse any mans wish for a porkchop and say how much of it is hunger how much custom how much nervous fancy how much a haunting love of the beautiful  the mans desire for the porkchop remains literally as mystical and ethereal as his desire for heaven all attempts therefore at a science of any human things at a science of history a science of folklore a science of sociology are by their nature not merely hopeless but crazy you can no more be certain in economic history that a mans desire for money was merely a desire for money than you can be certain in hagiology that a saints desire for god was merely a desire for god and this kind of vagueness in the primary phenomena of the study is an absolutely final blow to anything in the nature of a science men can construct a science with very few instruments or with very plain instruments but no one on earth could construct a science with unreliable instruments  a man might work out the whole of mathematics with a handful of pebbles but not with a handful of clay which was always falling apart into new fragments and falling together into new combinations a man might measure heaven and earth with a reed but not with a growing reed  as one of the enormous follies of folklore let us take the case of the transmigration of stories and the alleged unity of their source story after story the scientific mythologists have cut out of its place in history and pinned side by side with similar stories in their museum of fables  the process is industrious it is fascinating and the whole of it rests on one of the plainest fallacies in the world that a story has been told all over the place at some time or other not only does not prove that it never really happened it does not even faintly indicate or make slightly more probable that it never happened that a large number of fishermen have falsely asserted that they have caught a pike two feet long does not in the least affect the question of whether any one ever really did so  that numberless journalists announce a francogerman war merely for money is no evidence one way or the other upon the dark question of whether such a war ever occurred doubtless in a few hundred years the innumerable francogerman wars that did not happen will have cleared the scientific mind of any belief in the legendary war of 70 which did but that will be because if folklore students remain at all their nature will be unchanged and their services to folklore will be still as they are at present greater than they know for in truth these men do something far more godlike than studying legends they create them  there are two kinds of stories which the scientists say cannot be true because everybody tells them  the first class consists of the stories which are told everywhere because they are somewhat odd or clever there is nothing in the world to prevent their having happened to somebody as an adventure any more than there is anything to prevent their having occurred as they certainly did occur to somebody as an idea but they are not likely to have happened to many people the second class of their myths consist of the stories that are told everywhere for the simple reason that they happen everywhere of the first class for instance we might take such an example as the story of william tell now generally ranked among legends upon the sole ground that it is found in the tales of other peoples now it is obvious that this was told everywhere because whether true or fictitious it is what is called a good story it is odd exciting and it has a climax  but to suggest that some such eccentric incident can never have happened in the whole history of archery or that it did not happen to any particular person of whom it is told is stark impudence  the idea of shooting at a mark attached to some valuable or beloved person is an idea doubtless that might easily have occurred to any inventive poet but it is also an idea that might easily occur to any boastful archer it might be one of the fantastic caprices of some storyteller it might equally well be one of the fantastic caprices of some tyrant it might occur first in real life and afterwards occur in legends or it might just as well occur first in legends and afterwards occur in real life  if no apple has ever been shot off a boys head from the beginning of the world it may be done tomorrow morning and by somebody who has never heard of william tell  this type of tale indeed may be pretty fairly paralleled with the ordinary anecdote terminating in a repartee or an irish bull such a retort as the famous je ne vois pas la necessite we have all seen attributed to talleyrand to voltaire to henri quatre to an anonymous judge and so on  but this variety does not in any way make it more likely that the thing was never said at all it is highly likely that it was really said by somebody unknown it is highly likely that it was really said by talleyrand in any case it is not any more difficult to believe that the mot might have occurred to a man in conversation than to a man writing memoirs it might have occurred to any of the men i have mentioned but there is this point of distinction about it that it is not likely to have occurred to all of them  and this is where the first class of socalled myth differs from the second to which i have previously referred  for there is a second class of incident found to be common to the stories of five or six heroes say to sigurd to hercules to rustem to the cid and so on and the peculiarity of this myth is that not only is it highly reasonable to imagine that it really happened to one hero but it is highly reasonable to imagine that it really happened to all of them such a story for instance is that of a great man having his strength swayed or thwarted by the mysterious weakness of a woman the anecdotal story the story of william tell is as i have said popular because it is peculiar  but this kind of story the story of samson and delilah of arthur and guinevere is obviously popular because it is not peculiar  it is popular as good quiet fiction is popular because it tells the truth about people if the ruin of samson by a woman and the ruin of hercules by a woman have a common legendary origin it is gratifying to know that we can also explain as a fable the ruin of nelson by a woman and the ruin of parnell by a woman  and indeed i have no doubt whatever that some centuries hence the students of folklore will refuse altogether to believe that elizabeth barrett eloped with robert browning and will prove their point up to the hilt by the unquestionable fact that the whole fiction of the period was full of such elopements from end to end  possibly the most pathetic of all the delusions of the modern students of primitive belief is the notion they have about the thing they call anthropomorphism  they believe that primitive men attributed phenomena to a god in human form in order to explain them because his mind in its sullen limitation could not reach any further than his own clownish existence  the thunder was called the voice of a man the lightning the eyes of a man because by this explanation they were made more reasonable and comfortable the final cure for all this kind of philosophy is to walk down a lane at night  any one who does so will discover very quickly that men pictured something semihuman at the back of all things not because such a thought was natural but because it was supernatural not because it made things more comprehensible but because it made them a hundred times more incomprehensible and mysterious for a man walking down a lane at night can see the conspicuous fact that as long as nature keeps to her own course she has no power with us at all  as long as a tree is a tree it is a topheavy monster with a hundred arms a thousand tongues and only one leg but so long as a tree is a tree it does not frighten us at all it begins to be something alien to be something strange only when it looks like ourselves  when a tree really looks like a man our knees knock under us  and when the whole universe looks like a man we fall on our faces    xii paganism and mr lowes dickinson  of the new paganism or neopaganism as it was preached flamboyantly by mr swinburne or delicately by walter pater there is no necessity to take any very grave account except as a thing which left behind it incomparable exercises in the english language  the new paganism is no longer new and it never at any time bore the smallest resemblance to paganism the ideas about the ancient civilization which it has left loose in the public mind are certainly extraordinary enough the term pagan is continually used in fiction and light literature as meaning a man without any religion whereas a pagan was generally a man with about half a dozen  the pagans according to this notion were continually crowning themselves with flowers and dancing about in an irresponsible state whereas if there were two things that the best pagan civilization did honestly believe in they were a rather too rigid dignity and a much too rigid responsibility pagans are depicted as above all things inebriate and lawless whereas they were above all things reasonable and respectable they are praised as disobedient when they had only one great virtuecivic obedience  they are envied and admired as shamelessly happy when they had only one great sindespair  mr lowes dickinson the most pregnant and provocative of recent writers on this and similar subjects is far too solid a man to have fallen into this old error of the mere anarchy of paganism in order to make hay of that hellenic enthusiasm which has as its ideal mere appetite and egotism it is not necessary to know much philosophy but merely to know a little greek mr lowes dickinson knows a great deal of philosophy and also a great deal of greek and his error if error he has is not that of the crude hedonist  but the contrast which he offers between christianity and paganism in the matter of moral idealsa contrast which he states very ably in a paper called how long halt ye which appeared in the independent reviewdoes i think contain an error of a deeper kind  according to him the ideal of paganism was not indeed a mere frenzy of lust and liberty and caprice but was an ideal of full and satisfied humanity according to him the ideal of christianity was the ideal of asceticism when i say that i think this idea wholly wrong as a matter of philosophy and history i am not talking for the moment about any ideal christianity of my own or even of any primitive christianity undefiled by after events  i am not like so many modern christian idealists basing my case upon certain things which christ said neither am i like so many other christian idealists basing my case upon certain things that christ forgot to say i take historic christianity with all its sins upon its head i take it as i would take jacobinism or mormonism or any other mixed or unpleasing human product and i say that the meaning of its action was not to be found in asceticism  i say that its point of departure from paganism was not asceticism  i say that its point of difference with the modern world was not asceticism i say that st simeon stylites had not his main inspiration in asceticism i say that the main christian impulse cannot be described as asceticism even in the ascetics  let me set about making the matter clear  there is one broad fact about the relations of christianity and paganism which is so simple that many will smile at it but which is so important that all moderns forget it  the primary fact about christianity and paganism is that one came after the other  mr lowes dickinson speaks of them as if they were parallel idealseven speaks as if paganism were the newer of the two and the more fitted for a new age he suggests that the pagan ideal will be the ultimate good of man but if that is so we must at least ask with more curiosity than he allows for why it was that man actually found his ultimate good on earth under the stars and threw it away again it is this extraordinary enigma to which i propose to attempt an answer  there is only one thing in the modern world that has been face to face with paganism there is only one thing in the modern world which in that sense knows anything about paganism and that is christianity that fact is really the weak point in the whole of that hedonistic neopaganism of which i have spoken all that genuinely remains of the ancient hymns or the ancient dances of europe all that has honestly come to us from the festivals of phoebus or pan is to be found in the festivals of the christian church if any one wants to hold the end of a chain which really goes back to the heathen mysteries he had better take hold of a festoon of flowers at easter or a string of sausages at christmas everything else in the modern world is of christian origin even everything that seems most antichristian the french revolution is of christian origin  the newspaper is of christian origin the anarchists are of christian origin  physical science is of christian origin  the attack on christianity is of christian origin there is one thing and one thing only in existence at the present day which can in any sense accurately be said to be of pagan origin and that is christianity  the real difference between paganism and christianity is perfectly summed up in the difference between the pagan or natural virtues and those three virtues of christianity which the church of rome calls virtues of grace  the pagan or rational virtues are such things as justice and temperance and christianity has adopted them the three mystical virtues which christianity has not adopted but invented are faith hope and charity  now much easy and foolish christian rhetoric could easily be poured out upon those three words but i desire to confine myself to the two facts which are evident about them  the first evident fact in marked contrast to the delusion of the dancing paganthe first evident fact i say is that the pagan virtues such as justice and temperance are the sad virtues and that the mystical virtues of faith hope and charity are the gay and exuberant virtues and the second evident fact which is even more evident is the fact that the pagan virtues are the reasonable virtues and that the christian virtues of faith hope and charity are in their essence as unreasonable as they can be  as the word unreasonable is open to misunderstanding the matter may be more accurately put by saying that each one of these christian or mystical virtues involves a paradox in its own nature and that this is not true of any of the typically pagan or rationalist virtues justice consists in finding out a certain thing due to a certain man and giving it to him  temperance consists in finding out the proper limit of a particular indulgence and adhering to that  but charity means pardoning what is unpardonable or it is no virtue at all hope means hoping when things are hopeless or it is no virtue at all and faith means believing the incredible or it is no virtue at all  it is somewhat amusing indeed to notice the difference between the fate of these three paradoxes in the fashion of the modern mind charity is a fashionable virtue in our time it is lit up by the gigantic firelight of dickens  hope is a fashionable virtue today our attention has been arrested for it by the sudden and silver trumpet of stevenson  but faith is unfashionable and it is customary on every side to cast against it the fact that it is a paradox everybody mockingly repeats the famous childish definition that faith is the power of believing that which we know to be untrue yet it is not one atom more paradoxical than hope or charity charity is the power of defending that which we know to be indefensible hope is the power of being cheerful in circumstances which we know to be desperate  it is true that there is a state of hope which belongs to bright prospects and the morning but that is not the virtue of hope the virtue of hope exists only in earthquake and eclipse it is true that there is a thing crudely called charity which means charity to the deserving poor but charity to the deserving is not charity at all but justice it is the undeserving who require it and the ideal either does not exist at all or exists wholly for them for practical purposes it is at the hopeless moment that we require the hopeful man and the virtue either does not exist at all or begins to exist at that moment exactly at the instant when hope ceases to be reasonable it begins to be useful now the old pagan world went perfectly straightforward until it discovered that going straightforward is an enormous mistake it was nobly and beautifully reasonable and discovered in its deathpang this lasting and valuable truth a heritage for the ages that reasonableness will not do  the pagan age was truly an eden or golden age in this essential sense that it is not to be recovered and it is not to be recovered in this sense again that while we are certainly jollier than the pagans and much more right than the pagans there is not one of us who can by the utmost stretch of energy be so sensible as the pagans that naked innocence of the intellect cannot be recovered by any man after christianity and for this excellent reason that every man after christianity knows it to be misleading let me take an example the first that occurs to the mind of this impossible plainness in the pagan point of view  the greatest tribute to christianity in the modern world is tennysons ulysses the poet reads into the story of ulysses the conception of an incurable desire to wander  but the real ulysses does not desire to wander at all he desires to get home  he displays his heroic and unconquerable qualities in resisting the misfortunes which baulk him but that is all there is no love of adventure for its own sake that is a christian product  there is no love of penelope for her own sake that is a christian product  everything in that old world would appear to have been clean and obvious  a good man was a good man a bad man was a bad man  for this reason they had no charity for charity is a reverent agnosticism towards the complexity of the soul for this reason they had no such thing as the art of fiction the novel for the novel is a creation of the mystical idea of charity for them a pleasant landscape was pleasant and an unpleasant landscape unpleasant  hence they had no idea of romance for romance consists in thinking a thing more delightful because it is dangerous it is a christian idea  in a word we cannot reconstruct or even imagine the beautiful and astonishing pagan world it was a world in which common sense was really common  my general meaning touching the three virtues of which i have spoken will now i hope be sufficiently clear they are all three paradoxical they are all three practical and they are all three paradoxical because they are practical it is the stress of ultimate need and a terrible knowledge of things as they are which led men to set up these riddles and to die for them whatever may be the meaning of the contradiction it is the fact that the only kind of hope that is of any use in a battle is a hope that denies arithmetic  whatever may be the meaning of the contradiction it is the fact that the only kind of charity which any weak spirit wants or which any generous spirit feels is the charity which forgives the sins that are like scarlet whatever may be the meaning of faith it must always mean a certainty about something we cannot prove  thus for instance we believe by faith in the existence of other people  but there is another christian virtue a virtue far more obviously and historically connected with christianity which will illustrate even better the connection between paradox and practical necessity this virtue cannot be questioned in its capacity as a historical symbol certainly mr lowes dickinson will not question it it has been the boast of hundreds of the champions of christianity it has been the taunt of hundreds of the opponents of christianity it is in essence the basis of mr lowes dickinsons whole distinction between christianity and paganism  i mean of course the virtue of humility i admit of course most readily that a great deal of false eastern humility that is of strictly ascetic humility mixed itself with the main stream of european christianity we must not forget that when we speak of christianity we are speaking of a whole continent for about a thousand years  but of this virtue even more than of the other three i would maintain the general proposition adopted above  civilization discovered christian humility for the same urgent reason that it discovered faith and charitythat is because christian civilization had to discover it or die  the great psychological discovery of paganism which turned it into christianity can be expressed with some accuracy in one phrase the pagan set out with admirable sense to enjoy himself by the end of his civilization he had discovered that a man cannot enjoy himself and continue to enjoy anything else mr lowes dickinson has pointed out in words too excellent to need any further elucidation the absurd shallowness of those who imagine that the pagan enjoyed himself only in a materialistic sense of course he enjoyed himself not only intellectually even he enjoyed himself morally he enjoyed himself spiritually but it was himself that he was enjoying on the face of it a very natural thing to do  now the psychological discovery is merely this that whereas it had been supposed that the fullest possible enjoyment is to be found by extending our ego to infinity the truth is that the fullest possible enjoyment is to be found by reducing our ego to zero  humility is the thing which is for ever renewing the earth and the stars it is humility and not duty which preserves the stars from wrong from the unpardonable wrong of casual resignation it is through humility that the most ancient heavens for us are fresh and strong the curse that came before history has laid on us all a tendency to be weary of wonders  if we saw the sun for the first time it would be the most fearful and beautiful of meteors now that we see it for the hundredth time we call it in the hideous and blasphemous phrase of wordsworth the light of common day we are inclined to increase our claims  we are inclined to demand six suns to demand a blue sun to demand a green sun humility is perpetually putting us back in the primal darkness there all light is lightning startling and instantaneous until we understand that original dark in which we have neither sight nor expectation we can give no hearty and childlike praise to the splendid sensationalism of things  the terms pessimism and optimism like most modern terms are unmeaning but if they can be used in any vague sense as meaning something we may say that in this great fact pessimism is the very basis of optimism  the man who destroys himself creates the universe to the humble man and to the humble man alone the sun is really a sun to the humble man and to the humble man alone the sea is really a sea when he looks at all the faces in the street he does not only realize that men are alive he realizes with a dramatic pleasure that they are not dead  i have not spoken of another aspect of the discovery of humility as a psychological necessity because it is more commonly insisted on and is in itself more obvious  but it is equally clear that humility is a permanent necessity as a condition of effort and selfexamination it is one of the deadly fallacies of jingo politics that a nation is stronger for despising other nations  as a matter of fact the strongest nations are those like prussia or japan which began from very mean beginnings but have not been too proud to sit at the feet of the foreigner and learn everything from him  almost every obvious and direct victory has been the victory of the plagiarist this is indeed only a very paltry byproduct of humility but it is a product of humility and therefore it is successful prussia had no christian humility in its internal arrangements hence its internal arrangements were miserable  but it had enough christian humility slavishly to copy france even down to frederick the greats poetry and that which it had the humility to copy it had ultimately the honour to conquer  the case of the japanese is even more obvious their only christian and their only beautiful quality is that they have humbled themselves to be exalted all this aspect of humility however as connected with the matter of effort and striving for a standard set above us i dismiss as having been sufficiently pointed out by almost all idealistic writers  it may be worth while however to point out the interesting disparity in the matter of humility between the modern notion of the strong man and the actual records of strong men  carlyle objected to the statement that no man could be a hero to his valet every sympathy can be extended towards him in the matter if he merely or mainly meant that the phrase was a disparagement of heroworship heroworship is certainly a generous and human impulse the hero may be faulty but the worship can hardly be  it may be that no man would be a hero to his valet  but any man would be a valet to his hero but in truth both the proverb itself and carlyles stricture upon it ignore the most essential matter at issue  the ultimate psychological truth is not that no man is a hero to his valet the ultimate psychological truth the foundation of christianity is that no man is a hero to himself cromwell according to carlyle was a strong man  according to cromwell he was a weak one  the weak point in the whole of carlyles case for aristocracy lies indeed in his most celebrated phrase carlyle said that men were mostly fools  christianity with a surer and more reverent realism says that they are all fools this doctrine is sometimes called the doctrine of original sin it may also be described as the doctrine of the equality of men but the essential point of it is merely this that whatever primary and farreaching moral dangers affect any man affect all men all men can be criminals if tempted all men can be heroes if inspired and this doctrine does away altogether with carlyles pathetic belief or any one elses pathetic belief in the wise few there are no wise few  every aristocracy that has ever existed has behaved in all essential points exactly like a small mob every oligarchy is merely a knot of men in the streetthat is to say it is very jolly but not infallible  and no oligarchies in the worlds history have ever come off so badly in practical affairs as the very proud oligarchiesthe oligarchy of poland the oligarchy of venice and the armies that have most swiftly and suddenly broken their enemies in pieces have been the religious armiesthe moslem armies for instance or the puritan armies  and a religious army may by its nature be defined as an army in which every man is taught not to exalt but to abase himself  many modern englishmen talk of themselves as the sturdy descendants of their sturdy puritan fathers as a fact they would run away from a cow  if you asked one of their puritan fathers if you asked bunyan for instance whether he was sturdy he would have answered with tears that he was as weak as water  and because of this he would have borne tortures and this virtue of humility while being practical enough to win battles will always be paradoxical enough to puzzle pedants it is at one with the virtue of charity in this respect every generous person will admit that the one kind of sin which charity should cover is the sin which is inexcusable  and every generous person will equally agree that the one kind of pride which is wholly damnable is the pride of the man who has something to be proud of the pride which proportionally speaking does not hurt the character is the pride in things which reflect no credit on the person at all thus it does a man no harm to be proud of his country and comparatively little harm to be proud of his remote ancestors it does him more harm to be proud of having made money because in that he has a little more reason for pride it does him more harm still to be proud of what is nobler than moneyintellect  and it does him most harm of all to value himself for the most valuable thing on earthgoodness the man who is proud of what is really creditable to him is the pharisee the man whom christ himself could not forbear to strike  my objection to mr lowes dickinson and the reassertors of the pagan ideal is then this  i accuse them of ignoring definite human discoveries in the moral world discoveries as definite though not as material as the discovery of the circulation of the blood we cannot go back to an ideal of reason and sanity for mankind has discovered that reason does not lead to sanity we cannot go back to an ideal of pride and enjoyment  for mankind has discovered that pride does not lead to enjoyment  i do not know by what extraordinary mental accident modern writers so constantly connect the idea of progress with the idea of independent thinking progress is obviously the antithesis of independent thinking for under independent or individualistic thinking every man starts at the beginning and goes in all probability just as far as his father before him  but if there really be anything of the nature of progress it must mean above all things the careful study and assumption of the whole of the past  i accuse mr lowes dickinson and his school of reaction in the only real sense if he likes let him ignore these great historic mysteriesthe mystery of charity the mystery of chivalry the mystery of faith if he likes let him ignore the plough or the printingpress but if we do revive and pursue the pagan ideal of a simple and rational selfcompletion we shall endwhere paganism ended i do not mean that we shall end in destruction  i mean that we shall end in christianity    xiii  celts and celtophiles  science in the modern world has many uses its chief use however is to provide long words to cover the errors of the rich the word kleptomania is a vulgar example of what i mean it is on a par with that strange theory always advanced when a wealthy or prominent person is in the dock that exposure is more of a punishment for the rich than for the poor  of course the very reverse is the truth exposure is more of a punishment for the poor than for the rich the richer a man is the easier it is for him to be a tramp the richer a man is the easier it is for him to be popular and generally respected in the cannibal islands  but the poorer a man is the more likely it is that he will have to use his past life whenever he wants to get a bed for the night  honour is a luxury for aristocrats but it is a necessity for hallporters this is a secondary matter but it is an example of the general proposition i offerthe proposition that an enormous amount of modern ingenuity is expended on finding defences for the indefensible conduct of the powerful as i have said above these defences generally exhibit themselves most emphatically in the form of appeals to physical science and of all the forms in which science or pseudoscience has come to the rescue of the rich and stupid there is none so singular as the singular invention of the theory of races  when a wealthy nation like the english discovers the perfectly patent fact that it is making a ludicrous mess of the government of a poorer nation like the irish it pauses for a moment in consternation and then begins to talk about celts and teutons  as far as i can understand the theory the irish are celts and the english are teutons of course the irish are not celts any more than the english are teutons i have not followed the ethnological discussion with much energy but the last scientific conclusion which i read inclined on the whole to the summary that the english were mainly celtic and the irish mainly teutonic  but no man alive with even the glimmering of a real scientific sense would ever dream of applying the terms celtic or teutonic to either of them in any positive or useful sense  that sort of thing must be left to people who talk about the anglosaxon race and extend the expression to america how much of the blood of the angles and saxons whoever they were there remains in our mixed british roman german dane norman and picard stock is a matter only interesting to wild antiquaries and how much of that diluted blood can possibly remain in that roaring whirlpool of america into which a cataract of swedes jews germans irishmen and italians is perpetually pouring is a matter only interesting to lunatics  it would have been wiser for the english governing class to have called upon some other god all other gods however weak and warring at least boast of being constant  but science boasts of being in a flux for ever boasts of being unstable as water  and england and the english governing class never did call on this absurd deity of race until it seemed for an instant that they had no other god to call on  all the most genuine englishmen in history would have yawned or laughed in your face if you had begun to talk about anglosaxons if you had attempted to substitute the ideal of race for the ideal of nationality i really do not like to think what they would have said  i certainly should not like to have been the officer of nelson who suddenly discovered his french blood on the eve of trafalgar  i should not like to have been the norfolk or suffolk gentleman who had to expound to admiral blake by what demonstrable ties of genealogy he was irrevocably bound to the dutch  the truth of the whole matter is very simple nationality exists and has nothing in the world to do with race nationality is a thing like a church or a secret society it is a product of the human soul and will it is a spiritual product and there are men in the modern world who would think anything and do anything rather than admit that anything could be a spiritual product  a nation however as it confronts the modern world is a purely spiritual product  sometimes it has been born in independence like scotland  sometimes it has been born in dependence in subjugation like ireland  sometimes it is a large thing cohering out of many smaller things like italy  sometimes it is a small thing breaking away from larger things like poland but in each and every case its quality is purely spiritual or if you will purely psychological  it is a moment when five men become a sixth man  every one knows it who has ever founded a club  it is a moment when five places become one place every one must know it who has ever had to repel an invasion mr timothy healy the most serious intellect in the present house of commons summed up nationality to perfection when he simply called it something for which people will die as he excellently said in reply to lord hugh cecil no one not even the noble lord would die for the meridian of greenwich and that is the great tribute to its purely psychological character it is idle to ask why greenwich should not cohere in this spiritual manner while athens or sparta did  it is like asking why a man falls in love with one woman and not with another  now of this great spiritual coherence independent of external circumstances or of race or of any obvious physical thing ireland is the most remarkable example  rome conquered nations but ireland has conquered races  the norman has gone there and become irish the scotchman has gone there and become irish the spaniard has gone there and become irish even the bitter soldier of cromwell has gone there and become irish  ireland which did not exist even politically has been stronger than all the races that existed scientifically the purest germanic blood the purest norman blood the purest blood of the passionate scotch patriot has not been so attractive as a nation without a flag  ireland unrecognized and oppressed has easily absorbed races as such trifles are easily absorbed she has easily disposed of physical science as such superstitions are easily disposed of  nationality in its weakness has been stronger than ethnology in its strength  five triumphant races have been absorbed have been defeated by a defeated nationality  this being the true and strange glory of ireland it is impossible to hear without impatience of the attempt so constantly made among her modern sympathizers to talk about celts and celticism who were the celts  i defy anybody to say  who are the irish i defy any one to be indifferent or to pretend not to know mr w b yeats the great irish genius who has appeared in our time shows his own admirable penetration in discarding altogether the argument from a celtic race but he does not wholly escape and his followers hardly ever escape the general objection to the celtic argument the tendency of that argument is to represent the irish or the celts as a strange and separate race as a tribe of eccentrics in the modern world immersed in dim legends and fruitless dreams its tendency is to exhibit the irish as odd because they see the fairies  its trend is to make the irish seem weird and wild because they sing old songs and join in strange dances but this is quite an error indeed it is the opposite of the truth it is the english who are odd because they do not see the fairies it is the inhabitants of kensington who are weird and wild because they do not sing old songs and join in strange dances in all this the irish are not in the least strange and separate are not in the least celtic as the word is commonly and popularly used in all this the irish are simply an ordinary sensible nation living the life of any other ordinary and sensible nation which has not been either sodden with smoke or oppressed by moneylenders or otherwise corrupted with wealth and science there is nothing celtic about having legends it is merely human the germans who are i suppose teutonic have hundreds of legends wherever it happens that the germans are human there is nothing celtic about loving poetry the english loved poetry more perhaps than any other people before they came under the shadow of the chimneypot and the shadow of the chimneypot hat  it is not ireland which is mad and mystic it is manchester which is mad and mystic which is incredible which is a wild exception among human things ireland has no need to play the silly game of the science of races ireland has no need to pretend to be a tribe of visionaries apart in the matter of visions ireland is more than a nation it is a model nation    xiv on certain modern writers and the institution of the family  the family may fairly be considered one would think an ultimate human institution  every one would admit that it has been the main cell and central unit of almost all societies hitherto except indeed such societies as that of lacedaemon which went in for efficiency and has therefore perished and left not a trace behind  christianity even enormous as was its revolution did not alter this ancient and savage sanctity it merely reversed it it did not deny the trinity of father mother and child it merely read it backwards making it run child mother father this it called not the family but the holy family for many things are made holy by being turned upside down but some sages of our own decadence have made a serious attack on the family  they have impugned it as i think wrongly and its defenders have defended it and defended it wrongly the common defence of the family is that amid the stress and fickleness of life it is peaceful pleasant and at one but there is another defence of the family which is possible and to me evident this defence is that the family is not peaceful and not pleasant and not at one  it is not fashionable to say much nowadays of the advantages of the small community  we are told that we must go in for large empires and large ideas  there is one advantage however in the small state the city or the village which only the wilfully blind can overlook the man who lives in a small community lives in a much larger world he knows much more of the fierce varieties and uncompromising divergences of men  the reason is obvious  in a large community we can choose our companions  in a small community our companions are chosen for us thus in all extensive and highly civilized societies groups come into existence founded upon what is called sympathy and shut out the real world more sharply than the gates of a monastery there is nothing really narrow about the clan the thing which is really narrow is the clique  the men of the clan live together because they all wear the same tartan or are all descended from the same sacred cow but in their souls by the divine luck of things there will always be more colours than in any tartan but the men of the clique live together because they have the same kind of soul and their narrowness is a narrowness of spiritual coherence and contentment like that which exists in hell a big society exists in order to form cliques  a big society is a society for the promotion of narrowness  it is a machinery for the purpose of guarding the solitary and sensitive individual from all experience of the bitter and bracing human compromises it is in the most literal sense of the words a society for the prevention of christian knowledge  we can see this change for instance in the modern transformation of the thing called a club  when london was smaller and the parts of london more selfcontained and parochial the club was what it still is in villages the opposite of what it is now in great cities then the club was valued as a place where a man could be sociable now the club is valued as a place where a man can be unsociable the more the enlargement and elaboration of our civilization goes on the more the club ceases to be a place where a man can have a noisy argument and becomes more and more a place where a man can have what is somewhat fantastically called a quiet chop its aim is to make a man comfortable and to make a man comfortable is to make him the opposite of sociable  sociability like all good things is full of discomforts dangers and renunciations the club tends to produce the most degraded of all combinationsthe luxurious anchorite the man who combines the selfindulgence of lucullus with the insane loneliness of st simeon stylites  if we were tomorrow morning snowed up in the street in which we live we should step suddenly into a much larger and much wilder world than we have ever known  and it is the whole effort of the typically modern person to escape from the street in which he lives first he invents modern hygiene and goes to margate then he invents modern culture and goes to florence then he invents modern imperialism and goes to timbuctoo  he goes to the fantastic borders of the earth  he pretends to shoot tigers he almost rides on a camel  and in all this he is still essentially fleeing from the street in which he was born and of this flight he is always ready with his own explanation  he says he is fleeing from his street because it is dull he is lying  he is really fleeing from his street because it is a great deal too exciting it is exciting because it is exacting it is exacting because it is alive he can visit venice because to him the venetians are only venetians the people in his own street are men  he can stare at the chinese because for him the chinese are a passive thing to be stared at if he stares at the old lady in the next garden she becomes active he is forced to flee in short from the too stimulating society of his equalsof free men perverse personal deliberately different from himself  the street in brixton is too glowing and overpowering he has to soothe and quiet himself among tigers and vultures camels and crocodiles  these creatures are indeed very different from himself  but they do not put their shape or colour or custom into a decisive intellectual competition with his own they do not seek to destroy his principles and assert their own the stranger monsters of the suburban street do seek to do this the camel does not contort his features into a fine sneer because mr robinson has not got a hump the cultured gentleman at no 5 does exhibit a sneer because robinson has not got a dado the vulture will not roar with laughter because a man does not fly but the major at no 9 will roar with laughter because a man does not smoke the complaint we commonly have to make of our neighbours is that they will not as we express it mind their own business we do not really mean that they will not mind their own business if our neighbours did not mind their own business they would be asked abruptly for their rent and would rapidly cease to be our neighbours what we really mean when we say that they cannot mind their own business is something much deeper  we do not dislike them because they have so little force and fire that they cannot be interested in themselves  we dislike them because they have so much force and fire that they can be interested in us as well what we dread about our neighbours in short is not the narrowness of their horizon but their superb tendency to broaden it and all aversions to ordinary humanity have this general character they are not aversions to its feebleness as is pretended but to its energy the misanthropes pretend that they despise humanity for its weakness as a matter of fact they hate it for its strength  of course this shrinking from the brutal vivacity and brutal variety of common men is a perfectly reasonable and excusable thing as long as it does not pretend to any point of superiority it is when it calls itself aristocracy or aestheticism or a superiority to the bourgeoisie that its inherent weakness has in justice to be pointed out fastidiousness is the most pardonable of vices but it is the most unpardonable of virtues  nietzsche who represents most prominently this pretentious claim of the fastidious has a description somewherea very powerful description in the purely literary senseof the disgust and disdain which consume him at the sight of the common people with their common faces their common voices and their common minds  as i have said this attitude is almost beautiful if we may regard it as pathetic nietzsches aristocracy has about it all the sacredness that belongs to the weak  when he makes us feel that he cannot endure the innumerable faces the incessant voices the overpowering omnipresence which belongs to the mob he will have the sympathy of anybody who has ever been sick on a steamer or tired in a crowded omnibus every man has hated mankind when he was less than a man every man has had humanity in his eyes like a blinding fog humanity in his nostrils like a suffocating smell  but when nietzsche has the incredible lack of humour and lack of imagination to ask us to believe that his aristocracy is an aristocracy of strong muscles or an aristocracy of strong wills it is necessary to point out the truth it is an aristocracy of weak nerves  we make our friends we make our enemies but god makes our nextdoor neighbour  hence he comes to us clad in all the careless terrors of nature he is as strange as the stars as reckless and indifferent as the rain  he is man the most terrible of the beasts that is why the old religions and the old scriptural language showed so sharp a wisdom when they spoke not of ones duty towards humanity but ones duty towards ones neighbour  the duty towards humanity may often take the form of some choice which is personal or even pleasurable that duty may be a hobby it may even be a dissipation we may work in the east end because we are peculiarly fitted to work in the east end or because we think we are we may fight for the cause of international peace because we are very fond of fighting the most monstrous martyrdom the most repulsive experience may be the result of choice or a kind of taste  we may be so made as to be particularly fond of lunatics or specially interested in leprosy we may love negroes because they are black or german socialists because they are pedantic but we have to love our neighbour because he is therea much more alarming reason for a much more serious operation he is the sample of humanity which is actually given us precisely because he may be anybody he is everybody he is a symbol because he is an accident  doubtless men flee from small environments into lands that are very deadly  but this is natural enough for they are not fleeing from death  they are fleeing from life  and this principle applies to ring within ring of the social system of humanity it is perfectly reasonable that men should seek for some particular variety of the human type so long as they are seeking for that variety of the human type and not for mere human variety it is quite proper that a british diplomatist should seek the society of japanese generals if what he wants is japanese generals but if what he wants is people different from himself he had much better stop at home and discuss religion with the housemaid it is quite reasonable that the village genius should come up to conquer london if what he wants is to conquer london  but if he wants to conquer something fundamentally and symbolically hostile and also very strong he had much better remain where he is and have a row with the rector the man in the suburban street is quite right if he goes to ramsgate for the sake of ramsgatea difficult thing to imagine but if as he expresses it he goes to ramsgate for a change then he would have a much more romantic and even melodramatic change if he jumped over the wall into his neighbours garden the consequences would be bracing in a sense far beyond the possibilities of ramsgate hygiene  now exactly as this principle applies to the empire to the nation within the empire to the city within the nation to the street within the city so it applies to the home within the street the institution of the family is to be commended for precisely the same reasons that the institution of the nation or the institution of the city are in this matter to be commended it is a good thing for a man to live in a family for the same reason that it is a good thing for a man to be besieged in a city it is a good thing for a man to live in a family in the same sense that it is a beautiful and delightful thing for a man to be snowed up in a street they all force him to realize that life is not a thing from outside but a thing from inside  above all they all insist upon the fact that life if it be a truly stimulating and fascinating life is a thing which of its nature exists in spite of ourselves the modern writers who have suggested in a more or less open manner that the family is a bad institution have generally confined themselves to suggesting with much sharpness bitterness or pathos that perhaps the family is not always very congenial of course the family is a good institution because it is uncongenial it is wholesome precisely because it contains so many divergencies and varieties  it is as the sentimentalists say like a little kingdom and like most other little kingdoms is generally in a state of something resembling anarchy it is exactly because our brother george is not interested in our religious difficulties but is interested in the trocadero restaurant that the family has some of the bracing qualities of the commonwealth it is precisely because our uncle henry does not approve of the theatrical ambitions of our sister sarah that the family is like humanity the men and women who for good reasons and bad revolt against the family are for good reasons and bad simply revolting against mankind aunt elizabeth is unreasonable like mankind  papa is excitable like mankind our youngest brother is mischievous like mankind grandpapa is stupid like the world he is old like the world  those who wish rightly or wrongly to step out of all this do definitely wish to step into a narrower world  they are dismayed and terrified by the largeness and variety of the family sarah wishes to find a world wholly consisting of private theatricals george wishes to think the trocadero a cosmos  i do not say for a moment that the flight to this narrower life may not be the right thing for the individual any more than i say the same thing about flight into a monastery  but i do say that anything is bad and artificial which tends to make these people succumb to the strange delusion that they are stepping into a world which is actually larger and more varied than their own the best way that a man could test his readiness to encounter the common variety of mankind would be to climb down a chimney into any house at random and get on as well as possible with the people inside and that is essentially what each one of us did on the day that he was born  this is indeed the sublime and special romance of the family  it is romantic because it is a tossup it is romantic because it is everything that its enemies call it  it is romantic because it is arbitrary it is romantic because it is there  so long as you have groups of men chosen rationally you have some special or sectarian atmosphere it is when you have groups of men chosen irrationally that you have men the element of adventure begins to exist for an adventure is by its nature a thing that comes to us  it is a thing that chooses us not a thing that we choose  falling in love has been often regarded as the supreme adventure the supreme romantic accident in so much as there is in it something outside ourselves something of a sort of merry fatalism this is very true love does take us and transfigure and torture us  it does break our hearts with an unbearable beauty like the unbearable beauty of music but in so far as we have certainly something to do with the matter in so far as we are in some sense prepared to fall in love and in some sense jump into it in so far as we do to some extent choose and to some extent even judgein all this falling in love is not truly romantic is not truly adventurous at all  in this degree the supreme adventure is not falling in love  the supreme adventure is being born there we do walk suddenly into a splendid and startling trap there we do see something of which we have not dreamed before our father and mother do lie in wait for us and leap out on us like brigands from a bush  our uncle is a surprise  our aunt is in the beautiful common expression a bolt from the blue when we step into the family by the act of being born we do step into a world which is incalculable into a world which has its own strange laws into a world which could do without us into a world that we have not made  in other words when we step into the family we step into a fairytale  this colour as of a fantastic narrative ought to cling to the family and to our relations with it throughout life romance is the deepest thing in life romance is deeper even than reality  for even if reality could be proved to be misleading it still could not be proved to be unimportant or unimpressive even if the facts are false they are still very strange and this strangeness of life this unexpected and even perverse element of things as they fall out remains incurably interesting the circumstances we can regulate may become tame or pessimistic but the circumstances over which we have no control remain godlike to those who like mr micawber can call on them and renew their strength  people wonder why the novel is the most popular form of literature people wonder why it is read more than books of science or books of metaphysics  the reason is very simple it is merely that the novel is more true than they are life may sometimes legitimately appear as a book of science life may sometimes appear and with a much greater legitimacy as a book of metaphysics  but life is always a novel  our existence may cease to be a song it may cease even to be a beautiful lament our existence may not be an intelligible justice or even a recognizable wrong  but our existence is still a story  in the fiery alphabet of every sunset is written to be continued in our next if we have sufficient intellect we can finish a philosophical and exact deduction and be certain that we are finishing it right with the adequate brainpower we could finish any scientific discovery and be certain that we were finishing it right but not with the most gigantic intellect could we finish the simplest or silliest story and be certain that we were finishing it right that is because a story has behind it not merely intellect which is partly mechanical but will which is in its essence divine the narrative writer can send his hero to the gallows if he likes in the last chapter but one  he can do it by the same divine caprice whereby he the author can go to the gallows himself and to hell afterwards if he chooses  and the same civilization the chivalric european civilization which asserted freewill in the thirteenth century produced the thing called fiction in the eighteenth when thomas aquinas asserted the spiritual liberty of man he created all the bad novels in the circulating libraries  but in order that life should be a story or romance to us it is necessary that a great part of it at any rate should be settled for us without our permission  if we wish life to be a system this may be a nuisance but if we wish it to be a drama it is an essential  it may often happen no doubt that a drama may be written by somebody else which we like very little but we should like it still less if the author came before the curtain every hour or so and forced on us the whole trouble of inventing the next act  a man has control over many things in his life he has control over enough things to be the hero of a novel but if he had control over everything there would be so much hero that there would be no novel  and the reason why the lives of the rich are at bottom so tame and uneventful is simply that they can choose the events  they are dull because they are omnipotent they fail to feel adventures because they can make the adventures the thing which keeps life romantic and full of fiery possibilities is the existence of these great plain limitations which force all of us to meet the things we do not like or do not expect  it is vain for the supercilious moderns to talk of being in uncongenial surroundings to be in a romance is to be in uncongenial surroundings to be born into this earth is to be born into uncongenial surroundings hence to be born into a romance  of all these great limitations and frameworks which fashion and create the poetry and variety of life the family is the most definite and important hence it is misunderstood by the moderns who imagine that romance would exist most perfectly in a complete state of what they call liberty they think that if a man makes a gesture it would be a startling and romantic matter that the sun should fall from the sky but the startling and romantic thing about the sun is that it does not fall from the sky  they are seeking under every shape and form a world where there are no limitationsthat is a world where there are no outlines that is a world where there are no shapes there is nothing baser than that infinity  they say they wish to be as strong as the universe but they really wish the whole universe as weak as themselves    xv on smart novelists and the smart set  in one sense at any rate it is more valuable to read bad literature than good literature  good literature may tell us the mind of one man but bad literature may tell us the mind of many men a good novel tells us the truth about its hero but a bad novel tells us the truth about its author  it does much more than that it tells us the truth about its readers and oddly enough it tells us this all the more the more cynical and immoral be the motive of its manufacture  the more dishonest a book is as a book the more honest it is as a public document a sincere novel exhibits the simplicity of one particular man an insincere novel exhibits the simplicity of mankind the pedantic decisions and definable readjustments of man may be found in scrolls and statute books and scriptures but mens basic assumptions and everlasting energies are to be found in penny dreadfuls and halfpenny novelettes  thus a man like many men of real culture in our day might learn from good literature nothing except the power to appreciate good literature but from bad literature he might learn to govern empires and look over the map of mankind  there is one rather interesting example of this state of things in which the weaker literature is really the stronger and the stronger the weaker  it is the case of what may be called for the sake of an approximate description the literature of aristocracy or if you prefer the description the literature of snobbishness now if any one wishes to find a really effective and comprehensible and permanent case for aristocracy well and sincerely stated let him read not the modern philosophical conservatives not even nietzsche let him read the bow bells novelettes of the case of nietzsche i am confessedly more doubtful nietzsche and the bow bells novelettes have both obviously the same fundamental character they both worship the tall man with curling moustaches and herculean bodily power and they both worship him in a manner which is somewhat feminine and hysterical even here however the novelette easily maintains its philosophical superiority because it does attribute to the strong man those virtues which do commonly belong to him such virtues as laziness and kindliness and a rather reckless benevolence and a great dislike of hurting the weak nietzsche on the other hand attributes to the strong man that scorn against weakness which only exists among invalids  it is not however of the secondary merits of the great german philosopher but of the primary merits of the bow bells novelettes that it is my present affair to speak the picture of aristocracy in the popular sentimental novelette seems to me very satisfactory as a permanent political and philosophical guide it may be inaccurate about details such as the title by which a baronet is addressed or the width of a mountain chasm which a baronet can conveniently leap but it is not a bad description of the general idea and intention of aristocracy as they exist in human affairs the essential dream of aristocracy is magnificence and valour and if the family herald supplement sometimes distorts or exaggerates these things at least it does not fall short in them it never errs by making the mountain chasm too narrow or the title of the baronet insufficiently impressive  but above this sane reliable old literature of snobbishness there has arisen in our time another kind of literature of snobbishness which with its much higher pretensions seems to me worthy of very much less respect  incidentally if that matters it is much better literature  but it is immeasurably worse philosophy immeasurably worse ethics and politics immeasurably worse vital rendering of aristocracy and humanity as they really are from such books as those of which i wish now to speak we can discover what a clever man can do with the idea of aristocracy but from the family herald supplement literature we can learn what the idea of aristocracy can do with a man who is not clever and when we know that we know english history  this new aristocratic fiction must have caught the attention of everybody who has read the best fiction for the last fifteen years it is that genuine or alleged literature of the smart set which represents that set as distinguished not only by smart dresses but by smart sayings  to the bad baronet to the good baronet to the romantic and misunderstood baronet who is supposed to be a bad baronet but is a good baronet this school has added a conception undreamed of in the former yearsthe conception of an amusing baronet the aristocrat is not merely to be taller than mortal men and stronger and handsomer he is also to be more witty he is the long man with the short epigram many eminent and deservedly eminent modern novelists must accept some responsibility for having supported this worst form of snobbishnessan intellectual snobbishness  the talented author of dodo is responsible for having in some sense created the fashion as a fashion mr hichens in the green carnation reaffirmed the strange idea that young noblemen talk well though his case had some vague biographical foundation and in consequence an excuse  mrs craigie is considerably guilty in the matter although or rather because she has combined the aristocratic note with a note of some moral and even religious sincerity  when you are saving a mans soul even in a novel it is indecent to mention that he is a gentleman nor can blame in this matter be altogether removed from a man of much greater ability and a man who has proved his possession of the highest of human instinct the romantic instincti mean mr anthony hope in a galloping impossible melodrama like the prisoner of zenda the blood of kings fanned an excellent fantastic thread or theme but the blood of kings is not a thing that can be taken seriously and when for example mr hope devotes so much serious and sympathetic study to the man called tristram of blent a man who throughout burning boyhood thought of nothing but a silly old estate we feel even in mr hope the hint of this excessive concern about the oligarchic idea it is hard for any ordinary person to feel so much interest in a young man whose whole aim is to own the house of blent at the time when every other young man is owning the stars  mr hope however is a very mild case and in him there is not only an element of romance but also a fine element of irony which warns us against taking all this elegance too seriously above all he shows his sense in not making his noblemen so incredibly equipped with impromptu repartee  this habit of insisting on the wit of the wealthier classes is the last and most servile of all the servilities  it is as i have said immeasurably more contemptible than the snobbishness of the novelette which describes the nobleman as smiling like an apollo or riding a mad elephant these may be exaggerations of beauty and courage but beauty and courage are the unconscious ideals of aristocrats even of stupid aristocrats  the nobleman of the novelette may not be sketched with any very close or conscientious attention to the daily habits of noblemen  but he is something more important than a reality he is a practical ideal the gentleman of fiction may not copy the gentleman of real life but the gentleman of real life is copying the gentleman of fiction he may not be particularly goodlooking but he would rather be goodlooking than anything else he may not have ridden on a mad elephant but he rides a pony as far as possible with an air as if he had and upon the whole the upper class not only especially desire these qualities of beauty and courage but in some degree at any rate especially possess them thus there is nothing really mean or sycophantic about the popular literature which makes all its marquises seven feet high  it is snobbish but it is not servile its exaggeration is based on an exuberant and honest admiration its honest admiration is based upon something which is in some degree at any rate really there  the english lower classes do not fear the english upper classes in the least nobody could they simply and freely and sentimentally worship them the strength of the aristocracy is not in the aristocracy at all it is in the slums  it is not in the house of lords it is not in the civil service it is not in the government offices it is not even in the huge and disproportionate monopoly of the english land it is in a certain spirit  it is in the fact that when a navvy wishes to praise a man it comes readily to his tongue to say that he has behaved like a gentleman  from a democratic point of view he might as well say that he had behaved like a viscount the oligarchic character of the modern english commonwealth does not rest like many oligarchies on the cruelty of the rich to the poor it does not even rest on the kindness of the rich to the poor it rests on the perennial and unfailing kindness of the poor to the rich  the snobbishness of bad literature then is not servile but the snobbishness of good literature is servile  the oldfashioned halfpenny romance where the duchesses sparkled with diamonds was not servile but the new romance where they sparkle with epigrams is servile for in thus attributing a special and startling degree of intellect and conversational or controversial power to the upper classes we are attributing something which is not especially their virtue or even especially their aim  we are in the words of disraeli who being a genius and not a gentleman has perhaps primarily to answer for the introduction of this method of flattering the gentry we are performing the essential function of flattery which is flattering the people for the qualities they have not got praise may be gigantic and insane without having any quality of flattery so long as it is praise of something that is noticeably in existence  a man may say that a giraffes head strikes the stars or that a whale fills the german ocean and still be only in a rather excited state about a favourite animal but when he begins to congratulate the giraffe on his feathers and the whale on the elegance of his legs we find ourselves confronted with that social element which we call flattery the middle and lower orders of london can sincerely though not perhaps safely admire the health and grace of the english aristocracy and this for the very simple reason that the aristocrats are upon the whole more healthy and graceful than the poor but they cannot honestly admire the wit of the aristocrats and this for the simple reason that the aristocrats are not more witty than the poor but a very great deal less so  a man does not hear as in the smart novels these gems of verbal felicity dropped between diplomatists at dinner  where he really does hear them is between two omnibus conductors in a block in holborn  the witty peer whose impromptus fill the books of mrs craigie or miss fowler would as a matter of fact be torn to shreds in the art of conversation by the first bootblack he had the misfortune to fall foul of the poor are merely sentimental and very excusably sentimental if they praise the gentleman for having a ready hand and ready money but they are strictly slaves and sycophants if they praise him for having a ready tongue  for that they have far more themselves  the element of oligarchical sentiment in these novels however has i think another and subtler aspect an aspect more difficult to understand and more worth understanding the modern gentleman particularly the modern english gentleman has become so central and important in these books and through them in the whole of our current literature and our current mode of thought that certain qualities of his whether original or recent essential or accidental have altered the quality of our english comedy in particular that stoical ideal absurdly supposed to be the english ideal has stiffened and chilled us  it is not the english ideal but it is to some extent the aristocratic ideal or it may be only the ideal of aristocracy in its autumn or decay the gentleman is a stoic because he is a sort of savage because he is filled with a great elemental fear that some stranger will speak to him  that is why a thirdclass carriage is a community while a firstclass carriage is a place of wild hermits but this matter which is difficult i may be permitted to approach in a more circuitous way  the haunting element of ineffectualness which runs through so much of the witty and epigrammatic fiction fashionable during the last eight or ten years which runs through such works of a real though varying ingenuity as dodo or concerning isabel carnaby or even some emotions and a moral may be expressed in various ways but to most of us i think it will ultimately amount to the same thing this new frivolity is inadequate because there is in it no strong sense of an unuttered joy  the men and women who exchange the repartees may not only be hating each other but hating even themselves any one of them might be bankrupt that day or sentenced to be shot the next  they are joking not because they are merry but because they are not out of the emptiness of the heart the mouth speaketh even when they talk pure nonsense it is a careful nonsensea nonsense of which they are economical or to use the perfect expression of mr w s gilbert in patience it is such precious nonsense even when they become lightheaded they do not become lighthearted all those who have read anything of the rationalism of the moderns know that their reason is a sad thing  but even their unreason is sad  the causes of this incapacity are also not very difficult to indicate the chief of all of course is that miserable fear of being sentimental which is the meanest of all the modern terrorsmeaner even than the terror which produces hygiene  everywhere the robust and uproarious humour has come from the men who were capable not merely of sentimentalism but a very silly sentimentalism  there has been no humour so robust or uproarious as that of the sentimentalist steele or the sentimentalist sterne or the sentimentalist dickens these creatures who wept like women were the creatures who laughed like men it is true that the humour of micawber is good literature and that the pathos of little nell is bad  but the kind of man who had the courage to write so badly in the one case is the kind of man who would have the courage to write so well in the other the same unconsciousness the same violent innocence the same gigantesque scale of action which brought the napoleon of comedy his jena brought him also his moscow and herein is especially shown the frigid and feeble limitations of our modern wits they make violent efforts they make heroic and almost pathetic efforts but they cannot really write badly  there are moments when we almost think that they are achieving the effect but our hope shrivels to nothing the moment we compare their little failures with the enormous imbecilities of byron or shakespeare  for a hearty laugh it is necessary to have touched the heart i do not know why touching the heart should always be connected only with the idea of touching it to compassion or a sense of distress the heart can be touched to joy and triumph the heart can be touched to amusement but all our comedians are tragic comedians these later fashionable writers are so pessimistic in bone and marrow that they never seem able to imagine the heart having any concern with mirth  when they speak of the heart they always mean the pangs and disappointments of the emotional life when they say that a mans heart is in the right place they mean apparently that it is in his boots  our ethical societies understand fellowship but they do not understand good fellowship similarly our wits understand talk but not what dr johnson called a good talk  in order to have like dr johnson a good talk it is emphatically necessary to be like dr johnson a good manto have friendship and honour and an abysmal tenderness above all it is necessary to be openly and indecently humane to confess with fulness all the primary pities and fears of adam johnson was a clearheaded humorous man and therefore he did not mind talking seriously about religion  johnson was a brave man one of the bravest that ever walked and therefore he did not mind avowing to any one his consuming fear of death  the idea that there is something english in the repression of ones feelings is one of those ideas which no englishman ever heard of until england began to be governed exclusively by scotchmen americans and jews  at the best the idea is a generalization from the duke of wellingtonwho was an irishman  at the worst it is a part of that silly teutonism which knows as little about england as it does about anthropology but which is always talking about vikings as a matter of fact the vikings did not repress their feelings in the least  they cried like babies and kissed each other like girls in short they acted in that respect like achilles and all strong heroes the children of the gods  and though the english nationality has probably not much more to do with the vikings than the french nationality or the irish nationality the english have certainly been the children of the vikings in the matter of tears and kisses it is not merely true that all the most typically english men of letters like shakespeare and dickens richardson and thackeray were sentimentalists  it is also true that all the most typically english men of action were sentimentalists if possible more sentimental in the great elizabethan age when the english nation was finally hammered out in the great eighteenth century when the british empire was being built up everywhere where in all these times where was this symbolic stoical englishman who dresses in drab and black and represses his feelings were all the elizabethan palladins and pirates like that  were any of them like that was grenville concealing his emotions when he broke wineglasses to pieces with his teeth and bit them till the blood poured down was essex restraining his excitement when he threw his hat into the sea did raleigh think it sensible to answer the spanish guns only as stevenson says with a flourish of insulting trumpets did sydney ever miss an opportunity of making a theatrical remark in the whole course of his life and death  were even the puritans stoics the english puritans repressed a good deal but even they were too english to repress their feelings  it was by a great miracle of genius assuredly that carlyle contrived to admire simultaneously two things so irreconcilably opposed as silence and oliver cromwell cromwell was the very reverse of a strong silent man cromwell was always talking when he was not crying  nobody i suppose will accuse the author of grace abounding of being ashamed of his feelings  milton indeed it might be possible to represent as a stoic in some sense he was a stoic just as he was a prig and a polygamist and several other unpleasant and heathen things but when we have passed that great and desolate name which may really be counted an exception we find the tradition of english emotionalism immediately resumed and unbrokenly continuous whatever may have been the moral beauty of the passions of etheridge and dorset sedley and buckingham they cannot be accused of the fault of fastidiously concealing them charles the second was very popular with the english because like all the jolly english kings he displayed his passions william the dutchman was very unpopular with the english because not being an englishman he did hide his emotions he was in fact precisely the ideal englishman of our modern theory and precisely for that reason all the real englishmen loathed him like leprosy with the rise of the great england of the eighteenth century we find this open and emotional tone still maintained in letters and politics in arts and in arms  perhaps the only quality which was possessed in common by the great fielding and the great richardson was that neither of them hid their feelings swift indeed was hard and logical because swift was irish and when we pass to the soldiers and the rulers the patriots and the empirebuilders of the eighteenth century we find as i have said that they were if possible more romantic than the romancers more poetical than the poets  chatham who showed the world all his strength showed the house of commons all his weakness wolfe walked about the room with a drawn sword calling himself caesar and hannibal and went to death with poetry in his mouth clive was a man of the same type as cromwell or bunyan or for the matter of that johnsonthat is he was a strong sensible man with a kind of running spring of hysteria and melancholy in him like johnson he was all the more healthy because he was morbid the tales of all the admirals and adventurers of that england are full of braggadocio of sentimentality of splendid affectation but it is scarcely necessary to multiply examples of the essentially romantic englishman when one example towers above them all mr rudyard kipling has said complacently of the english we do not fall on the neck and kiss when we come together it is true that this ancient and universal custom has vanished with the modern weakening of england  sydney would have thought nothing of kissing spenser  but i willingly concede that mr broderick would not be likely to kiss mr arnoldfoster if that be any proof of the increased manliness and military greatness of england but the englishman who does not show his feelings has not altogether given up the power of seeing something english in the great seahero of the napoleonic war  you cannot break the legend of nelson and across the sunset of that glory is written in flaming letters for ever the great english sentiment kiss me hardy  this ideal of selfrepression then is whatever else it is not english it is perhaps somewhat oriental it is slightly prussian but in the main it does not come i think from any racial or national source it is as i have said in some sense aristocratic it comes not from a people but from a class  even aristocracy i think was not quite so stoical in the days when it was really strong but whether this unemotional ideal be the genuine tradition of the gentleman or only one of the inventions of the modern gentleman who may be called the decayed gentleman it certainly has something to do with the unemotional quality in these society novels from representing aristocrats as people who suppressed their feelings it has been an easy step to representing aristocrats as people who had no feelings to suppress  thus the modern oligarchist has made a virtue for the oligarchy of the hardness as well as the brightness of the diamond like a sonneteer addressing his lady in the seventeenth century he seems to use the word cold almost as a eulogium and the word heartless as a kind of compliment  of course in people so incurably kindhearted and babyish as are the english gentry it would be impossible to create anything that can be called positive cruelty so in these books they exhibit a sort of negative cruelty they cannot be cruel in acts but they can be so in words all this means one thing and one thing only  it means that the living and invigorating ideal of england must be looked for in the masses it must be looked for where dickens found itdickens among whose glories it was to be a humorist to be a sentimentalist to be an optimist to be a poor man to be an englishman but the greatest of whose glories was that he saw all mankind in its amazing and tropical luxuriance and did not even notice the aristocracy dickens the greatest of whose glories was that he could not describe a gentleman    xvi on mr mccabe and a divine frivolity  a critic once remonstrated with me saying with an air of indignant reasonableness if you must make jokes at least you need not make them on such serious subjects  i replied with a natural simplicity and wonder about what other subjects can one make jokes except serious subjects  it is quite useless to talk about profane jesting all jesting is in its nature profane in the sense that it must be the sudden realization that something which thinks itself solemn is not so very solemn after all if a joke is not a joke about religion or morals it is a joke about policemagistrates or scientific professors or undergraduates dressed up as queen victoria  and people joke about the policemagistrate more than they joke about the pope not because the policemagistrate is a more frivolous subject but on the contrary because the policemagistrate is a more serious subject than the pope the bishop of rome has no jurisdiction in this realm of england whereas the policemagistrate may bring his solemnity to bear quite suddenly upon us  men make jokes about old scientific professors even more than they make them about bishopsnot because science is lighter than religion but because science is always by its nature more solemn and austere than religion  it is not i it is not even a particular class of journalists or jesters who make jokes about the matters which are of most awful import it is the whole human race if there is one thing more than another which any one will admit who has the smallest knowledge of the world it is that men are always speaking gravely and earnestly and with the utmost possible care about the things that are not important but always talking frivolously about the things that are men talk for hours with the faces of a college of cardinals about things like golf or tobacco or waistcoats or party politics but all the most grave and dreadful things in the world are the oldest jokes in the worldbeing married being hanged  one gentleman however mr mccabe has in this matter made to me something that almost amounts to a personal appeal and as he happens to be a man for whose sincerity and intellectual virtue i have a high respect i do not feel inclined to let it pass without some attempt to satisfy my critic in the matter mr mccabe devotes a considerable part of the last essay in the collection called christianity and rationalism on trial to an objection not to my thesis but to my method and a very friendly and dignified appeal to me to alter it  i am much inclined to defend myself in this matter out of mere respect for mr mccabe and still more so out of mere respect for the truth which is i think in danger by his error not only in this question but in others in order that there may be no injustice done in the matter i will quote mr mccabe himself  but before i follow mr chesterton in some detail i would make a general observation on his method he is as serious as i am in his ultimate purpose and i respect him for that  he knows as i do that humanity stands at a solemn parting of the ways  towards some unknown goal it presses through the ages impelled by an overmastering desire of happiness today it hesitates lightheartedly enough but every serious thinker knows how momentous the decision may be  it is apparently deserting the path of religion and entering upon the path of secularism will it lose itself in quagmires of sensuality down this new path and pant and toil through years of civic and industrial anarchy only to learn it had lost the road and must return to religion or will it find that at last it is leaving the mists and the quagmires behind it that it is ascending the slope of the hill so long dimly discerned ahead and making straight for the longsought utopia this is the drama of our time and every man and every woman should understand it  mr chesterton understands it  further he gives us credit for understanding it  he has nothing of that paltry meanness or strange density of so many of his colleagues who put us down as aimless iconoclasts or moral anarchists he admits that we are waging a thankless war for what we take to be truth and progress  he is doing the same but why in the name of all that is reasonable should we when we are agreed on the momentousness of the issue either way forthwith desert serious methods of conducting the controversy why when the vital need of our time is to induce men and women to collect their thoughts occasionally and be men and womennay to remember that they are really gods that hold the destinies of humanity on their kneeswhy should we think that this kaleidoscopic play of phrases is inopportune the ballets of the alhambra and the fireworks of the crystal palace and mr chestertons daily news articles have their place in life but how a serious social student can think of curing the thoughtlessness of our generation by strained paradoxes of giving people a sane grasp of social problems by literary sleightofhand of settling important questions by a reckless shower of rocketmetaphors and inaccurate facts and the substitution of imagination for judgment i cannot see  i quote this passage with a particular pleasure because mr mccabe certainly cannot put too strongly the degree to which i give him and his school credit for their complete sincerity and responsibility of philosophical attitude  i am quite certain that they mean every word they say  i also mean every word i say  but why is it that mr mccabe has some sort of mysterious hesitation about admitting that i mean every word i say why is it that he is not quite as certain of my mental responsibility as i am of his mental responsibility if we attempt to answer the question directly and well we shall i think have come to the root of the matter by the shortest cut  mr mccabe thinks that i am not serious but only funny because mr mccabe thinks that funny is the opposite of serious funny is the opposite of not funny and of nothing else the question of whether a man expresses himself in a grotesque or laughable phraseology or in a stately and restrained phraseology is not a question of motive or of moral state it is a question of instinctive language and selfexpression whether a man chooses to tell the truth in long sentences or short jokes is a problem analogous to whether he chooses to tell the truth in french or german whether a man preaches his gospel grotesquely or gravely is merely like the question of whether he preaches it in prose or verse the question of whether swift was funny in his irony is quite another sort of question to the question of whether swift was serious in his pessimism surely even mr mccabe would not maintain that the more funny gulliver is in its method the less it can be sincere in its object the truth is as i have said that in this sense the two qualities of fun and seriousness have nothing whatever to do with each other they are no more comparable than black and triangular mr bernard shaw is funny and sincere  mr george robey is funny and not sincere  mr mccabe is sincere and not funny the average cabinet minister is not sincere and not funny  in short mr mccabe is under the influence of a primary fallacy which i have found very common in men of the clerical type numbers of clergymen have from time to time reproached me for making jokes about religion and they have almost always invoked the authority of that very sensible commandment which says thou shalt not take the name of the lord thy god in vain of course i pointed out that i was not in any conceivable sense taking the name in vain  to take a thing and make a joke out of it is not to take it in vain  it is on the contrary to take it and use it for an uncommonly good object  to use a thing in vain means to use it without use  but a joke may be exceedingly useful it may contain the whole earthly sense not to mention the whole heavenly sense of a situation  and those who find in the bible the commandment can find in the bible any number of the jokes in the same book in which gods name is fenced from being taken in vain god himself overwhelms job with a torrent of terrible levities the same book which says that gods name must not be taken vainly talks easily and carelessly about god laughing and god winking evidently it is not here that we have to look for genuine examples of what is meant by a vain use of the name  and it is not very difficult to see where we have really to look for it the people as i tactfully pointed out to them who really take the name of the lord in vain are the clergymen themselves  the thing which is fundamentally and really frivolous is not a careless joke the thing which is fundamentally and really frivolous is a careless solemnity  if mr mccabe really wishes to know what sort of guarantee of reality and solidity is afforded by the mere act of what is called talking seriously let him spend a happy sunday in going the round of the pulpits  or better still let him drop in at the house of commons or the house of lords  even mr mccabe would admit that these men are solemnmore solemn than i am and even mr mccabe i think would admit that these men are frivolousmore frivolous than i am  why should mr mccabe be so eloquent about the danger arising from fantastic and paradoxical writers why should he be so ardent in desiring grave and verbose writers there are not so very many fantastic and paradoxical writers but there are a gigantic number of grave and verbose writers and it is by the efforts of the grave and verbose writers that everything that mr mccabe detests and everything that i detest for that matter is kept in existence and energy how can it have come about that a man as intelligent as mr mccabe can think that paradox and jesting stop the way  it is solemnity that is stopping the way in every department of modern effort it is his own favourite serious methods it is his own favourite momentousness it is his own favourite judgment which stops the way everywhere every man who has ever headed a deputation to a minister knows this every man who has ever written a letter to the times knows it  every rich man who wishes to stop the mouths of the poor talks about momentousness  every cabinet minister who has not got an answer suddenly develops a judgment every sweater who uses vile methods recommends serious methods i said a moment ago that sincerity had nothing to do with solemnity but i confess that i am not so certain that i was right in the modern world at any rate i am not so sure that i was right in the modern world solemnity is the direct enemy of sincerity in the modern world sincerity is almost always on one side and solemnity almost always on the other  the only answer possible to the fierce and glad attack of sincerity is the miserable answer of solemnity let mr mccabe or any one else who is much concerned that we should be grave in order to be sincere simply imagine the scene in some government office in which mr bernard shaw should head a socialist deputation to mr austen chamberlain  on which side would be the solemnity and on which the sincerity  i am indeed delighted to discover that mr mccabe reckons mr shaw along with me in his system of condemnation of frivolity he said once i believe that he always wanted mr shaw to label his paragraphs serious or comic  i do not know which paragraphs of mr shaw are paragraphs to be labelled serious but surely there can be no doubt that this paragraph of mr mccabes is one to be labelled comic  he also says in the article i am now discussing that mr shaw has the reputation of deliberately saying everything which his hearers do not expect him to say i need not labour the inconclusiveness and weakness of this because it has already been dealt with in my remarks on mr bernard shaw suffice it to say here that the only serious reason which i can imagine inducing any one person to listen to any other is that the first person looks to the second person with an ardent faith and a fixed attention expecting him to say what he does not expect him to say it may be a paradox but that is because paradoxes are true it may not be rational but that is because rationalism is wrong but clearly it is quite true that whenever we go to hear a prophet or teacher we may or may not expect wit we may or may not expect eloquence but we do expect what we do not expect  we may not expect the true we may not even expect the wise but we do expect the unexpected if we do not expect the unexpected why do we go there at all if we expect the expected why do we not sit at home and expect it by ourselves  if mr mccabe means merely this about mr shaw that he always has some unexpected application of his doctrine to give to those who listen to him what he says is quite true and to say it is only to say that mr shaw is an original man but if he means that mr shaw has ever professed or preached any doctrine but one and that his own then what he says is not true it is not my business to defend mr shaw as has been seen already i disagree with him altogether  but i do not mind on his behalf offering in this matter a flat defiance to all his ordinary opponents such as mr mccabe  i defy mr mccabe or anybody else to mention one single instance in which mr shaw has for the sake of wit or novelty taken up any position which was not directly deducible from the body of his doctrine as elsewhere expressed  i have been i am happy to say a tolerably close student of mr shaws utterances and i request mr mccabe if he will not believe that i mean anything else to believe that i mean this challenge  all this however is a parenthesis  the thing with which i am here immediately concerned is mr mccabes appeal to me not to be so frivolous let me return to the actual text of that appeal  there are of course a great many things that i might say about it in detail but i may start with saying that mr mccabe is in error in supposing that the danger which i anticipate from the disappearance of religion is the increase of sensuality  on the contrary i should be inclined to anticipate a decrease in sensuality because i anticipate a decrease in life  i do not think that under modern western materialism we should have anarchy  i doubt whether we should have enough individual valour and spirit even to have liberty it is quite an oldfashioned fallacy to suppose that our objection to scepticism is that it removes the discipline from life our objection to scepticism is that it removes the motive power materialism is not a thing which destroys mere restraint materialism itself is the great restraint  the mccabe school advocates a political liberty but it denies spiritual liberty that is it abolishes the laws which could be broken and substitutes laws that cannot  and that is the real slavery  the truth is that the scientific civilization in which mr mccabe believes has one rather particular defect it is perpetually tending to destroy that democracy or power of the ordinary man in which mr mccabe also believes  science means specialism and specialism means oligarchy  if you once establish the habit of trusting particular men to produce particular results in physics or astronomy you leave the door open for the equally natural demand that you should trust particular men to do particular things in government and the coercing of men  if you feel it to be reasonable that one beetle should be the only study of one man and that one man the only student of that one beetle it is surely a very harmless consequence to go on to say that politics should be the only study of one man and that one man the only student of politics as i have pointed out elsewhere in this book the expert is more aristocratic than the aristocrat because the aristocrat is only the man who lives well while the expert is the man who knows better but if we look at the progress of our scientific civilization we see a gradual increase everywhere of the specialist over the popular function once men sang together round a table in chorus now one man sings alone for the absurd reason that he can sing better if scientific civilization goes on which is most improbable only one man will laugh because he can laugh better than the rest  i do not know that i can express this more shortly than by taking as a text the single sentence of mr mccabe which runs as follows the ballets of the alhambra and the fireworks of the crystal palace and mr chestertons daily news articles have their places in life i wish that my articles had as noble a place as either of the other two things mentioned  but let us ask ourselves in a spirit of love as mr chadband would say what are the ballets of the alhambra the ballets of the alhambra are institutions in which a particular selected row of persons in pink go through an operation known as dancing  now in all commonwealths dominated by a religionin the christian commonwealths of the middle ages and in many rude societiesthis habit of dancing was a common habit with everybody and was not necessarily confined to a professional class a person could dance without being a dancer a person could dance without being a specialist a person could dance without being pink and in proportion as mr mccabes scientific civilization advancesthat is in proportion as religious civilization or real civilization decaysthe more and more well trained the more and more pink become the people who do dance and the more and more numerous become the people who dont mr mccabe may recognize an example of what i mean in the gradual discrediting in society of the ancient european waltz or dance with partners and the substitution of that horrible and degrading oriental interlude which is known as skirtdancing that is the whole essence of decadence the effacement of five people who do a thing for fun by one person who does it for money now it follows therefore that when mr mccabe says that the ballets of the alhambra and my articles have their place in life it ought to be pointed out to him that he is doing his best to create a world in which dancing properly speaking will have no place in life at all  he is indeed trying to create a world in which there will be no life for dancing to have a place in the very fact that mr mccabe thinks of dancing as a thing belonging to some hired women at the alhambra is an illustration of the same principle by which he is able to think of religion as a thing belonging to some hired men in white neckties both these things are things which should not be done for us but by us  if mr mccabe were really religious he would be happy if he were really happy he would dance  briefly we may put the matter in this way  the main point of modern life is not that the alhambra ballet has its place in life the main point the main enormous tragedy of modern life is that mr mccabe has not his place in the alhambra ballet the joy of changing and graceful posture the joy of suiting the swing of music to the swing of limbs the joy of whirling drapery the joy of standing on one legall these should belong by rights to mr mccabe and to me in short to the ordinary healthy citizen probably we should not consent to go through these evolutions but that is because we are miserable moderns and rationalists we do not merely love ourselves more than we love duty we actually love ourselves more than we love joy  when therefore mr mccabe says that he gives the alhambra dances and my articles their place in life i think we are justified in pointing out that by the very nature of the case of his philosophy and of his favourite civilization he gives them a very inadequate place for if i may pursue the too flattering parallel mr mccabe thinks of the alhambra and of my articles as two very odd and absurd things which some special people do probably for money in order to amuse him but if he had ever felt himself the ancient sublime elemental human instinct to dance he would have discovered that dancing is not a frivolous thing at all but a very serious thing he would have discovered that it is the one grave and chaste and decent method of expressing a certain class of emotions and similarly if he had ever had as mr shaw and i have had the impulse to what he calls paradox he would have discovered that paradox again is not a frivolous thing but a very serious thing he would have found that paradox simply means a certain defiant joy which belongs to belief  i should regard any civilization which was without a universal habit of uproarious dancing as being from the full human point of view a defective civilization and i should regard any mind which had not got the habit in one form or another of uproarious thinking as being from the full human point of view a defective mind it is vain for mr mccabe to say that a ballet is a part of him he should be part of a ballet or else he is only part of a man it is in vain for him to say that he is not quarrelling with the importation of humour into the controversy he ought himself to be importing humour into every controversy for unless a man is in part a humorist he is only in part a man to sum up the whole matter very simply if mr mccabe asks me why i import frivolity into a discussion of the nature of man i answer because frivolity is a part of the nature of man  if he asks me why i introduce what he calls paradoxes into a philosophical problem i answer because all philosophical problems tend to become paradoxical if he objects to my treating of life riotously i reply that life is a riot  and i say that the universe as i see it at any rate is very much more like the fireworks at the crystal palace than it is like his own philosophy about the whole cosmos there is a tense and secret festivitylike preparations for guy fawkes day eternity is the eve of something  i never look up at the stars without feeling that they are the fires of a schoolboys rocket fixed in their everlasting fall    xvii on the wit of whistler  that capable and ingenious writer mr arthur symons has included in a book of essays recently published i believe an apologia for london nights in which he says that morality should be wholly subordinated to art in criticism and he uses the somewhat singular argument that art or the worship of beauty is the same in all ages while morality differs in every period and in every respect  he appears to defy his critics or his readers to mention any permanent feature or quality in ethics this is surely a very curious example of that extravagant bias against morality which makes so many ultramodern aesthetes as morbid and fanatical as any eastern hermit  unquestionably it is a very common phrase of modern intellectualism to say that the morality of one age can be entirely different to the morality of another and like a great many other phrases of modern intellectualism it means literally nothing at all  if the two moralities are entirely different why do you call them both moralities it is as if a man said camels in various places are totally diverse some have six legs some have none some have scales some have feathers some have horns some have wings some are green some are triangular there is no point which they have in common  the ordinary man of sense would reply then what makes you call them all camels what do you mean by a camel  how do you know a camel when you see one of course there is a permanent substance of morality as much as there is a permanent substance of art to say that is only to say that morality is morality and that art is art  an ideal art critic would no doubt see the enduring beauty under every school equally an ideal moralist would see the enduring ethic under every code but practically some of the best englishmen that ever lived could see nothing but filth and idolatry in the starry piety of the brahmin and it is equally true that practically the greatest group of artists that the world has ever seen the giants of the renaissance could see nothing but barbarism in the ethereal energy of gothic  this bias against morality among the modern aesthetes is nothing very much paraded  and yet it is not really a bias against morality it is a bias against other peoples morality  it is generally founded on a very definite moral preference for a certain sort of life pagan plausible humane  the modern aesthete wishing us to believe that he values beauty more than conduct reads mallarme and drinks absinthe in a tavern  but this is not only his favourite kind of beauty it is also his favourite kind of conduct if he really wished us to believe that he cared for beauty only he ought to go to nothing but wesleyan school treats and paint the sunlight in the hair of the wesleyan babies  he ought to read nothing but very eloquent theological sermons by oldfashioned presbyterian divines  here the lack of all possible moral sympathy would prove that his interest was purely verbal or pictorial as it is in all the books he reads and writes he clings to the skirts of his own morality and his own immorality  the champion of lart pour lart is always denouncing ruskin for his moralizing if he were really a champion of lart pour lart he would be always insisting on ruskin for his style  the doctrine of the distinction between art and morality owes a great part of its success to art and morality being hopelessly mixed up in the persons and performances of its greatest exponents of this lucky contradiction the very incarnation was whistler no man ever preached the impersonality of art so well no man ever preached the impersonality of art so personally for him pictures had nothing to do with the problems of character but for all his fiercest admirers his character was as a matter of fact far more interesting than his pictures he gloried in standing as an artist apart from right and wrong but he succeeded by talking from morning till night about his rights and about his wrongs  his talents were many his virtues it must be confessed not many beyond that kindness to tried friends on which many of his biographers insist but which surely is a quality of all sane men of pirates and pickpockets beyond this his outstanding virtues limit themselves chiefly to two admirable onescourage and an abstract love of good work  yet i fancy he won at last more by those two virtues than by all his talents a man must be something of a moralist if he is to preach even if he is to preach unmorality professor walter raleigh in his in memoriam james mcneill whistler insists truly enough on the strong streak of an eccentric honesty in matters strictly pictorial which ran through his complex and slightly confused character he would destroy any of his works rather than leave a careless or inexpressive touch within the limits of the frame he would begin again a hundred times over rather than attempt by patching to make his work seem better than it was  no one will blame professor raleigh who had to read a sort of funeral oration over whistler at the opening of the memorial exhibition if finding himself in that position he confined himself mostly to the merits and the stronger qualities of his subject we should naturally go to some other type of composition for a proper consideration of the weaknesses of whistler but these must never be omitted from our view of him indeed the truth is that it was not so much a question of the weaknesses of whistler as of the intrinsic and primary weakness of whistler he was one of those people who live up to their emotional incomes who are always taut and tingling with vanity  hence he had no strength to spare hence he had no kindness no geniality for geniality is almost definable as strength to spare he had no godlike carelessness he never forgot himself his whole life was to use his own expression an arrangement he went in for the art of livinga miserable trick in a word he was a great artist but emphatically not a great man in this connection i must differ strongly with professor raleigh upon what is from a superficial literary point of view one of his most effective points  he compares whistlers laughter to the laughter of another man who was a great man as well as a great artist his attitude to the public was exactly the attitude taken up by robert browning who suffered as long a period of neglect and mistake in those lines of the ring and the book   well british public ye who like me not    god love you and will have your proper laugh    at the dark question laugh it  id laugh first  mr whistler adds professor raleigh always laughed first the truth is i believe that whistler never laughed at all there was no laughter in his nature because there was no thoughtlessness and selfabandonment no humility  i cannot understand anybody reading the gentle art of making enemies and thinking that there is any laughter in the wit  his wit is a torture to him he twists himself into arabesques of verbal felicity he is full of a fierce carefulness he is inspired with the complete seriousness of sincere malice  he hurts himself to hurt his opponent browning did laugh because browning did not care browning did not care because browning was a great man  and when browning said in brackets to the simple sensible people who did not like his books god love you he was not sneering in the least he was laughingthat is to say he meant exactly what he said  there are three distinct classes of great satirists who are also great menthat is to say three classes of men who can laugh at something without losing their souls  the satirist of the first type is the man who first of all enjoys himself and then enjoys his enemies in this sense he loves his enemy and by a kind of exaggeration of christianity he loves his enemy the more the more he becomes an enemy he has a sort of overwhelming and aggressive happiness in his assertion of anger his curse is as human as a benediction of this type of satire the great example is rabelais  this is the first typical example of satire the satire which is voluble which is violent which is indecent but which is not malicious the satire of whistler was not this  he was never in any of his controversies simply happy the proof of it is that he never talked absolute nonsense  there is a second type of mind which produces satire with the quality of greatness  that is embodied in the satirist whose passions are released and let go by some intolerable sense of wrong he is maddened by the sense of men being maddened his tongue becomes an unruly member and testifies against all mankind such a man was swift in whom the saeva indignatio was a bitterness to others because it was a bitterness to himself  such a satirist whistler was not  he did not laugh because he was happy like rabelais but neither did he laugh because he was unhappy like swift  the third type of great satire is that in which he satirist is enabled to rise superior to his victim in the only serious sense which superiority can bear in that of pitying the sinner and respecting the man even while he satirises both  such an achievement can be found in a thing like popes atticus a poem in which the satirist feels that he is satirising the weaknesses which belong specially to literary genius  consequently he takes a pleasure in pointing out his enemys strength before he points out his weakness that is perhaps the highest and most honourable form of satire that is not the satire of whistler  he is not full of a great sorrow for the wrong done to human nature for him the wrong is altogether done to himself  he was not a great personality because he thought so much about himself  and the case is stronger even than that he was sometimes not even a great artist because he thought so much about art  any man with a vital knowledge of the human psychology ought to have the most profound suspicion of anybody who claims to be an artist and talks a great deal about art art is a right and human thing like walking or saying ones prayers but the moment it begins to be talked about very solemnly a man may be fairly certain that the thing has come into a congestion and a kind of difficulty  the artistic temperament is a disease that afflicts amateurs it is a disease which arises from men not having sufficient power of expression to utter and get rid of the element of art in their being it is healthful to every sane man to utter the art within him it is essential to every sane man to get rid of the art within him at all costs  artists of a large and wholesome vitality get rid of their art easily as they breathe easily or perspire easily but in artists of less force the thing becomes a pressure and produces a definite pain which is called the artistic temperament thus very great artists are able to be ordinary menmen like shakespeare or browning  there are many real tragedies of the artistic temperament tragedies of vanity or violence or fear but the great tragedy of the artistic temperament is that it cannot produce any art  whistler could produce art and in so far he was a great man but he could not forget art and in so far he was only a man with the artistic temperament  there can be no stronger manifestation of the man who is a really great artist than the fact that he can dismiss the subject of art that he can upon due occasion wish art at the bottom of the sea similarly we should always be much more inclined to trust a solicitor who did not talk about conveyancing over the nuts and wine  what we really desire of any man conducting any business is that the full force of an ordinary man should be put into that particular study  we do not desire that the full force of that study should be put into an ordinary man we do not in the least wish that our particular lawsuit should pour its energy into our barristers games with his children or rides on his bicycle or meditations on the morning star but we do as a matter of fact desire that his games with his children and his rides on his bicycle and his meditations on the morning star should pour something of their energy into our lawsuit we do desire that if he has gained any especial lung development from the bicycle or any bright and pleasing metaphors from the morning star that the should be placed at our disposal in that particular forensic controversy in a word we are very glad that he is an ordinary man since that may help him to be an exceptional lawyer  whistler never ceased to be an artist  as mr max beerbohm pointed out in one of his extraordinarily sensible and sincere critiques whistler really regarded whistler as his greatest work of art the white lock the single eyeglass the remarkable hatthese were much dearer to him than any nocturnes or arrangements that he ever threw off  he could throw off the nocturnes for some mysterious reason he could not throw off the hat he never threw off from himself that disproportionate accumulation of aestheticism which is the burden of the amateur  it need hardly be said that this is the real explanation of the thing which has puzzled so many dilettante critics the problem of the extreme ordinariness of the behaviour of so many great geniuses in history their behaviour was so ordinary that it was not recorded hence it was so ordinary that it seemed mysterious  hence people say that bacon wrote shakespeare  the modern artistic temperament cannot understand how a man who could write such lyrics as shakespeare wrote could be as keen as shakespeare was on business transactions in a little town in warwickshire  the explanation is simple enough it is that shakespeare had a real lyrical impulse wrote a real lyric and so got rid of the impulse and went about his business being an artist did not prevent him from being an ordinary man any more than being a sleeper at night or being a diner at dinner prevented him from being an ordinary man  all very great teachers and leaders have had this habit of assuming their point of view to be one which was human and casual one which would readily appeal to every passing man if a man is genuinely superior to his fellows the first thing that he believes in is the equality of man  we can see this for instance in that strange and innocent rationality with which christ addressed any motley crowd that happened to stand about him what man of you having a hundred sheep and losing one would not leave the ninety and nine in the wilderness and go after that which was lost or again what man of you if his son ask for bread will he give him a stone or if he ask for a fish will he give him a serpent this plainness this almost prosaic camaraderie is the note of all very great minds  to very great minds the things on which men agree are so immeasurably more important than the things on which they differ that the latter for all practical purposes disappear  they have too much in them of an ancient laughter even to endure to discuss the difference between the hats of two men who were both born of a woman or between the subtly varied cultures of two men who have both to die the firstrate great man is equal with other men like shakespeare the secondrate great man is on his knees to other men like whitman the thirdrate great man is superior to other men like whistler    xviii the fallacy of the young nation  to say that a man is an idealist is merely to say that he is a man but nevertheless it might be possible to effect some valid distinction between one kind of idealist and another one possible distinction for instance could be effected by saying that humanity is divided into conscious idealists and unconscious idealists in a similar way humanity is divided into conscious ritualists and unconscious ritualists  the curious thing is in that example as in others that it is the conscious ritualism which is comparatively simple the unconscious ritual which is really heavy and complicated the ritual which is comparatively rude and straightforward is the ritual which people call ritualistic  it consists of plain things like bread and wine and fire and men falling on their faces but the ritual which is really complex and many coloured and elaborate and needlessly formal is the ritual which people enact without knowing it it consists not of plain things like wine and fire but of really peculiar and local and exceptional and ingenious thingsthings like doormats and doorknockers and electric bells and silk hats and white ties and shiny cards and confetti the truth is that the modern man scarcely ever gets back to very old and simple things except when he is performing some religious mummery the modern man can hardly get away from ritual except by entering a ritualistic church  in the case of these old and mystical formalities we can at least say that the ritual is not mere ritual that the symbols employed are in most cases symbols which belong to a primary human poetry  the most ferocious opponent of the christian ceremonials must admit that if catholicism had not instituted the bread and wine somebody else would most probably have done so any one with a poetical instinct will admit that to the ordinary human instinct bread symbolizes something which cannot very easily be symbolized otherwise that wine to the ordinary human instinct symbolizes something which cannot very easily be symbolized otherwise but white ties in the evening are ritual and nothing else but ritual no one would pretend that white ties in the evening are primary and poetical  nobody would maintain that the ordinary human instinct would in any age or country tend to symbolize the idea of evening by a white necktie  rather the ordinary human instinct would i imagine tend to symbolize evening by cravats with some of the colours of the sunset not white neckties but tawny or crimson necktiesneckties of purple or olive or some darkened gold  mr j a kensit for example is under the impression that he is not a ritualist but the daily life of mr j a kensit like that of any ordinary modern man is as a matter of fact one continual and compressed catalogue of mystical mummery and flummery  to take one instance out of an inevitable hundred  i imagine that mr kensit takes off his hat to a lady and what can be more solemn and absurd considered in the abstract than symbolizing the existence of the other sex by taking off a portion of your clothing and waving it in the air this i repeat is not a natural and primitive symbol like fire or food a man might just as well have to take off his waistcoat to a lady and if a man by the social ritual of his civilization had to take off his waistcoat to a lady every chivalrous and sensible man would take off his waistcoat to a lady  in short mr kensit and those who agree with him may think and quite sincerely think that men give too much incense and ceremonial to their adoration of the other world but nobody thinks that he can give too much incense and ceremonial to the adoration of this world  all men then are ritualists but are either conscious or unconscious ritualists  the conscious ritualists are generally satisfied with a few very simple and elementary signs the unconscious ritualists are not satisfied with anything short of the whole of human life being almost insanely ritualistic the first is called a ritualist because he invents and remembers one rite the other is called an antiritualist because he obeys and forgets a thousand  and a somewhat similar distinction to this which i have drawn with some unavoidable length between the conscious ritualist and the unconscious ritualist exists between the conscious idealist and the unconscious idealist it is idle to inveigh against cynics and materialiststhere are no cynics there are no materialists  every man is idealistic only it so often happens that he has the wrong ideal every man is incurably sentimental but unfortunately it is so often a false sentiment  when we talk for instance of some unscrupulous commercial figure and say that he would do anything for money we use quite an inaccurate expression and we slander him very much he would not do anything for money  he would do some things for money he would sell his soul for money for instance and as mirabeau humorously said he would be quite wise to take money for muck he would oppress humanity for money but then it happens that humanity and the soul are not things that he believes in they are not his ideals but he has his own dim and delicate ideals and he would not violate these for money  he would not drink out of the souptureen for money he would not wear his coattails in front for money  he would not spread a report that he had softening of the brain for money in the actual practice of life we find in the matter of ideals exactly what we have already found in the matter of ritual we find that while there is a perfectly genuine danger of fanaticism from the men who have unworldly ideals the permanent and urgent danger of fanaticism is from the men who have worldly ideals  people who say that an ideal is a dangerous thing that it deludes and intoxicates are perfectly right  but the ideal which intoxicates most is the least idealistic kind of ideal the ideal which intoxicates least is the very ideal ideal that sobers us suddenly as all heights and precipices and great distances do granted that it is a great evil to mistake a cloud for a cape still the cloud which can be most easily mistaken for a cape is the cloud that is nearest the earth similarly we may grant that it may be dangerous to mistake an ideal for something practical but we shall still point out that in this respect the most dangerous ideal of all is the ideal which looks a little practical it is difficult to attain a high ideal consequently it is almost impossible to persuade ourselves that we have attained it but it is easy to attain a low ideal consequently it is easier still to persuade ourselves that we have attained it when we have done nothing of the kind  to take a random example it might be called a high ambition to wish to be an archangel the man who entertained such an ideal would very possibly exhibit asceticism or even frenzy but not i think delusion he would not think he was an archangel and go about flapping his hands under the impression that they were wings but suppose that a sane man had a low ideal suppose he wished to be a gentleman  any one who knows the world knows that in nine weeks he would have persuaded himself that he was a gentleman and this being manifestly not the case the result will be very real and practical dislocations and calamities in social life it is not the wild ideals which wreck the practical world it is the tame ideals  the matter may perhaps be illustrated by a parallel from our modern politics  when men tell us that the old liberal politicians of the type of gladstone cared only for ideals of course they are talking nonsensethey cared for a great many other things including votes and when men tell us that modern politicians of the type of mr chamberlain or in another way lord rosebery care only for votes or for material interest then again they are talking nonsensethese men care for ideals like all other men but the real distinction which may be drawn is this that to the older politician the ideal was an ideal and nothing else to the new politician his dream is not only a good dream it is a reality the old politician would have said it would be a good thing if there were a republican federation dominating the world but the modern politician does not say it would be a good thing if there were a british imperialism dominating the world he says it is a good thing that there is a british imperialism dominating the world whereas clearly there is nothing of the kind the old liberal would say there ought to be a good irish government in ireland  but the ordinary modern unionist does not say there ought to be a good english government in ireland  he says there is a good english government in ireland which is absurd in short the modern politicians seem to think that a man becomes practical merely by making assertions entirely about practical things apparently a delusion does not matter as long as it is a materialistic delusion  instinctively most of us feel that as a practical matter even the contrary is true i certainly would much rather share my apartments with a gentleman who thought he was god than with a gentleman who thought he was a grasshopper to be continually haunted by practical images and practical problems to be constantly thinking of things as actual as urgent as in process of completionthese things do not prove a man to be practical these things indeed are among the most ordinary signs of a lunatic that our modern statesmen are materialistic is nothing against their being also morbid  seeing angels in a vision may make a man a supernaturalist to excess  but merely seeing snakes in delirium tremens does not make him a naturalist  and when we come actually to examine the main stock notions of our modern practical politicians we find that those main stock notions are mainly delusions  a great many instances might be given of the fact we might take for example the case of that strange class of notions which underlie the word union and all the eulogies heaped upon it of course union is no more a good thing in itself than separation is a good thing in itself  to have a party in favour of union and a party in favour of separation is as absurd as to have a party in favour of going upstairs and a party in favour of going downstairs the question is not whether we go up or down stairs but where we are going to and what we are going for  union is strength union is also weakness  it is a good thing to harness two horses to a cart but it is not a good thing to try and turn two hansom cabs into one fourwheeler turning ten nations into one empire may happen to be as feasible as turning ten shillings into one halfsovereign also it may happen to be as preposterous as turning ten terriers into one mastiff the question in all cases is not a question of union or absence of union but of identity or absence of identity owing to certain historical and moral causes two nations may be so united as upon the whole to help each other  thus england and scotland pass their time in paying each other compliments but their energies and atmospheres run distinct and parallel and consequently do not clash  scotland continues to be educated and calvinistic england continues to be uneducated and happy but owing to certain other moral and certain other political causes two nations may be so united as only to hamper each other their lines do clash and do not run parallel  thus for instance england and ireland are so united that the irish can sometimes rule england but can never rule ireland the educational systems including the last education act are here as in the case of scotland a very good test of the matter the overwhelming majority of irishmen believe in a strict catholicism the overwhelming majority of englishmen believe in a vague protestantism the irish party in the parliament of union is just large enough to prevent the english education being indefinitely protestant and just small enough to prevent the irish education being definitely catholic here we have a state of things which no man in his senses would ever dream of wishing to continue if he had not been bewitched by the sentimentalism of the mere word union  this example of union however is not the example which i propose to take of the ingrained futility and deception underlying all the assumptions of the modern practical politician i wish to speak especially of another and much more general delusion it pervades the minds and speeches of all the practical men of all parties and it is a childish blunder built upon a single false metaphor i refer to the universal modern talk about young nations and new nations about america being young about new zealand being new  the whole thing is a trick of words  america is not young new zealand is not new it is a very discussable question whether they are not both much older than england or ireland  of course we may use the metaphor of youth about america or the colonies if we use it strictly as implying only a recent origin but if we use it as we do use it as implying vigour or vivacity or crudity or inexperience or hope or a long life before them or any of the romantic attributes of youth then it is surely as clear as daylight that we are duped by a stale figure of speech we can easily see the matter clearly by applying it to any other institution parallel to the institution of an independent nationality if a club called the milk and soda league let us say was set up yesterday as i have no doubt it was then of course the milk and soda league is a young club in the sense that it was set up yesterday but in no other sense it may consist entirely of moribund old gentlemen  it may be moribund itself we may call it a young club in the light of the fact that it was founded yesterday  we may also call it a very old club in the light of the fact that it will most probably go bankrupt tomorrow all this appears very obvious when we put it in this form any one who adopted the youngcommunity delusion with regard to a bank or a butchers shop would be sent to an asylum but the whole modern political notion that america and the colonies must be very vigorous because they are very new rests upon no better foundation  that america was founded long after england does not make it even in the faintest degree more probable that america will not perish a long time before england that england existed before her colonies does not make it any the less likely that she will exist after her colonies  and when we look at the actual history of the world we find that great european nations almost invariably have survived the vitality of their colonies when we look at the actual history of the world we find that if there is a thing that is born old and dies young it is a colony the greek colonies went to pieces long before the greek civilization the spanish colonies have gone to pieces long before the nation of spainnor does there seem to be any reason to doubt the possibility or even the probability of the conclusion that the colonial civilization which owes its origin to england will be much briefer and much less vigorous than the civilization of england itself  the english nation will still be going the way of all european nations when the anglosaxon race has gone the way of all fads  now of course the interesting question is have we in the case of america and the colonies any real evidence of a moral and intellectual youth as opposed to the indisputable triviality of a merely chronological youth consciously or unconsciously we know that we have no such evidence and consciously or unconsciously therefore we proceed to make it up of this pure and placid invention a good example for instance can be found in a recent poem of mr rudyard kiplings speaking of the english people and the south african war mr kipling says that we fawned on the younger nations for the men that could shoot and ride some people considered this sentence insulting  all that i am concerned with at present is the evident fact that it is not true the colonies provided very useful volunteer troops but they did not provide the best troops nor achieve the most successful exploits the best work in the war on the english side was done as might have been expected by the best english regiments the men who could shoot and ride were not the enthusiastic corn merchants from melbourne any more than they were the enthusiastic clerks from cheapside  the men who could shoot and ride were the men who had been taught to shoot and ride in the discipline of the standing army of a great european power  of course the colonials are as brave and athletic as any other average white men of course they acquitted themselves with reasonable credit all i have here to indicate is that for the purposes of this theory of the new nation it is necessary to maintain that the colonial forces were more useful or more heroic than the gunners at colenso or the fighting fifth  and of this contention there is not and never has been one stick or straw of evidence  a similar attempt is made and with even less success to represent the literature of the colonies as something fresh and vigorous and important the imperialist magazines are constantly springing upon us some genius from queensland or canada through whom we are expected to smell the odours of the bush or the prairie  as a matter of fact any one who is even slightly interested in literature as such and i for one confess that i am only slightly interested in literature as such will freely admit that the stories of these geniuses smell of nothing but printers ink and that not of firstrate quality by a great effort of imperial imagination the generous english people reads into these works a force and a novelty but the force and the novelty are not in the new writers the force and the novelty are in the ancient heart of the english anybody who studies them impartially will know that the firstrate writers of the colonies are not even particularly novel in their note and atmosphere are not only not producing a new kind of good literature but are not even in any particular sense producing a new kind of bad literature  the firstrate writers of the new countries are really almost exactly like the secondrate writers of the old countries  of course they do feel the mystery of the wilderness the mystery of the bush for all simple and honest men feel this in melbourne or margate or south st pancras but when they write most sincerely and most successfully it is not with a background of the mystery of the bush but with a background expressed or assumed of our own romantic cockney civilization what really moves their souls with a kindly terror is not the mystery of the wilderness but the mystery of a hansom cab  of course there are some exceptions to this generalization the one really arresting exception is olive schreiner and she is quite as certainly an exception that proves the rule olive schreiner is a fierce brilliant and realistic novelist but she is all this precisely because she is not english at all her tribal kinship is with the country of teniers and maarten maartensthat is with a country of realists  her literary kinship is with the pessimistic fiction of the continent with the novelists whose very pity is cruel  olive schreiner is the one english colonial who is not conventional for the simple reason that south africa is the one english colony which is not english and probably never will be and of course there are individual exceptions in a minor way i remember in particular some australian tales by mr mcilwain which were really able and effective and which for that reason i suppose are not presented to the public with blasts of a trumpet but my general contention if put before any one with a love of letters will not be disputed if it is understood it is not the truth that the colonial civilization as a whole is giving us or shows any signs of giving us a literature which will startle and renovate our own  it may be a very good thing for us to have an affectionate illusion in the matter that is quite another affair the colonies may have given england a new emotion i only say that they have not given the world a new book  touching these english colonies i do not wish to be misunderstood i do not say of them or of america that they have not a future or that they will not be great nations  i merely deny the whole established modern expression about them  i deny that they are destined to a future  i deny that they are destined to be great nations i deny of course that any human thing is destined to be anything all the absurd physical metaphors such as youth and age living and dying are when applied to nations but pseudoscientific attempts to conceal from men the awful liberty of their lonely souls  in the case of america indeed a warning to this effect is instant and essential  america of course like every other human thing can in spiritual sense live or die as much as it chooses but at the present moment the matter which america has very seriously to consider is not how near it is to its birth and beginning but how near it may be to its end  it is only a verbal question whether the american civilization is young it may become a very practical and urgent question whether it is dying when once we have cast aside as we inevitably have after a moments thought the fanciful physical metaphor involved in the word youth what serious evidence have we that america is a fresh force and not a stale one  it has a great many people like china it has a great deal of money like defeated carthage or dying venice it is full of bustle and excitability like athens after its ruin and all the greek cities in their decline  it is fond of new things but the old are always fond of new things young men read chronicles but old men read newspapers  it admires strength and good looks it admires a big and barbaric beauty in its women for instance but so did rome when the goth was at the gates all these are things quite compatible with fundamental tedium and decay there are three main shapes or symbols in which a nation can show itself essentially glad and greatby the heroic in government by the heroic in arms and by the heroic in art  beyond government which is as it were the very shape and body of a nation the most significant thing about any citizen is his artistic attitude towards a holiday and his moral attitude towards a fightthat is his way of accepting life and his way of accepting death  subjected to these eternal tests america does not appear by any means as particularly fresh or untouched  she appears with all the weakness and weariness of modern england or of any other western power in her politics she has broken up exactly as england has broken up into a bewildering opportunism and insincerity  in the matter of war and the national attitude towards war her resemblance to england is even more manifest and melancholy  it may be said with rough accuracy that there are three stages in the life of a strong people first it is a small power and fights small powers  then it is a great power and fights great powers  then it is a great power and fights small powers but pretends that they are great powers in order to rekindle the ashes of its ancient emotion and vanity after that the next step is to become a small power itself england exhibited this symptom of decadence very badly in the war with the transvaal but america exhibited it worse in the war with spain there was exhibited more sharply and absurdly than anywhere else the ironic contrast between the very careless choice of a strong line and the very careful choice of a weak enemy america added to all her other late roman or byzantine elements the element of the caracallan triumph the triumph over nobody  but when we come to the last test of nationality the test of art and letters the case is almost terrible  the english colonies have produced no great artists and that fact may prove that they are still full of silent possibilities and reserve force but america has produced great artists  and that fact most certainly proves that she is full of a fine futility and the end of all things whatever the american men of genius are they are not young gods making a young world  is the art of whistler a brave barbaric art happy and headlong  does mr henry james infect us with the spirit of a schoolboy  no the colonies have not spoken and they are safe their silence may be the silence of the unborn  but out of america has come a sweet and startling cry as unmistakable as the cry of a dying man    xix slum novelists and the slums  odd ideas are entertained in our time about the real nature of the doctrine of human fraternity  the real doctrine is something which we do not with all our modern humanitarianism very clearly understand much less very closely practise  there is nothing for instance particularly undemocratic about kicking your butler downstairs it may be wrong but it is not unfraternal  in a certain sense the blow or kick may be considered as a confession of equality you are meeting your butler body to body you are almost according him the privilege of the duel  there is nothing undemocratic though there may be something unreasonable in expecting a great deal from the butler and being filled with a kind of frenzy of surprise when he falls short of the divine stature  the thing which is really undemocratic and unfraternal is not to expect the butler to be more or less divine  the thing which is really undemocratic and unfraternal is to say as so many modern humanitarians say of course one must make allowances for those on a lower plane all things considered indeed it may be said without undue exaggeration that the really undemocratic and unfraternal thing is the common practice of not kicking the butler downstairs  it is only because such a vast section of the modern world is out of sympathy with the serious democratic sentiment that this statement will seem to many to be lacking in seriousness democracy is not philanthropy it is not even altruism or social reform democracy is not founded on pity for the common man democracy is founded on reverence for the common man or if you will even on fear of him  it does not champion man because man is so miserable but because man is so sublime  it does not object so much to the ordinary man being a slave as to his not being a king for its dream is always the dream of the first roman republic a nation of kings  next to a genuine republic the most democratic thing in the world is a hereditary despotism  i mean a despotism in which there is absolutely no trace whatever of any nonsense about intellect or special fitness for the post rational despotismthat is selective despotismis always a curse to mankind because with that you have the ordinary man misunderstood and misgoverned by some prig who has no brotherly respect for him at all  but irrational despotism is always democratic because it is the ordinary man enthroned the worst form of slavery is that which is called caesarism or the choice of some bold or brilliant man as despot because he is suitable  for that means that men choose a representative not because he represents them but because he does not men trust an ordinary man like george iii or william iv because they are themselves ordinary men and understand him men trust an ordinary man because they trust themselves but men trust a great man because they do not trust themselves and hence the worship of great men always appears in times of weakness and cowardice we never hear of great men until the time when all other men are small  hereditary despotism is then in essence and sentiment democratic because it chooses from mankind at random if it does not declare that every man may rule it declares the next most democratic thing it declares that any man may rule hereditary aristocracy is a far worse and more dangerous thing because the numbers and multiplicity of an aristocracy make it sometimes possible for it to figure as an aristocracy of intellect some of its members will presumably have brains and thus they at any rate will be an intellectual aristocracy within the social one they will rule the aristocracy by virtue of their intellect and they will rule the country by virtue of their aristocracy thus a double falsity will be set up and millions of the images of god who fortunately for their wives and families are neither gentlemen nor clever men will be represented by a man like mr balfour or mr wyndham because he is too gentlemanly to be called merely clever and just too clever to be called merely a gentleman but even an hereditary aristocracy may exhibit by a sort of accident from time to time some of the basically democratic quality which belongs to a hereditary despotism  it is amusing to think how much conservative ingenuity has been wasted in the defence of the house of lords by men who were desperately endeavouring to prove that the house of lords consisted of clever men  there is one really good defence of the house of lords though admirers of the peerage are strangely coy about using it and that is that the house of lords in its full and proper strength consists of stupid men it really would be a plausible defence of that otherwise indefensible body to point out that the clever men in the commons who owed their power to cleverness ought in the last resort to be checked by the average man in the lords who owed their power to accident of course there would be many answers to such a contention as for instance that the house of lords is largely no longer a house of lords but a house of tradesmen and financiers or that the bulk of the commonplace nobility do not vote and so leave the chamber to the prigs and the specialists and the mad old gentlemen with hobbies  but on some occasions the house of lords even under all these disadvantages is in some sense representative when all the peers flocked together to vote against mr gladstones second home rule bill for instance those who said that the peers represented the english people were perfectly right all those dear old men who happened to be born peers were at that moment and upon that question the precise counterpart of all the dear old men who happened to be born paupers or middleclass gentlemen that mob of peers did really represent the english peoplethat is to say it was honest ignorant vaguely excited almost unanimous and obviously wrong  of course rational democracy is better as an expression of the public will than the haphazard hereditary method while we are about having any kind of democracy let it be rational democracy  but if we are to have any kind of oligarchy let it be irrational oligarchy  then at least we shall be ruled by men  but the thing which is really required for the proper working of democracy is not merely the democratic system or even the democratic philosophy but the democratic emotion  the democratic emotion like most elementary and indispensable things is a thing difficult to describe at any time but it is peculiarly difficult to describe it in our enlightened age for the simple reason that it is peculiarly difficult to find it it is a certain instinctive attitude which feels the things in which all men agree to be unspeakably important and all the things in which they differ such as mere brains to be almost unspeakably unimportant  the nearest approach to it in our ordinary life would be the promptitude with which we should consider mere humanity in any circumstance of shock or death we should say after a somewhat disturbing discovery there is a dead man under the sofa we should not be likely to say there is a dead man of considerable personal refinement under the sofa we should say a woman has fallen into the water  we should not say a highly educated woman has fallen into the water  nobody would say there are the remains of a clear thinker in your back garden nobody would say unless you hurry up and stop him a man with a very fine ear for music will have jumped off that cliff but this emotion which all of us have in connection with such things as birth and death is to some people native and constant at all ordinary times and in all ordinary places  it was native to st francis of assisi  it was native to walt whitman in this strange and splendid degree it cannot be expected perhaps to pervade a whole commonwealth or a whole civilization but one commonwealth may have it much more than another commonwealth one civilization much more than another civilization no community perhaps ever had it so much as the early franciscans no community perhaps ever had it so little as ours  everything in our age has when carefully examined this fundamentally undemocratic quality  in religion and morals we should admit in the abstract that the sins of the educated classes were as great as or perhaps greater than the sins of the poor and ignorant but in practice the great difference between the mediaeval ethics and ours is that ours concentrate attention on the sins which are the sins of the ignorant and practically deny that the sins which are the sins of the educated are sins at all we are always talking about the sin of intemperate drinking because it is quite obvious that the poor have it more than the rich but we are always denying that there is any such thing as the sin of pride because it would be quite obvious that the rich have it more than the poor we are always ready to make a saint or prophet of the educated man who goes into cottages to give a little kindly advice to the uneducated but the medieval idea of a saint or prophet was something quite different the mediaeval saint or prophet was an uneducated man who walked into grand houses to give a little kindly advice to the educated the old tyrants had enough insolence to despoil the poor but they had not enough insolence to preach to them it was the gentleman who oppressed the slums but it was the slums that admonished the gentleman  and just as we are undemocratic in faith and morals so we are by the very nature of our attitude in such matters undemocratic in the tone of our practical politics it is a sufficient proof that we are not an essentially democratic state that we are always wondering what we shall do with the poor if we were democrats we should be wondering what the poor will do with us with us the governing class is always saying to itself what laws shall we make in a purely democratic state it would be always saying what laws can we obey  a purely democratic state perhaps there has never been  but even the feudal ages were in practice thus far democratic that every feudal potentate knew that any laws which he made would in all probability return upon himself his feathers might be cut off for breaking a sumptuary law his head might be cut off for high treason but the modern laws are almost always laws made to affect the governed class but not the governing we have publichouse licensing laws but not sumptuary laws that is to say we have laws against the festivity and hospitality of the poor but no laws against the festivity and hospitality of the rich we have laws against blasphemythat is against a kind of coarse and offensive speaking in which nobody but a rough and obscure man would be likely to indulge  but we have no laws against heresythat is against the intellectual poisoning of the whole people in which only a prosperous and prominent man would be likely to be successful  the evil of aristocracy is not that it necessarily leads to the infliction of bad things or the suffering of sad ones the evil of aristocracy is that it places everything in the hands of a class of people who can always inflict what they can never suffer whether what they inflict is in their intention good or bad they become equally frivolous  the case against the governing class of modern england is not in the least that it is selfish if you like you may call the english oligarchs too fantastically unselfish the case against them simply is that when they legislate for all men they always omit themselves  we are undemocratic then in our religion as is proved by our efforts to raise the poor  we are undemocratic in our government as is proved by our innocent attempt to govern them well but above all we are undemocratic in our literature as is proved by the torrent of novels about the poor and serious studies of the poor which pour from our publishers every month and the more modern the book is the more certain it is to be devoid of democratic sentiment  a poor man is a man who has not got much money  this may seem a simple and unnecessary description but in the face of a great mass of modern fact and fiction it seems very necessary indeed most of our realists and sociologists talk about a poor man as if he were an octopus or an alligator  there is no more need to study the psychology of poverty than to study the psychology of bad temper or the psychology of vanity or the psychology of animal spirits a man ought to know something of the emotions of an insulted man not by being insulted but simply by being a man  and he ought to know something of the emotions of a poor man not by being poor but simply by being a man therefore in any writer who is describing poverty my first objection to him will be that he has studied his subject a democrat would have imagined it  a great many hard things have been said about religious slumming and political or social slumming but surely the most despicable of all is artistic slumming  the religious teacher is at least supposed to be interested in the costermonger because he is a man the politician is in some dim and perverted sense interested in the costermonger because he is a citizen it is only the wretched writer who is interested in the costermonger merely because he is a costermonger  nevertheless so long as he is merely seeking impressions or in other words copy his trade though dull is honest but when he endeavours to represent that he is describing the spiritual core of a costermonger his dim vices and his delicate virtues then we must object that his claim is preposterous we must remind him that he is a journalist and nothing else he has far less psychological authority even than the foolish missionary for he is in the literal and derivative sense a journalist while the missionary is an eternalist  the missionary at least pretends to have a version of the mans lot for all time the journalist only pretends to have a version of it from day to day the missionary comes to tell the poor man that he is in the same condition with all men  the journalist comes to tell other people how different the poor man is from everybody else  if the modern novels about the slums such as novels of mr arthur morrison or the exceedingly able novels of mr somerset maugham are intended to be sensational i can only say that that is a noble and reasonable object and that they attain it  a sensation a shock to the imagination like the contact with cold water is always a good and exhilarating thing and undoubtedly men will always seek this sensation among other forms in the form of the study of the strange antics of remote or alien peoples  in the twelfth century men obtained this sensation by reading about dogheaded men in africa in the twentieth century they obtained it by reading about pigheaded boers in africa  the men of the twentieth century were certainly it must be admitted somewhat the more credulous of the two for it is not recorded of the men in the twelfth century that they organized a sanguinary crusade solely for the purpose of altering the singular formation of the heads of the africans  but it may be and it may even legitimately be that since all these monsters have faded from the popular mythology it is necessary to have in our fiction the image of the horrible and hairy eastender merely to keep alive in us a fearful and childlike wonder at external peculiarities but the middle ages with a great deal more common sense than it would now be fashionable to admit regarded natural history at bottom rather as a kind of joke they regarded the soul as very important hence while they had a natural history of dogheaded men they did not profess to have a psychology of dogheaded men they did not profess to mirror the mind of a dogheaded man to share his tenderest secrets or mount with his most celestial musings they did not write novels about the semicanine creature attributing to him all the oldest morbidities and all the newest fads it is permissible to present men as monsters if we wish to make the reader jump and to make anybody jump is always a christian act but it is not permissible to present men as regarding themselves as monsters or as making themselves jump  to summarize our slum fiction is quite defensible as aesthetic fiction it is not defensible as spiritual fact  one enormous obstacle stands in the way of its actuality the men who write it and the men who read it are men of the middle classes or the upper classes at least of those who are loosely termed the educated classes  hence the fact that it is the life as the refined man sees it proves that it cannot be the life as the unrefined man lives it rich men write stories about poor men and describe them as speaking with a coarse or heavy or husky enunciation but if poor men wrote novels about you or me they would describe us as speaking with some absurd shrill and affected voice such as we only hear from a duchess in a threeact farce  the slum novelist gains his whole effect by the fact that some detail is strange to the reader but that detail by the nature of the case cannot be strange in itself it cannot be strange to the soul which he is professing to study the slum novelist gains his effects by describing the same grey mist as draping the dingy factory and the dingy tavern  but to the man he is supposed to be studying there must be exactly the same difference between the factory and the tavern that there is to a middleclass man between a late night at the office and a supper at paganis the slum novelist is content with pointing out that to the eye of his particular class a pickaxe looks dirty and a pewter pot looks dirty but the man he is supposed to be studying sees the difference between them exactly as a clerk sees the difference between a ledger and an edition de luxe  the chiaroscuro of the life is inevitably lost for to us the high lights and the shadows are a light grey but the high lights and the shadows are not a light grey in that life any more than in any other  the kind of man who could really express the pleasures of the poor would be also the kind of man who could share them  in short these books are not a record of the psychology of poverty  they are a record of the psychology of wealth and culture when brought in contact with poverty they are not a description of the state of the slums  they are only a very dark and dreadful description of the state of the slummers one might give innumerable examples of the essentially unsympathetic and unpopular quality of these realistic writers but perhaps the simplest and most obvious example with which we could conclude is the mere fact that these writers are realistic the poor have many other vices but at least they are never realistic the poor are melodramatic and romantic in grain the poor all believe in high moral platitudes and copybook maxims probably this is the ultimate meaning of the great saying blessed are the poor blessed are the poor for they are always making life or trying to make life like an adelphi play  some innocent educationalists and philanthropists for even philanthropists can be innocent have expressed a grave astonishment that the masses prefer shilling shockers to scientific treatises and melodramas to problem plays the reason is very simple  the realistic story is certainly more artistic than the melodramatic story  if what you desire is deft handling delicate proportions a unit of artistic atmosphere the realistic story has a full advantage over the melodrama in everything that is light and bright and ornamental the realistic story has a full advantage over the melodrama  but at least the melodrama has one indisputable advantage over the realistic story the melodrama is much more like life  it is much more like man and especially the poor man  it is very banal and very inartistic when a poor woman at the adelphi says do you think i will sell my own child but poor women in the battersea high road do say do you think i will sell my own child  they say it on every available occasion you can hear a sort of murmur or babble of it all the way down the street  it is very stale and weak dramatic art if that is all when the workman confronts his master and says im a man but a workman does say im a man two or three times every day in fact it is tedious possibly to hear poor men being melodramatic behind the footlights but that is because one can always hear them being melodramatic in the street outside in short melodrama if it is dull is dull because it is too accurate somewhat the same problem exists in the case of stories about schoolboys mr kiplings stalky and co is much more amusing if you are talking about amusement than the late dean farrars eric or little by little  but eric is immeasurably more like real schoollife for real schoollife real boyhood is full of the things of which eric is fullpriggishness a crude piety a silly sin a weak but continual attempt at the heroic in a word melodrama and if we wish to lay a firm basis for any efforts to help the poor we must not become realistic and see them from the outside we must become melodramatic and see them from the inside the novelist must not take out his notebook and say i am an expert  no he must imitate the workman in the adelphi play he must slap himself on the chest and say i am a man    xx  concluding remarks on the importance of orthodoxy  whether the human mind can advance or not is a question too little discussed for nothing can be more dangerous than to found our social philosophy on any theory which is debatable but has not been debated but if we assume for the sake of argument that there has been in the past or will be in the future such a thing as a growth or improvement of the human mind itself there still remains a very sharp objection to be raised against the modern version of that improvement  the vice of the modern notion of mental progress is that it is always something concerned with the breaking of bonds the effacing of boundaries the casting away of dogmas  but if there be such a thing as mental growth it must mean the growth into more and more definite convictions into more and more dogmas  the human brain is a machine for coming to conclusions if it cannot come to conclusions it is rusty when we hear of a man too clever to believe we are hearing of something having almost the character of a contradiction in terms it is like hearing of a nail that was too good to hold down a carpet or a bolt that was too strong to keep a door shut man can hardly be defined after the fashion of carlyle as an animal who makes tools ants and beavers and many other animals make tools in the sense that they make an apparatus  man can be defined as an animal that makes dogmas  as he piles doctrine on doctrine and conclusion on conclusion in the formation of some tremendous scheme of philosophy and religion he is in the only legitimate sense of which the expression is capable becoming more and more human when he drops one doctrine after another in a refined scepticism when he declines to tie himself to a system when he says that he has outgrown definitions when he says that he disbelieves in finality when in his own imagination he sits as god holding no form of creed but contemplating all then he is by that very process sinking slowly backwards into the vagueness of the vagrant animals and the unconsciousness of the grass  trees have no dogmas turnips are singularly broadminded  if then i repeat there is to be mental advance it must be mental advance in the construction of a definite philosophy of life  and that philosophy of life must be right and the other philosophies wrong now of all or nearly all the able modern writers whom i have briefly studied in this book this is especially and pleasingly true that they do each of them have a constructive and affirmative view and that they do take it seriously and ask us to take it seriously there is nothing merely sceptically progressive about mr rudyard kipling there is nothing in the least broad minded about mr bernard shaw the paganism of mr lowes dickinson is more grave than any christianity even the opportunism of mr h g wells is more dogmatic than the idealism of anybody else  somebody complained i think to matthew arnold that he was getting as dogmatic as carlyle he replied that may be true but you overlook an obvious difference i am dogmatic and right and carlyle is dogmatic and wrong the strong humour of the remark ought not to disguise from us its everlasting seriousness and common sense no man ought to write at all or even to speak at all unless he thinks that he is in truth and the other man in error  in similar style i hold that i am dogmatic and right while mr shaw is dogmatic and wrong  but my main point at present is to notice that the chief among these writers i have discussed do most sanely and courageously offer themselves as dogmatists as founders of a system  it may be true that the thing in mr shaw most interesting to me is the fact that mr shaw is wrong but it is equally true that the thing in mr shaw most interesting to himself is the fact that mr shaw is right mr shaw may have none with him but himself but it is not for himself he cares it is for the vast and universal church of which he is the only member  the two typical men of genius whom i have mentioned here and with whose names i have begun this book are very symbolic if only because they have shown that the fiercest dogmatists can make the best artists in the fin de siecle atmosphere every one was crying out that literature should be free from all causes and all ethical creeds art was to produce only exquisite workmanship and it was especially the note of those days to demand brilliant plays and brilliant short stories and when they got them they got them from a couple of moralists the best short stories were written by a man trying to preach imperialism the best plays were written by a man trying to preach socialism all the art of all the artists looked tiny and tedious beside the art which was a byproduct of propaganda  the reason indeed is very simple  a man cannot be wise enough to be a great artist without being wise enough to wish to be a philosopher a man cannot have the energy to produce good art without having the energy to wish to pass beyond it  a small artist is content with art a great artist is content with nothing except everything so we find that when real forces good or bad like kipling and g b s enter our arena they bring with them not only startling and arresting art but very startling and arresting dogmas  and they care even more and desire us to care even more about their startling and arresting dogmas than about their startling and arresting art mr shaw is a good dramatist but what he desires more than anything else to be is a good politician  mr rudyard kipling is by divine caprice and natural genius an unconventional poet but what he desires more than anything else to be is a conventional poet he desires to be the poet of his people bone of their bone and flesh of their flesh understanding their origins celebrating their destiny he desires to be poet laureate a most sensible and honourable and publicspirited desire having been given by the gods originalitythat is disagreement with othershe desires divinely to agree with them but the most striking instance of all more striking i think even than either of these is the instance of mr h g wells he began in a sort of insane infancy of pure art  he began by making a new heaven and a new earth with the same irresponsible instinct by which men buy a new necktie or buttonhole he began by trifling with the stars and systems in order to make ephemeral anecdotes he killed the universe for a joke  he has since become more and more serious and has become as men inevitably do when they become more and more serious more and more parochial  he was frivolous about the twilight of the gods but he is serious about the london omnibus he was careless in the time machine for that dealt only with the destiny of all things but he is careful and even cautious in mankind in the making for that deals with the day after tomorrow he began with the end of the world and that was easy now he has gone on to the beginning of the world and that is difficult but the main result of all this is the same as in the other cases the men who have really been the bold artists the realistic artists the uncompromising artists are the men who have turned out after all to be writing with a purpose  suppose that any cool and cynical artcritic any artcritic fully impressed with the conviction that artists were greatest when they were most purely artistic suppose that a man who professed ably a humane aestheticism as did mr max beerbohm or a cruel aestheticism as did mr w e henley had cast his eye over the whole fictional literature which was recent in the year 1895 and had been asked to select the three most vigorous and promising and original artists and artistic works he would i think most certainly have said that for a fine artistic audacity for a real artistic delicacy or for a whiff of true novelty in art the things that stood first were soldiers three by a mr rudyard kipling arms and the man by a mr bernard shaw and the time machine by a man called wells and all these men have shown themselves ingrainedly didactic you may express the matter if you will by saying that if we want doctrines we go to the great artists  but it is clear from the psychology of the matter that this is not the true statement the true statement is that when we want any art tolerably brisk and bold we have to go to the doctrinaires  in concluding this book therefore i would ask first and foremost that men such as these of whom i have spoken should not be insulted by being taken for artists  no man has any right whatever merely to enjoy the work of mr bernard shaw he might as well enjoy the invasion of his country by the french  mr shaw writes either to convince or to enrage us  no man has any business to be a kiplingite without being a politician and an imperialist politician if a man is first with us it should be because of what is first with him if a man convinces us at all it should be by his convictions if we hate a poem of kiplings from political passion we are hating it for the same reason that the poet loved it if we dislike him because of his opinions we are disliking him for the best of all possible reasons if a man comes into hyde park to preach it is permissible to hoot him but it is discourteous to applaud him as a performing bear and an artist is only a performing bear compared with the meanest man who fancies he has anything to say  there is indeed one class of modern writers and thinkers who cannot altogether be overlooked in this question though there is no space here for a lengthy account of them which indeed to confess the truth would consist chiefly of abuse  i mean those who get over all these abysses and reconcile all these wars by talking about aspects of truth by saying that the art of kipling represents one aspect of the truth and the art of william watson another the art of mr bernard shaw one aspect of the truth and the art of mr cunningham grahame another the art of mr h g wells one aspect and the art of mr coventry patmore say another i will only say here that this seems to me an evasion which has not even had the sense to disguise itself ingeniously in words if we talk of a certain thing being an aspect of truth it is evident that we claim to know what is truth just as if we talk of the hind leg of a dog we claim to know what is a dog unfortunately the philosopher who talks about aspects of truth generally also asks what is truth  frequently even he denies the existence of truth or says it is inconceivable by the human intelligence  how then can he recognize its aspects i should not like to be an artist who brought an architectural sketch to a builder saying this is the south aspect of seaview cottage seaview cottage of course does not exist  i should not even like very much to have to explain under such circumstances that seaview cottage might exist but was unthinkable by the human mind nor should i like any better to be the bungling and absurd metaphysician who professed to be able to see everywhere the aspects of a truth that is not there  of course it is perfectly obvious that there are truths in kipling that there are truths in shaw or wells but the degree to which we can perceive them depends strictly upon how far we have a definite conception inside us of what is truth it is ludicrous to suppose that the more sceptical we are the more we see good in everything  it is clear that the more we are certain what good is the more we shall see good in everything  i plead then that we should agree or disagree with these men  i plead that we should agree with them at least in having an abstract belief but i know that there are current in the modern world many vague objections to having an abstract belief and i feel that we shall not get any further until we have dealt with some of them the first objection is easily stated  a common hesitation in our day touching the use of extreme convictions is a sort of notion that extreme convictions specially upon cosmic matters have been responsible in the past for the thing which is called bigotry but a very small amount of direct experience will dissipate this view in real life the people who are most bigoted are the people who have no convictions at all  the economists of the manchester school who disagree with socialism take socialism seriously it is the young man in bond street who does not know what socialism means much less whether he agrees with it who is quite certain that these socialist fellows are making a fuss about nothing the man who understands the calvinist philosophy enough to agree with it must understand the catholic philosophy in order to disagree with it it is the vague modern who is not at all certain what is right who is most certain that dante was wrong  the serious opponent of the latin church in history even in the act of showing that it produced great infamies must know that it produced great saints it is the hardheaded stockbroker who knows no history and believes no religion who is nevertheless perfectly convinced that all these priests are knaves the salvationist at the marble arch may be bigoted but he is not too bigoted to yearn from a common human kinship after the dandy on church parade but the dandy on church parade is so bigoted that he does not in the least yearn after the salvationist at the marble arch bigotry may be roughly defined as the anger of men who have no opinions  it is the resistance offered to definite ideas by that vague bulk of people whose ideas are indefinite to excess bigotry may be called the appalling frenzy of the indifferent this frenzy of the indifferent is in truth a terrible thing it has made all monstrous and widely pervading persecutions in this degree it was not the people who cared who ever persecuted the people who cared were not sufficiently numerous  it was the people who did not care who filled the world with fire and oppression it was the hands of the indifferent that lit the faggots it was the hands of the indifferent that turned the rack there have come some persecutions out of the pain of a passionate certainty but these produced not bigotry but fanaticisma very different and a somewhat admirable thing  bigotry in the main has always been the pervading omnipotence of those who do not care crushing out those who care in darkness and blood  there are people however who dig somewhat deeper than this into the possible evils of dogma  it is felt by many that strong philosophical conviction while it does not as they perceive produce that sluggish and fundamentally frivolous condition which we call bigotry does produce a certain concentration exaggeration and moral impatience which we may agree to call fanaticism they say in brief that ideas are dangerous things in politics for example it is commonly urged against a man like mr balfour or against a man like mr john morley that a wealth of ideas is dangerous  the true doctrine on this point again is surely not very difficult to state  ideas are dangerous but the man to whom they are least dangerous is the man of ideas he is acquainted with ideas and moves among them like a liontamer ideas are dangerous but the man to whom they are most dangerous is the man of no ideas  the man of no ideas will find the first idea fly to his head like wine to the head of a teetotaller it is a common error i think among the radical idealists of my own party and period to suggest that financiers and business men are a danger to the empire because they are so sordid or so materialistic the truth is that financiers and business men are a danger to the empire because they can be sentimental about any sentiment and idealistic about any ideal any ideal that they find lying about just as a boy who has not known much of women is apt too easily to take a woman for the woman so these practical men unaccustomed to causes are always inclined to think that if a thing is proved to be an ideal it is proved to be the ideal many for example avowedly followed cecil rhodes because he had a vision they might as well have followed him because he had a nose a man without some kind of dream of perfection is quite as much of a monstrosity as a noseless man  people say of such a figure in almost feverish whispers he knows his own mind which is exactly like saying in equally feverish whispers he blows his own nose human nature simply cannot subsist without a hope and aim of some kind as the sanity of the old testament truly said where there is no vision the people perisheth  but it is precisely because an ideal is necessary to man that the man without ideals is in permanent danger of fanaticism  there is nothing which is so likely to leave a man open to the sudden and irresistible inroad of an unbalanced vision as the cultivation of business habits all of us know angular business men who think that the earth is flat or that mr kruger was at the head of a great military despotism or that men are graminivorous or that bacon wrote shakespeare religious and philosophical beliefs are indeed as dangerous as fire and nothing can take from them that beauty of danger but there is only one way of really guarding ourselves against the excessive danger of them and that is to be steeped in philosophy and soaked in religion  briefly then we dismiss the two opposite dangers of bigotry and fanaticism bigotry which is a too great vagueness and fanaticism which is a too great concentration  we say that the cure for the bigot is belief we say that the cure for the idealist is ideas to know the best theories of existence and to choose the best from them that is to the best of our own strong conviction appears to us the proper way to be neither bigot nor fanatic but something more firm than a bigot and more terrible than a fanatic a man with a definite opinion  but that definite opinion must in this view begin with the basic matters of human thought and these must not be dismissed as irrelevant as religion for instance is too often in our days dismissed as irrelevant even if we think religion insoluble we cannot think it irrelevant even if we ourselves have no view of the ultimate verities we must feel that wherever such a view exists in a man it must be more important than anything else in him  the instant that the thing ceases to be the unknowable it becomes the indispensable there can be no doubt i think that the idea does exist in our time that there is something narrow or irrelevant or even mean about attacking a mans religion or arguing from it in matters of politics or ethics  there can be quite as little doubt that such an accusation of narrowness is itself almost grotesquely narrow to take an example from comparatively current events  we all know that it was not uncommon for a man to be considered a scarecrow of bigotry and obscurantism because he distrusted the japanese or lamented the rise of the japanese on the ground that the japanese were pagans  nobody would think that there was anything antiquated or fanatical about distrusting a people because of some difference between them and us in practice or political machinery nobody would think it bigoted to say of a people i distrust their influence because they are protectionists  no one would think it narrow to say i lament their rise because they are socialists or manchester individualists or strong believers in militarism and conscription  a difference of opinion about the nature of parliaments matters very much but a difference of opinion about the nature of sin does not matter at all  a difference of opinion about the object of taxation matters very much but a difference of opinion about the object of human existence does not matter at all we have a right to distrust a man who is in a different kind of municipality but we have no right to mistrust a man who is in a different kind of cosmos  this sort of enlightenment is surely about the most unenlightened that it is possible to imagine to recur to the phrase which i employed earlier this is tantamount to saying that everything is important with the exception of everything religion is exactly the thing which cannot be left outbecause it includes everything  the most absentminded person cannot well pack his gladstonebag and leave out the bag we have a general view of existence whether we like it or not it alters or to speak more accurately it creates and involves everything we say or do whether we like it or not  if we regard the cosmos as a dream we regard the fiscal question as a dream if we regard the cosmos as a joke we regard st pauls cathedral as a joke if everything is bad then we must believe if it be possible that beer is bad if everything be good we are forced to the rather fantastic conclusion that scientific philanthropy is good  every man in the street must hold a metaphysical system and hold it firmly the possibility is that he may have held it so firmly and so long as to have forgotten all about its existence  this latter situation is certainly possible in fact it is the situation of the whole modern world  the modern world is filled with men who hold dogmas so strongly that they do not even know that they are dogmas it may be said even that the modern world as a corporate body holds certain dogmas so strongly that it does not know that they are dogmas  it may be thought dogmatic for instance in some circles accounted progressive to assume the perfection or improvement of man in another world  but it is not thought dogmatic to assume the perfection or improvement of man in this world though that idea of progress is quite as unproved as the idea of immortality and from a rationalistic point of view quite as improbable progress happens to be one of our dogmas and a dogma means a thing which is not thought dogmatic  or again we see nothing dogmatic in the inspiring but certainly most startling theory of physical science that we should collect facts for the sake of facts even though they seem as useless as sticks and straws this is a great and suggestive idea and its utility may if you will be proving itself but its utility is in the abstract quite as disputable as the utility of that calling on oracles or consulting shrines which is also said to prove itself thus because we are not in a civilization which believes strongly in oracles or sacred places we see the full frenzy of those who killed themselves to find the sepulchre of christ  but being in a civilization which does believe in this dogma of fact for facts sake we do not see the full frenzy of those who kill themselves to find the north pole  i am not speaking of a tenable ultimate utility which is true both of the crusades and the polar explorations i mean merely that we do see the superficial and aesthetic singularity the startling quality about the idea of men crossing a continent with armies to conquer the place where a man died but we do not see the aesthetic singularity and startling quality of men dying in agonies to find a place where no man can livea place only interesting because it is supposed to be the meetingplace of some lines that do not exist  let us then go upon a long journey and enter on a dreadful search let us at least dig and seek till we have discovered our own opinions the dogmas we really hold are far more fantastic and perhaps far more beautiful than we think  in the course of these essays i fear that i have spoken from time to time of rationalists and rationalism and that in a disparaging sense  being full of that kindliness which should come at the end of everything even of a book i apologize to the rationalists even for calling them rationalists there are no rationalists  we all believe fairytales and live in them some with a sumptuous literary turn believe in the existence of the lady clothed with the sun  some with a more rustic elvish instinct like mr mccabe believe merely in the impossible sun itself some hold the undemonstrable dogma of the existence of god some the equally undemonstrable dogma of the existence of the man next door  truths turn into dogmas the instant that they are disputed thus every man who utters a doubt defines a religion  and the scepticism of our time does not really destroy the beliefs rather it creates them gives them their limits and their plain and defiant shape we who are liberals once held liberalism lightly as a truism now it has been disputed and we hold it fiercely as a faith we who believe in patriotism once thought patriotism to be reasonable and thought little more about it  now we know it to be unreasonable and know it to be right  we who are christians never knew the great philosophic common sense which inheres in that mystery until the antichristian writers pointed it out to us  the great march of mental destruction will go on  everything will be denied everything will become a
