28651157	birds in town  village  by   w h hudson  fzs  author of the purple land idle days in patagonia far away and long ago etc   1920    preface  this book is more than a mere reprint of birds in a village first published in 1893 that was my first book about bird life with some impressions of rural scenes in england and as is often the case with a first book its author has continued to cherish a certain affection for it on this account it pleased me when its turn came to be reissued since this gave me the opportunity of mending some faults in the portions retained and of throwing out a good deal of matter which appeared to me not worth keeping  the first portion birds in a village has been mostly rewritten with some fresh matter added mainly later observations and incidents introduced in illustration of the various subjects discussed for the concluding portion of the old book which has been discarded i have substituted entirely new matterthe part entitled birds in a cornish village  between these two long parts there are five shorter essays which i have retained with little alteration and these in one or two instances are consequently out of date especially in what was said with bitterness in the essay on exotic birds for britain anent the featherwearing fashion and of the london trade in dead birds and the refusal of women at that time to help us in trying to save the beautiful wild bird life of this country and of the world generally from extermination happily the last twenty years of the life and work of the royal society for the protection of birds have changed all that and it would not now be too much to say that all rightthinking persons in this country men and women are anxious to see the end of this iniquitous traffic  w h h  september 1919    contents

village    birds in a village i  about the middle of last may after a rough and cold period there came a spell of brilliant weather reviving in me the old spring feeling the passion for wild nature the desire for the companionship of birds and i betook myself to st jamess park for the sake of such satisfaction as may be had from watching and feeding the fowls wild and semiwild found gathered at that favored spot  i was glad to observe a couple of those new colonists of the ornamental water the dabchicks and to renew my acquaintance with the familiar longestablished moorhens one of them was engaged in building its nest in an elmtree growing at the waters edge i saw it make two journeys with large wisps of dry grass in its beak running up the rough slanting trunk to a height of sixteen to seventeen feet and disappearing within the brushwood sheaf that springs from the bole at that distance from the roots the woodpigeons were much more numerous also more eager to be fed  they seemed to understand very quickly that my bread and grain was for them and not the sparrows but although they stationed themselves close to me the little robbers we were jointly trying to outwit managed to get some pieces of bread by flying up and catching them before they touched the sward this little comedy over i visited the waterfowl ducks of many kinds sheldrakes geese from many lands swans black and swans white to see birds in prison during the spring mood of which i have spoken is not only no satisfaction but a positive pain herealbeit without that large liberty that nature gives they are free in a measure and swimming and diving or dozing in the sunshine with the blue sky above them they are perhaps unconscious of any restraint  walking along the margin i noticed three children some yards ahead of me two were quite small but the third in whose charge the others were was a robustlooking girl aged about ten or eleven years from their dress and appearance i took them to be the children of a respectable artisan or small tradesman but what chiefly attracted my attention was the very great pleasure the elder girl appeared to take in the birds she had come well provided with stale bread to feed them and after giving moderately of her store to the woodpigeons and sparrows she went on to the others native and exotic that were disporting themselves in the water or sunning themselves on the green bank she did not cast her bread on the water in the manner usual with visitors but was anxious to feed all the different species or as many as she could attract to her and appeared satisfied when any one individual of a particular kind got a fragment of her bread meanwhile she talked eagerly to the little ones calling their attention to the different birds drawing near i also became an interested listener and then in answer to my questions she began telling me what all these strange fowls were this she said glad to give information is the canadian goose and there is the egyptian goose and here is the kingduck coming towards us and do you see that large beautiful bird standing by itself that will not come to be fed that is the golden duck but that is not its real name i dont know them all and so i name some for myself i call that one the golden duck because in the sun its feathers sometimes shine like gold it was a rare pleasure to listen to her and seeing what sort of a girl she was and how much in love with her subject i in my turn told her a great deal about the birds before us also of other birds she had never seen nor heard of in other and distant lands that have a nobler bird life than ours and after she had listened eagerly for some minutes and had then been silent a little while she all at once pressed her two hands together and exclaimed rapturously oh i do so love the birds  i replied that that was not strange since it is impossible for us not to love whatever is lovely and of all living things birds were made most beautiful  then i walked away but could not forget the words she had exclaimed her whole appearance the face flushed with color the eloquent brown eyes sparkling the pressed palms the sudden spontaneous passion of delight and desire in her tone the picture was in my mind all that day and lived through the next and so wrought on me that i could not longer keep away from the birds which i too loved for now all at once it seemed to me that life was not life without them that i was grown sick and all my senses dim that only the wished sight of wild birds could medicine my vision that only by drenching it in their wild melody could my tired brain recover its lost vigour     ii   after wandering somewhat aimlessly about the country for a couple of days i stumbled by chance on just such a spot as i had been wishing to finda rustic village not too far away it was not more than twentyfive minutes walk from a small station less than one hour by rail from london  the way to the village was through cornfields bordered by hedges and rows of majestic elms beyond it but quite near there was a wood principally of beech over a mile in length with a public path running through it on the right hand ten minutes walk from the village there was a long green hill the ascent to which was gentle but on the further side it sloped abruptly down to the thames  on the left hand there was another hill with cottages and orchards with small fields interspersed on the slope and summit so that the middle part where i lodged was in a pretty deep hollow there was no sound of traffic there and few farmers carts came that way as it was well away from the roads and the deep narrow winding lanes were exceedingly rough like the stony beds of driedup streams  in the deepest part of the coombe in the middle of the village there was a well where the cottagers drew their water and in the summer evenings the youths and maidens came there with or without jugs and buckets to indulge in conversation which was mostly of the rustic bantering kind mixed with a good deal of loud laughter close by was the inn where the men sat on benches in the taproom in grave discourse over their pipes and beer  wishing to make their acquaintance i went in and sat down among them and found them a little shynot to say standoffish at first rustics are often suspicious of the stranger within their gates but after paying for beer all round the frost melted and we were soon deep in talk about the wild life of the place always a safe and pleasant subject in a village one roughlooking brownfaced man with irongrey hair became a sort of spokesman for the company and replied to most of my questions  and what about badgers i asked in such a roughlooking spot with woods and all it strikes me as just the sort of place where one would find that animal  a long dead silence followed i caught the eye of the man nearest me and repeated the question are there no badgers here his eyes fell then he exchanged glances with some of the others all very serious and at length my man addressing the person who had acted as spokesman before said perhaps youll tell the gentleman if there are any badgers here  at that the rough man looked at me very sharply and answered stiffly not as i know of  a few weeks later at a small town in the neighbourhood i got into conversation with a hotel keeper an intelligent man who gave me a good deal of information about the country he asked me where i was staying and on my telling him said ah i know it wellthat village in a hole and a very nasty hole to get in tooat any rate it was so formerly they are getting a bit civilized now but i remember the time when a stranger couldnt show himself in the place without being jeered at and insulted yes they were a rough lot down in that holethe badgers they were called and thats what they are called still  the pity of it was that i didnt know this before i went among them but it was not remembered against me that i had wounded their susceptibilities they soon found that i was nothing but a harmless field naturalist and i had friendly relations with many of them  at the extremity of the straggling village was the beginning of an extensive common where it was always possible to spend an hour or two without seeing a human creature a few sheep grazed and browsed there roaming about in twos and threes and halfdozens tearing their fleeces for the benefit of nestbuilding birds in the great tangled masses of mingled furze and bramble and briar birds were abundant thereall those kinds that love the commons openness and the rough thorny vegetation that flourishes on it but the villageor rather the large open space occupied by it formed the headquarters and centre of a paradise of birds as i soon began to think it for the cottages and houses were widely separated the meanest having a garden and some trees and in most cases there was an old orchard of apple cherry and walnut trees to each habitation and out of this mass of greenery which hid the houses and made the place look more like a wood than a village towered the great elms in rows and in groups  on first approaching the place i heard mingled with many other voices that of the nightingale and as it was for the medicine of its pure fresh melody that i particularly craved i was glad to find a lodging in one of the cottages and to remain there for several weeks  the small care which the nightingale took to live up to his reputation in this place surprised me a little here he could always be heard in the daytimenot one bird but a dozenin different parts of the village but he sang not at night this i set down to the fact that the nights were dark and the weather unsettled but later when the weather grew warmer and there were brilliant moonlight nights he was still a silent bird except by day  i was also a little surprised at his tameness  on first coming to the village when i ran after every nightingale i heard to get as near him as possible i was occasionally led by the sound to a cottage and in some instances i found the singer perched within three or four yards of an open window or door at my own cottage when the woman who waited on me shook the breakfast cloth at the front door the bird that came to pick up the crumbs was the nightingalenot the robin when by chance he met a sparrow there he attacked and chased it away it was a feast of nightingales an elderly woman of the village explained to me that the nightingales and other small birds were common and tame in the village because no person disturbed them i smile now when recording the good old dames words  on my second day at the village it happened to be raininga warm mizzling rain without windind the nightingales were as vocal as in fine bright weather i heard one in a narrow lane and went towards it treading softly in order not to scare it away until i got within eight or ten yards of it as it sat on a dead projecting twig this was a twig of a low thorn tree growing up from the hedge projecting through the foliage and the bird perched near its end sat only about five feet above the bare ground of the lane now i owe my best thanks to this individual nightingale for sharply calling to my mind a common pestilent delusion which i have always hated but had never yet raised my voice againstnamely that all wild creatures exist in constant fear of an attack from the numberless subtle or powerful enemies that are always waiting and watching for an opportunity to spring upon and destroy them  the truth is that although their enemies be legion and that every day and even several times on each day they may be threatened with destruction they are absolutely free from apprehension except when in the immediate presence of danger suspicious they may be at times and the suspicion may cause them to remove themselves to a greater distance from the object that excites it but the emotion is so slight the action so almost automatic that the singing bird will fly to another bush a dozen yards away and at once resume his interrupted song again a bird will see the deadliest enemy of its kind and unless it be so close as to actually threaten his life he will regard it with the greatest indifference or will only be moved to anger at its presence  here was this nightingale singing in the rain seeing but not heeding me while beneath the hedge almost directly under the twig it sat on a black cat was watching it with luminous yellow eyes i did not see the cat at first but have no doubt that the nightingale had seen and knew that it was there high up on the tops of the thorn a couple of sparrows were silently perched perhaps like myself they had come there to listen after i had been standing motionless drinking in that dulcet music for at least five minutes one of the two sparrows dropped from the perch straight down and alighting on the bare wet ground directly under the nightingale began busily pecking at something eatable it had discovered no sooner had he begun pecking than out leaped the concealed cat on to him the sparrow fluttered wildly up from beneath or between the claws and escaped as if by a miracle the cat raised itself up glared round and catching sight of me close by sprang back into the hedge and was gone but all this time the exposed nightingale perched only five feet above the spot where the attack had been made and the sparrow had so nearly lost his life had continued singing and he sang on for some minutes after i suppose that he had seen the cat before and knew instinctively that he was beyond its reach that it was a terrestrial not an aerial enemy and so feared it not at all and he would perhaps have continued singing if the sparrow had been caught and instantly killed  quite early in june i began to feel just a little cross with the nightingales for they almost ceased singing and considering that the spring had been a backward one it seemed to me that their silence was coming too soon i was not sufficiently regardful of the fact that their lays are solitary as the poet has said that they ask for no witness of their song nor thirst for human praise they were all nesting now but if i heard them less i saw much more of them especially of one individual the male bird of a couple that had made their nest in a hedge a stones throw from the cottage a favourite morning perch of this bird was on a small wooden gate four or five yards away from my window it was an open sunny spot where his restless bright eyes could sweep the lane up and down and he could there also give vent to his superfluous energy by lording it over a few sparrows and other small birds that visited the spot i greatly admired the fine alert figure of the pugnacious little creature as he perched there so close to me and so fearless his striking resemblance to the robin in form size and in his motions made his extreme familiarity seem only natural the robin is greatly distinguished in a soberplumaged company by the vivid tint on his breast he is like the autumn leaf that catches a ray of sunlight on its surface and shines conspicuously among russet leaves but the clear brown of the nightingale is beautiful too  this same nightingale was keeping a little surprise in store for me although he took no notice of me sitting at the open window whenever i went thirty or forty yards from the gate along the narrow lane that faced it my presence troubled him and his mate only too much they would flit round my head emitting the two strongly contrasted sounds with which they express solicitudethe clear thin plaintive or wailing note and the low jarring soundan alternate lamenting and girding one day when i approached the nest they displayed more anxiety than usual fluttering close to me wailing and croaking more vehemently than ever when all at once the male at the height of his excitement burst into singing half a dozen notes were uttered rapidly with great strength then a small complaining cry again and at intervals a fresh burst of melody i have remarked the same thing in other singing birds species in which the harsh grating or piercing sounds that properly express violent emotions of a painful kind have been nearly or quite lost in the nightingale this part of the birds language has lost its original character and has dwindled to something very small solicitude fear anger are expressed with sounds that are mere lispings compared with those emitted by the bird when singing it is worthy of remark that some of the most highly developed melodistsand i am now thinking of the mockingbirdsnever inmoments of extreme agitation fall into this confusion and use singing notes that express agreeable emotions to express such as are painful but in the mockingbird the primitive harsh and grating cries have not been lost nor softened to sounds hardly to be distinguished from those that are emitted by way of song     iii   by this time all the birds were breeding some already breeding a second time and now i began to suspect that they were not quite so undisturbed as the old dame had led me to believe that they had not found a paradise in the village after all one morning as i moved softly along the hedge in my nightingales lane all at once i heard in the old grassy orchard to which it formed a boundary swishing sounds of scuttling feet and halfsuppressed exclamations of alarm then a crushing through the hedge and out almost at my feet rushed and leaped and tumbled halfadozen urchins who had suddenly been frightened from a birdnesting raid clothes torn hands and faces scratched with thorns hatless their towcoloured hair all disordered or standing up like a white crest above their brown faces rounded eyes staringwhat an extraordinarily wild appearance they had i was back in very old times in the britain of a thousand years before the coming of the romans and these were her young barbarians learning their lifes business in little things  no the birds of the village were not undisturbed while breeding but happily the young savages never found my nightingales nest one day the bird came to the gate as usual and was more alert and pugnacious than ever and no wonder for his mate came too and with them four young birds for a week they were about the cottage every day when they dispersed and one beautiful bright morning the male bird in his old place near my window attempted to sing beginning with that rich melodious throbbing which is usually called jugging and following with halfadozen beautiful notes that was all it was july and i heard no more music from him or from any other of his kind      i have perhaps written at too great length of this bird the nightingale was after all only one of the fiftynine species i succeeded in identifying during my sojourn at the village there were more i heard the calls and cries of others in the wood and various places but refused except in the case of the too elusive crake to set down any in my list that i did not see it was not my ambition to make a long list my greatest desire was to see well those that interested me most but those who go forth as i did to look for birds that are a sight for sore eyes must meet with many a disappointment in all those fruit and shade trees that covered the village with a cloud of verdure and in the neighbouring woods not once did i catch a glimpse of the green woodpecker a beautiful conspicuous bird supposed to be increasing in many places in england its absence from so promising a locality seemed strange  another species also said to be increasing in the countrythe turtledove was extremely abundant in the tall beech woods its low montonous crooning note was heard all day long from all sides in shady places where the loud shrill birdvoices are few one prefers this sound to the set song of the woodpigeon being more continuous and soothing and of the nature of a lullaby it sometimes reminded me of the low monotone i have heard from a patagonian mother when singing her swart papoose to sleep still i would gladly have spared many of these woodland crooners for the sake of one magpiethat bird of fine feathers and a bright mind which i had not looked on for a whole year and now hoped to see again but he was not there and after i had looked for myself some of the natives assured me that no magpie had been seen for years in that wood  for a time i feared that i was to be just as unlucky with regard to the jay seeing that the owner of the extensive beech woods adjoining the village permitted his keeper to kill the most interesting birds in itkestrels and sparrowhawks owls jays and magpies he was a new man comparatively in the place and wanted to increase his preserves but to do this it was necessary first to exclude the villagersthe badgers who were no doubt partial to pheasants eggs now to close an ancient rightofway is a ticklish business and this was an important one seeing that the village women did their saturday marketing in the town beyond the wood and river and with the path closed they would have two miles further to walk the new lord wisely took this into consideration and set himself to win the goodwill of the people before attempting any strong measures he walked in the lanes and was affable to the cottage women and nice to the children and by and bye he exclaimed what no institute no hall or any place where you can meet and spend the long winter evenings well ill soon see to that and soon to their delight they had a nice building reared on a piece of land which he bought for the purpose furnished with tables chairs bagatelle boards and all accessories and he also supplied them with newspapers and magazines he was immensely popular but appeared to think little of what he had done when they expressed their gratitude to him he would move his hand and answer oh im going to do a great deal more than that for you  a few months went by then he caused a notice to be put up about the neighbourhood that the path through the wood was going to be closed by order no one took any notice and a few weeks later his workmen appeared on the scene and erected a huge oakwood barrier across the path also a notice on a board that the wood was strictly private and trespassers would be prosecuted the villagers met in force at the institute and the inn that evening and after discussing the matter over their ale they armed themselves with axes and went in a body and demolished the barrier  the owner was disgusted but took no action this he said is their gratitude and from that day he ceased to subscribe to the local charities or take his walks in the village he had given the institute and so could not pull it down nor prevent them from using it  it was refreshing to hear that the badgers had shown a proper spirit in the matter and i was grateful to them for having kept the rightofway as on most days i spent several hours in the beautiful woods  to return to the jay in spite of the keepers persecution i knew that he was there every morning when i got up to look out of the window between four and five oclock i heard from some quarter of the village that curious subdued but farreaching scolding note he is accustomed to utter when his suspicions have been aroused  that was the jays customto come from the woods before even the earliest risers were up and forage in the village by and bye i discovered that by lying motionless for an hour or so on the dry moss in the wood he would at length grow so bold as to allow himself to be seen but high up among the topmost branches then by means of my binocular i had the wild thing on my thumb so to speak exhibiting himself to me inquisitive perplexed suspicious enraged by turns as he flirted wings and tail lifted and lowered his crest glancing down with bright wild eyes what a beautiful hypocrisy and delightful power this is which enables us sitting or lying motionless feigning sleep perhaps thus to fool this wild elusive creature and bring all its cunning to naught he is so much smaller and keenersighted able to fly to perch far up above me to shift his position every minute or two masking his small figure with this or that tuft of leaves while still keeping his eyes on mein spite of it all to have him so close and without moving or taking any trouble to see him so much better than he can see me but this is a legitimate trickery of science so innocent that we can laugh at our dupe when we practise it nor do we afterwards despise our superior cunning and feel ashamed as when we slaughter wild birds with farreaching shot which they cannot escape      all these corvine birds which the gamekeeper pursues so relentlessly albeit they were before him killing when they killed to better purpose and let us hope will exist after himall these must greatly surpass other kinds in sagacity to have escaped extermination in the present condition of things the jay is perhaps the best off on account of his smaller size and less conspicuous colouring but whether more cunning than the crow or magpie or not in perpetual alertness and restless energy or intensity of life he is without an equal among british birds and this quality forms his chief attraction it is more to the mind than his lifted crest and bright eyes his fine vinaceous brown and the patch of skyblue on his wings one would miss him greatly from the woods some of the melody may well be spared for the sake of the sudden brainpiercing rasping rending scream with which he startles us in our solitary forest walks  it is this extreme liveliness of the jay which makes it more distressing to the mind to see it pent in a cage than other birds of its family such as the magpie just as it is more distressing to see a skylark than a finch in prison because the lark has an irresistible impulse to rise when his singing fit is on sing he must in or out of prison yet there can be little joy in the performance when the bird is incessantly teased with the unsatisfied desire to mount and pour out his music at heavens gate  out of the cages jays make charming and beautiful pets and some who have kept them have assured me that they are not mischievous birds the late mark melford one time when i visited him had two jays handsome birds in bright glossy plumage always free to roam where they liked indoors or out we were sitting talking in his garden when one of the jays came flying to us and perched on a wooden ledge a few feet from and above our heads and after sitting quietly for a little while he suddenly made a dash at my head just brushing it with his wings then returned to his perch  at intervals of a few moments he repeated this action and when i remarked that he probably resented the presence of a stranger melford exclaimed oh no he wants to play with youthats all  his manner of playing was rather startling so long as i kept my eyes on him he remained motionless but the instant my attention wandered or when in speaking i looked at my companion the sudden violent dash at my head would be made  i was assured by melford that his birds never carried off and concealed bright objects a habit which it has been said the jay as well as the magpie possesses  what would he do with this shilling if i tossed it to him i asked  catch it he returned it would simply be play to him but he wouldnt carry it off  i tossed up the shilling and the bird had perhaps expected me to do so as he deftly caught it just as a dog catches a biscuit when you toss one to him after keeping it a few moments in his beak he put it down at his side i took out four more shilling pieces and tossed them quickly one by one and he caught them without a miss and placed them one by one with the other not scattered about but in a neat pile then seeing that i had no more shillings he flew off  after these few playful passages with one of his birds i could understand melfords feeling about his free pet jays magpies and jackdaws they were not merely birds to him but rather like so many delightful little children in the beautiful shape of birds      there was no rookery in or near the village but a large flock of rooks were always to be seen feeding and sunning themselves in some level meadows near the river it struck me one day as a very fine sight when an old bird who looked larger and blacker and greyerfaced than the others and might have been the father and leader of them all got up on a low post and with wideopen beak poured forth a long series of most impressive caws one always wonders at the meaning of such displays is the old bird addressing the others in the rook language on some matter of great moment or is he only expressing some feeling in the only language he hasthose long hoarse uninflected sounds and if so what feeling probably a very common one the rooks appeared happy and prosperous feeding in the meadow grass in that june weather with the hot sun shining on their glossy coats their days of want were long past and forgotten the anxious breeding period was over the tempest in the tall trees the annual slaughter of the young birdsall past and forgotten the old rook was simply expressing the old truth that life was worth living  these rooks were usually accompanied by two or three or more crowsa bird of so illrepute that the most outandout enthusiast for protection must find it hard to say a word in its favour at any rate the rooks must think if they think at all that this frequent visitor and attendant of theirs is more kin than kind i have related in a former work that i once saw a peregrine strike down and kill an owla sight that made me gasp with astonishment but i am inclined to think of this act as only a slip a slight aberration on the part of the falcon so universal is the sense of relationship among the kinds that have the rapacious habit or at the worst it was merely an isolated act of deviltry and daring of the sharpwinged pirate of the sky a sudden assertion of overmastering energy and power and a very slight offence compared with that of the crow when he carries off and devours his callow little cousins of the rookery      one of the first birds i went out to seekperhaps the most medicinal of all birds to seewas the kingfisher but he was not anywhere on the river margin although suitable places were plentiful enough and myriads of small fishes were visible in the shallow water seen at rest like dimpointed stripes beneath the surface and darting away and scattering outwards like a flight of arrows at any persons approach walking along the river bank one day when the place was still new to me i discovered a stream and following it up arrived at a spot where a clump of trees overhung the water casting on it a deep shade on the other side of the stream buttercups grew so thickly that the glazed petals of the flowers were touching the meadow was one broad expanse of brilliant yellow i had not been standing half a minute in the shade before the bird i had been seeking darted out from the margin almost beneath my feet and then instead of flying up or down stream sped like an arrow across the field of buttercups it was a very bright day and the bird going from me with the sunshine full on it appeared entirely of a shining splendid green  never had i seen the kingfisher in such favourable circumstances flying so low above the flowery level that the swiftly vibrating wings must have touched the yellow petals he was like a waif from some far tropical land the bird was tropical but i doubt if there exists within the tropics anything to compare with a field of buttercupssuch large and unbroken surfaces of the most brilliant colour in nature the first birds mate appeared a minute later flying in the same direction and producing the same splendid effect and also green these two alone were seen and only on this occasion although i often revisited the spot hoping to find them again  now the kingfisher is blue and i am puzzled to know why on this one occasion it appeared green i have in a former work argentine ornithology described a contrary effect in a small and beautiful tyrantbird cyanotis azarae variously called in the vernacular allcolored or manycolored kinglet it has a little blue on its head but its entire back from the nape to the tail is deep green it lives in beds of bulrushes and when seen flying from the spectator in a very strong light at a distance of twenty or thirty yards its colour in appearance is bright cerulean blue it is a sunlight effect but how produced is a mystery to me in the case of the two green kingfishers i am inclined to think that the yellow of that shining field of buttercups in some way produced the illusion  why are these exquisite birds so rare even in situations so favourable to them as the one i have described are they killed by severe frosts an ornithological friend from oxfordshire assures me that it will take several favourable seasons to make good the losses of the late terrible winter of 189192 but this as every ornithologist knows is only a part of the truth the large number of stuffed kingfishers under glass shades that one sees in houses of all descriptions in town and country but most frequently in the parlours of country cottages and inns tell a melancholy story some time ago a young man showed me three stuffed kingfishers in a case and informed me that he had shot them at a place which he named quite close to london he said that these three birds were the last of their kind ever seen there that he had gone week after week and watched and waited until one by one at long intervals he had secured them all and that two years had passed since the last one was killed and no other kingfisher had been seen at the place he added that the waterside which these birds had frequented was resorted to by crowds of london working people on saturday afternoons sundays and other holidays the fact that hundreds perhaps thousands of pairs of tired eyes would have been freshened and gladdened by the sight of their rare gemlike beauty only made him prouder of his achievement this young man was a cockney of the small shopkeeping classa philistine of the philistineshence there was no call to feel surprise at his selfglorification over such a matter but what shall we say of that writer whose masterly works on english rural life are familiar to everyone who is regarded as first among lovers of nature when he relates that he invariably carried a gun when out of doors mainly with the object of shooting any kingfisher he might chance to see as the dead bird always formed an acceptable present to the cottagers wife who would get it stuffed and keep it as an ornament on her parlour mantelshelf  happily for the kingfisher and for human beings who love nature the old idea that beautiful birds were meant to be destroyed for fun by anyone and everyone from the smallbrained detestable cockney sportsman i have mentioned to the gentlemen who write books about the beauties of nature is now gradually giving place to this new onethat it would be better to preserve the beautiful things we possess half a century before the author of wild life in a southern country amused himself by carrying a gun to shoot kingfishers the inhabitants of that same county of wiltshire were bathed in tearsso i read in an old salisbury newspaperat the tragic death of a young gentleman of great distinction great social charm great promise he was out shooting swallows with a friend who firing at a passing swallow had the misfortune to shoot and kill him  at the present time when gentlemen practise a little at flying birds to get their hand in before the first of september they shoot sparrows as a rule or if they shoot swallows which afford them better practice they do not say anything about it     iv   where the stream broadened and mixed with the river there existed a dense and extensive rushbedan island of rushes separated by a deep channel some twelve or fourteen yards in width from the bank this was a favourite nestingplace of the sedgewarblers occasionally as many as a dozen birds could be heard singing at the same time although in no sense together and the effect was indeed curious this is not a song that spurts and gushes up fountainlike in the manner of the robins and of some other kinds sprinkling the listener so to speak with a sparkling vocal spray but it keeps low down a song that flows along the surface gurgling and prattling like musical running water in its shallow pebbly channel listening again the similitude that seemed appropriate at first was cast aside for another and then another still the hidden singers scattered all about their rushy island were small fantastic human minstrels performing on a variety of instruments some unknown others recognizablebones and castanets tiny hurdygurdies piccolos banjos tabours and pandean pipesa strange medley  interesting as this concert was it held me less than the solitary singing of a sedgewarbler that lived by himself or with only his mate higher up where the stream was narrow so that i could get near him for he not only tickled my ears with his rapid reedy music but amused my mind as well with a pretty little problem in bird psychology i could sit within a few yards of his tangled haunt without hearing a note but if i jumped up and made a noise or struck the branches with my stick he would incontinently burst into song it is a very wellknown habit of the bird and on account of it and of the very peculiar character of the sounds emitted his song is frequently described by ornithologists as mocking defiant scolding angry etc it seems clear that at different times the bird sings from different exciting causes when undisturbed by a strange presence he bursts spontaneously into singing the music as in other species is simply an expression of overflowing gladness at other times the bird expressed such feelings as alarm suspicion solicitude perhaps anger by singing the same song how does this come about  i have stated when speaking of the nightingale that birds in which the singing faculty is highly developed sometimes make the mistake of bursting into song when anxious or distressed or in pain but that this is not the case with the mockingbirds some species of these brilliant songsters of the new world in their passion for variety to put it that way import every harsh and grating cry and sound they know into their song but on the other hand when anxious for the safety of their young or otherwise distressed they emit only the harsh and grating soundsnever a musical note in the sedgewarbler the harsh scolding sounds that express alarm solicitude and other painful emotions have also been made a part of the musical performance but this differs from the songs of most species the mocking birds included in the extraordinary rapidity with which it is enunciated once the song begins it goes on swiftly to the finish harsh and melodious notes seeming to overlap and mingle the sound forming to speak in metaphor a close intricate pattern of stronglycontrasted colours now the song invariably begins with the harsh notesthe sounds which at other times express alarm and other more or less painful emotionsand it strikes me as a probable explanation that when the bird in the singing season has been startled into uttering these harsh and grating sounds as when a stone is flung into the rushes he is incapable of uttering them only but the singing notes they suggest and which he is in the habit of uttering follow automatically  the spot where i observed this wee feathered fantasy the tantalizing sprite of the rushes and where i soon ceased to see hear or think about him calls for a fuller description on one side the wooded hill sloped downward to the stream on the other side spread the meadows where the rooks came every day to feed or to sit and stand about motionless looking like birds cut out of jet scattered over about half an acre of the grassy level ground stout old pollard willows grew here and there along the banks and were pleasant to see this being the one manmutilated thing in nature which to my mind not infrequently gains in beauty by the mutilation so admirably does it fit into and harmonize with the landscape at one point there was a deep nearly stagnant pool separated from the stream by a strip of wet rushy ground its still dark surface covered with waterlilies not yet in bloom they were just beginning to show their polished buds shaped like snakes heads above the broad oily leaves floating like islands on the surface the stream itself was on my side fringed with bulrushes and other aquatic plants on the opposite bank there were some large alders lifting their branches above great masses of bramble and rosebriar all together forming as rich and beautiful a tangle as one could find even in the most luxuriant of the wild unkept hedges round the village the briars especially flourished wonderfully at this spot climbing high and dropping their long slim branches quite down to the surface of the water and in some places forming an arch above the stream a short distance from this tangle so abundantly sprinkled with its pale delicate roses the water was spanned by a small wooden bridge which no person appeared to use but which had a use it formed the one dry clear spot in the midst of all that moist vegetation and the birds that came from the wood to drink and search for worms and small caterpillars first alighted on the bridge there they would rest a few moments take a look round then fly to some favourite spot where succulent morsels had been picked up on previous visits thrushes blackbirds sparrows reedbuntings chaffinches tits wrens with many other species succeeded each other all day long for now they mostly had young to provide for and it was their busiest time  the unsullied beauty and solitariness of this spot made me wish at first that i was a boy once more to climb and to swim to revel in the sunshine and flowers to be nearer in spirit to the birds and dragon flies and waterrats then that i could build a cabin and live there all the summer long forgetful of the world and its affairs with no human creature to keep me company and no book to read or with only one slim volume some spanish poet let me say melendez for preferenceonly a small selection from his too voluminous writings for he albeit an eighteenthcentury singer was perhaps the last of that long illustrious line of poets who sang as no others have sung of the pure delightfulness of a life with nature something of this charm is undoubtedly due to the beauty of the language they wrote in and to the free airy grace of assonants what a hard artificial sound the rhyme too often has the clink that falls at regular intervals as of a stonebreakers hammer in the freer kinds of spanish poetry there are numberless verses that make the smoothest lines and lyrics of our sweetest and most facile singers from herrick to swinburne seem hard and mechanical by comparison but there is something more i doubt for one thing if we are justified in the boast we sometimes make that the feeling for nature is stronger in our poets than in those of other countries the most scientific critic may be unable to pick a hole in tennysons botany and zoology but the passion for and feeling of oneness with nature may exist without this modern minute accuracy be this as it may it was not tennyson nor any other of our poets that i would have taken to my dreamedof solitary cabin for companionship melendez came first to my mind i think of his lines to a butterfly    de donde alegre vienes   tan suelta y tan festiva   las valles alegrando   veloz mariposilla   may be roughly rendered thus    whence blithe one comest thou   with that airy happy flight   to make the valleys glad   o swiftwinged butterfly  and can imagine himthe poet himselfcoming to see me through the woods and down the hill with the careless ease and lightness of heart of his own purplewinged child of earth and airtan suelta y tan festiva here in these four or five words one may read the whole secret of his charmthe exquisite delicacy and seeming artlessness in the form and the spirit that is in himthe old simple healthy natural gladness in nature and feeling of kinship with all the children of life but i do not wish to disturb anyone in his prepossessions it would greatly trouble me to think that my reader should for the space of a page or even of a single line find himself in opposition to and not with me and i am free to admit that with regard to poetry ones preferences change according to the mood one happens to be in and to the conditions generally at home in murky london on most days i should probably seek pleasure and forgetfulness in browning but in such surroundings as i have been describing the lighterhearted elflike melendez accords best with my spirit one whose finest songs are without human interest who is irresponsible as the wind and as unstained with earthly care as the limpid running water he delights in who is brother to bird and bee and butterfly and worships only liberty and sunshine and is in love with nothing but a flower  nearly midway between the useful little bridge and the roseblossoming tangle i have spoken of there were three elmtrees growing in the open grassy space near the brook they were not lofty but had very widespreading horizontal branches which made them look like oaks this was an ideal spot in which to spend the sultry hours and i had no sooner cast myself on the short grass in the shade than i noticed that the end of a projecting branch above my head and about twenty feet from the ground was a favourite perch of a treepipit he sang in the air and circling gracefully down would alight on the branch where sitting near me and plainly visible he would finish his song and renew it at intervals then leaving the loved perch he would drop singing to the ground just a few yards beyond the trees shadow thence singing again he would mount up and up above the tree only to slide down once more with set unfluttering wings with a beautiful swaying motion to the same old restingplace on the branch there to sing and sing and sing  if melendez himself had come to me with flushed face and laughing eyes and sat down on the grass at my side to recite one of his most enchanting poems i should with finger on lip have enjoined silence for in the mood i was then in at that sequestered spot with the landscape outside my shady green pavilion bathed and quivering in the brilliant sunshine this small bird had suddenly become to me more than any other singer feathered or human and yet the treepipit is not very highly regarded among british melodists on account of the little variety there is in its song nevertheless it is most sweetperhaps the sweetest of all it is true that there are thousands nay millions of thingssights and sounds and perfumeswhich are or may be described as sweet so common is the metaphor and this too common use has perhaps somewhat degraded it but in this case there is no other word so well suited to describe the sensation produced  the treepipit has a comparatively short song repeated with some variation in the number and length of the notes at brief intervals the opening notes are thick and throaty and similar in character to the throatnotes of many other species in this group a softer sound than the throatnotes of the skylark and woodlark which they somewhat resemble the canarylike trills and thin piping notes long drawn out which follow vary greatly in different individuals and in many cases the trills are omitted but the concluding notes of the song i am consideringwhich is only one note repeated again and againare clear and beautifully inflected and have that quality of sweetness of lusciousness i have mentioned the note is uttered with a downward fall more slowly and expressively at each repetition as if the singer felt overcome at the sweetness of life and of his own expression and languished somewhat at the close its effect is like that of the perfume of the honeysuckle infecting the mind with a soft delicious languor a wish to lie perfectly still and drink of the same sweetness again and again in larger measure  to some who are familiar with this by no means uncommon little bird it may seem that i am overstating the charm of its melody i can only say that the mood i was then in made me very keenly appreciative also that i have never heard any other individual of this species able to produce precisely the same effect we know that there are quite remarkable differences in the songs of birds of the same species that among several that appear to be perfect and to sing alike one will possess a charm above the other the truth is they are not alike they affect us differently but the sense is not fine enough or not sufficiently trained to detect the cause the poets words may be used of this natural melody as well as of the works of art    o the little more and how much it is  there were about the village within a few minutes walk of the cottage not fewer than halfadozen treepipits each inhabiting a favourite spot where i could always count on finding and hearing him at almost any hour of the day from sunrise to sunset yet i cared not for these to the one chosen bird i returned daily to spend the hot hours lying in the shade and listening to his strain finally i allowed two or three days to slip by and when i revisited the old spot the secret charm had vanished the bird was there and rose and fell as formerly pouring out his melody but it was not the same something was missing from those last sweet languishing notes perhaps in the interval there had been some disturbing accident in his little wild life though i could hardly believe it since his mate was still sitting about thirty yards from the tree on the five little mottled eggs in her nest or perhaps his midsummers music had reached its highest point and was now in its declension and perhaps the fault was in me the virtue that draws and holds us does not hold us always nor very long it departs from all things and we wonder why the loss is in ourselves although we do not know it nature the chosen mistress of our heart does not change towards us yet she is now even today    less full of purple colour and hid spice  and smiles and sparkles in vain to allure us and when she touches us with her warm caressing touch there is compared with yesterday only a faint response     v   coming back from the waterside through the wood after the hottest hours of the day were over the crooning of the turtledoves would be heard again on every sidethat summer beechwood lullaby that seemed never to end the other bird voices were of the willowwren the woodwren the coaltit and the now somewhat tiresome chiffchaff from the distance would come the prolonged rich strain of the blackbird and occasionally the lyric of the chaffinch the song of this bird gains greatly when heard from a tall tree in the woodland silence it has then a resonance and wildness which it appears to lack in the garden and orchard in the village i had been glad to find that the chaffinch was not too common that in the tangle of minstrelsy one could enjoy there his vigorous voice was not predominant  of all these woodland songsters the woodwren impressed me the most he could always be heard no matter where i entered the wood since all this world of tall beeches was a favoured haunt of the woodwren each pair keeping to its own territory of halfanacre of trees or so and somewhere among those trees the male was always singing far up invisible to eyes beneath in the topmost sunlit foliage of the tall trees on entering the wood i would stand still for a few minutes to listen to the various sounds until that one fascinating sound would come to my ears from some distance away and to that spot i would go to find a bed of last years leaves to sit upon and listen it was an enchanting experience to be there in that woodland twilight with the green cloud of leaves so far above me to listen to the silence to the faint whisper of the windtouched leaves then to little prelusive drops of musical sound growing louder and falling faster until they ran into one prolonged trill and there i would sit listening for halfanhour or a whole hour but the end would not come the bird is indefatigable and with his mysterious talk in the leaves would tire the sun himself and send him down the sky for not until the sun has set and the wood has grown dark does the singing cease  on emerging from the deep shade of the beeches into the wide grassy road that separated the wood from the orchards and plantations of fruit trees and pausing for a minute to look down on the more than halfhidden village invariably the first loud sounds that reached my ear were those of the cuckoo thrush and blackbird at all hours in the village from early morning to evening twilight these three voices sounded far and near above the others i considered myself fortunate that no large tree near the cottage had been made choice of by a songthrush as a singingstand during the early hours the nearest tree so favoured was on the further side of a field so that when i woke at halfpast three or four oclock the shrill indefatigable voice came in at the open window softened by distance and washed by the dewy atmosphere to greater purity throstle and skylark to be admired must be heard at a distance but at that early hour when i sat by the open window the cuckoos call was the commonest sound the birds were everywhere bird answering bird far and near so persistently repeating their double note that this sound which is in character unlike any other sound in nature which one so listens and longs to hear in spring lost its old mystery and charm and became of no more account than the cackle of the poultryyard it was the cuckoos village sometimes three or four birds in hot pursuit of each other would dash through the trees that lined the further side of the lane and alight on that small tree at the gate which the nightingale was accustomed to visit later in the day  other birds that kept themselves very much out of sight during most of the time also came to the same small tree at that early hour it was regularly visited and its thin bole industriously examined by the nuthatch and the quaint little mouselike creeper doubtless they imagined that five oclock was too early for heavy human creatures to be awake and were either ignorant of my presence or thought proper to ignore it  but where during the days when the vociferous cuckoo with hoarse chuckle and dissyllabic call and wild bubbling cry was so much with uswhere in this period of many pleasant noises was the cuckoos mate or maid or messenger the quaint and beautiful wryneck there are few british birds perhaps not onenot even the crafty black and white magpie or mysterious mothlike goatsucker or tropical kingfishermore interesting to watch at twilight i had lingered at the woodside also in other likely places and the goatsucker had failed to appear gliding and zigzagging hither and thither on his duskymottled noiseless wings and now this still heavier disappointment was mine i could not find the wryneck those quiet grassy orchards shut in by straggling hedges should have had him as a favoured summer guest creeper and nuthatch and starling and gemlike blue tit found holes enough in the old trunks to breed in and yet i knew that albeit not common he was there i could not exactly say where but somewhere on the other side of the next hedge or field or orchard for i heard his unmistakable cry now on this hand now on that day after day i followed the voice sometimes in my eagerness forcing my way through a brambly hedge to emerge with scratched hands and clothes torn like one that had been set upon and mauled by some savage animal of the cat kind and still the quaint figure eluded my vision  at last i began to have doubts about the creature that emitted that strange penetrating call first heard as a birdcall and nothing more by degrees it grew more and more laughlikea long farreaching ringing laugh not the laugh i should like to hear from any person i take an interest in but a laugh with all the gladness unction and humanity gone out of ita dry mechanical sound as if a soulless lifeless windinstrument had laughed it was very curious listening to it day by day something of the strange history of the being once but no longer human that uttered it grew up and took shape in my mind for we all have in us something of this mysterious faculty it was no bird no wryneck but a being that once long long long ago in that same beautiful place had been a village boya free careless gladhearted boy like many another but to this boy life was more than to others since nature appeared immeasurably more vivid on account of his brighter senses therefore his love of life and happiness in life greatly surpassed theirs annually the trees shed their leaves the flowers perished the birds flew away to some distant country beyond the horizon and the sun grew pale and cold in the sky but the bright impression all things made on him gave him a joy that was perennial the briony woodbine and honeysuckle he had looked on withered in the hedges but their presentments flourished untouched by frost as if his warmth sustained and gave them perpetual life in that inner magical world of memory the birds still twittered and warbled each after its kind and the sun shone everlastingly but he was living in a fools paradise as he discovered byandby when a boy who had been his playmate began to grow thin and pale and at last fell sick and died he crept near and watched his dead companion lying motionless unbreathing with a face that was like white clay and then more horrible still he saw him taken out and put into a grave and the heavy cold soil cast over him  what did this strange and terrible thing mean now for the first time he was told that life is ours only for a season that we also like the leaves and flowers flourish for a while then fade and perish and mingle with the dust the sad knowledge had come too suddenly and in too vivid and dreadful a manner  he could not endure it only for a seasononly for a season the earth would be green and the sky blue and the sun shine bright for ever and he would not see not know it struck with anguish at the thought he stole away out of sight of the others to hide himself in woods and thickets to brood alone on such a hateful destiny and torture himself with vain longings until he too grew pale and thin and largeeyed like the boy that had died and those who saw him shook their heads and whispered to one another that he was not long for this world he knew what they were saying and it only served to increase his misery and fear and made him hate them because they were insensible to the awful fact that death awaited them or so little concerned that they had never taken the trouble to inform him of it to eat and drink and sleep was all they cared for and they regarded death with indifference because their dull sight did not recognize the beauty and glory of the earth nor their dull hearts respond to natures everlasting gladness the sight of the villagers with their solemn headshakings and whisperings even of his nearest kindred grew insupportable and he at length disappeared from among them and was seen no more with his white terrorstricken face from that time he hid himself in the close thickets supporting his miserable existence on wild fruits and leaves and spending many hours each day lying in some sheltered spot gazing up into that blue sunny sky which was his to gaze on only for a season while the large tears gathered in his eyes and rolled unheeded down his wasted cheeks  at length during this period there occurred an event which is the obscurest part of his history for i know not who or what it wasmy mind being in a mist about itthat came to or accidentally found him lying on a bed of grass and dried leaves in his thorny hidingplace it may have been a gipsy or a witchthere were witches in those dayswho suddenly looking on his upturned face and seeing the hunger in his unfathomable eyes loved him in spite of her malignant nature or a spirit out of the earth or only a very wise man an ancient whitehaired solitary whose life had been spent in finding out the secrets of nature this being becoming acquainted with the cause of the boys grief and of his solitary miserable condition began to comfort him by telling him that no grief was incurable no desire that heart could conceive unattainable he discoursed of the hidden potent properties of nature unknown only to those who seek not to know them of the splendid virtue inherent in all things like the green and violet flames in the clear colourless raindrops which are seen only on rare occasions of life and death he said that life was of the spirit which never dies that death meant only a passage a change of abode of the spirit and the left body crumbled to dust when the spirit went out of it to continue its existence elsewhere but that those who hated the thought of such change could by taking thought prolong life and live for a thousand years like the adder and tortoise or for ever but no he would not leave the poor boy to grope alone and blindly after that hidden knowledge he was burning to possess he pitied him too much the means were simple and near to hand the earth teemed with the virtue that would save him from the dissolution which so appalled him he would be startled to hear in how small a thing and in how insignificant a creature resided the principle that could make his body like his spirit immortal but exceeding great power often existed in small compass witness the adders tooth which was to our sight no more than the point of the smallest thorn now in the small ant there exists a principle of a greater potency than any other in nature so strong and penetrating was it that even the dull and brutish kind of men who enquire not into hidden things know something of its power but the greatest of all the many qualities of this acid was unknown to them the ants were a small people but exceedingly wise and powerful if a little human child had the strength of an ant he would surpass in power the mightiest giant that ever lived in the same way ants surpassed men in wisdom and this strength and wisdom was the result of that acid principle in them now if any person should be able to overcome his repugnance to so strange a food as to sustain himself on ants and nothing else the effect of the acid on him would be to change and harden his flesh and make it impervious to decay or change of any kind he would so long as he confined himself to this kind of food be immortal  not a moment did the wretched boy hesitate to make use of this new and wonderful knowledge when he had found and broken open an anthill so eager was he that shutting his eyes he snatched up the maddened insects by handfuls and swallowed them dust and ants together and was then tortured for hours feeling and thinking that they were still alive within him running about in search of an outlet and frantically biting the strange food sickened him so that he grew thinner and paler until at last he could barely crawl on hands and feet and was like a skeleton except for the great sad eyes that could still see the green earth and blue sky and still reflected in their depths one fear and one desire and slowly day by day as his system accustomed itself to the new diet his strength returned and he was able once more to walk erect and run and to climb a tree where he could sit concealed among the thick foliage and survey the village where he had first seen the light and had passed the careless happy years of boyhood but he cherished no tender memories and regrets his sole thought was of the ants and where to find a sufficiency of them to stay the cravings of hunger for after the first sensations of disgust had been overcome he had begun to grow fond of this kind of food and now consumed it with avidity and as his strength increased so did his dexterity in catching the small active insect prey he no longer gathered the ants up in his palm and swallowed them along with dust and grit but picked them up deftly and conveyed them one by one to his mouth with lightning rapidity meanwhile that acid principle about which he had heard such wonderful things was having its effect on his system his skin changed its colour he grew shrunken and small until at length after very many years he dwindled to the grey little manikin of the present time his mind too changed he has no thought nor remembrance of his former life and condition and of his longdead relations but he still haunts the village where he knows so well where to find the small ants to pick them from off the anthill and from the trunks of trees with his quick little clawlike hands language and song are likewise forgotten with all human things all except his laugh for when hunger is satisfied and the sun shines pleasantly as he reposes on the dry leaves on the ground or sits aloft on a branch at times a sudden feeling of gladness possesses him and he expresses it in that one waythe long wild ringing peal of laughter listening to that strange sound although i could not see i could yet picture him as aware of my cautious approach he moved shyly behind the mossy trunk of some tree and waited silently for me to pass a lean grey little man clad in a quaintly barred and mottled mantle woven by his own hands from some soft silky material and a closefitting brown peaked cap on his head with one barred feather in it for ornament and a small wizened grey face with a thin sharp nose puckered lips and a pair of round brilliant startled eyes  so distinct was this image to my minds eye that it became unnecessary for me to see the creature and i ceased to look for him then all at once came disillusion when one day hearing the familiar highpitched laugh with its penetrating and somewhat nasal tone i looked and beheld the thing that had laughed just leaving its perch on a branch near the ground and winging its way across the field it was only a bird after allonly the wryneck and that mysterious faculty i spoke of saying that we all of us possessed something of it meaning only some of us was nothing after all but the old common faculty of imagination  later on i saw it again on halfadozen occasions but never succeeded in getting what i call a satisfying sight of it perched woodpeckerwise on a mossy trunk busy at its old fascinating occupation of deftly picking off the running ants  it is melancholy to think that this quaint and beautiful bird of a unique type has been growing less and less common in our country during the last half a century or for a longer period in the last fifteen or twenty years the fallingoff has been very marked the declension is not attributable to persecution in this case since the bird is not on the gamekeepers black list nor has it yet become so rare as to cause the amateur collectors of dead birds throughout the country systematically to set about its extermination doubtless that will come later on when it will be in the same category with the golden oriole hoopoe furzewren and other species that are regarded as always worth killing that is to say it will comethe scramble for the wrynecks carcassif nothing is done in the meantime to restrain the enthusiasm of those who value a bird only when the spirit of life that gave it flight and grace and beauty has been crushed out of itwhen it is no longer a bird the cause of its decline up till now cannot be known to us we can only say in our ignorance that this type like innumerable others that have ceased to exist has probably run its course and is dying out or it might be imagined that its system is undergoing some slow change which tells on the migratory instinct that it is becoming more a resident species in its winter home in africa but all conjectures are idle in such a case it is melancholy at all events for the ornithologist to think of an england without a wryneck but before that still distant day arrives let us hope that the love of birds will have become a common feeling in the mass of the population and that the variety of our bird life will have been increased by the addition of some chance colonists and of many new species introduced from distant regions  i have lingered long over the wryneck but have still a story to relate of this birdnot a fairy tale this time but true  on the border of the village adjoining the woodthe side where birds were more abundant and which consequently had the greatest attraction for methere stands an old picturesque cottage nearly concealed from sight by the hedge in front and closely planted trees clustering round it on one side was a grass field on the other an orchard of old cherry apple and plum trees all the property of the old man living in the cottage who was a character in his way at all events he had not been fashioned in quite the same mould as the majority of the cottagers about him they mostly when past middle life wore a heavy dull and somewhat depressed look this man had a twinkle in his darkgrey eyes an expression of intelligent curiosity and fellowship and his full face bronzed with sixty or sixtyfive years exposure to the weather was genial as if the sunshine that had so long beaten on it had not been all used up in painting his skin that rich oldfurniture colour but had some of it filtered through the epidermis into the heart to make his existence pleasant and sweet but it was a very roughcast face with shapeless nose and thick lips he was short and broadshouldered always in the warm weather in his shirtsleeves a shirt of some very coarse material and of an earthen colour his brown thick arms bare to the elbows waistcoat and trousers looked as if he had worn them for half his life and had a marbled or mottled appearance as if they had taken the various tints of all the objects and materials he had handled or rubbed against in his lifes workwood mossy trees grass clay bricks stone rusty iron and dozens more he wore the fieldlabourers thick boots his ancient rusty felt hat had long lost its original shape and finally to complete the portrait a short black clay pipe was never out of his lipsnever at all events when i saw him which was often for every day as i strolled past his domain he would be on the outside of his hedge or just coming out of his gate invariably with something in his handa spade a fork or stick of wood or an old empty fruitbasket although thus having the appearance of being very much occupied he would always stop for a few minutes talk with me and byandby i began to suspect that he was a very social sort of person and that it pleased him to have a little chat but that he liked to have me think that he met me by accident while going about his work  one sunny morning as i came past his field he came out bearing a huge bundle of green grass on his head whatl he exclaimed coming to a stand you here today i thought youd be away to the regatta  i said that i knew little about regattas and cared less that a day spent in watching and listening to the birds gave me more pleasure than all the regattas in the country i suppose you cant understand that i added  he took the big green bundle from his head and set it down pulled off his old hat to flap the dust out of it then sucked at his short clay well he said at length some fancies one thing and some another but we most of us like a regatta  during the talk that followed i asked him if he knew the wryneck and if it ever nested in his orchard he did not know the bird had never heard its name nor the other names of snakebird and cuckoos mate and when i had minutely described its appearance he said that no such bird was known in the village  i assured him that he was mistaken that i had heard the cry of the bird many times and had even heard it once at a distance since our conversation began hearing that distant cry had caused me to ask the question  all at once he remembered that he knew or had known formerly the wryneck very well but he had never learnt its name about twenty or fiveandtwenty years ago he said he saw the bird i had just described in his orchard and as it appeared day after day and had a strange appearance as it moved up the tree trunks he began to be interested in it one day he saw it fly into a hole close to the ground in an old apple tree now ive got you he exclaimed and running to the spot thrust his hand in as far as he could but was unable to reach the bird then he conceived the idea of starving it out and stopped up the hole with clay the following day at the same hour he again put in his hand and this time succeeded in taking the bird so strange was it to him that after showing it to his own family he took it round to exhibit it to his neighbours and although some of them were old men not one among them had ever seen its like before they concluded that it was a kind of nuthatch but unlike the common nuthatch which they knew after they had all seen and handled it and had finished the discussions about it he released it and saw it fly away but to his astonishment it was back in his orchard a few hours later in a few weeks it brought out its five or six young from the hole he had caught it in and for several years it returned each season to breed in the same hole until the tree was blown down after which the bird was seen no more  what an experience the poor bird had suffered first plastered up and left to starve or suffocate in its hollow tree then captured and passed round from rough horny hand to hand while the villagers were discussing it in their slow ponderous fashionhow wildly its little wild heart must have palpitatedand finally after being released to go back at once to its eggs in that dangerous tree i do not know which surprised me most the birds action in returning to its nest after such inhospitable treatment or the ignorance of the villagers concerning it the incident seemed to show that the wryneck had been scarce at this place for a very long period  the villager as a rule is not a good observer which is not strange since no person is or ever can be a good observer of the things in which he is not specially interested consequently the countryman only knows the most common and the most conspicuous species he plods through life with downcast eyes and a vision somewhat dimmed by indifference forgetting as he progresses the small scraps of knowledge he acquired by looking sharply during the period of boyhood when every living creature excited his attention in italy notwithstanding the paucity of bird life i believe that the peasants know their birds better the reason of this is not far to seek every bird not excepting even the templehaunting martlet and nightingale and minute goldencrested wren is regarded only as a possible morsel to give a savour to a dish of polenta if the shy little flitting thing can only be enticed within touching distance of the limed twigs thus they take a very strong interest in and in a sense love birds it is their passion for this kind of flavouring which has drained rural italy of its songsters and will in time have the same effect on argentina the country in which the withering stream of italian emigration empties itself     vi   from the date of my arrival at the village in may until i left it early in july the great annual business of pairing nestbuilding and rearing the young was going on uninterruptedly the young of some of the earliest breeders were already strong on the wing when i took my first walks along the hedgerows still in their early vivid green frequently observing my bird through a white and rosetinted cloud of appleblossoms and when i left some species that breed more than once in the season were rearing second broods or engaged in making new nests on my very first day i discovered a nest full of fully fledged blue tits in a hole in an apple tree this struck me as a dangerous place for the young birds as the tree leaned over towards the lane and the hole could almost be reached by a person standing on the ground on the next day i went to look at them and approaching noiselessly along the lane spied two small boys with bright clean facesit was on a sundaystanding within three or four yards of the tree watching the tits with intense interest the parent birds were darting up and down careless of their presence finding food so quickly in the gooseberry bushes growing near the roots of the tree that they visited the hole every few moments while the young birds ever screaming for more were gathered in a dense little cluster at the entrance their yellow breasts showing very brightly against the rainwet wood and the dark interior of the hole the instant the two little watchers caught sight of me the excited look vanished from their faces and they began to move off gazing straight ahead in a somewhat vacant manner this instantaneous and instinctive display of hypocrisy was highly entertaining and would have made me laugh if it had not been for the serious purpose i had in my mind now look here i said i know what you are after so its no use pretending that you are walking about and seeing nothing in particular youve been watching the young tits well ive been watching them too and waiting to see them fly i dare say they will be out by tomorrow or the next day and i hope you little fellows wont try to drag them out before then  they at once protested that they had no such intention they said that they never robbed birds nests that there were several nests at home in the garden and orchard one of a nightingale with three eggs in it but that they never took an egg but some of the boys they knew they said took all the eggs they found and there was one boy who got into every orchard and garden in the place who was so sharp that few nests escaped him and every nest he found he destroyed breaking the eggs if there were any and if there were young birds killing them  not perhaps without first mutilating them i thought for i know something of this kind of young human devil to use the phrase which canon wilberforce has made so famous in another connexion later on i heard much more about the exploits of this champion birddestroyer of the village from strange to say a birdcatcher by trade a man of a rather low type of countenance and who lived when at home in a london slum on the common where he spread his nets he had found he told me about thirty nests containing eggs or fledglings but this boy had gone over the ground after him and not many of the nests had escaped his sharp eyes  i was satisfied that the young tits were quite safe so far as these youngsters were concerned and only regretted that they were such small boys and that the great nestdestroyer whose evil deeds they spoke of with an angry colour in their cheeks was a very strong boy otherwise i should have advised them to go for him  oddly enough i heard of another boy who exercised the same kind of cruelty and destructiveness over another common a few miles distant walking across it i spied two boys among the furze bushes and at the same moment they saw me whereupon one ran away and the other remained standing a nice little fellow of about eight he looked as if he had been crying i asked him what it was all about and he then told me that the bigger boy who had just run away was always on the common searching for nests just to destroy them and kill the young birds that he my informant had come there where he came every day just to have a peep at a linnets nest with four eggs in it on which the bird was sitting that the other boy concealed among the bushes had watched him go to the nest and had then rushed up and pulled the nest out of the bush  why didnt you knock him down i asked  thats what i tried to do before he pulled the nest out he said and then he added sorrowfully he knocked me down  i am reminded here of a tale of ancient greece about a boy of this descriptionthe boy to be found in pretty well every parish in the land this was a shepherd boy who followed or led his sheep to a distance from the village and amused his idle hours by snaring small birds to put their eyes out with a sharp thorn then to toss them up just to see how and how far they would fly in the dark he was seen doing it and the matter reported to the heads or fathers of the village and he was brought before them and after due consideration of the case condemned to death such a decision must seem shocking to us and worthy of a semibarbarous people but if cruelty is the worst of all offencesand this was cruelty in its most horrid formthe offence which puts men down on a level with the worst of the mythical demons it was surely a righteous deed to blot such an existence out lest other young minds should be contaminated or even that it should be known that such a crime was possible      all those birds that had finished rearing their young by the sixteenth of june were fortunate for on the morning of that day a great and continuous shouting with gunfiring banging on old brass and iron utensils with various other loud unusual noises were heard at one extremity of the village and continued with occasional quiet intervals until evening this tempest of rude sounds spread from day to day until the entire area of the village and the surrounding orchards was involved and the poor birds that were tied to the spots where their treasures were must have existed in a state of constant trepidation for now the cherries were fast ripening and the fruiteating birds especially the thrushes and blackbirds were inflamed at the gleam of crimson colour among the leaves in the very large orchards men and boys were stationed all day long yelling and firing off guns to frighten the marauders in the smaller orchards the trees were decorated with whirligigs of coloured paper ancient hats among which were some of the quaintlyshaped chimneypots of a past generation old coats and waistcoats and trousers and rags of all colours to flutter in the wind and these objects were usually considered a sufficient protection some of the birds wiser than their fellows were not to be kept back by such simple means but so long as they came not in battalions but singly they could have their fill and no notice was taken of them  i was surprised to hear that on the large plantations the men employed were not allowed to use shot the aim of the fruit grower being only to scare the birds away i had a talk with my old friend of the wryneck on the subject and told him that i had seen one of the birdscarers going home to his cottage very early in the morning carrying a bunch of about a dozen blackbirds and thrushes he had just shot  yes he replied some of the men would buy shot and use it early in the morning before their master was about but if the man i had seen had been detected in the act he would have been discharged on the spot it was not only because the trees would be injured by shot but this fruitgrower was friendly to birds  most fruitgrowers i said were dead against the birds and anxious only to kill as many of them as possible  it might be so in some places he answered but not in the village he himself and most of the villagers depended in a great measure on the fruit they produced for a living and their belief was that taking one bird with another all the year round the birds did them more good than harm  i then imparted to him the views on this bird subject of a wellknown fruitgrower in the north of england mr joseph witherspoon of chesterlestreet he began by persecuting the birds as he had been taught to do by his father a marketgardener but after years of careful observation he completely changed his views and is now so convinced of the advantage that birds are to the fruitgrower that he does all in his power to attract them and to tempt them to breed in his grounds his main idea is that birds that are fed on the premises that live and feed among the trees search for and attack the gardeners enemies at every stage of their existence at the same time he believes that it is very bad to grow fruit near woods as in such a case the birds that live in the woods and are of no advantage to the garden swarm into it as the fruit ripens and that it is only by liberal use of nets that any reasonable portion of the fruit can be saved  he answered that with regard to the last point he did not quite agree with mr witherspoon all the gardens and orchards in the village were raided by the birds from the wood yet he reckoned they got as much fruit from their trees as others who had no woods near them then there was the big cherry plantation one of the biggest in england so that people came from all parts in the blossoming time just to look at it and a wonderful sight it was for a quarter of a mile this particular orchard ran parallel with the wood with nothing but the green road between and when the first fruit was ripening you could see all the big trees on the edge of the wood swarming with birdsjays thrushes blackbirds doves and all sorts of tits and little birds just waiting for a chance to pounce down and devour the cherries the noise kept them off but many would dodge in and even if a gun was fired close to them the blackbirds would snatch a cherry and carry it off to the wood that didnt mattera few cherries here and there didnt count the starlings were the worst robbers if you didnt scare them they would strip a tree and even an orchard in a few hours but they were the easiest birds to deal with they went in flocks and a shout or rattle or report of a gun sent the lot of them away together  his way of looking at it was this in the fruit season which lasts only a few weeks you are bound to suffer from the attacks of birds whether they are your own birds only or your own combined with others from outside unless you keep them off that those who do not keep them off are foolish or indolent and deserve to suffer the fruit season was he said always an anxious time  in conclusion i remarked that the means used for protecting the fruit whether they served their purpose well or not struck me as being very unworthy of the times we lived in and seemed to show that the british fruitgrowers who were ahead of the world in all other matters connected with their vocation had quite neglected this one point a thousand years ago cultivators of the soil were scaring the birds from their crops just as we are doing with methods no better and no worse putting up scarecrows and old ragged garments and fluttering rags hanging a dead crow to a stick to warn the others off shouting and yelling and throwing stones there appeared to be an opening here for experiment and invention mere noise was not terrifying to birds and they soon discovered that an old hat on a stick had no injurious brains in or under it but certain sounds and colours and odours had a strong effect on some animals sounds made to stimulate the screams of some hawks would perhaps prove very terrifying to thrushes and other small birds and the effect of scarlet in large masses or long strips might be tried it would also be worth while to try the effect of artificial sparrowhawks and other birds of prey perched conspicuously moving and perking their tails at intervals by clockwork in fact a hundred things might be tried until something valuable was found and when it lost its value for the birds would in time discover the deception some new plan adopted  to this dissertation on what might be done he answered that if any one could find out or invent any new effective means to keep the birds from the fruit the fruitgrowers would be very thankful for it but that no such invention could be looked for from those who are engaged on the soil that it must come from those who do not dig and sweat but sit still and work with their brains at new ideas  this ended our conversation and i left him more than satisfied at the information he had given me and with a higher opinion than ever of his geniality and good practical sense  it was a relief when the noisy birdscaring business was done with and the last market baskets of ripe cherries were carried away to the station very splendid they looked in such large masses of crimson as the baskets were brought out and set down in the grassy road but i could not help thinking a little sadly that the thrushes and blackbirds which had been surreptitiously shot when fallen and fluttering in the wet grass in the early morning had shed lifedrops of that same beautiful colour     vii   after the middle of june the common began to attract me more and more it was so extensive that standing on its border just beyond the last straggling cottages and orchards the further side was seen only as a line of blue trees indistinct in the distance as i grew to know it better adding each day to my list from its varied bird life the woods and waterside were visited less and less frequently and after the birdscaring noises began in the village its wildness and quiet became increasingly grateful the silence of nature was broken only by bird sounds and the most frequent sound was that of the yellow bunting as perched motionless on the summit of a gorse bush his yellow head conspicuous at a considerable distance he emitted his thin monotonous chant at regular intervals like a painted toybird that sings by machinery there too sedentary as an owl in the daytime the corn bunting was common discharging his brief song at intervalsa sound as of shattering glass the whinchat was rarely seen but i constantly met the small prettily coloured stonechat flitting from bush to bush following me and never ceasing his low querulous tacking chirp anxious for the safety of his nest nightingales blackcaps and whitethroats also nested there and were louder and more emphatic in their protests when approached there were several grasshopperwarblers on the common all very curiously as it seemed to me clustered at one spot so that one could ramble over miles of ground without hearing their singular note but on approaching the place they inhabited one gradually became conscious of a mysterious trilling buzz or whirr low at first and growing louder and more stridulous until the hidden singers were left behind when by degrees it sank lower and lower again and ceased to be audible at a distance of about one hundred yards from the points where it had sounded loudest the birds hid in clumps of furze and bramble so near together that the area covered by the buzzing sound measured about two hundred yards across this most singular sound for a warbler to make is certainly not ventriloquial although if one comes to it with the sense of hearing disorganized by town noises or unpractised one is at a loss to determine the exact spot it comes from or even to know from which side it comes while emitting its prolonged sound the bird is so absorbed in its own performance that it is not easily alarmed and will sometimes continue singing with a human listener standing within four or five yards of it when one is near the bird and listens standing motionless the effect on the nerves of hearing is very remarkable considering the smallness of the sound which without being unpleasant is somewhat similar to that produced by the vibration of the brake of a train it is not powerful enough to jar the nerves but appears to pervade the entire system lying still with eyes closed and three or four of these birds singing near so that their strains overlap and leave no silent intervals the listener can imagine that the sound originates within himself that the numberless fine cords of his nervous network tremble responsively to it  there are a number of natural sounds that resemble more or less closely the most unbirdlike note of this warblercicada rattlesnake and some batrachians  some grasshoppers perhaps come nearest to it but the most sustained current of sound emitted by the insect is short compared to the warblers strain also the vibrations are very much more rapid and not heard as vibrations and the same effect is not produced  the grasshopper warblers gave me so much pleasure that i was often at the spot where they had their little colony of about halfadozen pairs and where i discovered they bred every year at first i used to go to any bush where i had caught sight of a bird and sit down within a few yards of it and wait until the little hidelings shyness wore off and he would come out and start reeling afterwards i always went straight to the same bush because i thought the bird that used it as his singingplace appeared less shy than the others one day i spent a long time listening to this favourite delightedly watching him perched on a low twig on a level with my sight and not more than five yards from me his body perfectly motionless but the head and wideopen beak jerked from side to side in a measured mechanical way i had a side view of the bird but every three seconds the head would be jerked towards me showing the bright yellow colour of the open mouth the reeling would last about three minutes then the bird would unbend or unstiffen and take a few hops about the bush then stiffen and begin again while thus gazing and listening i by chance met with an experience of that rare kind which invariably strikes the observer of birds as strange and almost incrediblean example of the most perfect mimicry in a species which has its own distinctive song and is not a mimic except once in a while and as it were by chance the marsh warbler is our perfect mockingbird our one professional mimic while the starling in comparison is but an amateur we all know the starlings ever varying performance in which he attempts a hundred things and occasionally succeeds but even the starling sometimes affects us with a mild astonishment and i will here give one instance  i was staying at a village in the wiltshire downs and at intervals while sitting at work in my room on the ground floor i heard the cackling of a fowl at the cottage opposite i heard but paid no attention to that familiar sound but after three days it all at once struck me that no fowl could lay an egg about every ten or twelve minutes and go on at this rate day after day and getting up i went out to look for the cackler a few hens were moving quietly about the open ground surrounding the cottage where the sound came from but i heard nothing by and by when i was back in my room the cackling sounded again but when i got out the sound had ceased and the fowls as before appeared quite unexcited the only way to solve the mystery was to stand there out of doors for ten minutes and before that time was over a starling with a white grub in his beak flew down and perched on the low garden wall of the cottage then with some difficulty squeezed himself through a small opening into a cavity under a strip of zinc which covered the bricks of the wall it was a queer place for a starlings nest on a wall three feet high and within two yards of the cottage door which stood open all day having delivered the grub the starling came out again and hopping on to the zinc opened his beak and cackled like a hen then flew away for more grubs  i observed the starling a good deal after this and found that invariably on leaving the nest he uttered his imitation of a fowl cackling and no other note or sound of any kind it was as if he was not merely imitating a sound but had seen a fowl leaving the nest and then cackling and mimicked the whole proceeding and had kept up the habit after the young were hatched  to return to my experience on the common about fifty yards from the spot where i was there was a dense thicket of furze and thorn with a huge mound in the middle composed of a tangle of whitethorn and bramble bushes mixed with ivy and clematis from this spot at intervals of half a minute or so there issued the call of a duckthe prolonged hoarse call of a drake two or three times repeated evidently emitted in distress i conjectured that it came from one of a small flock of ducks belonging to a cottage near the edge of the common on that side the flock as i had seen was accustomed to go some distance from home and i supposed that one of them a drake had got into that brambly thicket and could not make his way out for half an hour i heard the calls without paying much attention absorbed in watching the quaint little songster close to me and his curious gestures when emitting his sustained reeling sounds in the end the persistent distressed calling of the drake lost in a brambly labyrinth got a little on my nerves and i felt it as a relief when it finally ceased then after a short silence another sound came from the same spota blackbird sound known to everyone but curiously interesting when uttered in the way i now heard it it was the familiar loud chuckle not emitted in alarm and soon ended but the chuckle uttered occasionally by the bird when he is not disturbed or when after uttering it once for some real cause he continues repeating it for no reason at all producing the idea that he has just made the discovery that it is quite a musical sound and that he is repeating it as if singing just for pleasure at such times the long series of notes do not come forth with a rush he begins deliberately with a series of musical chirps uttered in a measured manner like those of a wood wren the prelude to its song the notes coming faster and faster and swelling and running into the loud chuckling performance this performance like the lost drakes call was repeated in the same deliberate or leisurely manner at intervals again and again until my curiosity was aroused and i went to the spot to get a look at the bird who had turned his alarm sound into a song and appeared to be very much taken with it  but there was no blackbird at the spot and no lost drake and no bird except a throstle sitting motionless on the bush mound this was the bird i had been listening to uttering not his own thrush melody which he perhaps did not know at all but the sounds he had borrowed from two species so wide apart in their character and language  the astonishing thing in this case was that the bird never uttered a note of his own original and exceedingly copious song and i could only suppose that he had never learned the thrush melody that he had perhaps been picked up as a fledgling and put in a cage where he had imitated the sounds he heard and liked best and made them his song and that he had finally escaped or had been liberated  the wild thrush we know does introduce certain imitations into his own song but the borrowed notes or even phrases are as a rule few and not always to be distinguished from his own  sometimes one can pick them out thus on the borders of a marsh where redshanks bred i have heard the call of that bird distinctly given by the thrush and again where the ringouzel is common the thrush will get its brief song exactly when thrushes taken from the nest are reared in towns where they never hear the thrush or any other bird sing they are often exceedingly vocal and utter a medley of sounds which are sometimes distressing to the ear i have heard many caged thrushes of this kind in london but the most remarkable instance i have met with was at the little seaside town of seaford here in the main shopping street a caged thrush lived for years in a butchers shop and poured out its song continuously the most distressing throstle performance i ever heard composed of a medley of loud shrill and harsh soundsimitations of screams and shouts boy whistlers saw filing knives sharpened on steels and numerous other unclassifiable noises but all more or less painful the whole street was filled with the noise and the owner used to boast that his caged thrush was the most persistent as well as the loudest singer that had ever been heard he had no nerves and was proud of it on a recent visit to seaford i failed to hear the bird when walking about the town and after two or three days went into the shop to enquire about it they told me it was deadthat it had been dead over a year also that many visitors to seaford had missed its song and had called at the shop to ask about the bird the strangest thing about its end they said was its suddenness the bird was singing its loudest one morning and had been at it for some time filling the whole place with its noise when suddenly in the middle of its song it dropped down dead from its perch  to drop dead while singing is not an unheard of nor a very rare occurrence in caged birds and it probably happens too in birds living their natural life listening to a nightingale pouring out its powerful music continuously as the lark sings one sometimes wonders that something does not give way to end the vocalists performance and life at the same instant some such incident was probably the origin of the old legend of the minstrel and the nightingale oa which strada based his famous poem known in many languages in england crawshaws version was by far the best and is perhaps the finest bird poem in our literature  the blackbird like the thrush sometimes borrows a note or a phrase and like the thrush again if reared by hand he may become a nuisance by mimicking some disagreeable sound and using it by way of song i heard of such a case a short time ago at sidmouth the ground floor of the house where i lodged was occupied by a gentleman who had a fondness for bird music and being an invalid confined to his rooms he kept a number of birds in cages he had besides canaries the thrush chaffinch linnet goldfinch and cirl bunting i remarked that he did not have the best singer of allthe blackbird he said that he had procured one or that some friend had sent him one a very beautiful ouel cock in the blackest plumage and with the orangetawniest bill and he had anticipated great pleasure from hearing its fluting melody but alas no blackbird song did this unnatural blackbird sing he had learnt to bark like a dog and whenever the singing spirit took him he would bark once or twice or three times and then after an interval of silence of the proper length about fifteen seconds he would bark again and so on until he had had his fill of music for the time the barking got on the invalids nerves and he sent the bird away it was either that he said or losing my senses altogether      as all or most singing birds learn their songs from the adults of the same species it is not strange that there should be a good deal of what we call mimicry in their performances we may say in fact that pretty well all the true singers are mimics but that some mimic more than others thus the starling is more ready to borrow other birds notes than the thrush while the marshwarbler borrows so much that his singing is mainly composed of borrowings the nightingale is perhaps an exception his voice excels in power and purity of sound and what we may call his artistry is exceptionally perfect this may account for the fact that he does not borrow from other birds songs i should say from my own observation that all songsters are interested in the singing of other species or at all events in certain notes especially the most striking in power beauty and strangeness thus when the cuckoo starts calling you will see other small birds fly straight to the tree and perch near him apparently to listen and among the listeners you will find the sparrow and tits of various speciesbirds which are never victimized by the cuckoo and do not take him for a hawk since they take no notice of him until the calling begins the reason that the double fluting call of the cuckoo is not mimicked by other birds is that they cant because that peculiar sound is not in their register the bubbling cry is reproduced by both the marsh warbler and the starling again it is my experience that when a nightingale starts singing the small birds near immediately become attentive often suspending their own songs and some flying to perch near him and listen just as they listen to the cuckoo birds imitate the note or phrase that strikes them most and is easiest to imitate as when the thrush copies the piping and trilling of the redshank and the easy song of the ringouzel which when incorporated into his own music harmonizes with it perfectly but he cannot flute and so never mimics the blackbirds song although he can and does as we have seen imitate its chuckling cry  there is another thing to be considered i believe that the bird like creatures in other classes has his receptive period his time to learn and that like some mammals he learns everything he needs to know in his first year or two and that having acquired his proper song he adds little or nothing to it thereafter although the song may increase in power and brilliance when the bird comes to full maturity this i think holds true of all birds like the nightingale which have a singing period of two or three months and are songless for the rest of the year that long silent period cannot so far as sounds go be a receptive one the song early in life has become crystallized in the form it will keep through life and is like an intuitive act this is not the case with birds like the starling that sing all the year roundbirds that are naturally loquacious and sing instead of screaming and chirping like others they are always borrowing new sounds and always forgetting  the most curious example of mimicry i have yet met with is that of a true mockingbird mimus patachonicus a common resident species in northern patagonia on the atlantic side very abundant in places he is a true mockingbird because he belongs to the genus mimus a branch of the thrush family and not because he mocks or mimics the songs of other species like others of his kindred he does not in fact mimic the set songs of others although he often introduces notes and phrases borrowed from other species into his own performance he sings in a sketchy way all the year round but in spring has a fuller unbroken song emitted with more power and passion for the rest of the time he sings to amuse himself as it seems in a peculiarly leisurely and one may say indolent manner perched on a bush from time to time emitting a note or two then a phrase which if it pleases him he will repeat two or three or half a dozen times then after a pause other notes and phrases and so on pretty well all day long this manner of singing is irritating like the staccato song of our throstle to a listener who wants a continuous stream of song but it becomes exceedingly interesting when one discovers that the bird is thinking very much about his own music if one can use such an expression about a bird that he is all the time experimenting trying to get a new phrase a new combination of the notes he knows and new notes also that when sitting on his bush and uttering these careless chance sounds he is at the same time intently listening to the others all engaged in the same way singing and listening you will see them all about the place each bird sitting motionless like a grey and white image of a bird on the summit of his own bush for although he is not gregarious as a rule a number of pairs live near each other and form a sort of loose community the bond that unites them is their music for not only do they sit within hearing distance but they are perpetually mimicking each other one may say that they are accomplished mimics but prefer mimicking their own to other species but they only imitate the notes that take their fancy so to speak thus occasionally one strikes out a phrase a new expression which appears to please him and after a few moments he repeats it again then again and so on and on and if you remain an hour within hearing he will perhaps be still repeating it at short intervals now if by chance there is something in the new phrase which pleases the listeners too you will note that they instantly suspend their own singing and for some little time they do nothing but listen by and by the new note or phrase will be exactly reproduced from a bird on another bush and he too will begin repeating it at short intervals then a second one will get it then a third and eventually all the birds in that thicket will have it the constant repeating of the new note may then go on for hours and it may last longer you may return to the spot on the second day and sit for an hour or longer listening and still hear that same note constantly repeated until you are sick and tired of it or it may even get on your nerves i remember that on one occasion i avoided a certain thicket one of my favourite daily haunts for three whole days not to hear that one everlasting sound then i returned and to my great relief the birds were all at their old game of composing and not one utteredperhaps he didnt darethe too hackneyed phrase i was sharply reminded one day by an incident in the village of this old patagonian experience and of the strange humanlike weakness or passion for something new and arresting in music or song something tuney or catchy  it chanced that when i left london a new popular song had come out and was all the rage a tune and words invented or first produced in the musichalls by a woman named lottie collins with a chorus to ittararaboomdeay repeated several times first caught up in the musichalls it spread to the streets and in everwidening circles over all london and over all the land in london people were getting tired of hearing it but when i arrived at my village in a hole and settled down among the badgers i heard it on every handin cottages in the streets in the fields men women and children were singing whistling and humming it and in the evening at the inn roaring it out with as much zest as if they had been singing rule britannia  this state of things lasted from may to the middle of june then one very hot still day about three oclock i was sitting at my cottage window when i caught the sound of a rumbling cart and a man singing as the noise grew louder my interest in the approaching man and cart was excited to an extraordinary degree never had i heard such a noise and no wonder since the man was driving a heavy springless farm cart in the most reckless manner urging his two huge horses to a fast trot then a gallop up and down hill along those rough gullylike roads he standing up in his cart and roaring out auld lang syne at the top of a voice of tremendous power he was probably tipsy but it was not a bad voice and the old familiar tune and words had an extraordinary effect in that still atmosphere he passed my cottage standing up his legs wide apart his cap on the back of his head a big broadchested young man lashing his horses and then for about two minutes or longer the thunder of the cart and the roaring song came back fainter until it faded away in the distance at that still hour of the day the children were all at school on the further side of the village the men away in the fields the women shut up in their cottages perhaps sleeping it seemed to me that i was the only person in the village who had witnessed and heard the passing of the bigvoiced man and cart but it was not so at all events next day the whole village men women and children were singing humming and whistling auld lang syne and auld lang syne lasted for several days and from that day tararaboomdeay was heard no more it had lost its charm     viii   just out of hearing of the grasshopper warblers there was a goodsized pool of water on the common probably an old gravelpit its bottom now overgrown with rushes a sedge warbler the only one on the common lived in the masses of bramble and gorse on its banks and birds of so many kinds came to it to drink and bathe that the pool became a favourite spot with me one evening just before sunset as i lingered near it a pied wagtail darted out of some low scrub at my feet and fluttered as if wounded over the turf for a space of ten or twelve yards before flying away not many minutes after seeing the wagtail a reedbuntinga bird which i had not previously observed on the commonflew down and alighted on a bush a few yards from me holding a white crescentshaped grub in its beak i stood still to watch it certainly not expecting to see its nest and young for as a rule a bird with food in its beak will sit quietly until the watcher loses patience and moves away but on this occasion i had not been standing more than ten seconds before the bunting flew down to a small tuft of furze and was there greeted by the shrill welcoming cries of its young i went up softly to the spot when out sprang the old bird i had seen but only to drop to the ground just as the wagtail had done to beat the turf with its wings then to lie gasping for breath then to flutter on a little further until at last it rose up and flew to a bush  after admiring the reedbuntings action i turned to the dwarf bush near my feet and saw perched on a twig in its centre a solitary young bird fully fledged but not yet capable of sustained flight he did not recognise an enemy in me on the contrary when i approached my hand to him he opened his yellow mouth wide in expectation of being fed although his throat was crammed with caterpillars and the white crescentshaped larva i had seen in the parents bill was still lying in his mouth unswallowed the wonder is that when a young bird had been stuffed with food to such an extent just before sleeping time he can still find it in him to open his mouth and call for more      how wonderful it is that this parental instinct so beautiful in its perfect simulation of the action of the bird that has lost the power of flight should be found in so large a number of species but when we find that it is not universal that in two closelyallied species one will possess it and the other not and that it is common in such widelyseparated orders as gallinaceous and passerine birds in pigeons ducks and waders it becomes plain that it is not assignable to community of descent but has originated independently all over the globe in a vast number of species something of the beginnings and progressive development of this instinct may be learnt i think by noticing the behaviour of various passerine birds in the presence of danger to their nests and young their actions and cries show that they are greatly agitated and in a majority of species the parent bird flits and flutters round the intruder uttering sounds of distress frequently the bird exhibits its agitation not only by these cries and restless motions but by the drooping of the wings and tailthe action observed in a bird when hurt or sick or oppressed with heat these languishing signs are common to a great many species after the young have been hatched the period when the parental solicitude is most intense in several species which i have observed in south america the languishing is more marked there are no sorrowful cries and restless movements the bird sits with hanging wings and tail gasping for breath with open bill in appearance a greatly suffering bird in some cases of this description the bird if it moves at all hops or flutters from a higher to a lower branch and as if sick or wounded seems about to sink to the ground in still others the bird actually does drop to the ground then feebly flapping its wings rises again with great effort from this last form it is but a step to the more highly developed complex instinct of the bird that sinks to the earth and flutters painfully away gasping and seemingly incapable of flight  it would be a great mistake to suppose that the bird when fluttering on the ground to lead an enemy from the neighbourhood of its nest is in full possession of all its faculties acting consciously and itself in as little danger of capture as when on its perch or flying through the air we have seen that the action has its root in the birds passion for its young and intense solicitude in the presence of any danger threatening them which is so universal in this class of creatures and which expresses itself so variously in different kinds this must be in all cases a painful and debilitating emotion and when the bird drops down to the earth its pain has caused it to fall as surely as if it had received a wound or had been suddenly attacked by some grievous malady and when it flutters on the ground it is for the moment incapable of flight and its efforts to recover flight and safety cause it to beat its wings and tremble and gasp with open mouth the object of the action is to deceive an enemy or to speak more correctly the result is to deceive and there is nothing that will more inflame and carry away any rapacious mammal than the sight of a fluttering bird but in thus drawing upon itself the attention of an enemy threatening the safety of its eggs or young to what a terrible danger does the parent expose itself and how often in those moments of agitation and debility must its own life fall a sacrifice the sudden spring and rush of a feline enemy must have proved fatal in myriads of instances from its inception to its most perfect stage in the various species that possess it this perilous instinct has been washed in blood and made bright  what i have just said that the peculiar instinct and deceptive action we have been considering is made and kept bright by being bathed in blood applies to all instinctive acts that tend to the preservation of life both of the individual and species necessarily so seeing that for one thing instincts can only arise and grow to perfection in order to meet cases which commonly occur in the life of a species the instinct is not prophetic and does not meet rare or extraordinary situations unless intelligence or some higher faculty comes in to supplement or to take the place of instinctive action then the creature must perish on account of the limitation of instinct again the higher and more complete the instinct the more perilous it is seeing that its efficiency depends on the absolutely perfect health and balance of all the faculties and the entire organism thus the higher instinctive faculty and action of birds for the preservation of the species that of migration is undoubtedly the most dangerous of all it is so perfect that by means of this faculty millions and myriads of birds of an immense variety of species from cranes swans and geese down to minute goldcrests and firecrests and the smallest feeblewingedleaf warblers are able to inhabit and to distribute themselves evenly over all the temperate and cold regions of the earth and even nearer the pole and in all these regions they rear their young and spend several months each year where they would inevitably perish from cold and lack of food if they stayed on to meet the winter we can best realize the perfection of this instinct when we consider that all these migrants including the young which have never hitherto strayed beyond the small area of their home where every tree and bush and spring and rock is familiar to them rush suddenly away as if blown by a wind to unknown lands and continents beyond the seas to a distance of from a thousand to six or seven thousand miles that after long months spent in those distant places which in turn have grown familiar to them they return again to their natal place not in a direct but ofttimes by a devious route now north now northeast now east or west keeping to the least perilous lines and crossing the seas where they are narrowest thus when the returning multitude recrosses the channel into england coming by way of france and spain from north or south or midafrica and from asia they at once proceed to disperse over the entire country from lands end to thurso and the northernmost islands of scotland until every wood and hill and moor and thicket and stream and every village and field and hedgerow and farmhouse has its own feathered people back in their old places but they do not return in their old force they had increased to twice or three times their original numbers when they left us and as a result of that great adventure a half or twothirds of the vast army has perished  the instinct which in character comes nearest to that of the parent simulating the action of a wounded and terrified bird struggling to escape in order to safeguard its young is that one very strong in all groundbreeding species of sitting close on the nest in the presence of danger here too the instinct is of prime importance to the species since the bird by quitting the nest reveals its existence to the prowling nestseeking enemydog cat fox stoat rat in england and in the country where i first observed animals the skunk armadillo opossum snake wild cat and animals of the weasel family by leaving its nest a minute or half a minute too soon the bird sacrifices the eggs or young by staying a moment too long it is in imminent danger of being destroyed itself  how often the bird stays too long on the nest is seen in the corncrake a species continually decreasing in this country owing to the destruction caused by the mowingmachine the parent birds that escape may breed again in a safer place but in many cases the bird clings too long to its nest and is decapitated or fatally injured by the cutters  larks too often perish in the same way to go back to the ailing or wounded bird simulating action this is perhaps most perfect in the gallinaceous birds all groundbreeders whose nests are most diligently hunted for by all eggeating creatures beast or bird and whose tender chicks are a favourite food for all rapacious animals in the fowl pheasants partridges quail and grouse the instinct is singularly powerful the bird making such violent efforts to escape with such an outcry such beating of its wings and struggles on the ground that no rapacious beast however often he may have been deceived before can fail to be carried away with the prospect of an immediate capture the instinct and action has appeared to me more highly developed in these birds because in the first place the demonstrations are more violent than in other families consequently more effective and secondly because the danger once over the birds recovery to its normal quiet watchful state is quicker by way of experiment i have at various times thrown myself on pheasants partridges and grouse when i have found them with a family of recentlyhatched chicks then on giving up the chase and turning away from the bird its instantaneous recovery has seemed like a miracle it was like a miracle because the creature did actually suffer from all those violent debilitating emotions expressed in its disordered cries and action and it is the miracle of natures marvellous health if we for example were thrown into these violent extremes of passion we should not escape the aftereffects our whole system would suffer a doctor would perhaps have to be called in and would discourse wisely on metabolism and the development of toxins in the muscles and give us a bottle of medicine  i will conclude this digression and dissertation on a birds instinct by relating the action of a henpheasant i once witnessed partly because it is the most striking one i have met with of that instantaneous recovery of a bird from an extremity of distress and terror and partly for another reason which will appear at the end  the henpheasant was a solitary bird having strayed away from the pheasant copses near the itchen and found a nestingplace a mile away on the other side of the valley among the tall grasses and sedges on its border i was the birds only human neighbour as i was staying in a fishingcottage near the spot where the bird had its nest eventually it brought off eight chicks and remained with them at the same spot on the edge of the valley living like a rail among the sedges and tall valley herbage i never went near the bird but from the cottage caught sight of it from time to time and sometimes watched it with my binocular there was i thought a good chance of its being able to rear its young unless the damp proved injurious as there was no dog or cat at the cottage and there were no carrion crows or sparrowhawks at that spot one morning about five oclock on going out i spied a foxterrier a poaching dog from the neighbouring village rushing about in an excited state a hundred yards or so below the cottage he had scented the birds and presently up rose the hen from the tall grass with a mighty noise then flopping down she began beating her wings and struggling over the grass uttering the most agonizing screams the dog after her frantically grabbing at her tail i feared that he would catch her and seizing a stick flew down to the rescue yelling at the dog but he was too excited to obey or even hear me at length thanks to the devious course taken by the bird i got near enough to get in a good blow on the dogs back he winced and went on as furiously as ever and then i got in another blow so well delivered that the rascal yelled and turning fled back to the village hot and panting from my exertions i stood still but sooner still the pheasant had pulled herself up and stood there about three yards from my feet as if nothing had happenedas if not a ripple had troubled the quiet surface of her life the serenity of the bird just out of that storm of violence and danger and her perfect indifference to my presence was astonishing to me for a minute or two i stood still watching her then turned to walk back to the cottage and no sooner did i start than after me she came at a gentle trot following me like a dog on my way back i came to the very spot where the foxterrier had found and attacked the bird and at once on reaching it she came to a stop and uttered a call and instantly from eight different places among the tall grasses the eight fluffy little chicks popped up and started running to her and there she stood gathering them about her with gentle chucklings taking no notice of me though i was standing still within two yards of her  up to the moment when the dog got his smart blow and fled from her she had been under the domination of a powerful instinct and could have acted in no other way but what guided her so infallibly in her subsequent actions certainly not instinct and not reason which hesitates between different courses and is slow to arrive at a decision one can only say that it was or was like intuition which is as much as to say that we dont know    ix   among the rarer fringilline birds on the common were the cirl bunting bullfinch and goldfinch the last two rarely seen linnets however were abundant now gathered in small flocks composed mainly of young birds in plain plumage with here and there an individual showing the carminetinted breast of the adult male unhappily a dreary fate was in store for many of these blithe twitterers  on june 24 when walking towards the pool i spied two recumbent human figures on a stretch of level turf near its banks and near them a something dark on the grassa pair of clapnets still another serpent in my birds paradise said i to myself and walking on i skirted the nets and sat down on the grass beside the men one was a rough brownfaced country lad the other who held the strings and wore the usual cap and comforter was a man of about fiveandtwenty with pale blue eyes and yellowish hair closecropped and the unmistakable london mark in his chalky complexion he regarded me with cold suspicious looks and when i talked and questioned answered briefly and somewhat surlily i treated him to tobacco and he smoked but it wasnt shag and didnt soften him on mentioning casually that i had seen a stoat an hour before he exhibited a sudden interest it was as if one had said rats to a terrier i succeeded after a while in getting him to tell me the name of the man to whom he sent his captives and when i told him that i knew the man wella birdseller in a low part of londonhe thawed visibly finally i asked him to look at a redbacked shrike perched on a bush about fifteen yards from his nets through my fieldglasses and from that moment he became as friendly as possible and conversed freely about his mystery how near it brings him he exclaimed with a grin of delight after looking at the bird  the shrike had greatly annoyed him it had been hanging about for some time he told me dashing at the linnets and driving them off when they flew down to the nets two or three times he might have caught it but would not draw the nets and have the trouble of resetting them for so worthless a bird but ill take him the next time he said vindictively i didnt know he was such a handsome bird unfortunately the shrike soon flew away and passing linnets dropped down drawn to the spot by the twitterings of their caged fellows and were caught and so it went on for a couple of hours we conversing amicably during the waiting intervals for now he regarded me as a friend of the birdcatcher linnets only were caught most of them young birds which pleased him for the young linnet after a month or two of cage life will sing but the adult males would be silent until the next spring consequently they were not worth so much although the carmine stain in their breast made them for the time so much more beautiful  i remarked incidentally that there were some who looked with unfriendly eyes on his occupation and that sooner or later these people would try to get an act of parliament to make birdcatching in lanes on commons and waste lands illegal they cant do it he exclaimed excitedly and if they can do it and if they do do it it will be the ruination of england for what would there be then to stop the birds increasing it stands to reason that the whole country would be eaten up  doubtless the man really believed that but for the laborious days that birdcatchers spend lying on the grass the human race would be very badly off  just after he had finished his protest three or four linnets flew down and were caught taking them from the nets he showed them to me remarking with a short laugh that they were all young males then he thrust them down the stockingleg which served as an entrance to the covered box he kept his birds inthe black hole in which their captive life begins where they were now all vainly fluttering to get out going back to the previous subject he said that he knew very well that many persons disliked a birdcatcher but there was one thing that nobody could say against himhe wasnt cruel he caught but didnt kill he only killed when he caught a great number of female linnets which were not worth sending up he pulled their heads off and took them home to make a linnet pie then by way of contrast to his own merciful temper he told me of the young nestdestroyer i have written about it made him mad to see such things something ought to be done he said to stop a boy like that for by destroying so many nestlings he was taking the bread out of the birdcatchers mouth passing to other subjects he said that so far he had caught nothing but linnets on the commonyou couldnt expect to catch other kinds in june later on in august and september there would be a variety but he had small hopes of catching goldfinches they were too scarce now greenfinches yellowhammers common buntings reed sparrowsall such birds were worth only tuppence apiece oh yes he caught them just the same and sent them up to london but that was all they were worth to him for young male linnets he got eightpence sometimes tenpence for hen birds fourpence or less i dare say that eightpence was what he hoped to get seeing that young male linnets are not unfrequently sold by london dealers for sixpence and even fourpence  goldfinches ran to eighteenpence sometimes as much as two shillings  starlings he had made a lot out of but that was all past and over why  because they were not wantedbecause people were such fools that they now preferred to shoot at pigeons he hated pigeons gentlemen used to shoot starlings at matches and if you had the making of a bird to shoot at you couldnt get a better than the starlingsuch a neat bird he had caught hundredsthousandsand had sold them well but now nothing but pigeons would they have pigeons always pigeons he caught starlings still but what was the good of that the dealers would only take a few and they were worth nothingno more than greenfinches and yellowhammers  my colloquy with my enemy on the common tempts me to a fresh digression in this placeto have my say on a question about which much has already been said during the last three or four decades especially during the sixties when the first practical efforts to save our wildbird life from destruction were made  there is a feeling in the great mass of people that the pursuit of any wild animal whether fit for food or not for pleasure or gain is a form of sport and that sport ought not to be interfered with so strong and wellnigh universal is this feeling which is like a superstition that the pursuit is not interfered with however unsportsmanlike it may be and when illegal and when practised by only a very few persons in any district where to others it may be secretly distasteful or even prejudicial  even birdcatching on a common is regarded as a form of sport and the birdcatcher as a sportsmanand a brother  a striking instance of this tameness and stupidly acquiescent spirit in people generally was witnessed during the intensely severe frosts of the early part of the late winter 18823 when incalculable numbers of seabirds were driven by hunger and cold into bays and inland waters at this time thousands of gulls made their appearance in the thames but no sooner did they arrive than those who possessed guns and licences to shoot began to shoot them the police interfered and some of these sportsmen were brought before the magistrates and fined for the offence of discharging guns to the public danger for upwards of a fortnight after the shooting had been put a stop to the gulls continued to frequent the river in large numbers and were perhaps most numerous from london bridge to battersea and during this time they were watched every day by thousands of londoners with keen interest and pleasure the river here flowing through the very centre and heart of the greatest city of the world forms at all hours and at all seasons of the year a noble and magnificent sight to my eyes it never looked more beautiful and wonderful than during those intensely cold days of january when there was nothing that one could call a mist in a chilly motionless atmosphere but only a faint haze a pallor as of impalpable frost which made the heavens seem more white than blue and gave a hoariness and cloudlike remoteness to the arches spanning the water and the vast buildings on either side ending with the sublime dome of the city cathedral and when out of the pale motionless haze singly in twos and threes in dozens and scores floated the mysterious white birdfigures first seen like vague shadows in the sky then quickly taking shape and whiteness and floating serenely past to be succeeded by others and yet others  it was not merely the ornithologist in me that made the sight so fascinating since it was found that othersall others it might almost be saidexperienced the same kind of delight  crowds of people came down to the river to watch the birds workmen when released from their work at midday hurried down to the embankment so as to enjoy seeing the gulls while eating their dinners and strangest thing of all to feed them with the fragments  and yet these very men who found so great a pleasure in observing and feeding their white visitors from the sea and were exhilarated with the novel experiences of seeing wild nature face to face at their own doorsthese thousands would have stood by silent and consenting if the halfadozen scoundrels with guns and fishhooks on lines had been allowed to have their will and had slaughtered and driven the birds from the river and this in fact is precisely what happened at a distance from london where guns could be discharged without danger to the public in numberless bays and rivers in which the birds sought refuge they were simply slaughtered wholesale in the most wanton manner in morecambe bay a hundred and twelve gulls were killed at one discharge and no hand and no voice was raised to interfere with the hideous sport not because it was not shocking to the spectators but because it was sport  doubtless it will be said that this wholesale wanton destruction of bird life however painful it may be to lovers of nature however reprehensible from a moral point of view is sanctioned by law and cannot therefore be prevented this is not quite so we see that the wild birds protection act is continually being broken with impunity and where public opinion is unfavourable to it the guardians of the law themselves the police and the magistrates are found encouraging the people to break the law again we find that where commons are enclosed and the law says nothing the people are accustomed to assemble together unlawfully to tear the fences down and are not punished for after all if laws do not express or square with public will or opinion they have little force and if in any locality the people thought proper to do soif they were not restrained by that dull tame spirit i have spoken ofthey would lawfully or unlawfully protect their seafowl from the cockney sportsmen and sweep the birdcatchers out of their lanes and waste lands  one day i paid a visit to maidenhead a pleasant town on the thames where the thames is most beautiful set in the midst of a rich and diversified country which should be a birds paradise in my walks in the town i saw a great many stuffed kingfishers and in the shops of the local taxidermists some rare and beautiful birds with others that are fast becoming rare but outside of the town i saw no kingfishers and no rare species at all and comparatively few birds of any kind it might have been a town of philistine cockneys who at no very distant period had emigrated thither from the parish of st gilesinthefields i came home with the local guidebook in my pocket it is now before me and this is what its writer says of the thicket the extensive and beautiful common two miles from the town which belongs to maidenhead or in other words to its inhabitants the thicket was formerly much infested by robbers and highwaymen the only remains of them to be found now are the snarers of the little feathered songsters who imprison them in tiny cages and carry them off in large numbers to brighten by their sweet sad sighs for liberty the dwellers in our smoky cities  on this point i consulted a birdcatcher who had spread his nets on the common for many years and he complained bitterly of the increasing scarcity of its bird life there was no better place than the thicket formerly he said but now he could hardly make his bread there i presume that a dozen men of his trade would be well able to drain the country in the neighbourhood of the thicket of the greater portion of its bird life each year so as to keep the songsters scarce will any person maintain for a moment that the eight or nine thousand inhabitants of maidenhead and the hundreds or thousands inhabiting the surrounding country could not protect their songbirds from these few men most of them out of london slums if they wished or had the spirit to do so  it is true that the local authorities in some country towns have made bylaws to protect the birds in their open spaces thus at tunbridge wells since 1890 birdtrapping and birdsnesting have been prohibited on the large and beautiful common there but so far as i know such measures have only been taken in boroughs after the birds have been almost exterminated  doubtless the day will come when law or no law the birdcatcher will find it necessary to go warily lest the people of any place where he may be tempted to spread his nets should have formed the custom of treating those of his calling somewhat roughly that it will come soon is earnestly to be wished nevertheless it would be irrational to cherish feelings of animosity and hatred against the birdcatcher himself the man and brother ready and anxious as we may be to take the bread out of his mouth he certainly does not regard himself as an injurious or disreputable person on the contrary he looks on himself as a useful member of the community and in some cases even more if anyone is to be hated or blamed it is the person who sends the birdcatcher into the fields not the dealer but he who buys trapped birds and keeps them in cages to be amused by their twitterings this is not a question of morality nor of sentimentality as some may imagine but rather of taste of the sense of fitness of that something vaguely described as the feeling for nature which is not universal thus one man will dine with zest on a pheasant partridge or quail but would be choked by a lark while another man will eat pheasant and lark with equal pleasure both may be good honest moral men only one has that something which the other lacks in one the soul responds to the skylarks music singing at heavens gate in the other not to one the roasted lark is merely a savoury morsel the other be he never so hungry cannot dissociate the bird on the dish from that heavenly melody which registered a sensation in his brain to be thereafter reproduced at will together with the revived emotion it is a curious question and is no nearer to a settlement when one of these two i have described turns round and calls his neighbour a gross feeder a worshipper of his belly a soulless and brutish man and when the other answers poohpooh and goes on complacently devouring larks with great gusto until he is himself devoured of death  to those with whom i am in sympathy in this matter who love to listen to and are yearly invigorated by the skylarks music and whose souls are yearly sickened at the slaughter of their loved songsters i would humbly suggest that there is a simpler more practical means of ending this dispute which has surely lasted long enough it goes without saying that this birds music is eminently pleasing to most persons that even as the sunshine is sweet and pleasant to behold its silvery aerial sounds rained down so abundantly from heaven are delightful and exhilarating to all of us or at all events to so large a majority that the minority are not entitled to consideration one person in five thousand or perhaps in ten thousand might be found to say that the lark singing in blue heaven affords him no pleasure this being so and ours being a democratic country in which the will or desire of the many is or may be made the law of the land it is surely only right and reasonable that lovers of larks flesh should be prevented from gratifying their taste at the cost of the destruction of so loved a bird that they should be made to content themselves with woodcock and snipe on toast and golden plover and grouse and blackcock and any other bird of delicate flavor which does not living appeal so strongly to the aesthetic feelings in us and is not so universal a favourite  this too will doubtless come in time speaking for myself and going back to the former subject little as i like to see men feeding on larks rather would i see larks killed and eaten than thrust into cages for in captivity they do not sweeten my life as the maidenhead guidebook writer would say with their shrill piercing cries for liberty but they sing me mad just as in some minds this birds musica sound which above all others typifies the exuberant life and joy of nature to the soulcannot be separated from the cooked and dishedup melodist so that they turn with horror from such meat so i cannot separate this bird nor any bird from the birds wild life of liberty and the marvellous faculty of flight which is the birds attribute to see so wild and aerial a creature in a cage jars my whole system and is a sight hateful and unnatural an outrage on our universal mother  this feeling about birds in captivity which i have attempted to describe and which i repeat is not sentimentality as that word is ordinarily understood has been so vividly rendered in an ode to the skylarks by sir rennell rodd that the reader will probably feel grateful to me for quoting a portion of it in this place especially as the volume in which it appearsfeda with other poemsis i imagine not very widely known      oh the sky the sky the open sky     for the home of a songbirds heart     and why and why and for ever why     do they stifle here in the mart     cages of agony rows on rows     torture that only a wild thing knows     is it nothing to you to see     that head thrust out through the hopeless wire     and the tiny life and the mad desire     to be free to be free to be free     oh the sky the sky the blue wide sky     for the beat of a songbirds wings              straight and close are the cramping bars     from the dawn of mist to the chill of stars     and yet it must sing or die     will its marred harsh voice in the city street     make any heart of you glad     it will only beat with its wings and beat     it will only sing you mad              if it does not go to your heart to see     the helpless pity of those bruised wings     the tireless effort to which it clings     to the strain and the will to be free     i know not how i shall set in words     the meaning of god in this     for the loveliest thing in this world of his     are the ways and the songs of birds     but the sky the sky the wide free sky     for the home of the songbirds heart   how falsely does that man see nature how grossly ignorant must he be of its most elemental truths who looks upon it as a chamber of torture a physiological laboratory on a very vast scale a scene of endless strife and trepidation of hunger and cold and every form of pain and miseryand who holding this doctrine of    oh the sky the sky the open sky is the home of a songbirds heart  natures cruelty keeps a few captive birds in cages and is accustomed to say of them these at any rate are safe rescued from subjection to ruthless conditions sheltered from the inclement weather and from enemies and all their small wants abundantly satisfied who once or twice every day looks at his little captives presents them with a lump of sugar whistles and chuckles to provoke them to sing then goes about his business flattering himself that he is a lover of birds a being of a sweet and kindly nature it is all a delusiona distortion and inversion of the truthso absurd that it would be laughable were it not so sad and the cause of so much unconscious cruelty the truth is that if birds be capable of misery it is only in the unnatural conditions of a caged life that they experience it and that if they are capable of happiness in a cage such happiness or contentment is but a poor pale emotion compared with the wild exuberant gladness they have in freedom where all their instincts have full play and where the perils that surround them do but brighten their many splendid faculties the little bird twitters and sings in its cage and among ourselves the blind man and the cripple whistle and sing too feeling at times a lower kind of contentment and cheerfulness the chaffinch in east london with its eyeballs seared by redhot needles sings too in its prison when it has grown accustomed to its darkened existence and is in health and the agreeable sensations that accompany health prompt it at intervals to melody but no person not even the dullest ruffian among the baser sort of birdfanciers would maintain for a moment that the happiness of the little sightless captive whether vocal or silent is at all comparable in degree to that of the chaffinch singing in april on the orchard bough vividly seeing the wide sunlit world blue above and green below possessing the will and the power when its lyric ends to transport itself swiftly through the crystal fields of air to other trees and other woods  i take it that in the lower animals misery can result from two causes onlyrestraint and disease consequently that animals in a state of nature are not miserable they are not hindered nor held back whether the animal is migrating or burying himself in his hibernating nest or den or flying from some rapacious enemy which he may or may not be able to escape or feeding or sleeping or fighting or courting or incubating however many days or weeks this process may lastin all things he is obeying the impulse that is strongest in him at the timehe is doing what he wants to dothe one thing that makes him happy  as to disease it is so rare in wild animals or in a large majority of cases so quickly proves fatal that compared with what we call disease in our own species it is practically nonexistent the struggle for existence in so far as animals in a state of nature are concerned is a metaphorical struggle and the strife short and sharp which is so common in nature is not misery although it results in pain since it is pain that kills or is soon outlived fear there is just as in fine weather there are clouds in the sky and just as the shadow of the cloud passes so does fear pass from the wild creature when the object that excited it has vanished from sight and when death comes it comes unexpectedly and is not the death that we know even before we taste of it thinking of it with apprehension all our lives long but a sudden blow that takes away consciousnessthe touch of something that numbs the nervesmerely the prick of a needle  in whatever way the animal perishes whether by violence or excessive cold or decay his death is a comparatively easy one so long as he is fighting with or struggling to escape from an enemy wounds are not felt as wounds and scarcely hurt himas we know from our own experience and when overcome if death be not practically instantaneous as in the case of a small bird seized by a cat the disabling grip or blow is itself a kind of anodyne producing insensibility to pain this too is a matter of human experience to say nothing of those who fall in battle men have often been struck down and fearfully lacerated by lions tigers jaguars and other savage beasts and after having been rescued by their companions have recounted this strange thing even when there was no loss of consciousness when they saw and knew that the animal was rending their flesh they seemed not to feel it and were at the time indifferent to the fate that had overtaken them  it is the same in death from cold the strong wellnourished man overtaken by a snowstorm on some pathless uninhabited waste may experience some exceedingly bitter moments or even hours before he gives up the struggle the physical pain is simply nothing the whole bitterness is in the thought that he must die the horror at the thought of annihilation the remembrance of all the happiness he is now about to lose of dear friends of those whose lives will be dimmed with grief for his loss of all his cherished dreams of the futurethe sting of all this is so sharp that compared with it the creeping coldness in his blood is nothing more than a slight discomfort and is scarcely felt by and by he is overcome by drowsiness and ceases to struggle the torturing visions fade from his mind and his only thought is to lie down and sleep and when he sleeps he passes away very easily very painlessly for the pain was of the mind and was over long before death ensued  the bird however hard the frost may be flies briskly to its customary roostingplace and with beak tucked into its wing falls asleep it has no apprehensions only the hot blood grows colder and colder the pulse feebler as it sleeps and at midnight or in the early morning it drops from its perchdead  yesterday he lived and moved responsible to a thousand external influences reflecting earth and sky in his small brilliant brain as in a lookingglass also he had a various language the inherited knowledge of his race and the faculty of flight by means of which he could shoot meteorlike across the sky and pass swiftly from place to place and with it such perfect control over all his organs such marvellous certitude in all his motions as to be able to drop himself plumb down from the tallest treetop or out of the void air on to a slender spray and scarcely cause its leaves to tremble now on this morning he lies stiff and motionless if you were to take him up and drop him from your hand he would fall to the ground like a stone or a lump of clayso easy and swift is the passage from life to death in wild nature but he was never miserable  those of my readers who have seen much of animals in a state of nature will agree that death from decay or old age is very rare among them in that state the fullest vigour with brightness of all the faculties is so important that probably in ninetynine cases in a hundred any fallingoff in strength or decay of any sense results in some fatal accident death by misadventure as we call it is natures ordinance the end designed for a very large majority of her children nevertheless animals do sometimes live on without accident to the very end of their term to fade peacefully away at the last i have myself witnessed such cases in mammals and birds and one such case which profoundly impressed me and is vividly remembered i will describe  one morning in the late summer while walking in the fields at my home in south america i noticed a few purple martins large beautiful swallows common in that region engaged at a considerable height in the aerial exercises in which they pass so much of their time each day by and by one of the birds separated itself from the others and circling slowly downward finally alighted on the ground not far from me i walked on but the action of the bird had struck me as unusual and strange and before going far i turned and walked back to the spot where it continued sitting on the ground quite motionless it made no movement when i approached to within four yards of it and after i had stood still at that distance for a minute or so attentively regarding it i saw it put out one wing and turn over on its side i at once took it up in my hand and found that it was already quite dead it was a large example of its species and its size together with a something of dimness in the glossy purple colour of the upper plumage seemed to show that it was an old bird but it was uninjured and when i dissected it no trace of disease was discernible i concluded that it was an old bird that had died solely from natural failure of the lifeenergy  but how wonderful how almost incredible that the healthy vigour and joy of life should have continued in this individual bird down to within so short a period of the end that it should have been not only strong enough to find its food but to rush and wheel about for long intervals in purely sportive exercises when the brief twilight of decline and final extinction were so near it becomes crediblewe can even believe that most of the individuals that cease to exist only when the vital fire has burnt itself out fall on death in this swift easy mannerwhen we recall the fact that even in the lifehistory of men such a thing is not unknown probably there is not one among my readers who will not be able to recall some such incident in his own circlethe case of someone who lived perhaps long past the term usually allotted to man and who finally passed away without a struggle without a pang so that those who were with him found it hard to believe that the spirit had indeed gone in such cases the subject has invariably been healthy although it is hard to believe that in the conditions we exist in any man can have the perfect health that all wild creatures enjoy     x   after my long talk with the birdcatcher on june 24 and two more talks equally long on the two following days i found that something of the charm the common had had for me was gone it was not quite the same as formerly even the sunshine had a something of conscious sadness in it which was like a shadow those merry little brown twitterers that frequently shot across the sky looking small as insects in the wide blue expanse and ever and anon dropped swiftly down like showers of aerolites to lose themselves in the grass and herbage or perch singing on the topmost dead twigs of a bush now existed in constant imminent dangernot of that quick merciful destruction which nature has for her weaklings and for all that fail to reach her high standard but of a worse fate the prison life which is not natures ordinance but one of the cunning larger apes abhorred inventions instead of taking my usual long strolls about the common i loitered once more in the village lanes and had my reward  on the morning of june 27 i was out sauntering very indolently thinking of nothing at all for it was a surpassingly brilliant day and the sunshine produced the effect of a warm lucent buoyant fluid in which i seemed to float rather than walka celestial water which like the more ponderable and common sort may sometimes be both felt and seen the sensation of feeling it is somewhat similar to that experienced by a bather standing breastdeep in a dear green warm tropical sea so charged with salt that it lifts him up but to distinguish it with the eye you must look away to a distance of some yards in an open unshaded place when it will become visible as fine glinting lines quivering and serpentining upwards fountainwise from the surface all at once i was startled by hearing the loud importunate hungercall of a young cuckoo quite close to me moving softly up to the low hedge and peering over i saw the bird perched on a long crossstick which had been put up in a cottage garden to hang clothes on he was not more than three to four yards from me a fine young cuckoo in perfect plumage his barred undersurface facing me although seeing me as plainly as i saw him he exhibited no fear and did not stir why should he since i had not come there to feed him and to his inexperienced avian mind was only one of the huge terrestrial creatures of various forms with horns and manes on their heads that move heavily about in roads and pastures and are nothing to birds but his foster parent a hedgesparrow was suspicious and kept at some distance with food in her bill then excited by his imperative note she flitted shyly to him and deposited a minute caterpillar in his great gaping yellow mouth it was like dropping a bun into the monstrous mouth of the hippopotamus of the zoological gardens but the hedgesparrow was off and back again with a second morsel in a very few moments and again and again she darted away in quest of food and returned successful while the lazy beautiful giant sat sunning himself on his crossstick and hungrily cried for more  this is one of those exceptional sights in nature which however often seen never become altogether familiar never fail to reexcite the old feelings of wonder and admiration which were experienced on first witnessing them i can safely say i think that no man has observed so many parasitical young birds individuals being fed by their fosterparents as myself yet the interest such a sight inspired in me is just as fresh now as in boyhood  and probably in no parasitical species does the strangeness of the spectacle strike the mind so sharply as in this british bird since the differences in size and colouring between the fosterparent and its false offspring are so much greater in its case here natures unnaturalness in such an instincta close union of the beautiful and the monstrousis seen in its extreme form the hawklike figure and markings of the cuckoo serve only to accentuate the disparity which is perhaps greatest when the parent is the hedgesparrowso plainlycoloured a bird so shy and secretive in its habits one never ceases to be amazed at the blindness of the parental instinct in so intelligent a creature as a bird in a case of this kind some idea of how blind it is may be formed by imagining a case in widely separated types of our own species which would be a parallel to that of the cuckoo and hedgesparrow let us imagine that some malicious arabian nights genius had snatched up the infant male child of a scandinavian couplethe largest of their nation and flying away to africa with it to the heart of the great aruwhimi forest had laid it on the breast of a little coffeecoloured woollyheaded spindleshanked potbellied pigmy mother taking away at the same time her own newlyborn babe that she had tenderly nursed the substituted child and reared and protected it ministering according to her lights to all its huge wants until he had come to the fullness of his stature yet never suspected that the magnificent ivorylimbed giant with flowing yellow locks and cerulean eyes was not the child of her own womb     xi   bright and genial were all the last days of june when i loitered in the lanes before the unwished day of my return to london during this quiet pleasant time the greenfinch was perhaps more to me than any other songster in the village itself with the adjacent lanes and orchards this pretty seldomsilent bird was the most common species the village was his metropolis just as london is oursand the sparrows its lanes were his streets its hedges and elm trees his cottage rows and tall stately mansions and public buildings  we frequently find the predominance of one species somewhat wearisome speaking for myself there are songsters that are best appreciated when they are limited in numbers and keep their distance but of the familiar unambitious strains of swallow robin and wren i never tire nor during these days could i have too much of the greenfinch low as he ranks among british melodists tastes differ that is a point on which we are all agreed and every one of us even the humblest is permitted to have his own preferences still after rereading wordsworths lines to the green linnet it is curious to say the least of it to turn to some prosewriteran authority on birds perhapsto find that this species whose music so charmed the poet has for its song a monotonous croak which it repeats at short intervals for hours without the slightest variationa dismal sound which harmonizes with no other sound in nature and suggests nothing but heat and weariness and is of all natural sounds the most irritating to this writer thenand there are others to keep him in countenancethe greenfinch as a vocalist ranks lower than the lowest one can only wonder and smile at such extreme divergences to my mind all natural sounds have in some measure an exhilarating effect and i cannot get rid of the notion that so it should be with every one of us and when some particular sound or series of sounds that has more than this common character and is distinctly pleasing is spoken of as nothing but disagreeable irritating and the rest of it i am inclined to think that there is something wrong with the person who thus describes it that he is not exactly as nature would have had him but that either during his independent life or before it at some period of his prenatal existence something must have happened to distune him all this i freely confess may be nothing but fancy in any case the subject need not keep us longer from the greenfinchthat is to say my greenfinch not another mans  from morning until evening all around and about the cottage and out of doors whithersoever i bent my steps from the masses of deep green foliage sounded the perpetual airy prattle of these delightful birds one had the idea that the concealed vocalists were continually meeting each other at little social gatherings where they exchanged pretty loving greetings and indulged in a leafy gossip interspersed with occasional fragments of music vocal and instrumental now a long trilla trilling a tinkling a sweeping of one minute fingertip over metal strings as fine as gossamer threadsdescribe it how you will you cannot describe it then the long low inflected scream like a larks throatnote drawn out and inflected little chirps and chirruping exclamations and remarks and a soft warbled note three or four or more times repeated and sometimes the singer fluttering up out of the foliage and hovering in the air displaying his green and yellow plumage while emitting these lovely notes and again the trill trill answering trill in different keys and again the music scream as if some unsubstantial being fairy or woodnymph had screamed somewhere in her green hidingplace in london one frequently hears especially in the spring halfadozen sparrows just met together in a garden tree or among the ivy or creeper on a wall burst out suddenly into a confused rapturous chorus of chirruping sounds mingled with others of a finer quality liquid and ringing at such times one is vexed to think that there are writers on birds who invariably speak of the sparrow as a tuneless creature a harsh chirper and nothing more it strikes one that such writers either wilfully abuse or are ignorant of the right meaning of words so wild and glad in character are these concerts of town sparrows and so refreshing to the tired and noisevexed brain but now when i listened to the greenfinches in the village elms and hedgerows if by chance a few sparrows burst out in loud gratulatory notes the sounds they emitted appeared coarse and i wished the chirrupers away but with the true and brilliant songsters it seemed to me that the rippling greenfinch music was always in harmony forming as it were a kind of airy subdued accompaniment to their loud and ringing tones  i had had my nightingale days my cuckoo and blackbird and treepipit days with others too numerous to mention and now i was having my greenfinch days and these were the last  one morning in july i was in my sittingroom when in the hedge on the other side of the lane just opposite my window a small brown bird warbled a few rich notes the prelude to his song i went and stood by the open window intently listening when it sang again but only a phrase or two but i listened still confidently expecting more for although it was now long past its singing season that splendid sunshine would compel it to express its gladness then just when a fresh burst of music came it was disturbed by another sound close bya human voice also singing on the other side of the hedge in which the bird sat concealed was a cottage garden and there on a swing fastened to a pair of apple trees a girl about eleven years old sat lazily swinging herself once or twice after she began singing the nightingale broke out again and then at last he became silent altogether his voice overpowered by hers  girl and bird were not five yards apart it greatly surprised me to hear her singing for it was eleven oclock when all the village children were away at the national school a time of day when so far as human sounds were concerned there reigned an almost unbroken silence but very soon i recalled the fact that this was a very lazy child and concluded that she had coaxed her mother into sending an excuse for keeping her at home and so had kept her liberty on this beautiful morning about two minutes walk from the cottage at the side of the crooked road running through the village there was a group of ancient pollarded elm trees with huge hollow trunks and behind them an open space a pleasant green slope where some of the village children used to go every day to play on the grass here i used to see this girl lying in the sun her dark chestnut hair loosed and scattered on the sward her arms stretched out her eyes nearly closed basking in the sun as happy as some heatloving wild animal no it was not strange that she had not gone to school with the others when her disposition was remembered but most strange to hear a voice of such quality in a spot where nature was rich and lovely and only man was if not vile at all events singularly wanting in the finer human qualities  looking out from the open window across the low hedgetop i could see her as she alternately rose and fell with slow indolent motion now waisthigh above the green dividing wall then only her brown head visible resting against the rope just where her hand had grasped it and as she swayed herself to and fro she sang that simple melodyprobably some childs hymn which she had been taught at the sundayschool but it was a very long hymn or else she repeated the same few stanzas many times and after each there was a brief pause and then the voice that seemed to fall and rise with the motion went on as before i could have stood there for an hournay for hourslistening to it so fresh and so pure was the clear young voice which had no earthly trouble in it and no passion and was in this like the melody of the birds of which i had lately heard so much and with it all that tenderness and depth which is not theirs but is human only and of the soul  it struck me as a singular coincidenceand to a mind of so primitive a type as the writers there is more in the fact that the word impliesthat just as i had quitted london to seek for just such a spot as i so speedily found with the passionately exclaimed words of a young london girl ringing in my ears so now i went back with this village girls melody sounding and following me no less clearly and insistently for it was not merely remembered as we remember most things but vividly and often reproduced together with the various melodies of the birds i had listened to a greater and principal voice in that choir yet in no wise lessening their first value nor ever out of harmony with them     exotic birds for britain   there are countries with a less fertile soil and a worse climate than ours yet richer in bird life nevertheless england is not poor the species are not few in number and some are extremely abundant unfortunately many of the finer kinds have been too much sought after persecuted first for their beauty then for their rarity until now we are threatened with their total destruction as these kinds become unobtainable those which stand next in the order of beauty and rarity are persecuted in their turn and in a country as densely populated as ours where birds cannot hide themselves from human eyes such persecution must eventually cause their extinction meanwhile the bird population does not decrease every place in nature like every property in chancery has more than one claimant to itsometimes the claimants are manyand so long as the dispute lasts all live out of the estate for there are always two or more species subsisting on the same kind of food possessing similar habits and frequenting the same localities it is consequently impossible for man to exterminate any one species without indirectly benefiting some other species which attracts him in a less degree or not at all this is unfortunate for as the bright kinds or those we esteem most diminish in numbers the less interesting kinds multiply and we lose much of the pleasure which bird life is fitted to give us when we visit woods or other places to which birds chiefly resort in districts uninhabited by man or where he pays little or no attention to the feathered creatures the variety of the bird life encountered affords a new and peculiar delight there is a constant succession of new forms and new voices in a single day as many species may be met with as one would find in england by searching diligently for a whole year  and yet this may happen in a district possessing no more species than england boasts and the actual number of individuals may be even less than with us in sparrows for instance of the one common species we are exceedingly rich but in bird life generally in variety of birds especially in those of graceful forms and beautiful plumage we have been growing poorer for the last fifty years and have now come to so low a state that it becomes us to inquire whether it is not in our power to better ourselves it is an old familiar trutha truismthat it is easier to destroy than to restore or build up nevertheless some comfort is to be got from the reflection that in this matter we have up till now been working against nature she loves not to bring forth food where there are none to thrive on it and when our unconsidered action had made these gaps when despising her gifts or abusing them we had destroyed or driven out her finer kinds she fell back on her lowlier kindsher reserve of coarser more generalized speciesand gave them increase and bestowed the vacant places which we had created on them what she has done she will undo or assist us in undoing for we should be going back to her methods and should have her with and not against us much might yet be done to restore the balance among our native species not by legislation albeit all laws restraining the wholesale destruction of bird life are welcome on this subject the honourable auberon herbert has said and his words are golden for myself legislation or no legislation i would turn to the friends of animals in this country and say if you wish that the friendship between man and animals should become a better and truer thing than it is at present you must make it so by countless individual efforts by making thousands of centres of personal influence  the subject is a large one in this paper the question of the introduction of exotic birds will be chiefly considered birds have been blown by the winds of chance over the whole globe and have found rest for their feet that a large number of species suited to the conditions of this country exist scattered about the world is not to be doubted and by introducing a few of these we might accelerate the change so greatly to be desired at present a very considerable amount of energy is spent in hunting down the small contingents of rare species that once inhabited our islands and still resort annually to its shores persistently endeavouring to reestablish their colonies a less amount of labour and expense would serve to introduce a few foreign species each year and the reward would be greater and would not make us ashamed we have generously given our own wild animals to other countries and from time to time we receive cheering reports of an abundant increase in at least two of our exportationsto wit the rabbit and the sparrow we are surely entitled to some return dead animals however rich their pelt or bright their plumage may be are not a fair equivalent dead things are too much with us london has become a mart for this kind of merchandise for the whole of europe and the traffic is not without a reflex effect on us for life in the inferior animals has come or is coming to be merely a thing to be lightly taken by human hands in order that its dropped garment may be sold for filthy lucre there are warehouses in this city where it is possible for a person to walk ankledeepliterally to wadein brightplumaged birdskins and see them piled shoulderhigh on either side of hima sight to make the angels weep  not the angel called woman it is not that she is naturally more cruel than man bleeding wounds and suffering in all its forms even the sigh of a burdened heart appeal to her quick sympathies and draw the ready tears but her imagination helps her less the appeal must in most cases be direct and through the medium of her senses else it is not seen and not heard if she loves the ornament of a gaywinged bird and is able to wear it with a light heart it is because it calls up no mournful image to her mind no little tragedy enacted in some faroff wilderness of the swift child of the air fallen and bleeding out its bright life and its callow nestlings orphaned of the breast that warmed them dying of hunger in the tree we know at all events that out of a female population of many millions in this country so far only ten women possibly fifteen have been found to raise their voicesraised so often and so loudly on other questionsto protest against the barbarous and abhorrent fashion of wearing slain birds as ornaments the degrading business of supplying the demand for this kind of feminine adornment must doubtless continue to flourish in our midst commerce not being compatible with morality but the material comes from other lands unblessed as yet with wild bird protection acts and individual efforts and thousands of centres of personal influence it comes mainly from the tropics where men have brutish minds and birds a brilliant plumage this trade therefore does not greatly affect the question of our native bird life and the consideration of the means which may be within our reach of making it more to us than it now is some species from warm and even hot climates have been found to thrive well in england breeding in the open air as for instance the black and the blacknecked swans the egyptian goose the mandarin and summer ducks and others too numerous to mention but these birds are semidomestic and are usually kept in enclosures and that they can stand the climate and propagate when thus protected from competition is not strange for we know that several of our hardy domestic birdsthe fowl peafowl guineafowl and muscovy duckare tropical in their origin furthermore they are all comparatively large and if they ever become feral in england it will not be for many years to come  that these large kinds thrive so well with us is an encouraging fact but the question that concerns us at present is the feasibility of importing birds of the grove chiefly of the passerine order and sending them forth to give a greater variety and richness to our bird life to go with such an object to tropical countries would only be to court failure natures highest types surpassing all others in exquisite beauty of form brilliant colouring and perfect melody can never be known to our woods and groves these rarest avian gems may not be removed from their setting and to those who desire to know them in their unimaginable lustre it will always be necessary to cross oceans and penetrate into remote wildernesses we must go rather to regions where the conditions of life are hard where winters are long and often severe where nature is not generous in the matter of food and the mouths are many and the competition great nor even from such regions could we take any strictly migratory species with any prospect of success still limiting ourselves to the resident and consequently to the hardiest kinds and to those possessing only a partial migration it is surprising to find how many there are to choose from how many are charming melodists and how many have the bright tints in which our native species are so sadly lacking the field from which the supply can be drawn is very extensive and includes the continent of europe the countries of north asia a large portion of north america and antarctic america or south chili and patagonia it would not be going too far to say that for every english species inhabiting the garden wood field stream or waste at least half a dozen resident species with similar habits might be obtained from the countries mentioned which would be superior to our own in melody the nightingale and lark excepted bright plumage grace of form or some other attractive quality the question then arises what reason is there for believing that these exotics imported necessarily in small numbers would succeed in winning a footing in our country and become a permanent addition to its avifauna for it has been admitted that our species are not few in spite of the losses that have been suffered and that the bird population does not diminish however much its character may have altered and deteriorated from the aesthetic point of view and probably also from the utilitarian there are no vacant places thus the streams are fished by herons grebes and kingfishers while the rushy margins are worked by coots and gallinules and above the surface reed and sedgewarblers with other kinds inhabit the reedbeds the decaying forest tree is the province of the woodpecker of which there are three kinds and the trunks and branches of all trees healthy or decaying are quartered by the small creeper that leaves no crevice unexplored in its search for minute insects and their eggs he is assisted by the nuthatch and in summer the wryneck comes if he still lives and deftly picks up the little active ants that are always wildly careering over the boles the foliage is gleaned by warblers and others and not even the highest terminal twigs are left unexamined by tits and their fellowseekers after little things thrushes seek for worms in moist grounds about the woods starlings and rooks go to the pasture lands the lark and his relations keep to the cultivated fields and there also dwells the larger partridge waste and stony grounds are occupied by the chats and even on the barren mountain summits the ptarmigan gets his living wagtails run on the clean margins of streams and littoral birds of many kinds are in possession of the entire seacoast thus the whole ground appears to be already sufficiently occupied the habitats of distinct species overlapping each other like the scales on a fish and when we have enumerated all these we find that scores of others have been left out  the important flycatcher the wren natures diligent little housekeeper that leaves no dusty corner uncleaned and the pigeons that have a purely vegetable diet the woods and thickets are also ranged by jays cuckoos owls hawks magpies butcherbirds natures gamekeepers with a licence to kill which after the manner of gamekeepers they exercise somewhat indiscriminately above the earth the air is peopled by swifts and swallows in the daytime and by goatsuckers at night and as if all these were not enough the finches are found scattered everywhere from the most secluded spot in nature to the noisy public thoroughfare and are eaters of most things from flinty seed to softest caterpillar this being the state of things one might imagine that experience and observation are scarcely needed to prove to us that the exotic strange to the conditions and where its finest instincts would perhaps be at fault would have no chance of surviving nevertheless odd as it may seem the small stock of facts bearing on the subject which we possess point to a contrary conclusion it might have been assumed for instance that the redlegged partridge would never have established itself with us where the ground was already fully occupied by a native species which possessed the additional advantage of a more perfect protective colouring yet in spite of being thus handicapped the stranger has conquered a place and has spread throughout the greater part of england even more remarkable is the case of the pheasant with its rich plumage a native of a hot region yet our cold wet climate and its unmodified bright colours have not been fatal to it and practically it is one of our wild birds the large capercailzie has also been successfully introduced from norway small birds would probably become naturalized much more readily than large ones they are volatile and can more quickly find suitable feedingground and safe roosting and nesting places their food is also more abundant and easily found their small size which renders them inconspicuous gives them safety and finally they are very much more adaptive than large birds  it is not at all probable that the redlegged partridge will ever drive out our own bird a contingency which some have feared that would be a misfortune for we do not wish to change one bird for another or to lose any species we now possess but to have a greater variety we are better off with two partridges than we were with one even if the invader does not afford such good sport nor such delicate eating they exist side by side and compete with each other but such competition is not necessarily destructive to either on the contrary it acts and reacts healthily and to the improvement of both it is a fact that in small islands very far removed from the mainland where the animals have been exempt from all foreign competitionthat is from the competition of casual colonistswhen it does come it proves in many cases fatal to them fortunately this countrys large size and nearness to the mainland has prevented any such fatal crystallization of its organisms as we see in islands like st  helena that any english species would be exterminated by foreign competition is extremely unlikely whether we introduce exotic birds or not the only losses we shall have to deplore in the future will like those of the past be directly due to our own insensate action in slaying every rare and beautiful thing with powder and shot from the introduction of exotic species nothing is to be feared but much to be hoped  there is another point which should not be overlooked it has after all become a mere fiction to say that all places are occupied natures nice order has been destroyed and her kingdom thrown into the utmost confusion our action tends to maintain the disorderly condition while she is perpetually working against us to reestablish order when she multiplies some common littleregarded species to occupy a space left vacant by an artificially exterminated kind the species called in as a mere stopgap as it were is one not specially adapted in structure and instincts to a particular mode of life and consequently cannot fully and effectually occupy the ground into which it has been permitted to enter to speak in metaphor it enters merely as a caretaker or ignorant and improvident steward in the absence of the rightful owner again some of our ornamental species which are fast diminishing are fitted from their peculiar structure and life habits to occupy places in nature which no other kinds however plastic they may be can even partially fill the wryneck and the woodpecker may be mentioned and a still better instance is afforded by the small gemlike kingfisherthe only british bird which can properly be described as gemlike when the goldfinch goesand we know that he is going rapidlyother coarser fringilline birds without the melody brightness and charm of the goldfinchsparrow and buntingcome in and in some rough fashion supply its place but when the kingfisher disappears an important place is left absolutely vacant for in this case there is no coarser bird of homely plumage with the fishing instinct to seize upon it here then is an excellent opportunity for an experiment in the temperate regions of the earth there are many fine kingfishers to select from some are resident in countries colder than england and are consequently very hardy and in some cases the rivers and streams they frequent are exceedingly poor in fish some of them are very beautiful and they vary in size from birds no larger than a sparrow to others as large as a pigeon  anglers might raise the cry that they require all the finny inhabitants of our waters for their own sport it is scarcely necessary to go as deeply into the subject as mathematicalminded mudie did to show that natures lavishness in the production of life would make such a contention unreasonable he demonstrated that if all the fishes hatched were to live their full term in twentyfour years their production power would convert into fish two hundred to the solid foot as much matter as there is contained in the whole solar systemsun planets and satellites an abundantly startling result as he says to be well within the mark ninetynine out of every hundred fishes hatched must somehow perish during that stage when they are nothing but suitable morsels for the kingfisher to be swallowed entire and a portion of all this wasted food might very well go to sustain a few species which would be beautiful ornaments of the waterside and a perpetual delight to all lovers of rural nature including anglers it may be remarked in passing that the waste of food in the present disorganized state of nature is not only in our streams  the introduction of one or more of these lovely foreign kingfishers would not certainly have the effect of hastening the decline of our native species but indirectly it might bring about a contrary resulta subject to be touched on at the end of this paper practical naturalists may say that kingfishers would be far more difficult to procure than other birds and that it would be almost impossible to convey them to england that is a question it would be premature to discuss now but if the attempt should ever be made the difficulties would not perhaps be found insuperable in all countries one hears of certain species of birds that they invariably die in captivity but when the matter is closely looked into one usually finds that improper treatment and not loss of liberty is the cause of death unquestionably it would be much more difficult to keep a kingfisher alive and healthy during a long seavoyage than a common seedeating bird but the same may be said of woodpeckers cuckoos warblers and in fact of any species that subsists in a state of nature on a particular kind of animal food still when we find that even the excessively volatile hummingbird which subsists on the minutest insects and the nectar of flowers and seems to require unlimited space for the exercise of its energies can be successfully kept confined for long periods and conveyed to distant countries one would imagine that it would be hard to set a limit to what might be done in this direction we do not want hardbilled birds only we require in the first place variety and secondly that every species introduced when not of type unlike any native kind as in the case of the pheasant shall be superior in beauty melody or some other quality to its british representative or to the species which comes nearest to it in structure and habits thus suppose that the introduction of a pigeon should be desired we know that in all temperate regions these birds vary as little in colour and markings as they do in form but in the vocal powers of different species there is great diversity and the main objects would therefore be to secure a bird which would be an improvement in this respect on the native kinds there are doves belonging to the same genus as stockdove and woodpigeon that have exceedingly good voices in which the peculiar mournful dovemelody has reached its highest perfectionweird and passionate strains surging and ebbing and startling the hearer with their mysterious resemblance to human tones or a zenaida might be preferred for its tender lament so wild and exquisitely modulated like sobs etherealized and set to music and passing away in sighlike sounds that seem to mimic the aerial voices of the wind  when considering the character of our bird population with a view to its improvement one cannot but think much and with a feeling almost of dismay of the excessive abundance of the sparrow a systematic persecution of this bird would probably only serve to make matters worse since its continued increase is not the cause but an effect of a corresponding decrease in other more useful and attractive species and if nature is to have her way at all there must be birds and besides no birdlover has any wish at see such a thing attempted the sparrow has his good points if we are to judge him as we find him without allowing what the australians and americans say of him to prejudice our minds possibly in those distant countries he may be altogether bad resembling in this respect some of the emigrants of our species who when they go abroad leave their whole stock of morality at home even with us miss ormerod is exceedingly bitter against him and desires nothing less than his complete extirpation but it is possible that this ladys zeal may not be according to knowledge that she may not know a sparrow quite so well as she knows a fly at all events the ornithologist finds it hard to believe that so bad an insectcatcher is really causing the extinction of any exclusively insectivorous species on her own very high authority we know that the insect supply is not diminishing that the injurious kinds alone are able to inflict an annual loss equal to £10000000 on the british farmer to put aside this controversial matter the sparrow with all his faults is a pleasant merry little fellow in many towns he is the sole representative of wild bird life and is therefore a great deal to usespecially in the metropolis in which he most abounds and where at every quiet interval his blithe chirruping comes to us like a sound of subdued and happy laughter in london itself this merriment of nature never irritates it is so much finer and more aerial in character than the gross jarring noises of the street that it is a relief to listen to it and it is like melody in the quiet suburbs it sounds much louder and without intermission and going further afield in woods gardens hedges hamlets townseverywhere there is the same running rippling sound of the omnipresent sparrow and it becomes monotonous at last we have too much of the sparrow but we are to blame for that he is the unskilled worker that nature has called in to do the work of skilled hands which we have foolishly turned away he is willing enough to take it all on himself his energy is great he bungles away without ceasing and being one of a joyous temperament he whistles and sings in his tuneless fashion at his work until like the grasshopper of ecclesiastes he becomes a burden for how tiring are the sight and sound of grasshoppers when one journeys many miles and sees them incessantly rising like a sounding cloud before his horse and hears their shrill notes all day from the wayside yet how pleasant to listen to their minstrelsy in the green summer foliage where they are not too abundant we can have too much of anything however charming it may be in itself those who live where sceres of hummingbirds are perpetually dancing about the garden flowers find that the eye grows weary of seeing the daintiest forms and brightest colours and liveliest motions that birds exhibit we are told that edward the confessor grew so sick of the incessant singing of nightingales in the forest of haveringatbower that he prayed to heaven to silence their music whereupon the birds promptly took their departure and returned no more to that forest until after the kings death the sparrow is not so sensitive as the legendary nightingales and is not to be got rid of in this easy manner he is amenable only to a rougher kind of persuasion and it would be impossible to devise a more effectual method of lessening his predominance than that which nature teachesnamely to subject him to the competition of other and better species he is well equipped for the strugglehardy pugnacious numerous and in possession he would not be in possession and so predominant if he had not these qualities and great pliability of instinct and readiness to seize on vacant places nevertheless even with the sturdy sparrow a very small thing might turn the scale particularly if we were standing by and putting a little artificial pressure on one side of the balance for it must be borne in mind that the very extent and diversity of the ground he occupies is a proof that he does not occupy it effectually and that his position is not too strong to be shaken it is not probable that our action in assisting one side against the other would go far in its results still a little might be done there are gardens and grounds in the suburbs of london where sparrows are not abundant and are shyer than the birds of other species and this result has been brought about by means of a little judicious persecution shooting is a bad plan even with an airgun its effects are seen by all the birds for they see more from their green hidingplaces than we imagine and it creates a general alarm among them those who wish to give the other birds a chance will only defeat their own object by shooting the sparrows a much better plan for those who are able to practise it prudently is to take their nests which are more exposed to sight than those of other birds but they should be taken after the full complement of eggs have been laid and only at night so that other birds shall not witness the robbery and fear for their own treasures mr henry george in that book of his which has been the delight of so many millions of rational souls advocates the destruction of all sharks and other large rapacious fishes after which he says the ocean can be stocked with salmon which would secure an unlimited supply of good wholesome food for the human race no such highhanded measures are advocated here with regard to the sparrow knowledge of nature makes us conservative it is so very easy to say kill the sparrow or shark or magpie or whatever it is and then everything will be right but there are more things in nature than are dreamt of in the philosophy of the class of reformers represented by the gamekeeper and the gamekeepers master and miss ormerod and mr henry george let him by all means kill the sharks but he will not conquer nature in that way she will make more sharks out of something elsepossibly out of the very salmon on which he proposes to regale his hungry disciples to go into details is not the present writers purpose and to finish with this part of the subject it is sufficient to add that in the very wide and varied field occupied by the sparrow in that rough ineffectual manner possible to a species having no special and highly perfected feeding instincts there is room for the introduction of scores of competitors every one of which should be better adapted than the sparrow to find a subsistence at that point or that particular part of the field where the two would come into rivalry and every species introduced should also possess some quality which would make it from the aesthetic point of view a valuable addition to our bird life this would be no war of violence and no contravention of natures ordinances but on the contrary a return to her safe healthy and farreaching methods  there is one objection some may make to the scheme suggested here which must be noticed it may be said that even if exotic species able to thrive in our country were introduced there would be no result for these strangers to our groves would all eventually meet with the same fate as our rarer species and casual visitorsthat is to say they would be shot there is no doubt that the amateur naturalist has been a curse to this country for the last half century that it is owing to the cupidity of the cabinet as old robert mudie has itthat many of our finer species are exceedingly rare while others are disappearing altogether but it is surely not too soon to look for a change for the better in this direction half a century ago when the few remaining great bustards in this country were being done to death it was suddenly remembered by naturalists that in their eagerness to possess examples of the bird in the skin they had neglected to make themselves acquainted with its customs when alive its habits were hardly better known than those of the dodo and solitaire the reflection came too late in so far as the habits of the bird in this country are concerned but unhappily the lesson was not then taken to heart and other fine species have since gone the way of the great bustard but now that we have so clearly seen the disastrous effects of this method of studying ornithology which is not in harmony with our humane civilization it is to be hoped that a better method will be adoptedthat finer way which thoreau found and put aside his fowlingpiece to practise there can be no doubt that the desire for such an improvement is now becoming very general that a kindlier feeling for animal and especially bird life is growing up among us and there are signs that it is even beginning to have some appreciable effect the fashion of wearing birds is regarded by most men with pain and reprobation and it is possible that before long it will be thought that there is not much difference between the action of the woman who buys tanagers and hummingbirds to adorn her person and that of the man who kills the bittern hoopoe waxwing golden oriole and dartfordwarbler to enrich his private collection  a few words on the latest attempt which has been made to naturalize an exotic bird in england will not seem out of place here about eight years ago a gentleman in essex introduced the rufous tinamoua handsome game bird nearly as large as a fowlinto his estate up till the present time or till quite recently these birds have bred every year and at one time they had increased considerably and scattered about the neighbourhood when it began to increase the neighbouring proprietors and sportsmen generally were asked not to shoot it but to give it a chance and there is reason to believe that they have helped to protect it and have taken a great interest in the experiment whatever the ultimate result may be the partial success attained during these few years is decidedly encouraging and that for more reasons than one in the first place the bird was badly chosen for such an experiment it belongs to the pampas of la plata to which it is restricted and where it enjoys a dry bright climate and lives concealed in the tall closegrowing indigenous grasses the conditions of its habitat are therefore widely different from those of essex or of any part of england and besides it has a peculiar organisation for it happens to be one of those animals of ancient types of which a few species still survive in south america that so unpromising a subject as this large archaic tinamou should be able to maintain its existence in this country even for a very few years encourages one to believe that with betterchosen species more highly organized and with more pliant habits such as the hazel hen of europe for a game bird success would be almost certain  another circumstance connected with the attempted introduction of this unsuitable bird even of more promise than the mere fact of the partial success achieved is the greatest interest the experiment has excited not only among naturalists throughout the country but also among landlords and sportsmen down in essex where the bird was not regarded merely as fair game to be bagged or as a curiosity to be shot for the collectors cabinet but was allowed to fight its own fight without counting man among its enemies and it is to be expected that the same selfrestraint and spirit of fairness and intelligent desire to see a favourable result would be shown everywhere if exotic species were to be largely introduced and breeding centres established in suitable places throughout the country when it once became known that individuals were doing this thing giving their time and best efforts and at considerable expense not for their own selfish gratification but for the general good and to make the country more delightful to all lovers of rural sights and sounds there would be no opposition but on the contrary every assistance since all would wish success to such an enterprise even the most enthusiastic collector would refrain from lifting a weapon against the new feathered guests from distant lands and if by any chance an example of one should get into his hands he would be ashamed to exhibit it  the addition of new beautiful species to our avifauna would probably not be the only nor even the principal benefit we should derive from the carrying out of the scheme here suggested the indirect effect of the knowledge all would possess that such an experiment was being conducted and that its chief object was to repair the damage that has been done would be wholly beneficial since it would enhance the value in our eyes of our remaining native rare and beautiful species a large number of our finer birds are annually shot by those who know that they are doing a great wrongthat if their transgression is not punishable by law it is really not less grave than that of the person who maliciously barks a shade tree in a park or public gardenbut who excuse their action by saying that such birds must eventually get shot and that those who first see them might as well have the benefit the presence of even a small number of exotic species in our woods and groves would no doubt give rise to a better condition of things it would attract public attention to the subject for the birds that delight us with their beauty and melody should be for the public and not for the few barbarians engaged in exterminating them and the collector would find it best to abandon his evil practices when it once began to be generally asked if we can spare the rare lovely birds brought hither at great expense from china or patagonia can we not also spare our own kingfisher and the golden oriole and the hoopoe that comes to us annually from africa to breed but is not permitted to breed and many other equally beautiful and interesting species     moorhens in hyde park   the sparrow like the poor we have always with us and on windy days even the largesized rook is blown about the murkiness which does duty for sky over london and on such occasions its coarse corvine dronings seem not unmusical nor without something of a tonic effect on our jarred nerves and here the ordinary londoner has got to the end of his ornithological listthat is to say his winter list he knows nothing about those windworn waifs the occasional visitors to the metropolisthe pilgrims to distant meccas and medinas that have fallen overcome by weariness at the wayside or have encountered storms in the great aerial sea and lost compass and reckoning and have been lured by false lights to perish miserably at the hands of their cruel enemies it may be true that gulls are seen on the serpentine that woodcocks are flushed in lincolns inn fields but the citizen who goes to his office in the morning and returns after the lamps have been lighted does not see them and they are nothing in his life those who concern themselves to chronicle such incidents might just as well for all that it matters to him mistake their species like that birdloving but unornithological correspondent of the times who wrote that he had seen a flock of golden orioles in kensington gardens it turned out that what he had seen were wheatears or they might draw a little on their imaginations and tell of sunwardsailing cranes encamped on the dome of st pauls cathedral flamingoes in the round pond great snowy owls in westminster abbey and an ibisscarlet glossy or sacred according to fancyperched on peabodys statue at the royal exchange  but his winter does not last for ever when the bitter months are past with march that mocks us with its crown of daffodils when the sun shines and the rain is soon over and elms and limes in park and avenue and unsightly smokeblackened brushwood in the squares are dressed once more in tenderest heartrefreshing green even in london we know that the birds have returned from beyond the sea why should they come to us here when it would seem so much more to their advantage and more natural for them to keep aloof from our dimmed atmosphere and the rude sounds of traffic and the sight of many people going to and fro are there no silent green retreats left where the conditions are better suited to their shy and delicate natures yet no sooner is the spring come again than the birds are with us not always apparent to the eye but everywhere their irrepressible gladness betrays their proximity and all london is ringed round with a mist of melody which presses on us ambitious of winning its way even to the central heart of our citadel creeping in mistlike along gardens and treeplanted roads clinging to the greenery of parks and squares and floating above the dull noises of the town as clouds fleecy and ethereal float above the earth  among our spring visitors there is one which is neither aerial in habits nor a melodist yet is eminently attractive on account of its graceful form pretty plumage and amusing manners nor must it be omitted as a point in its favour that it is not afraid to make itself very much at home with us in london  footnote note that when this was written in 1893 the moorhen was never known to winter in london his habits have changed in this respect during the last two decades he is now a permanent resident this is the little moorhen a bird possessing some strange customs for which those who are curious about such matters may consult its numerous biographies every spring a few individuals of this species make their appearance in hyde park and settle there for the season in full sight of the fashionable world for their breedingplace happens to be that minute transcript of nature midway between the dell and rotten row where a small bed of rushes and aquatic grasses flourishes in the stagnant pool forming the end of the serpentine where they pass the winterin what mentone or madeira of the ralline raceis not known there is a pretty story which circulated throughout europe a little over fifty years ago of a polish gentleman capturing a stork that built its nest on his roof every summer and putting an iron collar on its neck with the inscription haec ciconia ex polonia the following summer it reappeared with something which shone very brightly on its neck and when the stork was taken again this was found to be a collar of gold with which the iron collar had been replaced and on it were graven the words india cum donis remittit ciconian polonis no person has yet put an iron collar on the moorhen to receive gifts in return or followed its feeble fluttering flight to discover the limits of its migration which is probably no further away than the kentish marshes and other wet sheltered spots in the south of england that it leaves the country when it quits the park is not to be believed still it goes with the wave and with the wave returns and like the migratory birds that observe times and seasons it comes back to its own homethat circumscribed spot of earth and water which forms its little world and is more to it than all other reedy and willowshaded pools and streams in england it is said to be shy in disposition yet all may see it here within a few feet of the row with so many people continually passing and so many pausing to watch the pretty birds as they trip about their little plot of green turf deftly picking minute insects from the grass and not disdaining crumbs thrown by the children a dainty thing to look at is that smooth olivebrown little moorhen going about with such freedom and ease in its small dominion lifting its green legs deliberately turning its yellow beak and shield this way and that and displaying the snowwhite undertail at every step as it moves with that quaint graceful jetting gait peculiar to the gallinules  such a fact as thisand numberless facts just as significant all pointing to the same conclusion might be adducedshows at once how utterly erroneous is that oftenquoted dictum of darwins that birds possess an instinctive or inherited fear of man these moorhens fear him not at all simply because in hyde park they are not shot at and robbed of their eggs or young nor in any way molested by him they fear no living thing except the irrepressible small dog that occasionally bursts into the enclosure and hunts them with furious barkings to their reedy little refuge and as with these moorhens so it is with all wild birds they fear and fly from and suspiciously watch from a safe distance whatever molests them and wherever man suspends his hostility towards them they quickly outgrow the suspicion which experience has taught them or which is traditional among them for the young and inexperienced imitate the action of the adults they associate with and learn the suspicious habit from them  it is also interesting and curious to note that a bird which inhabits two countries in summer and winter regulates his habits in accordance with the degree of friendliness or hostility exhibited towards him by the human inhabitants of the respective areas the bird has in fact two traditions with regard to mans attitude towards himone for each country thus the fieldfare is an exceedingly shy bird in england but when he returns to the north if his breeding place is in some inhabited district in northern sweden or norway he loses all his wildness and builds his nest quite close to the houses my friend trevor battye saw a pair busy making their nest in a small birch within a few yards of the front door of a house he was staying at how strange said he to the man of the house to see fieldfares making a nest in such a place  why strange said the man in surprise why strange because of the boys always throwing stones at a bird the nest is so low down that any boy could put his hand in and take the eggs take the eggs cried the man more astonished than ever and throwing stones at a bird who ever heard of a boy doing such things  closely related to this error is another error which is that noise in itself is distressing to birds and has the effect of driving them away to all sounds and noises which are not associated with danger to them birds are absolutely indifferent the rumbling of vehicles puffing and shrieking of engines and braying of brass bands alarm them less than the slight popping of an air gun where that modest weapon of destruction is frequently used against them they have no nerves for noise but the apparition of a small boy silently creeping along the hedgeside in search of nests or throwing stones is very terrifying to them they fear not cattle and horses however loud the bellowing may be and if we were to transport and set loose herds of longnecked camelopards trumpeting elephants and rhinoceroses of horrible aspect the little birds would soon fear them as little as they do the familiar cow but they greatly fear the smallsized quiet unobtrusive and meeklooking cat  sparrows and starlings that fly wildly at the shout of a small boy or the bark of a foxterrier build their nests under every railway arch and the incubating bird sits unalarmed amid the iron plates and girders when the express train rushes overhead so close to her that one would imagine that the thunderous jarring noise would cause the poor thing to drop down dead with terror to this indifference to the mere harmless racket of civilization we owe it that birds are so numerous around and even in london and that in kew gardens which on account of its position on the water side and the numerous railroads surrounding it is almost as much tortured with noise as willesden or clapham junction birds are concentrated in thousands food is not more abundant there than in other places yet it would be difficult to find a piece of ground of the same extent in the country proper where all is silent and there are no human crowds with so large a bird population they are more numerous in kew than elsewhere in spite of the noise and the people because they are partially protected there from their human persecutors it is a joy to visit the gardens in spring as much to hear the melody of the birds as to look at the strange and lovely vegetable forms on a june evening with a pure sunny sky when the air is elastic after rain how it rings and palpitates with the fine sounds that people it and which seem infinite in variety has england burdened with care and long estranged from nature so many sweet voices left what aerial chimes are those wafted from the leafy turret of every tree what clear choral songsso wild so glad what strange instruments not made with hands so deftly touched and soulfully breathed upon what faint melodious murmurings that float around us mysterious and tender as the lisping of leaves who could be so dull and exact as to ask the names of such choristers at such a time earthly names they have the names we give them when they visit us and when we write about them in our dreary books but doubtless in their brighter home in cloudland they are called by other more suitable appellatives kew is exceptionally favoured for the reason mentioned but birds are also abundant where there are no hired men with red waistcoats and brass buttons to watch over their safety why do they press so persistently around us and not in london only but in every town and village every house and cottage in this country why are they always waiting congregating as far from us as the depth of garden lawn or orchard will allow yet always near as they dare to come it is not sentiment and to be translated into such words as these oh man why are you unfriendly towards us or else so indifferent to our existence that you do not note that your children dependants and neighbours cruelly persecute us for we are for peace and knowing you for the lord of creation we humbly worship you at a distance and wish for a share in your affection no the small bright soul which is in a bird is incapable of such a motive and has only the lesser light of instinct for its guide and to the birds instinct we are only one of the wingless mammalians inhabiting the earth and with the cat and weasel are labelled dangerous but the ox and horse and sheep have no such label even our larger dimmer eyes can easily discover the attraction let any one possessing a garden in the suburbs of london minutely examine the foliage at a point furthest removed from the house and he will find the plants clean from insects and as he moves back he will find them increasingly abundant until he reaches the door insect life is gathered thickly about us for that birdless space which we have made is ever its refuge and safe camping ground and the birds know one came before we were up when cat and dog were also sleeping and a report is current among them like ants when a forager who has found a honey pot returns to the nest they are all eager to go and see and taste for themselves their country is poor for they have gathered its spoils and now this virgin territory sorely tempts them to those who know a birds spirit it is plain that a mere suspension of hostile action on our part would have the effect of altering their shy habits and bringing them in crowds about us not only in the orchard and grove and garden walks would they be with us but even in our house the robin the little bird with the red stomacher would be there for the customary crumbs at mealtime and many dainty fringilline pensioners would keep him company and the wren would be there searching diligently in the dusty angles of cornices for a savoury morsel for it knows this wise little kitty wren that the spider taketh hold with her hands and is in kings palaces and wandering from room to room it would pour forth many a gushing lyrica sound of wildness and joy in our still interiors eternal natures message to our hearts  who delights not in a bird yet how few among us find any pleasure in reading of them in natural history books the living bird viewed closely and fearless of our presence is so much more to the mind than all that is writtenso infinitely more engaging in its spontaneous gladness its brilliant vivacity and its motions so swift and true and yet so graceful even leaving out the melody what a charm it would add to our homes if birds were permitted to take the part there for which nature designed themif they were the winged wardens of our gardens and houses as well as of our fields birdbiographies are always in our bookcases and the birdform meets our sight everywhere in decorative art eastern and western for its aerial beauty is without parallel in nature but the living birds with the exception of the unfortunate captives in cages are not with us      a robin redbreast in a cage     puts all heaven in a rage  sings blake prophet and poet and for robin redbreast i read every feathered creature endowed with the marvellous faculty of flight wild and loving their safety and liberty they keep at a distance at the end of the garden or in the nearest grove where from their perches they suspiciously watch our movements always waiting to be encouraged waiting to feed on the crumbs that fall from our table and are wasted and on the blighting insects that ring us round with their living multitudes     the eagle and the canary   one weekday morning following a crowd of welldressed people i presently found myself in a large church or chapel where i spent an hour very pleasantly listening to a great mans pulpit eloquence he preached about genius the subject was not suggested by the text nor did it have any close relation with the other parts of his discourse it was simply a digression and to my mind a very delightful one he began about the restrictions to which we are all more or less subject the aspirations that are never destined to be fulfilled but are mocked by lifes brevity and it was at this point thatprobably thinking of his own casehe branched off into the subject of genius and proceeded to show that a man possessing that divine quality finds existence a much sadder affair than the ordinary man the reason being that his aspirations are so much loftier than those of other minds the difference between his ideal and reality must be correspondingly greater in his case this was obviousalmost a truism but the illustration by means of which he brought it home to his hearers was certainly born of poetic imagination the life of the ordinary person he likened to that of the canary in its cage and here dropping his lofty didactic manner andif i may coin a wordsmalling his deep sonorous voice to a thin reedy treble in imitation of the tenuous fringilline pipe he went on with lively language rapid utterance and suitable brisk movements and gestures to describe the little lemoncoloured housekeeper in her gilded cage oh he cried what a bright busy bustling life is hers with so many things to occupy her time how briskly she hops from perch to perch then to the floor and back from floor to perch again how often she drops down to taste the seed in her box or scatter it about her in a little shower how curiously and turning her bright eyes critically this way and that she listens to every new sound and regards every object of sight she must chirp and sing and hop from place to place and eat and drink and preen her wings and do at least a dozen different things every minute and her time is so fully taken up that the narrow limits confining her are almost forgottenthe wires that separate her from the great world of windtossed woods and of blue fields of air and the free buoyant life for which her instincts and faculties fit her and which alas can never more be hers  all this sounded very pretty as well as true and there was a pleased smile on every face in the audience  then the rapid movements and gestures ceased and the speaker was silent a cloud came over his roughhewn majestic visage he drew himself up and swayed his body from side to side and shook his black gown and lifted his arms as their plumed homologues are lifted by some great bird and let them fall again two or three times and then said in deep measured tones which seemed to express rage and despair but did you ever see the eagle in his cage  the effect of the contrast was grand he shook himself again and lifted and dropped his arms again assuming for the nonce the peculiar aquiline slouch and there before us stood the mighty bird of jove as we are accustomed to see it in the zoological gardens its deepset desolate eyes looking through and beyond us ruffling its dark plumage and lifting its heavy wings as if about to scorn the earth only to drop them again and to utter one of those long dreary cries which seem to protest so eloquently against a barbarous destiny then he proceeded to tell us of the great raptor in its life of hopeless captivity his stern rugged countenance deep bass voice and grand mouthfilling polysllables suiting his subject well and making his description seem to our minds a sombre magnificent picture never to be forgottenat all events never by an ornithologist  doubtless this part of his discourse proved eminently pleasing to the majority of his hearers who looking downwards into the depths of their own natures would be able to discern there a glimmer or possibly more than a glimmer of that divine quality he had spoken of and which was unhappily for them not recognized by the world at large so that for the moment he was addressing a congregation of captive eagles all mentally ruffling their plumage and flapping their pinions and uttering indignant screams of protest against the injustice of their lot  the illustration pleased me for a different reason namely because being a student of birdlife his contrasted picture of the two widely different kinds when deprived of liberty struck me as being singularly true to nature and certainly it could not have been more forcibly and picturesquely put for it is unquestionably the fact that the misery we inflict by tyrannously using the power we possess over gods creatures is great in proportion to the violence of the changes of condition to which we subject our prisoners and while canary and eagle are both more or less aerial in their mode of life and possessed of boundless energy the divorce from nature is immeasurably greater in one case than in the other the small bird in relation to its free natural life is less confined in its cage than the large one its smallness perching structure and restless habits fit it for continual activity and its flitting active life within the bars bears some resemblance except in the great matter of flight to its life in a state of nature again its lively curious and extremely impressible character is in many ways an advantage in captivity every new sound and sight and every motion however slight in any object or body near it affording it so to speak something to think about it has the further advantage of a varied and highly musical language the frequent exercise of the faculty of singing in birds with largely developed vocal organs no doubt reacts on the system and contributes not a little to keep the prisoner healthy and cheerful  on the other hand the eagle on account of its structure and large size is a prisoner indeed and must languish with all its splendid faculties and importunate impulses unexercised you may gorge it with gobbets of flesh until its stomach cries enough but what of all the other organs fed by the stomach and their correlated faculties every bone and muscle and fibre every feather and scale is instinct with an energy which you cannot satisfy and which is like an eternal hunger chain it by the feet or place it in a cage fifty feet widein either case it is just as miserable the illimitable fields of thin cold air where it outrides the winds and soars exulting beyond the clouds alone can give free space for the display of its powers and scope to its boundless energies nor to the power of flight alone but also to a vision formed for sweeping wide horizons and perceiving objects at distances which to shortsighted man seem almost miraculous  doubtless eagles like men possess some adaptiveness else they would perish in their enforced inactivity swallowing without hunger and assimilating without pleasure the cold coarse flesh we give them a human being can exist and even be tolerably cheerful with limbs paralyzed and hearing gone and that to my mind would be a parallel case to that of the eagle deprived of its liberty and of the power to exercise its flight vision and predatory instincts  as i sit writing these thoughts with a cage containing four canaries on the table before me i cannot help congratulating these little prisoners on their comparatively happy fate in having been born or hatched finches and not eagles and yet albeit i am not responsible for the restraint which has been put upon them and am not their owner being only a visitor in the house i am troubled with some uncomfortable feelings concerning their conditionfeelings which have an admixture of something like a sense of shame or guilt as if an injustice had been done and i had stood by consenting i did not do it but we did it i remember matthew arnolds feeling lines on his dead canary poor matthias and quote      yet poor bird thy tiny corse     moves me somehow to remorse     something haunts my conscience brings     sad compunctious visitings     other favourites dwelling here     open lived with us and near     well we knew when they were glad     plain we saw if they were sad     sympathy could feel and show     both in weal of theirs and woe      birds companions more unknown     live beside us but alone     finding not do all they can     passage from their souls to man     kindness we bestow and praise     laud their plumage greet their lays     still beneath their feathered breast     stirs a history unexpressed     wishes there and feeling strong     incommunicably throng     what they want we cannot guess   this as poetry is good but it does not precisely fit my case my compunctious visitings being distinctly different in origin and character from the poets hematthew arnoldis a poet and the author of much good verse which i appreciate and hold dear but he was not a naturalistall men cannot be everything and i a naturalist hold that the wishes thronging the restless little feathered breast are not altogether so incommunicable as the melodious mourner of poor matthias imagines the daysay and yearswhich i have spent in the society of my feathered friends have not i flatter myself been so wasted that i cannot small my soul just as the preacher smalled his voice to bring it within reach of them and establish some sort of passage  and so thinking that a little more knowledge of birds than most people possess and consideration for themfor i will not be so harsh to speak of justiceand time and attention given to their wants might remove this reproach and silence these vague suggestions of a too fastidious conscience i have taken the trouble to add something to the seed with which these little prisoners had been supplied for we give sweetmeats to the child that cries for the moonan alternative which often acts beneficiallyand there is nothing more to be done any one of us even a philosopher would think it hard to be restricted to dry bread only yet such a punishment would be small compared with that which we in our ignorance or want of consideration inflict on our caged animalsour pets on compulsion small because an almost infinite variety of flavours drawn from the whole vegetable kingdoma hundred flavours for every one in the dietary which satisfies our heavier mammalian naturesis a condition of the little wild birds existence and essential to its wellbeing and perfect happiness and so to remedy this defect i went out into the garden and with seeding grasses and pungent buds and leaves of a dozen different kinds i decorated the cage until it looked less like a prison than a bower and now for an hour the little creatures have been busy with their varied green fare each one tasting half a dozen different leaves every minute hopping here and there and changing places with his fellows glancing their bright little eyes this way and that and all the time uttering gratulatory notes in the canarys conversational tone and their language is not altogether untranslatable i listen to one a pretty pure yellow bird but slightly tyrannical in his treatment of the others and he says or seems to say this is good i like it only the old leaf is tough the buds would be better    these are certainly not so good i tasted them out of compliment to nature though they were scarcely palatable    no that was not my own expression it was said by thoreau perhaps the only human a little bird can quote with approval this is decidedly bitterand yetyes it does leave a pleasant flavour on the palate make room for me thereor i shall make you and let me taste it again yes i fancy i can remember eating something like this in a former state of existence ages and ages ago and so on and so on until i began to imagine that the whole thing had been put right and that the uncomfortable feeling would return to trouble me no more but at the rate they are devouring their green stuff there will not be a leat scarcely a stem left in another hour and then why then they will have the naked wires of their cage all round them to protect them from the cat and for hunger there will be seed in the box  after all then what a little i have been able to do but i flatter myself that if they were mine i should do more i never keep captive birds but if they were given to me and i could not refuse i should do a great deal more for them all my knowledge of their ways and their requirements would teach me how to make their caged existence less unlike the old natural life than it now is to begin the ameliorating process i should place them in a large cage large enough to allow space for flight so that they might fly to and fro a few feet each way and rest their little feet from continual perching that would enable them to exercise their most important muscles and experience once more although in a very limited degree the old delicious sensation of gliding at will through the void air the wires of their new cage would be of brass or of some bright metal and the wooden parts and perches green enamelled or green variegated with brown and grey and the roof would be hung with glass lustres to quiver and sparkle into drops of violet red and yellow light gladdening these little lovers of bright colours for so we deem them i should also add gay flowers and berries crocus and buttercup and dandelion hips and haws and mountain ash and yellow and scarlet leavesall seasonable jewellery from woods and hedges and from the orchard and garden then would come the heaviest part of my task which would be to satisfy their continual craving for new tastes in food their delight in an endless variety i should go to the great seedmerchants of london and buy samples of all the cultivated seeds of the earth and not feed them in a trough or manger like heavy domestic brutes but give it to them mixed and scattered in small quantities to be searched for and gladly found in the sand and gravel and turf on the wide floor of the cage and higher up the wires of their dwelling would be hung with an endless variety of seeded grasses and sprays of all trees and plants good bad and indifferent for if the volatile bird dines on no more than twenty dishes every day he loves to taste of a hundred and to have at least a thousand on the table to choose from  feeding the birds and keeping the cage always sweet and clean would occupy most if not the whole of my time but would that be too much to give if it made me tranquil in my own mind for it must be noted that i have done all this mentally and on paper for my own satisfaction rather than that of the canaries birds are not worth muchto us are not five sparrows sold for three farthings i have even shot many birds and have felt no compunction true they perished before their time but they did not languish and being dead there was an end of them but the caged canaries continuing with us cannot be dismissed from the mind with the same convenient ease after all i begin to think that my imaginary reforms if carried out would not quite content me the compunctious visitings would continue still i look out of the window and see a sparrow on a neighbouring tree loudly chirruping and as i listen trying to find comfort by thinking of the perils which do environ him his careless unconventional sparrowmusic resolves itself into articulate speech interspersed with occasional bursts of derisive laughter he knows this fabulous sparrow what i have been thinking about and have written how would you like it i hear him saying o wise man that knows so much about the ways of birds if you were shut up in a big cagein windsor castle let us saywith scores of menials to wait on you and anticipate your every want that is i must explain every want compatible withahemthe captive condition would you be happy in your confinement practising with the dumbbells riding up and down the floors on a bicycle and gazing at pictures and filigree caskets and big malachite vases and eating dinners of many many courses or would you begin to wish that you might be allowed to live on sixpence a dayand earn it and even envy the ragged tramp who dines on a handful of halfrotten apples and sleeps in a haystack but is free to come and go and range the world at will you have been playing at nature but nature mocks you for your captives thank you not they would rather go to her without an intermediary and take a scantier measure of food from her hand but flavoured as she only can flavour it widen your cage naturalist replace the little twinkling lustres with sun and moon and milky way plant forests on the floor and let there be hills and valleys rivers and wide spaces and let the blue pillars of heaven be the wires of your cage with free entrance to wind and rain then your little captives will be happy even happy as i am in spite of all the perils which do environ meguns and cats and snares with wet and fog and hard frosts to come  and seeing my error i should open the cage and let them fly away even to death i should let them fly for there would be a taste of liberty first and life without that sweet savour whether of aerial bird or earthbound man is not worth living     chanticleer   during the month of september i spent several days at a house standing on high ground in one of the pleasantest suburbs of london commanding a fine view at the back of the breezy wooded and not very faroff surrey hills and all round from every window front and back such a mass of greenery met the eye almost concealing the neighbouring houses that i could easily imagine myself far out in the country in the garden the omnipresent sparrow and that always pleasant companion the starling associated with the thrush blackbird green linnet chaffinch redstart wren and two species of tits and better than all these not fewer than half a dozen robins warbled their autumn notes from early morning until late in the evening domestic birdlife was also represented by fifteen fowls and the wise laxity existing in the establishment made these also free of the grounds for of eyesores and painful skeletons in london cupboards one of the worst to my mind is that unwholesome coop at the back where a dozen unhappy birds are usually to be found immured for life these more fortunate had ample room to run about in and countless broad shady leaves from which to pick the green caterpillar and red tortoiseshaped ladybird and particoloured fly and soft warm soil in which to bathe in their own gallinaceous fashion and to lie with outstretched wings luxuriating by the hour in the genial sunshine and having seen their free wholesome life i did not regard the newlaid egg on the breakfasttable with a feeling of repugnance but ate it with a relish  i have said that the fowls numbered fifteen five were old birds and ten were chickens closely alike in size colour and general appearance they were not the true offspring of the hen that reared them but hatched from eggs bought from a local poultrybreeder as they advanced in age to their teens or the period in chickenlife corresponding to that in which in the human species boy and girl begin to diverge their tails grew long and they developed very fine red combs but the lady of the house who had been promised good layers when she bought the eggs clung tenaciously to the belief that long arching tails and stately crests were ornaments common to both sexes in this particular breed by and by they commenced to crow first one then two then all and stood confessed cockerels incidents like this which are of frequent occurrence serve to keep alive the exceedingly ancient notion that the sex of the future chick can be foretold from the shape of the egg as i had no personal interest in the question of the future eggsupply of the establishment i was not sorry to see the chickens develop into cocks what did interest me were their first attempts at crowingthose grating sounds which the young bird does not seem to emit but to wrench out with painful effort as a plant is wrenched out of the soil and not without bringing away portions of the lungs clinging to its roots the bird appears to know what is coming like an amateur dentist about to extract one of his own doublepronged teeth and setting his feet firmly on the ground and throwing himself well back before an imaginary lookingglass and with archedneck wideopen beak and rolling eyes courageously performs the horrible operation one cannot help thinking that a cockerel brought up without any companions of his own sex and age would not often crow but in this instance there were no fewer than ten of them to encourage each other in the laborious process of tuning thejr harsh throats heard subsequently in the quiet of the early morning these first tuning efforts suggested some reflections to my mind which may not prove entirely without interest to fanciers who aim at something beyond a mere increase in our foodsupply in their selecting and refining processes  to continue my narration i woke in the morning at my usual time between three and four oclock which is not my gettingup time for as a rule after half an hour or so i sleep again the waking is not voluntary as far as i know for although it may seem a contradiction in terms to speak of coming at will out of a state of unconsciousness we do in cases innumerable wake voluntarily or at the desired time not perhaps being altogether unconscious when sleeping if however this early waking were voluntary i should probably say that it was for the pleasure of listening to the crowing of the cocks at that silent hour when the night so near its end is darkest and the mysterious tide of life prescient of coming dawn has already turned and is sending the red current more and more swiftly through the sleepers veins i have spent many a night in the desert and when waking on the wide silent grassy plain the first whiteness in the eastern sky and the fluting call of the tinamou and the perfume of the wild evening primrose have seemed to me like a resurrection in which i had a part and something of this feeling is always associated in my mind with the first farheard notes of chanticleer  it was very dark and quiet when i woke my window was open with only a lace curtain before it to separate me from the open air presently the profound silence was broken from a distance of fifty or sixty yards away on the left hand came the crow of a cock soon answered by another further away on the same side and then further away still by a third other voices took up the challenge on the right some near some far until it seemed that there was scarcely a house in the neighbourhood at which chanticleer was not a dweller there was no other sound not for another hour would the sparrows burst out in a chorus of chirruping notes lengthened or shortened at will variously inflected and with a ringing musical sound in some of them which makes one wonder why this bird so high in the scale of nature has never acquired a set song for itself for there is music in him and when confined with a singing finch he will sometimes learn its song then the robins then the tits then the starlings gurgling jarring clicking whistling chattering then the pigeons cooing soothingly on the roof and windowledges taking flight from time to time with sudden sharp flap flap followed by a long silken sound made by the wings in gliding at four the cocks had it all to themselves and without counting the cockerels not yet out of school i could distinctly hear a dozen birds that is to say they were near enough for me to listen to their music critically the variety of sounds they emitted was very great and if cocks were selected for their vocal qualities would have shown an astonishing difference in the musical tastes of their owners a dozen dogs of as many different breeds ranging from the boarhound to the toy terrier would not have shown greater dissimilarity in their forms than did these cocks in their voices for the fowl like the dog has become an extremely variable creature in the domestic state in voice no less than in size form colour and other particulars at one end of the scale there was the raucous bronchial strain produced by the unwieldy cochin what a bird is that nature in obedience to mans behests and smiling with secret satire over her work has made it ponderous and ungraceful as any clumsy mammalian wombat ardvaark manatee or hippopotamus the burnished red hackles worn like a light mantle over the black doublet of the breast the metallic dark green sickleplumes arching over the tail all the beautiful lines and rich colouring have been absorbed into flesh and fat for gross feeders and with these have gone its liveliness and vigour its clarion voice and hostile spirit and brilliant courage it is gallus bankiva degenerate with dulled brains and blunted spurs and its hoarse crow is a barbarous chant  and far away at the other end startling in its suddenness and impetuosity was a trisyllabic crow so brief piercing and emphatic that it could only have proceeded from that peppery uppish little bird the bantam and of the three syllables the last which should be the longest was the shortest short and sharp like the shrill swallows cry or perhaps even more like the shrieky bark of an enraged little cur not a reveille and silvern morning song in one as a crow should be but a challenge and a defiance wounding the sense like a spur and suggesting the bustle and fury of the cockpit  if this style of crowing was known to milton it is perhaps accountable for the one bad couplet in the allegro    while the cock with lively din   scatters the rear of darkness thin  someone has said that every line in that incomparable poem brings at least one distinct picture vividly before the minds eye the picture the first line of the couplet i have quoted suggests to ray mind is not of crowing chanticleer at all but of a stalwart barearmed blowsyfaced woman vigorously beating on a tin pan with a stick but for what purposewhether to call down a passing swarm of bees or to summon the chickens to be fedi never know it is only my mental picture of a lively din as to the second line all attempts to see the thing described only bring before me clouds and shadows confusedly rushing about in an impossible way a chaos utterly unlike the serenity and imperceptible growth of morning and not a picture at all  by and by i found myself paying special attention to one cock about a hundred yards away or a little more perhaps for by contrast all the other songs within hearing seemed strangely inferior its voice was singularly clear and pure the last note greatly prolonged and with a slightly falling inflection yet not collapsing at the finish as such long notes frequently do ending with a little internal sound or croak as if the singer had exhausted his breath but it was perfect in its way a finished performance artistic and by comparison brilliant after once hearing this bird i paid little attention to the others but after each resounding call i counted the seconds until its repetition it was this birds note on this morning and not the others which seemed to bring round me that atmosphere of dreams and fancies i exist in at early cockcrowdreams and memories sweet or sorrowful of old scenes and faces and many eloquent passages in verse and prose written by men in other and better days who lived more with nature than we do now such a note as this was perhaps in thoreaus mind when he regretted that there were no cocks to cheer him in the solitude of walden i thought he says that it might be worth while keeping a cockerel for his music merely as a singing bird the note of this once wild indian pheasant is certainly the most remarkable of any birds and if they could be naturalized without being domesticated it would soon become the most famous sound in our woods    to walk in a winter morning in a wood where these birds abounded their native woods and hear the wild cockerels crow on the trees clear and shrill for miles over the surrounding countrythink of it it would put nations on the alert who would not be early to rise and rise earlier and earlier on each successive morning of his life till he became unspeakably healthy wealthy and wise  soon i fell into thinking of one in some ways greater than thoreau so unlike the skyeyminded new england prophet and solitary so much more genial and tolerant more mundane and lovable and yet like thoreau in his nearness to nature not only a lover of generous winesthat mark upon his lip is wineand books clothed in black and red all natural sights and sounds also filled his herte with pleasure and solass and the early crowing of the cock was a part of the minstrelsy he loved perhaps when lying awake during the dark quiet hours and listening to just such a note as this he conceived and composed that wonderful tale of the nuns priest in which the whole character of chanticleer his glory and his foibles together with the homely virtues of dame partlett are so admirably set forth  and longer ago it was perhaps such a note as this heard in imagination by the cockloving athenians which all at once made them feel so unutterably weary of endless fighting with the lacedaemonians and inspired their hearts with such a passionate desire for the long untasted sweets of security and repose is it one of my morning fancies merelyfor fact and fancy mingle strangely at this still mysterious hour and are scarcely distinguishableor is it related in history that this strange thing happened when all the people of the violetcrowned city were gathered to witness a solemn tragedy in which certain verses were spoken that had a strange meaning to their warweary souls those who sleep in the morning in the arms of peace do not start from them at the sound of the trumpet and nothing interrupts their slumbers but the peaceful crowing of the cock and at these words the whole concourse was electrified and rose up like one man and from thousands of lips went forth a great cry of peace peace let us make peace with sparta  hark once more that long clarion call it is the last timethe very last for all the others have sung a dozen times apiece and have gone to sleep again so would this one have done but cocks like minstrels among men are vain creatures and some kind officious fairy whispered in his ear that there was an appreciative listener hard by and so to please me he sang just one stave more  lying and listening in the dark it seemed to me that there were two opposite qualities commingled in the sound with an effect analogous to that of shadow mingling with and chastening light at eventide first it was strong and clear full of assurance and freedom qualities admirably suited to the song of a bird of chanticleers disposition a lusty ringing strain not sung in the clouds or from a lofty perch midway between earth and heaven but with feet firmly planted on the soil and earthly and compared with the notes of the grove like a versified utterance of walt whitman compared with the poems of the true inspired children of songblake shelley poe earthly but not hostile and eager on the contrary leisurely peaceful even dreamy with a touch of tenderness which brings it into relationship with the more aerial tones of the true singers and this is the second quality i spoke of which gave a charm to this note and made it seem better than the others this is partly the effect of distance which clarifies and softens sound just as distance gives indistinctness of outline and ethereal blueness to things that meet the sight to objects beautiful in themselves in graceful lines and harmonious proportions and colouring the haziness imparts an additional grace but it does not make beautiful the objects which are ugly in themselves as for instance an ugly square house so in the etherealizing effect of distance on sound when so loud a sound as the crowing of a stronglunged cock becomes dreamy and tender at a distance of one hundred yards there must be good musical elements in it to begin with  i do not remark this dreaminess in the notes of other birds some crowing at an equal distance others still further away all natural music is heard best at a distance like the chiming of bells and the music of the flute and the wild confused strains of the bagpipes for among artificial sounds these come the nearest to those made by nature  the shrill sharps of the thrush must be softened by distance to charm and the skylark when close at hand has both shrill and harsh sounds scarcely pleasing he must mount high before you can appreciate his merit i do not recommend any one to keep a caged cock in his study for the sake of its music crow it never so well  to return to the ten cockerels they did not crow very much and at first i paid little attention to them after a few days i remarked that one individual among them was rapidly acquiring the clear vigorous strain of the adult bird compared with that fine note which i have described it was still weak and shaky but in shape it was similar and the change had come while its brethren were still uttering brief and harsh screeches as at the beginning probably where there is a great mixture of varieties it is the same with the fowl as with man in the diversity of the young different ancestral characters appearing in different members of the same family this cockerel was apparently the musical member and promised in a short time to rival his neighbour having heard that it was intended to keep one of the cockerels to be the parent of future broods i began to wonder whether the prize in the lotteryto wit life and a modest haremwould fall to this fine singer or not the odds were that his musical career would be cut short by an early death since the ten birds were very much alike in other respects and i felt perfectly sure that his superior note would weigh nothing in the balance for when has the character of the voice influenced a fancier in selecting never i believe odd as it seems i have read a very big book on the various breeds of the fowl but the crowing of the cock was not mentioned in it  this would not seem so strange if fanciers had invariably looked solely to utility and their highest ambition had ended at size weight and quality of flesh early maturity hardihood and the greatest number of eggs this has not been the case they possess like others the love of the beautiful artificial as their standards sometimes appear and there are breeds in which beauty seems to have been the principal object as for instance in several of the gold and silver spangled and pencilled varieties but besides beauty of plumage there are other things in the fowl worthy of being improved by selection one of these has been cultivated by man for thousands of years namely the combative spirit and splendid courage of the male bird but there is a spirit abroad now which condemns cockfighting and to continue selecting and breeding cocks solely for their gamepoints seems a mere futility the energy and enthusiasm expended in this direction would be much better employed in improving the birds vocal powers  the morning song of the cock is a sound unique in nature and of all natural sounds it is the most universal all climates agree with brave chanticleer he is more indigenous even than the natives his health is ever good his lungs are sound his spirits never flag he is a pet bird among tribes that have never seen the peacock goose and turkey in tropical countries where the dog becomes dumb or degenerates into a mere growler his trumpet never rusts it is true that he was cradled in the torrid zone yet in all western lands where he shakes off the powdery snow with vigorous wings his voice sounds as loud and inspiriting as in the hot jungle palefaced londoners and blacks and bronzed or painted barbarians all men all the world over wake at morn to the peaceful crowing of the cock just as the athenians woke of old and the nations older still it is not therefore strange that this song has more associations for man than any other sound in nature but apart from any adventitious claims to our attention the sound possesses intrinsic merits and pleases for its own sake in our other domestic birds we have with regard to this point been unfortunate we have the gobbling of turkeys and the hoarse monotonous come back of the guineafowl screaming of peacocks and geese and quacking hissing and rasping of mallard and muscovy above all these sounds the ringing lusty triumphant call of chanticleer as the farreaching toll of the bellbird sounds above the screaming and chattering of parrots and toucans in the brazilian forest a fine sound which in spite of many changes of climate and long centuries of domestication still preserves that forestborn character of wildness which gives so great a charm to the language of many woodland gallinaceous birds as we have seen it is variable and in some artificial varieties has been suffered to degenerate into sounds harsh and disagreeable yet it is plain that an improved voice in a beautiful breed would double the birds value from an aesthetic point of view as things now are the fine voices are in a very small minority some bad voices in artificial breeds ie those which like the brahma and cochin diverge most widely from the original typeare perhaps incurable like the carrion crows voice for that bird will probably always caw harshly in spite of the musical throat which anatomists find in it we can only listen to our birds and begin experimenting with those already possessed of shapely notes and voices of good quality  i am not going to be so illmannered as to conclude without an apology to those among us who under no circumstances can tolerate the crowing of the cock it is true that i have not been altogether unmindful of their prepossessions and have freely acknowledged in divers places that chanticleer does not always please and that there is abundant room for improvement but if they go further than that if for them there exists not on this round globe a cock whose voice would fail to irritate then i have not shown consideration enough and something is still owing to their feelings which are very acute it is possible that one of these sensitive persons may take up my book and attracted by its title dip into this paper hoping to find in it a practical suggestion for the effectual muzzling of the obnoxious bird the only improvement which would fall in with such a ones ideas on the subject of cockcrowing would be to improve this kind of natural music out of existence naturally the paper would disappoint him he would be grieved at the writers erroneous views i hope that his feelings would take no acuter form i have listened to a person usually mildmannered denouncing a neighbour in the most unmeasured terms for the crime of keeping a crowing cock if the cock had been a noncrower a silent member it would have been different he would hardly have known that he had a neighbour there is a very serious even a sad side to this question mr sully maintains that as civilization progresses and as we grow more intellectual all noise which is pleasing to children and savages and only exhilarates their coarse and juvenile brains becomes increasingly intolerable to us what unfortunate creatures we then are we have got our pretty rattle and are now afraid that the noise it makes is going to be the death of us but what is noise will any two highly intellectual beings agree as to the particular sound which produces the effect of rusty nails thrust in among the convolutions of the brain physicians are continually discovering new forms of nervous maladies caused by the perpetual hurry and worry and excitement of our modern life and perhaps there is one form in which natural sounds which being natural should be agreeable or at any rate innocent become more and more abhorrent this is a question which concerns the medical journals also to some extent those who labour to forecast the future happily all our maladies are thrown off sooner or later if they do not kill us and we can cheerfully look forward to a time when the delicate chords in us shall no longer be made to vibrate like sweet bells jangled out of tune and harsh to any sound in nature and when the peaceful crowing of the cock shall cease to madden the early waker for whatever may be the fate awaiting our city civilization brave chanticleer improved as to his voice or not will undoubtedly still be with us     in an old garden   a sunny morning in junea golden day among days that have mostly a neutral tint a large garden with no visible houses beyond but green fields and unkept hedges and great silent trees oak and ash and elmcould i wish just now for a more congenial restingplace or even imagine one that comes nearer to my conception of an earthly paradise it is true that once i could not drink deeply enough from the sweet and bitter cup of wild nature and loved nature best and sought it gladly where it was most savage and solitary but that was long ago now after years of london life during which i have laboured like many another to get a wan pale face with perhaps a wan pale mind to match that past wildness would prove too potent and sharp a tonic unadulterated nature would startle and oppress me with its rude desolate aspect no longer familiar this softness of a wellcultivated earth and unbroken verdure of foliage in many shades and harmonious grouping and blending of floral hues best suit my present enervated condition i had i imagine a swarter skin and firmer flesh when i could ride all day over great summerparched plains where there was not a bush that would have afforded shelter to a mannikin and think that i was having a pleasant journey the cloudless sky and vertical sunhow intolerable they would now seem and scorch my brain and fill my shut eyes with dancing flames at present even this mild june sun is strong enough to make the old mulberry tree on the lawn appear grateful it is an ancient roughbarked tree with wide branches that droop downwards all round and rest their terminal leaves on the sward underneath it is a natural tent or pavilion with plenty of space to move about and sling a hammock in here then i have elected to spend the hottest hours of my one golden day reading dreaming listening at intervals to the fine birdsounds that have a medicinal and restorative effect on the jarred and wounded sense  from the elms hard by comes a subdued airy prattle of a few sparrows it is rather pleasant something like a low accompaniment to the notes of the more tuneful birds the murmurous music of a manystringed instrument forming the indistinct ground over which runs the bright embroidery of clear melodious singing  this morning while lying awake from four to five oclock i almost hated the sparrows they were there in such multitudes and so loud and persistent sounded their jangling through the open window it set me thinking of the england of the futureof a time a hundred years hence let us saywhen there will remain with us only two representatives of feral lifethe sparrow and the housefly doubtless it will come unless something happens but doubtless it will not continue it will still be necessary for a man to kill something in order to be happy and the sportsmen of that time like great gambetta in the past will sit in the balconies popping with pearifles at the sparrows until not one is left to twitter then will come the turn of the untamed and untamable fly and he will afford good sport if hunted a la domitain with fine needletipped paper javelins thrown to impale him on the wall  one of our savants has lately prophesied that the time will come when only the microscopic organisms will exist to satisfy the hunting instinct in man how these small creatures will be taken he does not tell us perhaps the hunters will station themselves round a table with a drop of preserved water on its centre made large and luminous by means of a ray of magnifying light when that time comes the amoebathat wandering jew as an irreverent quarterly reviewer has called itwill lose its immortality and the spry rotifer will fall a victim to the infinitesimal fine bright arrows of the chase a strange quarry for men whose paeliolithic progenitors hunted the woolly mastodon and manyhorned rhinoceros and sabretoothed tiger  that sad day of very small things for the sportsman is however not near nor within measurable distance or so it seemed to me when an hour ago i strolled round the garden curiously peering into every shrub to find the visible and comparatively noble insectlife in great abundance beetles were therehard round polished and of various colours like seaworn pebbles on the beach and some called ladybirds in the vernacular were bound like the books that chaucer loved in black and red and the small gilded fly not less an insect lightheaded a votary of vain delights than in the prehistoric days when a whiteheaded old king discrowned and crazed railed against sweet natures liberty and ever waiting to welcome this inconstant lover with falces there sits the solitary geometric spider an image and embodiment of patience not on a monument but a suspended wheel of which he is himself the hub and so delicately fashioned are the silver spokes thereof radiating from his round and gemlike body and the rings concentric tire within tire that its exceeding fineness like swift revolving motion renders it almost invisible caterpillars too in great plentyminiature porcupines with fretful quills on end and some naked even as they came into the world this one called the earthmeasurer has drunk himself green with chlorophyll so as to escape detection vain precaution since eccentric motion betrays him to keen avian eyes when like the travellers snake he erects himself on the tip of his tail and sways about in empty space vaguely feeling for something he knows not what and the mechanical tortrix that rolls up a leaf for garment and food and preys on his own case and shelter until he has literally eaten himself stark naked after which he rolls up a second leaf and so on progressively thus in his larval life does he symbolize some restless nation that makes itself many successive constitutions and forms of government in none of which it abides long but afterwards some higher thing when he rests motionless in form like a sarcophagus whence the infolded life emerges to haunt the twilighta grey ghost moth there is no end to rolledup leaves and to the variety of creatures that are housed in them for just as the insect tribes of human kind in all places and in all ages while seeking to improve their condition independently hit on the same means and inventions so it is with these small sixlegged people and many species in many places have found out the comfort and security of the green cylinder  so many did i open that i at last grew tired of the process like a man to whom the post has brought too many letters but there was onethe last i openedthe living active contents of which served to remind me that some insects are unable to make a cylinder for themselves having neither gum nor web to fasten it with and yet they will always find one made by others to shelter themselves in here were no fewer than six unbeautiful creatures brothers and sisters hatched from eggs on which their parent earwig sat incubating just like an eagle or dove or swallow or better still like a pelican for in the end did she not give of her own lifefluid to nourish her children unbeautiful yet not without a glory superior to that of the purple emperor and the angelic blue morpho and the broadwinged ornithoptera that caused an illustrious traveller to swoon with joy at the sight of its supreme loveliness du maurier has a drawing of a little girl in a garden gazing at two earwigs racing along a stem i suppose she remarks interrogatively to her mamma that these are mr and mrs earwig and on being answered affirmatively exclaims what could they have seen in each other what they saw was blue blood or something in insectology corresponding to it the earwigs lustre is that of antiquity he existed on earth before colour came in and colour is old although not so old as natures unconscious aestheticism which in the organic world is first expressed in beauty of form it is long since the great may flies large as swifts had their aerial cloudy dances over the vast everglades and ancient forests of ferns and when on some dark night a brilliant willothewisp rose and floated above the feathery foliage drawn in myriads to its light they revolved about it in an immense mystical wheel mistywhite glistening and touched with prismatic colour floating fire and wheel were visible only to the stars and the wakeful eyes of giant scaly monsters lying quiescent in the black waters below but they were very beautiful nevertheless the modest earwig was old on the earth even then he dates back to the time immeasurably remote when scorpions possessed the earth and taught him to frighten his enemies with a stingless tailthat curious antique little tail which has not yet forgot its cunning  greater than all these inhabitants of the garden ancient or modern by reason of their numbers which is the sign of predominance are the small wingless people that have colonies on every green stem and under every green leaf  these are the true generators of that heavenly sweat or saliva of the stars concerning which pliny the younger wrote so learnedly and they are many tribesgreen purple brown isabelline but all are one nation and sacred to that fair god whom the carian waternymph loved not wisely but too well for albeit the children of an ancient union they marry not nor are given in marriage yet withal multiply exceedingly so that one not two may in a single season produce a billion and at last when autumn comes won back from the cold god to his hot mother they know love and wedlock and die like all married things these are the aphidessometimes unprettily called plantlice and vaguely spoken of by the uninformed as blightand they nourish themselves on vegetable juices that thin green blood which is the plants life  this then is the fruit which the birds have come to gather in june is their richest harvest it is more bountiful than september when apples redden and grapes in distant southern lands are gathered for the winepress in yon grey wall at the end of the lawn just above the climbing rosebush there are now seven hungry infants in one small cradle each one some one says able to consume its own weight of insect food every day i am inclined to believe that it must be so while trying to count the visits paid to the nest in one hour by the parent titsthose small tits that do the gardener so much harm we know on good authority that the spider has a nutty flavour and most insects in the larval stage afford succulent and toothsome or at all events beaksome morsels these are just now the crimson cherries purple and yellow plums currants red white and blackand sunpainted peaches asking in their luscious ripeness for a mouth to melt in that fascinate finch and flycatcher alike and make the starlings smack their horny lips with a sound like a loving kiss  not that i care or esteem birds for what they eat or do not eat with all these creatures that are at strife among themselves and that birds prey upon i am at peace even to the smallest that are visiblethe red spider which is no spider and the minute gossamer spider clinging to the fine silvery hairs of the flying summer and the coccus that fall from the fruit trees to float on their buoyant cottony downa summer snow fils de la vierge are these and sacred the man who can needlessly set his foot on a worm is as strange to my soul as de quinceys imaginary malay or even his damned crocodile the worm that one sees lying bruised and incapable on the gravel walk has fallen among thieves these little lives do me good and not harm i smell the acid ants to strengthen my memory i know that if i set an overturned cockchafer on his legs three sins shall be forgiven me that if i am kindly tolerant of the spider that drops accidentally on my hand or face my purse shall be mysteriously replenished at the same time one has to remember that such sentiments as a rule are not understood by those who have charge over groves and gardens whose minds are ignorant and earthy or as they would say practical of the balance of nature they know and care naught nor can they regard life as sacred it is enough to know that it is or may be injurious to their interests for them to sweep it away the small thing that has been flying about and uttering musical sounds since april may when july comes devour a certain number of cherries nor is even this plea needed if it is innocent for the lower creatures to prey upon one another it cannot be less innocent for man to destroy them indiscriminately if it gives him any pleasure to do so it is idle to go into such subtle questions with those who have the power to destroy if their hands are to be restrained it is not by appealing to feelings which they do not possess but to their lower naturesto their greed and their cunning for the rest of us for all who have conquered or outgrown the killing instinct the impartiality that pets nothing and persecutes nothing is doubtless mans proper attitude towards the inferior animals a godlike benevolent neutrality a keen and kindly interest in every form of life with indifference as to its ultimate destiny the softness which does no wrong with the hardness that sees no wrong done  to return to the birds the starlings have kissed like lovers and fluttered up vertically on their short wings trying to stream like eagles only to return to the trees once more and sit there chattering pleasant nothings at intervals throwing out those soft round modulated whistled notes just as an idle cigarettesmoker blows rings of blue smoke from his lips and now they have flown away to the fields so that i can listen to the others  a thrush is making music on a tall tree beyond the garden hedge and i am more grateful for the distance that divides us than for the song for just now he does not sing so well as sometimes of an evening when he is most fluent and a listener deceived by his sweetness and melody writes to the papers to say that he has heard the nightingale just now his song is scrappy composed of phrases that follow no order and do not fit or harmonize and is like a poor imitation of an inferior mockingbirds song  between the scraps of loud thrushmusic i listen to catch the thin somewhat reedy sound of a yellowhammer singing in the middle of the adjoining grassy field it comes well from the open expanse of purpling grass and reminds me of a favourite grasshopper in a distant sunny land o happy grasshopper singing all day in the trees and tall herbage in a country where every village urchin is not sent afield to study natural history with green net and a good store of pins shall i ever again hear thy breezy music and see thee among the green leaves beautiful with steelblue and creamywhite body and dim purple over and vivid red underwings  the bird of the pastureland is singing still perhaps but all at once i have ceased to hear him for something has come to lift me above his low grassy level something faint and at first only the suspicion of a sound then a silvery lisping far off and aerial touching the sense as lightly as the windborne down of dandelion  if any place for any soul there be disrobed and disentrammelled doubtless it is from such a place and such a soul that this sublimated music falls the singer one can imagine has never known or has forgotten earth and if it is visible to him how small it must seem from that altitude spinning like a fretful midge beneath him in the vast void  it is the lark singing in the blue infinite heaven at this distance with something ethereal and heavenly in his voice but now the wide circling wings that brought him for a few moments within hearing have borne him beyond it again and missing it the sunshine looks less brilliant than before and all other birdvoices seem by comparison dull and of the earth  certainly there is nothing spiritual in the song of the chaffinch there he sits within sight motionless a little birdshaped automaton made to go off at intervals of twelve or thirteen seconds but unfortunately one hears with the song the whirr and buzz of the internal machinery it is not now as in april when it is sufficient in a song that it shall be joyous in the leafy month when roses are in bloom one grows critical and asks for sweetness and expression and a better art than this vigorous garden singer displays in that little double flourish with which he concludes his little hurryscurry lyric he has practised that same flourish for five thousand yearsto be quite within the markand it is still far from perfect still little better than a kind of musical sneeze so long is art  perhaps in some subtle way beyond the psychologists power to trace he has become aware of my opinion of his performancethe unspoken detraction which yet affects its object and feeling hurt in his fringilline amour propre he has all at once taken himself off never mind a better singer has succeeded him i have heard and seen the little wren a dozen times today now he has come to the upper part of the tree i am lying under and although so near his voice sounds scarcely louder than before this is also a lyric but of another kind it is not plaintive nor passionate nor is it so spontaneous as the warbling of the robinthat most perfect feathered impressionist nor is it endeared to me by early associations since i listened in boyhood to the songs of other wrens in what then does its charm consist i do not know certainly it is delicate and may even be described as brilliant in its limited way perfect and to other greater songs like the small pimpernel to a poppy or a hollyhock unambitious yet finished it has the charm of distinction the wren is the least selfconscious of our singers somewhere among the higher green translucent leaves the little brown barred thing is quietly sitting busy for the nonce about nothing dreaming his summer dream and unknowingly telling it aloud when shall we have symbols to express as perfectly our summerfeelingour dream  that small song has served to remind me of two small books i brought into the garden to readthe works of two modern minor poets whose wrenlike warblings i imagined would suit my mood and the genial morning better than the stirring or subtle thoughts of greater singers possibly in that i was mistaken for there until now lie the books neglected on a lawn chair within reach of my hand the chair was dragged hither halfanhour ago by a maiden all in white who appeared half inclined to share the mulberry shade with me she did not continue long in that mind in a lively manner she began speaking of some trivial thing but after a very few moments all interest in the subject evaporated and she sat humming some idle air tapping the turf with her fantastic shoe presently she picked up one of my books opened it at random and read a line or two her vermilion underlip curling slightly then threw it down again and glanced at me out of the corners of her eyes then hummed again and finally became silent and sat bending forward a little her dark lustrous eyes gazing with strange intentness through the slight screen of foliage into the vacant space beyond what to see the poet has omitted to tell us to what the maidens fancy lightly turns in spring doubtless it turns to thoughts of something real life is real so is passionthe quickening of the blood the wild pulsation but the pleasures and pains of the printed book are not real and are to reality like japanese flowers made of coloured bits of tissue paper to the living fragrant flowers that bloom today and perish tomorrow they are a simulacrum a mockery and present to us a pale phantasmagoric world peopled with bloodless men and women that chatter meaningless things and laugh without joy the feeling of unreality affects us all at times but in very different degrees and perhaps i was too long a doer herding too much with narrow foreheads drinking too deeply of the sweet and bitter cup to experience that pure unfailing delight in literature which some have  its charm i fancy is greatest to those in whom the natural man deprived in early life of his proper aliment grows sickly and pale and perishes at last of inanition there is ample room then for the latter higher growththe unnatural cultivated man lovers of literature are accustomed to say that they find certain works helpful to them and doubtless being all intellect they are right but we the less highly developed are compounded of two natures and while this spiritual pabulum sustains one the other and larger nature is starved for the larger nature is earthly and draws its sustenance from the earth i must look at a leaf or smell the sod or touch a rough pebble or hear some natural sound if only the chirp of a cricket or feel the sun or wind or rain on my face the book itself may spoil the pleasure it was designed to give me and instead of satisfying my hunger increase it until the craving and sensation of emptiness becomes intolerable not any day spent in a library would i live again but rather some lurid day of labour and anxiety of strife or peril or passion  occupied with this profound question i scarcely noticed when my shadesharer with whom i sympathised only too keenly in her restless mood rose and lifting the light green curtain passed out into the sunshine and was gone nor did i notice when the little wren ceased singing overhead at length recalled to myself i began to wonder at the unusual silence in the garden until casting my eyes on the lawn i discovered the reason for there moving about in their various ways most of the birds were collected in a loose miscellaneous flock a kind of happy family there were the starlings returned from the fields and looking like little speckled rooks some sparrows and a couple of robins hopping about in their wild startled manner in strange contrast to these last appeared that little feathered clodhopper the chaffinch plodding over the turf as if he had hobnailed boots on his feet last but not least came statuesque blackbirds and thrushes moving when they moved like automata they all appear to be finding something to eat but i watch the thrushes principally for these are more at home on the moist earth than the others and have keener senses and seek for nobler game i see one suddenly thrust his beak into the turf and draw from it a huge earthworm a wriggling serpent so long that although he holds his head high a third of the pink cylindrical body still rests in its run what will he do with it we know how wandering waterton treated the boa which he courageously grasped by the tail as it retreated into the bushes naturally it turned on him and lifting high its head came swiftly towards his face with wideopen jaws and at this supreme moment without releasing his hold on its tail with his free hand he snatched off his large felt hat and thrust it down the monsters throat and so saved himself  just as i am intently watching to see how my hatless little waterton will deal with his serpent a startling bark following by a canine shriek then a yell resound through the silent garden and over the lawn rush those three demoniacal foxterriers snap puzzy and babs all determined to catch something away fly the birds and though now high overhead the baffled brutes continue wildly careering about the grounds vexing the air with their frantic barkings no more birds today but now the peacebreakers have discovered me and come tearing across the lawn and on to the halfway chair then to the hammock scrambling over each other to inflict their unwelcome caresses on my hands and face  ah well let them have their way and do their worst since the birds are gone and i shall go soon it is a consolation to think that they are not my pets that i shall not grieve like their mistress when their brief barking period is over that i care just so much and no more for them than for any other living creature not excepting the ferdelance quoiled in the path like rope in a ship or the broadwinged vulture scaling the heavens by invisible stairs none are out of place where nature placed them nor unbeautiful none are unlovable since their various qualitiesthe rage of the one and the gentleness of the otherare but harmonious lights and shades in the everchanging living picture that is so perfect     birds in a cornish village  i  taking stock of the birds   having begun or first written this book in one village which was near london i am now finishing or rewriting it in another in the westest part of all the land over three hundred miles from the first here i had to go over this ancient work of twentythree years ago which was also my first english bird book to prepare it for a new edition and after all necessary corrections omissions and additions of fresh matter made in the foregoing parts it seemed best to throw out the whole of the concluding portion which dealt mainly with the question of birdpreservation as it presented itself at that time and is now out of date thanks to the legislation of recent years and to the growth in this country of the feeling or desire for birds during the last two or three decades in place of this discarded matter i propose to give here the results of recent observations on the bird life of a cornish village  my residence in the cornish village or villages was during may and june 1915 and again from october of the same year to june 1916 these were months of illhealth so that i was prevented from pursuing my customary outdoor rambling life but like that poor creature the barnyard fowl that cant use its wings instinctively or from old habit i used my eyes in keeping a watch on the feathered and flying people about me  the village lelant is on the hayle estuary and to see the atlantic one has but to walk past the grey old church at the end of the street where the ground rises to find oneself in a wilderness of towans as the sandhills are there called clothed in their rough greygreen marram grass and spreading on either hand round the bay of st ives a beautiful sight for the sea on a sunny day is of that marvellous blue colour seen only in cornwall far out on a rock on the right hand stands the shining white godrevy lighthouse and on the left on the opposite side of the bay the little ancient fishingtown of st ives  the river or estuary in sight of the doors and windows of the village was haunted every day by numbers of gulls and curlews these last numbered about one hundred and fifty birds and were always there except at full tide when they would fly away to the fields and moors of all my bird neighbours i think that these gave me most pleasure especially at night when lying awake i would listen by the hour to the perpetual curlew conversation going on in the darkan endless series of clear modulated notes and trills with a beautiful expression of wildness and freedom a reminder of lonely seashores and mountains and moorlands in the north country what wonder that stevenson sick in his tropical islandsick for his cold grey home so many thousands of miles away wished once more to hear the whaup crying over the graves of his forefathers and to hear no more at all  of bird music by day there was little you would hear more of it in one morning in that small rustic village in berkshire where the first part of this book was written than in a whole summer in one of these west cornwall villages so few comparatively are the songsters nor was this scarcity in the village only it was everywhere as i found when able to get out for a few hours during my two spring seasons in the place close by were the extensive woods of trevalloe where i was struck by the extraordinary silence and where i listened in vain for a single note from blackcap gardenwarbler willowwren woodwren or redstart the thrushes chaffinch chiffchaff and greenfinch were occasionally heard outside the wood the buntings chats and the skylark were few and far between  this scarcity of small birds is i think due in the first place to the extraordinary abundance of the jackdaw the diligent seeker after small birds nests and to the autumn and winter pastime of bushbeating to which men and boys are given in these parts and which the cornish authorities refuse to suppress  after a time when owing to increasing debility i was confined more and more to the village i began to concentrate my attention on a few common species that were always present particularly on the three commonestrook daw and starling the first two residents the starling a winter visitor from september to april  in october i started feeding the birds at the house where i was staying as a guest throwing the scraps on a lawn at the back which sloped down towards the estuary first came all the small birds in the immediate neighbourhoodrobin dunnock wagtail chaffinch throstle blackbird and blue and oxeye tits then followed troops of starlings and soon all the rooks and daws in the village began to see what was going on and come too and this attracted the gulls from the estuaryi wished that it had drawn the curlews and all these big ones were so greedy and bold so noisy and formidablelooking that the small birds were quite driven out all except the starlings that came in hungry crowds and were determined to get their share  at the beginning of december i had to move to a nursinghome at the convent of the sisters of the cross at the adjacent village of hayle just across the estuary the convent buildings and grounds and gardens are fortunately outside the ugly village and my room had an exceptionally big window occupying almost the whole wall on one side with an outlook to the south over the green fields and moors towards helston an ideal sickroom for a man who cant be happy without the company of birds and here even when lying on my bed before i was able to sit or stand by the window a large portion of the sky rainy or blue was visible and rooks and daws and gulls and troops of starlings and the curlews from the river were seen coming and going all day long  but it was much better when i was able to go to the window since now by feeding them i could draw the birds to me i fed them on a green field beneath my window where the convent milchcows were accustomed to graze for some hours each day all through the winter there was grass for them and i was glad to have them there as the cow is my favourite beast and it was also pleasant to see the wintering starlings consorting with them clustering about their noses just as they do in the pasture lands in summer time but i found it best to feed the birds when the cows were not there on account of the behaviour of one of them a young animal who had not yet been sobered by having a calf of her own  she was a frivolous young thing and when tired of feeding she would start teasing the old cows pushing them with her horns then flinging up her hind legs to challenge them to a romp the sight of a crowd of birds under my window would bring her at a gallop to the spot to find out what all the fuss was about and the birds would be driven off  one morning i was at my window when the field was empty of bird and beast life with the exception of a solitary old rook a big bird who was a constant attendant and so much bigger than most of the rooks that i had come to know it well by and by the young cow walked into the field by herself and after gazing all round as if surprised at finding the place so lifeless she caught sight of and fixed her eyes on the old rook working at the turf some fifty or sixty yards away presently she began walking towards it and when within about twenty yards put her head down and charged it the rook paid no attention until she was almost on it then rose up emitting its angriest most raucous screams while hovering just over her head and having thus relieved its indignant feelings it flew heavily away to the far end of the field and settling down began prodding away at the soil the cow standing still gazed after it and one could almost imagine her saying so you wont get out of the field well  ill soon make you im going to have it all to myself this morning and at once she began rapidly walking towards the bird but halfway to it was the post set up in the middle of the field for the cows to rub their hides and on coming abreast of it the sight of it and its proximity suggested the delight of a rub and turning off at right angles she walked straight to the post and began rubbing herself against it the rook went on with its business and after that there was no more quarrelling  another morning this same old rook came with his mate to the field separating they came down a distance of a hundred yards or more apart and began searching for grubs by and by the old cock discovered something particularly good and after vigorously prodding the turf for a few moments he sprang up and flew excitedly to his mate who instantly knew what this action meant and began fluttering her wings and crying for the dainty morsel which he proceeded to deliver into her wideopen mouth having fed her he flew back to the same spot and began working again  this is a common action of the rooks and i saw this same bird feed his mate on other occasions during the winter months when i have no doubt that he poor wretch could hardly find food enough to keep himself alive during the dark season of everlasting wind and rain when the dim daylight lasted for about six hours but i never saw a daw or starling feed his mate or feed another daw or starling although i watched closely every day and often for an hour at a stretch and though i am convinced that the starling like the rook and crow and daw and in fact all the corvidae pairs for life to this point i will return presently let me first relate another incident about our frivolous and irresponsible young cow  one morning when the cows were in the field some herringgulls drifted by and a few of them remained circling about above the field i threw out a piece of bread and a troop of starlings rushed to it and one of the gulls dropped down and took possession of it but had scarcely began tearing at it when two more gulls dropped down and the first bird lifting his wings began screaming hands off at the others and the others also raising their wings screamed their wailing screams in reply the young cow attracted by the noise gazed at them for a few moments then all at once putting her head down furiously charged them the three gulls rose up simultaneously and floated over her and then away leaving her standing on the spot shaking her head in anger and disgust at their escape a rhinoceros charging a ball of thistledown or a soapbubble and causing it to float away with the wind it created would not have been a more iudicrous spectacle     ii  do starlings pair for life   from my boyhood when i first began to observe birds i started with the imbibed notion that those which paired for life were the rare exceptionsthe dove that rhymed with love the eagle and perhaps half a dozen more who for instance would imagine that the sexes could be faithful in parasitical species like the cuckoo of europe and the cowbirds of america yet even as a boy i made the discovery that an argentine cowbird that lays its eggs in the nests of other species does actually pair for life and so effectually mated is it that on no day and no season of the year will you see a male without his female if he flies she flies with him and feeds and drinks with him and when he perches she perches at his side and he never utters a sound but a responsive sound immediately falls from her devoted beak  again it may seem unlikely that there can be pairing for life in species like the chaffinch of northern europe and with us of scotland in which the sexes separate and migrate separately also of nongregarious species like the nightingale in which the males arrive in this country several days before the females yet i am confident that if we could catch and mark a considerable number of pairs it would be found that the same male and female found one another and remated every year  it comes to this that birds may pair for life yet not be all the time or all the year together as in the case of hawks crows owls herons and many others in numberless species which undoubtedly pair for life the sexes keep apart during several hours each day and there is some evidence that those that separate for a part of the year remain faithful  an incident related by miss ethel williams of winchester in her natural history notes contributed to a journal in that city bears on this point she had among the bird pensioners in the garden of her house adjoining the cathedral green a female thrush that grew tame enough to fly into the house and feed on the diningroom table her thrush paired and bred for several seasons in the garden and the young too were tame and would follow their mother into the house to be fed the male was wild and too shy ever to venture in she noticed the first year that it had a wingfeather which stuck out owing probably to a malformation of the socket each year after the breeding season the male vanished the female remaining alone through the winter months but in spring the male came backthe same bird with the unmistakable projecting wingfeather yet it was certain that this bird had gone quite away otherwise he would have returned to the garden where there was food in abundance during the spells of frosty weather as he did not appear it is probable that he migrated each autumn to some warmer climate beyond the sea  i have noticed that wagtails thrushes blackbirds and some other species when the young are out of the nest divide the brood between male and female and go different ways and spend the daylight hours at a distance apart each attending to the one or two young birds in its charge  one winter a few years ago i was staying for a few days at a cottage facing silchester common and on going out after breakfast to feed the birds i particularly noticed a male grey wagtail among those that came to me on account of its beauty and tameness every morning i fed it and on my speaking to my landlady about it she said oh we know that bird well this is the fourth winter it has spent with us but it always came before with its mate the poor little thing had only one leg but managed to hop about and feed very well this year the poor thing didnt turn up with its mate so we suppose it had met its death somewhere during the summer  i have often watched the gatherings of pied wagtails always with a certain number of the grey species among them in places where they spend the winter in our southern counties at some spot where they are accustomed to congregate each evening to hold a sort of frolic before going to roost and it has always appeared to me that the birds both pied and grey were in pairs so too in watching the starlings day after day in the field in front of my window well able with my binocular to observe them closely i saw much to convince me that the starling too lives all the year with his mate  each morning the birds that had made our village their daily feedingground would on arrival from the roostingplace in one body break up into numerous small parties of half a dozen to twenty or more birds all day long these little flocks were hurrying about from field to field spending but a short time at one spot so hungry were they and anxious to find a more productive one and in every field they would meet and mix with other small groups and presently all would fly and breaking up into small parties again go off in different directions thus one had a constant succession of little flocks in the field from morning till night and i found from counting the birds in each small group that in three cases in four they were in even numbers again i have often seen a group of three five seven or nine birds on the field and after a while a solitary starling from a neighbouring field or from some treetop near by has flown down to join the group and make the numbers even  the birds when feeding i have said are always in a desperate hurry and little wonder since after a night usually wet and cold of from sixteen to eighteen hours and only about six to feed in they must be in a halfstarved state and frantic to find something to swallow no sooner do they alight than they begin running about prodding with their beaks and all the time advancing the birds keeping pretty well abreast now from time to time you will notice that a bird finds something to delay him and is left behind by the others on they goprod prod then a little run then prod prod again and run againwhile he excited over his find and vigorously digging at the roots of the grass lets them go on without him until he is yards behind whenever this happens you will see one of the advancing birds pause in its prodding to look back from time to time as if anxious about the one left behind and by and by this same bird its anxiety increasing will suddenly spring into the air and fly back to place itself at the side of the other to wait quietly until it has finished its task and no sooner does the busy one put up its head to signal that he is ready than up they spring and fly together on to the flock no one witnessing this action can doubt for a moment that these two are mates and that wherever they paired and bred originallyin lincoln or york or thurso or perhaps in one of the western islandsthey paired for life and will stick together summer and winter and in all their wanderings as long as they live  until one observes starlings in this close way even to their minutest actionsi had indeed little else to do during my three winter months in this nursinghomeit is only natural to believe that among gregarious species the starling is one of those least likely to pair for life seeing that in it the gregarious instinct is intensified and more highly developed than in most others one would suppose that the flock which is like an organismthat is to say the attachment to the flockwould out of the breeding season take the place of the close relation or companionship between bird and bird seen in species known to pair for life only the pairing passion one would suppose could serve to dissolve the company of birds and this only for a brief season of about a couple of months duration there is but one brood raised in the season and the whole business of reproduction is well over before the end of june later breeders are those that have lost their first eggs or broods and no sooner are the young brought off and instructed in the starlings sole vocation except his fruiteating of extracting the grubs it subsists on from the roots of the grassa business which detains them for a week or twothan the married life is apparently over and the communal life resumed the whole life of the bird is then changed the sole tie appears to be that of the flock home and young are forgotten the birds range hither and thither about the land and by and by migrate to distant places some passing oversea while others from the northern counties and from scotland and the islands come down to the south of england where they winter in millions and myriads there they form the winter habit of congregating in immense numbers in the evening at their favourite roostingplaces and hundreds and thousands of small flocks which during the daylight hours exist distributed over an area of hundreds of square miles all make to one point and combine into one flock at such times they actually appear to rejoice in their own incalculable numbers and gather earlier than they need at the roostingplace so that the whole vast gathering may spend an hour or so in their beloved aerial exercises  to anyone who witnesses these gatherings and sees the birds rising from time to time from the wood and appearing like a big black cloud in the sky growing lighter and darker alternately as the birds scatter wide or mass themselves in a closer formation until after wheeling about for some minutes they pour back into the trees and who listens to the noise they make as of a high wind in the wood composed as it is of an infinity of individual voices it must seem incredible that all these birds can keep in pairs for how could any couple hold together in such circumstances or when separated ever meet again in such a multitude or should they ever meet by chance how recognize one another when all are exactly alike in size shape colour and voice  they can and certainly do keep together and when forced apart as when pursued by a hawk they scatter in all directions they can quickly find one another again they can do it because of their perfect discipline or instinct or the perfection of the system they follow during their autumn and winter wanderings and migrations  the breeding season over the birds in each locality unite in a small flock composed of twenty or thirty to fifty or more pairs and start their wandering life those in the north migrate or drift south and vast numbers as we see spend the winter in the southern counties and here they have their favourite roostingplaces and are accustomed to assemble in tens and hundreds of thousands but the original small flock composed of a few pairs is never broken upnever absorbed by the multitude each morning when it is light enough the birds quit the roostingwood but not all together they quit it in flocks flock following flock so closely as to appear like a continuous stream of birds and the streams flow out in different directions over the surrounding country each stream of birds is composed of scores and hundreds of units and each unit drops out of the stream and slopes away to this or that side to drop down on its own chosen feedingground to which it returns morning after morning through the winter when all the units have dropped out and settled on their feeding areas for the day it may be seen that the whole country within a circuit of ten or twelve or more miles from the roostingplace has been occupied that each flock has its own territory where it splits up into some groups and spends its short hours flying about and exploring every green field and one might almost say every grass one can only explain this perfect distribution by assuming that each unit instinctively looks for unoccupied ground in its winter habitat and that consequently there is very little overlapping it must also be assumed that at the place of assembly in the evening each flock has its own roostingplaceits own trees and bushes where the members of the flock can still keep together and to which after each aerial performance they can return the flock comes back to sleep on its own tree and no doubt every couple roosts side by side on its own twig  on the return of spring the birds do not migrate in a body but slip away flock by flock to reappear about the end of april in their old breedingplace in the north country with perhaps the loss of a few membersthe one that was old and died in the season of scarcity and one that was taken at the roost by a brown owl and one that had its feet frozen to the perch and was killed by a jackdaw when struggling to free itself and one that was struck down by a sparrowhawk on his homeward journey  what i have so far been unable to trace is the career of the young after august we see that once they are able to fend for themselves they club together in small flocks and continue together during their brown thrush stage but by and by they get the adult plumage and language and are no longer distinguishable as young do they then join the old birds before the wandering and migrating south begins and do they pair or not before the winter     iii  village birds in winter   throughout the winter of 191516 and more particularly during my three months in the hospital at hayle from the beginning of december to march i was greatly impressed at the perpetual state of hunger in which the birds exist especially the three commonest species in our villagerook daw and starling little wonder that the sight of a piece of bread thrown out on the green field below my window would bring all these three and many others with a rush from all sides every one eager to get a morsel but the birds that live most in a groove as it were like the rook and starling and have but one kind of food and one way of finding it are always the worst off in winter these subsist on the grubs and other minute organisms they are able to pick out of the grass roots and are life workers paid by the piece who must labour hard and incessantly to make enough to keep themselves alive their winter life is accordingly in startling contrast to that of the dawone that lives on his wits and fares better and altogether has an easier and more amusing time  it was the habit of the three species named to quit the wood where they roosted as soon as it was light enough for them to feed the time varying according to the state of the weather from halfpast eight to ten oclock the mornings being usually wet and dark the rooks that had their rookery in the village numbered forty or fifty birds and these would remain at the village getting their food in the surrounding fields for the rest of the day the daws would appear in a body of two or three hundred birds but after a little while many of them would go on to their own villages further away leaving about sixty to eighty birds belonging to the village last of all the starlings would appear in flocks and continuous streams of birds often fighting their way against wind and rain leaving about a couple of hundred or more behind these being the birds that had settled in the village for the season and worked in the grass fields in and surrounding it rooks and starlings would immediately fall to work while the daws the flock breaking up into small parties of three or four would distribute themselves about the village and perch on the chimneypots they would perch and then fly and for all the rest of the day would be incessantly shifting about from place to place on the lookout for something to eat dropping from time to time to snatch up a crust of bread or the core of an apple thrown away by a child in the road or into a back garden or on to a dustheap where potatoparings and the head of a mackerel or other refuse had been thrown they were very bold but not as courageous as the oldtime british kite that often swooped to snatch the bread from a childs hand  from time to time one or a pair of a small party of these daws would drop down on the field before my window when the rooks and starlings were there prodding busily at the turf but though i watched them a thousand times i never detected them trying to find something for themselves they simply stood or walked about among the working birds watching them intently grubfinding was an art they had not acquired or were too indolent or proud to practise but they were not too proud to beg or steal they simply watched the other birds in the hope of being able to snatch up a big unearthed grub and run away with it as a rule after a minute or two they would get tired of waiting and rush off with a lively shout back they would go to the chimneypots and to their flying up and down suspending their flight over this or that yard or garden and by and by one would succeed in picking up something big and at once all the other daws in sight would give chase to take it from him for these village daws are not only parasites and cadgers but worsethey are thieves without honour among themselves  in spite of all the time and energy wasted in their perpetual races and chases going on all over the village every bird exerting himself to the utmost to rob all he can from his pals they get enough to eat for when the day is over and other daws from other villages drop in to visit them all unite in a big crowd and wheel about making the place ring with their merry yelping cries before sailing away to the wood one might say after witnessing and listening to this evening performance that they have great joy in their rascally lives  but for the poor starling there is little joy in these brief dark wet winter days even if there is little frost in this west cornwall climate a frost of a few days duration would be fatal to incalculable numbers especially if as in the great frosts of the winters of 18945 and 18967 severest in the south and west of england it should come late in winter i think it can be taken as a fact that a long or overseas migration takes place before midwinter or not at all in january and february when birds are driven to the limits of the land by a great cold they do not cross the sea either because they are too weak to attempt such an adventure or for some other reason unknown to us we see that on these occasions they come to the seashore and follow it south and west even to the western extremity of cornwall and then either turn back inland or wait where they are for open weather many perishing in the meantime  during those three winter months when i watched the starlings at work on the field before my hospital window they appeared to be in a perpetual state of extreme hunger and were always running over the ground rapidly prodding as they moved and apparently finding their food almost exclusively on the surfacethat is to say on the surface of the soil but under the grass at its surface roots at other seasons they go deep when they know from the appearance of every blade of grass whether or not there is a grub feeding on its roots beneath the surface without shooting and examining the stomachs of a large number of starlings it was not possible to know just what the food consisted of but with my strong binocular on them i could make out that at almost every dig of the beak something was picked up and could actually see it when the beak was held up with the minute morsel at its tipa small threadlike semitransparent worm or grub in most instances two or three of these atomies would hardly have made a square meal for a ladybird and i should think that a starling after swallowing a thousand would fed very hungry and on many days this scanty watery food had to be searched for in very painful conditions as it rained heavily on most days and often all day long at such times the birds in their sodden plumage looked like drowned starlings fished out of a pool and galvanized into activity nor were they even seen to shake the wet offa common action in swallows and other birds that feed in the rain they were too hungry too anxious to find something to eat to keep the starling soul and body together before the long night of eighteen or twenty hours would overtake them  no doubt the winter of 191516 was exceptionally wet and cold although without any severe frosts a long frost in february when the birds were most reduced would probably have proved fatal to at least half their number but though it continued wet and cold things began to mend for the starlings towards the end of february and in march the improvement was very marked they were not in such a perpetual hurry their time was longer now and by the end of the month their working day had increased from five or six to twelve or fourteen hours and the light had increased and grubs were easier to find by april the starlings no longer appeared to be the same species as the poor rusty bedraggled wretches we had been accustomed to see they are now lively happy birds with a splendid gloss on their feathers and beaks as bright a yellow as the blackbirds finally in april they left us not going in a body but flock by flock day after day until by the end of the month all were gone back to their homes in the northall but the two or three to half a dozen pairs in each village and these few that stay behind are new colonists in west cornwall     iv  increasing birds in britain   about the daw or jackie or dorrie or jackiedorrie as he is variously and familiarly called and his village habits there will be more to say presently just now my concern is with another mattera veritable daw problem  for the last twenty years or longer it has seemed to me that the daw is an increasing species in britain at all events i am quite sure that it is so in the southern half of england particularly along the coast of somerset devon dorset and in cornwall more than in any other county and why is it he is certainly not a respectable bird like the starling for exampleif we do not go to the cherrygrower for the starlings character he is and always has been on the keepers and farmers black list and scarcely a week passes but you will find him described in some gamekeepers or farmers journal as even worse than the rook even the ornithologists who are interested in birds as birds havent a good word to say of the daw according to them he alone is responsible for the disappearance of his distinguished relation the chough the vulgar daw is of course devoid of any distinction at all unless it be his grey pate and wicked little grey eyes  the ornithologists were wrong about the chough just as they had been wrong about the goldfinch during the late years of the nineteenth century and as they were wrong about the swallows and martins in later years of the goldfinch they said and solemnly put it down in their books that owing to improved methods of agriculture the thistle had been extirpated and the bird deprived of his natural food had forsaken this country but no sooner did our county councils begin to avail themselves of the powers given them by the bird act of twenty years ago to protect the goldfinch from the birdcatcher than it began to increase again and is still increasing year by year all over the country  of the decrease of swallows and martins they said it resulted from the action of the sparrows in ousting them from their nests and nestingsites but we know the true cause of the decline of these two species the best loved and best protected of all birds in britain not even excepting robin redbreast the french government in response to representations on this matter from our foreign office have caused enquiries to be made and have found that our swallows are being destroyed wholesale in france during the autumn migration and have promised to put a stop to this deplorable business they do not appear to have done so since the promise was made three years ago and i can say from my own observation in the south and west countries that the decline has continued and that we have never had so few swallows come to us as in the present summer of 1916  the dawto return to that subjecthas always been regarded as an injurious species and down to a quarter of a century ago every farm lad in possession of a gun shot it in the interests of the henwife even as he had formerly shot the kite a common british species and a familiar feature in the landscape down to the early years of last century doubtless it was a great thing to bring down this great bird that soars sublime and nail it to the barndoor by the middle of the last century it had become a rarity and the ensuing rush for specimens and eggs for private collectors quickly brought about its virtual extinction the kite is but one of several speciessix of them hawksextirpated within the last forty years why then does the daw more injurious to the gamepreserver and henwife than any one of these lost hawks continue to flourish and increase in numbers it is i imagine because of the growth of a sentiment which favours its preservation but it is not the same as that which has served to preserve the rook and made it so common that is a sentiment confined to the landowning classto those who inherit great houses where the ancient rookery with its crowd of big black contentious birds cawcawing on the windy elms has come to be an essential part of the establishment like the gardens and park and stables and homefarm and one might add the church and village this sentiment differs too from the heronsentiment which serves to keep that bird with us in spite of the annual wail rising occasionally in south devon to a howl of human troutfishers it is a traditional feeling coming down from the far past in englandfrom the time of william the conqueror to that of william of orange and the decay of falconry that a species without any sentiment to favour it and without special protection by law may increase is to be seen in the case of the starling this increase has come about automatically after we had destroyed the starlings natural enemies and then ceased to persecute it ourselves of all birds it was the most preyed on by certain raptorial species especially by the sparrowhawk which is now becoming so rare assisted by the hobby rarer still and the merlin it was more exposed than other birds to these enemies owing to its gregarious and feeding habits in grasslands and the open country also to its slower flight the greatest drain on the species came however from man the starling was a favourite bird for shootingmatches up till about thirty years ago and was taken annually in large numbers by the birdcatchers for the purpose it is probable that this use of the bird for sport caused people to eat it and so common did the habit become that at the end of summer or before the end shooting starlings for the pot was practised everywhere old men in the country have told me that forty or fifty years ago it was common to hear people on the farms say that of all birds the starling was the best to eat  when starling and sparrow shootingmatches declined the starling went out of favour as a tablebird and from that time thyspecies has been increasing at present the rate of increase grows from year to year and during the last decade the birds have colonized every portion of the north of scotland and the islands where the starling had previously been a rare visitora bird unknown to the people here in west cornwall where i am writing this chapter the starling was only a winter visitor until recently eight years ago i could only find two pairs breeding in the villagesabout twentyfive in numberin which i looked for them in the summer of 1915 i found them breeding in every town and village i visited at present june 1916 there are six pairs in the village i am staying at it may be the case and from conversations i have had with farmers about the bird i am inclined to believe it is so that a strong feeling in favour of the starling in the pastoral districts is growing up at the present time a feeling which in the end is more powerful to protect than any law but such a feeling has not become general as yet and consequently has had nothing to do with the extraordinary increase of the bird  the woodpigeon is another species which like the starling has increased greatly in recent years without special protection and with no sentiment in its favour    the sentiment is all confined to the naturelovers whose words have no effect on the people generally least of all on the farmers i am reminded here of the experience of a young man an ardent birdlover on his visit to a yorkshire farm his host who was also a young man took him a walk across his fields it was a spring day of brilliant sunshine and the air was full of the music of scores of soaring skylarks the visitor long in cities pent was exhilarated by the strains and kept on making exclamations of rapturous delight just listen to the larks did you ever hear anything like it and so on  his host his eyes cast down trudged on in glum silence finally the young man carried away by his enthusiasm stopped and turning to his companion shouted listen listen do you hear the larks  oh yes drawled the other looking more glum than ever i hear them fast enough and i wish they were all dead  so with the other charming species the moan of doves in immemorial elms is a pleasing sound to the poets but it does not prevent the farmers throughout the land from wishing them all dead and every person who possesses a gun is glad to help in their massacre for the bird is a pest and he who shoots it is doing something for england furthermore shooting it is firstrate sport not like slaughtering wretched little sparrows or innocent young rooks just out of their windy cradles and when shot it is a good tablebird with as much tasty flesh on it as a woodcock or partridge  how then can we account for the increase of such a species one cause is undoubtedly to be found in the removal by gamekeepers of its three chief enemiesthe carrion crow magpie and jayall these three being great devourers of pigeons eggs which of all eggs are most conspicuous and open to attack then again the winter immigration of woodpigeons from northern europe appears to be on the increase and it may be conjectured that a considerable number of these visitors remain annually to breed with us there has also been an increase in the stockdove and turtledove in recent years and the former species is extending its range in the north the cause or causes of the increase of the turtledove are not far to seek its chief feathered enemies the egg and fledgling robbers are the same as the woodpigeons moreover the turtledove is least persecuted by man of our four pigeons and being strictly migratory it quits the country before shootingtime begins add to this that the turtledove has been specially protected under sir herbert maxwells act of 1894 in a good number of english counties from surrey to yorkshire  of the stockdove we can only say that like the ringdove it has increased in spite of the persecution it is subject to since no person out after pigeons would spare it because it is without a white collar with the exception of the county of buckinghamshire it is not on the schedule anywhere in the country one can only suppose that this species has been indirectly benefited by the bird legislation and all that has been done to promote a feeling favourable to birdpreservation during the last thirty years    v  the daw sentiment   i have spoken of the wood adjacent to the villages of hayle and lelant where the rooks daws and starlings of the neighbourhood have their winter roostingplace this is at trevelloe the ancient estate of the praeds who now call themselves tyringham here the daws congregate each evening in such numbers that a stranger to the district and to the local habits of the bird might imagine that all the cliffbreeding jackdaws in west cornwall had come to roost at that spot yet the cliffbreeders albeit abundant enough are but a minority of the daw population of this district the majority of these birds live and breed in the neighbouring villages and hamletsst ives carbis bay towadneck lelant phillack hayle and others further away it is a jackdaw metropolis and as we have seen every village receives its own quota of birds each morning and there they spend the daylight hours and subsist on the waste food and on what they can steal just as the semidomestic raven and the kite did in former ages from roman times down to the seventeenth century  early in may the winter congregation breaks up the cliffbreeders going back to the rocks and the village birds to their chimneys where they presently set about relining their old nests there are plenty of places for all since there are chimneys in almost every cottage where fires are never lighted and as ventilation is not wanted in bedrooms the birds are allowed to bring in more materials each year until the whole flue is filled up year by year the materials brought in sink lower and lower until they rest on the closed iron register and change in time to a solid brown mould thus however longlived a daw may beand there are probably more centenarians among the daws than among the human inhabitants of the villagesit is a rare thing for one to be disturbed in his tenancy  in the cottage opposite the one i was staying in its owner an old woman who had lived in it all her life had recently died aged eightyseven  she was very feeble at the last and one cold day when she could not leave her bed the extraordinary idea occurred to some one of her people that it might be a good thing to light a fire in her room the fireplace was examined and was found to have no flue or that the flue had been filled with earth or cement the village builder was called in and with the aid of a man on the roof and poles and various implements he succeeded in extracting two or three barrowloads of hard earth which had no doubt once been sticks centuries ago as the building was very ancient no one had remembered that the daws had always occupied the same chimney the old dame herself had seen them going in and out of it from her childhood and her end was probably hastened by the disturbance made in cleaning it now she is gone the daws here are in possession of it once more  all through the month of may daws were to be seen about the village dropping from time to time upon the chimneypots where they had their nests and occasionally bringing some slight materials to form a new lining but it was very rare to see one with a stick in his beak the flues were already full of old sticks and no more were wanted it was amusing to see a bird flying about suddenly tumble out of the air on to a chimneypot then with tail tipped up and wings closed dive into the cavity below one wondered how the young birds would be got out  talking with the rector of the neighbouring parish of phillack one day on this subject he said dont imagine that the daws restrict themselves to the chimneys where fires are not lighted at all events it isnt so at phillack perhaps we have too many daws in our village but every year before lighting fires in the drawing and diningrooms we have to call in a man with a pole to clear the flues out he told me that a few years ago one cold june day a fire was lighted in the drawingroom and as the smoke all poured out into the room a man was sent up to the roof with a pole to clear the obstruction out presently a mess of sticks came down and with them two fullyfledged young jackdaws one dead killed with the pole the other sound and lively this one they kept and it soon became quite tame when able to fly it would go off and associate with the wild birds but refused to leave the house until the following summer when it found a mate and went away  the head keeper at trevelloe a remarkably vigorous and intelligent octogenarian who has been in his place over half a century gave me some interesting information about the daws he says they have greatly increased in recent years in this part of cornwall because they are no longer molested no person he says not even a gamekeeper anxious about his pheasants would think of shooting a jackdaw but this is not because the bird has changed its habits he is as great a pest as ever he was and as an example of how bad jackdaws can be he related the following incident told him by a friend of his a head keeper on an estate adjoining a shooting his master took one year on the northwest coast of england it happened that a big colony of daws existed within a mile or two of the preserves and one day the keeper was called away in a hurry and left the coops unattended for the best part of a day it was the biggest mistake he had ever made and the chief disaster of his life on his return he found that the daws had been before him and that all his precious chicks had been carried off for several hours of that day there was a steady coming and going of birds between the cliffs and the coops every daw going back with a chick in his beak for his hungry young in the nest  yet my informant this ancient and singularly intelligent old man a gamekeeper all his life who knows his jackdaw could not tell me why gamekeepers no longer persecute so injurious a bird i he will not allow a sparrowhawk to exist in his woods yet all he could say when i repeated my question was no keeper ever thinks of hurting a jack now but i cant say why  the reason of it i fancy is plain enough it is simply the sentiment i have spoken of in a small way it has always existed in certain places in towns where the jackdaw is associated in our minds with cathedrals and church towerswhere he is the ecclesiastical daw but the modern wider toleration is due to the character the personality of the bird itself which is more or less like that of all the members of the corvine family with the exception of the rook who always tries his best to be an honest useful citizen but it is not precisely the same they may be regarded as bad hats generally in the bird community and on this very accountim sorry to say to quote mr pecksniffthey touch a chord in us and the daw being the genial rascal in feathers par excellence is naturally the best loved  it has thus come about that of all the corvidae the daw is now the favourite as a pet bird and in the domestic condition he is accorded more liberty than is given to other species we think he makes better use of his freedom that he does not lose touch with his human friends when allowed to fly about and appears more capable of affection  formerly the raven and magpie came first as pets the raven vanished as a pet because like the goshawk kite and buzzard he was extirpated in the interests of the gamepreserver and henwife the magpie was then first and has only been recently ousted from that ancient honourable position the pie was a superior bird as a feathered pet in a cage he is beautiful in shape and colour in his snowwhite and metallic darkgreen and purpleglossed plumage and his long graduated tail moreover he is a clever bird to my mind there is no more fascinating species when i can find it in numbers in places where it is not persecuted and is accustomed to congregate at intervals not as rooks and starlings do merely because they are gregarious but purely for social purposesto play and converse with one another its language at such times is so various as to be a surprise and delight to the listener while its ways of amusing itself its clowning and the little tricks and practical jokes the birds are continually playing on each other are a delight to witness all this is lost in a caged bird he is handsome to look at and remarkably intelligent but he distinguishes between magpies and men he doesnt reveal himself his accomplishments vocal and mental are for his own tribe in this he differs from the daw for the daw is less specialized he is an undersized common crow livelier more impish than that bird also more plastic more adaptive and takes more kindly to the domestic or parasitic life human beings to him are simply larger daws and unlike the pie he can play his tricks and be himself among them as freely as when with his feathered comrades we like him best because he makes himself one of us  undoubtedly the chough comes nearest to the daw mentally and as it is a far more beautiful birdthe poor daw having little of that qualityit would probably have been our prime favourite among the crows but for its rarity formerly it was a common pet bird caged or free in all the coast districts where it inhabited and it may be that the desire for a pet chough was the cause of its decline and final disappearance all round the south and west coasts of england except at one spot near tintagel where half a dozen pairs still exist only because watchers appointed by the royal society for the protection of birds are always on the spot to warn off the nestrobbers during the breeding season but of the chough in captivity or as a domesticated bird we know little now as no records have been preserved i have only known one bird taken from a north devon cliff about forty years ago at a house near the coast a very beautiful pet bird with charming affectionate ways always free to range about the country and the cliffs where it associated with the daws it was the last of its kind at that place and i do not know if it still lives  next to the chough the jay comes nearest to the daw mentally of all our crows and as he excels most of our wild birds in beauty he would naturally have been a first favourite as a pet but for the fact that it is only in a state of nature in which he is like the dawlively clever impish in captivity he is more like the magpie and affiliates even less than that bird with his human associates in confinement he is a quiet almost sedate certainly a silent bird he is essentially a woodland species all his graces his various often musical language with many imitations of bird and animal sounds and his spectacular games and pretty wing displays are for his own people exclusively he must have his liberty in the woods and a company of his fellowjays to exhibit his full lustre  the difference between jay and daw is similar to that between fox and dog or rather let us say between one of the small desert foxes of syria and egyptthe fennec for instanceand the jackal the domestic dogs progenitor the first gifted with exquisite grace and beauty was too highly specialized to suit the domestic condition hence the generalized unbeautiful beast was chosen to be mans servant and companion in the same way it looks as if we were taking to the daw in preference to the more beautiful bird because he is more like us or understands us better or adapts himself more readily to our way of life  i believe that about nine out of every ten interesting and amusing stories about charming pet birds i have heard in england during the last quarter of a century relate to the daw and this i think goes to show that he is a prime favourite as a feathered pet at all events in the southern and western counties     vi  story of a jackdaw   when i laid my pen down after concluding part v it pleased me to think that i had written the last word that my task finished i was free to go on to something else but i was not yet wholly free of the jackdaws their yelping cries were still ringing in my mental ears and their remembered shapes were still all about me in their black dress or cassock grey hood and malicious little grey eyes the persistent images suggested that my task was not properly finished after all that it would be better to conclude with one of those anecdotes or stories of the domesticated bird which i have said are so common also that this should be a typical story which would serve to illustrate the peculiar daw sentimentthe affectionate interest we take in him not only in spite of his impudence and impishness and naughtiness but also to some extent because of these same qualities which find an echo in us accordingly i set myself to recall some of the latest anecdotes of this kind which i had heard and selected the one which follows not because it was more interesting as a daw story than the others but mainly on account of the shrewd and humorous and dramatic way in which it was related to me by a little boy of the working class  i met him on a bright sunday morning at the end of june in the parklike grounds of walmer castle i had not long been seated on a garden bench when a daw came flying to a tree close by and began craning her neck and eyeing me with one eye then the other with an intense almost painful curiosity and these nervous movements and gestures immediately revealed to me that she had a nestful of young birds somewhere close by after changing her position several times to view me from other points and find out what i was there for she came to the conclusion that i was not to be got rid of and making a sudden dash to a tree standing just before me disappeared in a small hole or cleft in the trunk about fortyfive feet above the ground and in a few seconds came out again and flew swiftly away in four or five minutes she returned and after eyeing me suspiciously a short time flew again to the tree and vanishing from sight in the hole remained there  i was intently watching that small black spot in the bark to see her emerge when a little boy came slowly sauntering past my bench and glancing at him i found that his shrewd brown eyes were watching my face and that he had a knowing halfsmile on his lips  hullo my boy i said i can see plainly enough what is in your mind you know im watching a hole in the tree where a jackdaw has just gone in and your intention is when no one is about to swarm up the tree and get the young birds  oh no he returned im not going to climb the tree and dont want any young jackdaws i always come to look because the birds breed in that hole every year two years ago i had a bird from the nest but i dont want another  then at my invitation he sat down to tell me about it one morning when he came the young had just come off and he found one squatting on the ground under the trees looking stupefied no doubt when it flew out it had struck against a trunk or branch and come down bruised and stunned  he wrapped it up in a handkerchief and took it home to deal and put it in a box then mother got some flannel and made a sort of bed for it and warmed some milk and they opened its beak and fed it with a teaspoon next day it was all right and opened its beak to be fed whenever they came near it and in two or three days it began flying about the room and perching on their shoulders then he brought it back to walmer and let it go and saw it fly off into the trees but when he got home mother scolded him for having let it go when its parents were not about she said it would die of starvation and was going on at him when in flew the jackdaw and came flop on her shoulder after that mother and father said theyd keep the daw a little longer and then he could let it go at a distance where there were other daws about by and by they said theyd let it stay where it was father liked a bloater for his tea and there was nothing the jackdaw was fonder of so he was always on the table at teatime eating out of fathers plate then he got to be troublesome he was always watching for a door or window of the parlour to be opened to let the air in and that was the room mother was so careful about and every time he got in hed fly straight to the mantelpiece which was covered with photographs and ornaments they were mostly those little thingspigs and dogs and parrots and all sorts of animals made of glass and china and the jackdaw would begin to pick them up and throw them down on to the fender and of course he broke a lot of them that made mother mad and she scolded him and told him to get rid of the bird so he wrapped it up so as it shouldnt know where it was going and went off two or three miles along the coast and let it go where there were other daws  it flew off and joined them and he came home that afternoon jackie came back and they wondered how he had found his way father said twas plain enough that the bird had just followed the coast till he got back to deal and there he was at home he said the only way to lose it was to take it somewhere away from the sea so he wrapped it up again and took it to his aunt ellens at northbourne about five miles from deal  his aunt told him to carry it to the park where hed find other daws and settle down and thats what he did but jackie came back to deal again that same day the strangest thing was that mother and father made a great fuss over it and fed it just as if they were glad to have it back next day it got into the parlour and broke some more things and mother scolded him for not getting rid of the bird and father said he knew how it could be done one of his pals was going to dover and he would ask him to take the bird and let it go up by the castle where it would mix with the jackdaws there and that would be too far away for it to come back but it did come back and after that he sent it to ashford and then to canterbury and i dont know how many other places but it always came back and they always seemed very glad to see it back all the same mother was always scolding him about the bird and complaining to father about the damage it did in the house then one day aunt ellen came to see mother and told her the best way to get rid of the daw would be to send it abroad she said her husbands cousin mr sturge was going out to his relations in canada to work on their farm and she would get her husband to ask him to take the jackdaw it would never come back from such a distant place a week afterwards mr sturge sent word that he would take the bird as he thought his relations would like to have a real old english jackdaw to remind them of home so one day aunt ellen came and took jackie away in a small covered basket the funniest thing was the way father went on when he came home to tea a bloater with a soft roe he says just what jackie likes wheres the bird got to come to your tea jackie  hes gone says mother gone to canada and a good riddance too  oh gone has he says father then were a happy family and going to lead a quiet life no more screams and tears over broken chiny dolls and if ever billy brings another jackdaw into the house well dust his coat for him  here billy interposed to say that if he ever made such a mistake again they could thrash him as much as they liked  oh yes said father well thrash you fast enough motherll do it for the sake of her chiny toys and dolls  that put mother up youre in a nasty temper she says but you know i miss the bird as much as you do  then said father why the devil didnt you tell that sister of yours to mind her own business when she came interfering about my jackdaw and that sturge hell soon get tired of the bird and give it away for a pint of beer before he gets to liverpool  so much the better says mother if jackie can get free before they take him aboard you may be sure hell find his way back to deal  and thats what they went on hoping for days and days but jackie never came back so i spose mr sturge took him out all right and that hes in canada now
